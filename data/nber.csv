4604,The Simplest Test of Inflation Target Credibility,['Lars E.O. Svensson'],1993-12-01,1993-12-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Money and Interest Rates', 'Monetary Policy']",['International Finance and Macroeconomics'],,,"

A simple test of inflation target credibility is constructed by subtracting the maximum and minimum inflation rates consistent with the inflation targets from the yields to maturity on nominal bonds. This results in a target-consistent range of real yields on nominal bonds.  If expected real yields, or market real interest rates on real bonds if such are available, fall outside the range of target- consistent real yields, credibility is rejected.  Two concepts of credibility, called absolute credibility and credibility in expectation, are distinguished.  The inflation targets of Canada, New Zealand and Sweden are examined with convenient diagrams over yields to maturity and forward interest rates.

7063,Technology (and Policy) Shocks in Models of Endogenous Growth,"['Larry E. Jones', 'Rodolfo E. Manuelli', 'Ennio Stacchetti']",1999-04-01,1999-04-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Is there a trade-off between fluctuations and growth? The empirical evidence is mixed, with some studies (Kormendi and Meguire (1985)) finding a positive relationship, while others (Ramey and Ramey (1995)) finding the a negative one. Our objective in this paper is to understand how fundamental uncertainty can affect the long run growth rate, and what are the factors that determine the nature (positive or negative) of the relationship. Qualitatively, we show that the relationship between volatility in fundamentals and policies and mean growth can be either positive or negative. We identify the curvature of the utility function as a key parameter that determines the sign of the relationship. Quantitatively, we find that when we move from a world of perfect certainty to one with uncertainty that resembles the average uncertainty in a large sample of countries, growth rates increase somewhere between 0.17% and 0.80%, with 0.20% being a  reasonable' estimate. Even though these are nontrivial changes, they are not large enough be themselves to account for the large differences in mean growth rates observed in the data. However, we find that differences in the curvature of preferences have very substantial effects on the estimated variability of stationary objects like the consumption/output ratio and hours worked. For this reason, we expect that the models considered in this paper will provide the basis of sharp estimates of the curvature parameter.

12017,Optimal Value and Growth Tilts in Long-Horizon Portfolios,"['Jakub W. Jurek', 'Luis M. Viceira']",2006-02-06,2006-02-06,,"['Financial Economics', 'Portfolio Selection and Asset Pricing']",['Asset Pricing'],,,"

We develop an analytical solution to the dynamic portfolio choice problem of an investor with power utility defined over wealth at a finite horizon who faces an investment opportunity set with time-varying risk premia, real interest rates and inflation. The variation in investment opportunities is captured by a flexible vector autoregressive parameterization, which readily accommodates a large number of assets and state variables. We find that the optimal dynamic portfolio strategy is an affine function of the vector of state variables describing investment opportunities, with coefficients that are a function of the investment horizon. We apply our method to the optimal portfolio choice problem of an investor who can choose between value and growth stock portfolios, and among these equity portfolios plus bills and bonds. For equity-only investors, the optimal mean allocation of short-horizon investors is heavily tilted away from growth stocks regardless of their risk aversion. However, the mean allocation to growth stocks increases dramatically with the investment horizon, implying that growth is less risky than value at long horizons for equity-only investors. By contrast, long-horizon conservative investors who have access to bills and bonds do not hold equities in their portfolio. These investors are concerned with interest rate risk, and empirically growth stocks are not particularly good hedges for bond returns. We also explore the welfare implications of adopting the optimal dynamic rebalancing strategy vis a vis other intuitive, but suboptimal, portfolio choice schemes and find significant welfare gains for all long-horizon investors.

13362,Nonseparable Preferences and Optimal Social Security Systems,"['Borys Grochulski', 'Narayana Kocherlakota']",2007-09-06,2007-09-06,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Fiscal Policy', 'Public Economics', 'Taxation']","['Economic Fluctuations and Growth', 'Public Economics']",,,"

In this paper, we consider economies in which agents are privately informed about their skills, which are evolving stochastically over time. We require agents' preferences to be weakly separable between the lifetime paths of consumption and labor. However, we allow for intertemporal nonseparabilities in preferences like habit formation.  We show that such nonseparabilities imply that optimal asset income taxes are necessarily retrospective in nature.  We show that under weak conditions, it is possible to implement a socially optimal allocation using a social security system in which taxes on wealth are linear, and taxes/transfers are history-dependent only at retirement.  The average asset income tax in this system is zero.

14605,Trading Frictions and House Price Dynamics,"['Andrew Caplin', 'John Leahy']",2008-12-23,2008-12-23,,"['Microeconomics', 'Economics of Information', 'Macroeconomics', 'Business Cycles']","['Economic Fluctuations and Growth', 'Monetary Economics']",,,"

We construct a model of trade with matching frictions. The model provides a simple characterization for the joint proces of prices, sales and inventory. We compare the implications of the model to certain properties of housing markets. The model can generate the large price changes and the positive correlation between prices and sales that we see in the data. Unlike the data, prices are negatively autocorrelated and high inventory predicts price appreciation. We investigate several amendments to the model.

16566,ExtrapoLATE-ing: External Validity and Overidentification in the LATE Framework,"['Joshua Angrist', 'Ivan Fernandez-Val']",2010-12-02,2010-12-02,,"['Econometrics', 'Estimation Methods']","['Children', 'Economics of Education', 'Health Economics', 'Labor Studies', 'Public Economics']",,,"

This paper develops a covariate-based approach to the external validity of instrumental variables (IV) estimates. Assuming that differences in observed complier characteristics are what make IV estimates differ from one another and from parameters like the effect of treatment on the treated, we show how to construct estimates for new subpopulations from a given set of covariate-specific LATEs. We also develop a reweighting procedure that uses the traditional overidentification test statistic to define a population for which a given pair of IV estimates has external validity. These ideas are illustrated through a comparison of twins and sex-composition IV estimates of the effects childbearing on labor supply.

17502,"Capital Flows and Economic Growth in the Era of Financial Integration and Crisis, 1990-2010","['Joshua Aizenman', 'Yothin Jinjarak', 'Donghyun Park']",2011-10-13,2011-10-13,,"['International Economics', 'International Factor Mobility', 'International Finance', 'International Macroeconomics']",['International Trade and Investment'],,,"

We investigate the relationship between economic growth and lagged international capital flows, disaggregated into FDI, portfolio investment, equity investment, and short-term debt. We follow about 100 countries during 1990-2010 when emerging markets became more integrated into the international financial system. We look at the relationship both before and after the global crisis. Our study reveals a complex and mixed picture. The relationship between growth and lagged capital flows depends on the type of flows, economic structure, and global growth patterns. We find a large and robust relationship between FDI - both inflows and outflows - and growth. The relationship between growth and equity flows is smaller and less stable. Finally, the relationship between growth and short-term debt is nil before the crisis, and negative during the crisis.

17545,How Do Informal Agreements and Renegotiation Shape Contractual Reference Points?,"['Ernst Fehr', 'Oliver D. Hart', 'Christian Zehnder']",2011-10-27,2011-10-27,,"['Econometrics', 'Experimental Design', 'Microeconomics', 'Behavioral Economics', 'Economics of Information', 'Labor Economics', 'Labor Market Structures']","['Corporate Finance', 'Law and Economics']",,,"

Previous experimental work provides encouraging support for some of the central assumptions underlying Hart and Moore (2008)'s theory of contractual reference points. However, existing studies ignore realistic aspects of trading relationships such as informal agreements and ex post renegotiation. We investigate the relevance of these features experimentally. Our evidence indicates that the central behavioral mechanism underlying the concept of contractual reference points is robust to the presence of informal agreements and ex post renegotiation. However, our data also reveal new behavioral features that suggest refinements of the theory. In particular, we find that the availability of informal agreements and ex post renegotiation changes how trading parties evaluate ex post outcomes. Interestingly, the availability of these additional options affects ex post evaluations even in situations in which the parties do not use them.

19594,Risky Investments with Limited Commitment,"['Thomas F. Cooley', 'Ramon Marimon', 'Vincenzo Quadrini']",2013-10-31,2013-10-31,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Consumption and Investment', 'Money and Interest Rates', 'Financial Economics', 'Corporate Finance']",['Corporate Finance'],,['Risks of Financial Institutions'],"

Over the last three decades there has been a dramatic increase in the size of the financial sector and in the compensation of financial executives. This increase has been associated with greater risk-taking and the use of more complex financial instruments. Parallel to this trend, the organizational structure of the financial sector has changed with the traditional partnership replaced by public companies. The organizational change has increased the competition for managerial talent, which may have weakened the commitment between investors and managers. We show how increased competition and the weaker commitment can raise the managerial incentives to undertake risky investment. In the general equilibrium, this change results in higher risk-taking, a larger and more productive financial sector with greater income inequality (within and across sectors), and a lower market valuation of financial institutions.

20010,Using Social Media to Measure Labor Market Flows,"['Dolan Antenucci', 'Michael Cafarella', 'Margaret Levenstein', 'Christopher Ré', 'Matthew D. Shapiro']",2014-03-27,2014-03-27,,"['Econometrics', 'Data Collection', 'Macroeconomics', 'Consumption and Investment', 'Labor Economics', 'Unemployment and Immigration']","['Economic Fluctuations and Growth', 'Labor Studies', 'Monetary Economics', 'Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship']",,,"

Social media enable promising new approaches to measuring economic activity and analyzing economic behavior at high frequency and in real time using information independent from standard survey and administrative sources.  This paper uses data from Twitter to create indexes of job loss, job search, and job posting.  Signals are derived by counting job-related phrases in Tweets such as ""lost my job.""   The social media indexes are constructed from the principal components of these signals. The University of Michigan Social Media Job Loss Index tracks initial claims for unemployment insurance at medium and high frequencies and predicts 15 to 20 percent of the variance of the prediction error of the consensus forecast for initial claims.  The social media indexes provide real-time indicators of events such as Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 government shutdown.  Comparing the job loss index with the search and posting indexes indicates that the Beveridge Curve has been shifting inward since 2011.
