2,"Hospital Utilization: An Analysis of SMSA Differences in Hospital Admission Rates, Occupancy Rates and Bed Rates",['Barry R. Chiswick'],1973-06-01,1973-06-01,,,,,,"

A topic of continued public concern is the national level and distribution among areas and individuals of the availability of hospital services.  This paper presents data for the country as a whole on hospital utilization during the post World War II period for short-term non-federal hospitals.  The bed rate (the number of beds per thousand population) increased nearly 25 percent.  The admission rate (admissions per thousand population)increased nearly 50 percent.  The average bed occupancy rate increased during most of the period but has recently been on the decline.  These changes are important because hospitals do perform useful services, but at a considerable cost - a cost which has been growing rapidly.  The purpose of this study is to present a model for analyzing the utilization of short-term general hospitals. The objective is to develop structural equations and hypotheses as to why the measures of hospital utilization vary across communities, and to estimate these equations and test these hypotheses.

3,Error Components Regression Models and Their Applications,['Swarnjit S. Arora'],1973-06-01,1973-06-01,,,,,,"

In this paper, we have developed an operational method for estimating error components regression models when the variance- covariance matrix of the disturbance terms is unkown.  Monte Carlo Studies were conducted to compare the relative efficiency of the pooled estimator obtained by this procedure to (a) an ordinary least sources estimator based on data aggregated over time, (b) the covariance estimator, and (d) a generalized least squares estimator based on a known variance-covariance matrix.  For T small and large p, this estimator definitely performs better than the other estimators which are also based on an estimated value of the variance-covariance matrix of the disturbances.  For p small and large T it compares equally well with other estimators.

5,A Life Cycle Family Model,['James P. Smith'],1973-07-01,1973-07-01,,,,,,"

The household production model provides a useful theoretical framework in which one may analyze family labor supply issues.  In this model, the family is viewed as if it were a small firm producing its ultimate wants within the household.  In order to satisfy these wants, the family (firm) combines purchased market goods and services with the time of various family members.  This approach differs from the traditional treatment of the labor-leisure choice decision since the price of any activity now has two components â€"" the goods price and the time price of each family member.  The relative empirical importance of the two components depends, of course, on their respective shares in the cost of producing an activity.

6,A Review of Cyclical Indicators for the United States: Preliminary Results,['Victor Zarnowitz'],1973-07-01,1973-07-01,,,,,,"

This paper represents a very early progress report on a new study of business cycle indicators for the United States.  Our host organization, CIRET, is concerned with research on surveys of economic tendencies that cover broad areas of business, investment, and consumer behavior.  These inquiries yield mainly qualitative data on plans and expectations of economic decision-making units.  Such data are aggregated and also in a sense quantified in form of diffusion indexes (the Ifo Business Test and its components may serve as examples), but they are basically limited to showing only the direction and not the size of changes in the economic variables covered.  A major purpose of compiling and analyzing these diffusion measures is to improve prediction of cyclical movements in business activity.  This objective is the same as that pursued in the National Bureau studies of quantitative business cycle indicators -- the latest of which is the project to be discussed in this paper.  Appraisals of the predictive records and potentials of these two time series data sets (the cyclical indicators and the expectational diffusion indexes) are therefore definitely an appropriate subject for consideration in this conference.

7,The Definition and Impact of College Quality,['Lewis C. Solmon'],1973-08-01,1973-08-01,,,,,,"

In this paper we are concerned with the characteristics of colleges which serve to increase subsequent monetary incomes of those who attend.  Usually, lifetime earnings are explained by variables such as innate ability, experience in the labor force and years of education, although other socio-economic, demographic and occupational data can be inserted to increase the explanatory power of the model.  This paper attempts to add a new dimension to the earnings function analysis by hypothesizing the features of colleges which might yield financial payoffs later in life, and then testing to see which of these traits actually do add most to the explanatory power of the traditional earnings function.

9,From Age-Earnings Profiles to the Distribution of Earnings and Human Wealth,['Lee A. Lillard'],1973-09-01,1973-09-01,,,,,,"

Recent development of explicit theoretical and empirical earnings functions from life cycle human capital investment models increases the potential to explain existing earnings distributions and to predict changes in it.  The purpose of this paper is to suggest how these earnings functions can be used more directly to derive predicted earnings and human  wealth distributions for populations and sub-populations with an empirical illustration.  This is accomplished by an application if statistical distribution theory as a link between the earnings function and the earnings distribution.

12,Citizen Rights and the Cost of Law Enforcement,['Melvin Reder'],1973-10-01,1973-10-01,,,,,,"

There is an inherent tension between the idea that individuals have certain inalienable (natural) rights and the economist's postulate that the rate if utilization of anything  whose production requires scarce resources must be limited by considerations of opportunity cost.  Remarks about rights to life, liberty, health, justice and the like are readily inserted into political pronouncements, legislative preambles and court decisions, but they (should) cause economists to raise questions about costs and quantities.  Unfortunately, neither in ordinary language nor in the jargon of moral philosophy can such ultimate desiderata as liberty and justice be related to costs or quantities.  Hence in the first section we sketch a model of social choice in which the necessary relationships can be defined.  In section II, we give instances where, despite protestations to the contrary, the Law Enforcement System (LES) has made de facto reductions of citizen rights (liberties) in order to increase the efficiency if law enforcement.  The final section considers some of the normative implications suggested by the positive arguments of section II.

13,Wage Comparisons -A Selectivity Bias,['Reuben Gronau'],1973-10-01,1973-10-01,,,,,,"

The economics of information have been established by now as an integral part of economic analysis.  However, surprisingly little has been written on the implications of search (and in particular, job search) for the estimation of the wage function and its ramifications in such cases as the estimation of the determinants of labor force participation, age-earning profiles, rates of return and rates of depreciation of human capital, degree of discrimination, etc.  Given a wage offer distribution, the parameters of the observed wage distribution depend on the intensity of search.  The lower a personâ€™s wage demands the greater the chance of his finding an acceptable job, but the lower the wage he expects to receive and the wider the dispersion of acceptable wages around their mean.  On the other hand, the job seeker may opt for a more ambitious search strategy, raising his minimum wage demand and consequently increasing the risk of remaining unemployed, but also increasing the expected wage and decreasing the dispersion of available offers.  Models of wage offer distribution have traditionally been based on empirical observation of observed wage distribution.  This approach may involve certain biases when applied to secondary labor groups â€"" married women, teenagers and the aged.  This paper attempts to point out some of these biases and suggests a method for their correction.

15,A Comparison of FIML and Robust Estimates of a Nonlinear Macroeconomic Model,['Ray C. Fair'],1973-10-01,1973-10-01,,,,,,"

The prediction accuracy of six estimators of econometric models are compared.  Two of rthe estimators are ordinary least squares (OLS) and full-information maximum likelihood.  (FML).  The other four estimators are robust estimators in the sense that they give less weight to large residuals.  One of the four estimators is approximately equivalent to the least-absolute-residual (LAR) estimator, one is a combination of OLS for small residuals and LAR for large residuals, one is an estimator proposed by John W. Tukey, and one is a combination of FIML and LAR.  All of the estimators account for the first-order serial correlation of the error terms.  The main conclusion is that robust estimators appear quite promising for the estimation of econometric models.  Of the robust estimators considered in the paper, the one based on minimizing the sum of the absolute values of the residuals performed the best.  The FIML estimator and the combination of the FIML and LAR estimators also appear promising.

16,Monte Carlo Techniques in Studying Robust Estimators,['David C. Hoaglin'],1973-11-01,1973-11-01,,,,,,"

Recent work on robust estimation has led to many procedures, which are easy to formulate and straightforward to program but difficult to study analytically.  In such circumstances experimental sampling is quite attractive, but the variety and complexity of both estimators and sampling situations make effective Monte Carlo techniques essential.  This discussion examines problems, techniques, and results and draws on examples in studies of robust location and robust regression.

18,The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life and Death,['Isaac Ehrlich'],1973-11-01,1973-11-01,,,,,,"

The debate over the legitimacy or propriety of the death penalty may be almost as old as the death penalty itself and, in the view of the increasing trend towards its complete abolition, perhaps as outdated.  Not surprisingly, and as is generally recognized by contemporary writers on this topic, the philosophical and moral arguments for or against the death penalty have remained remarkably unchanged since the beginning of the debate.  One outstanding issue has become, however, the subject of increased investigation, especially in recent years, due to its objective nature and the dominant role it has played in shaping the analytical and practical case against the death penalty.  That issue is the deterrent effect of capital punishment, a reexamination of which, in both theory and practice, is the object of the paper.

20,Short-Run and Long-Run Prospects for Female Earnings,['Victor R. Fuchs'],1973-12-01,1973-12-01,,,,,,"

This paper discussed the prospects for female earnings relative to male earnings.  The determinants of the general level of earnings (female and male) are not considered.  I concentrate on hourly earnings as being the best measure of the price of labor from both the demand and supply points of view.  One can easily extend the discussion to annual earnings by taking account of annual hours.  (In 1970 on average employed women worked about 3/4 as many hours per year as employed men.)  The estimates of hourly earnings to be presented are calculated from the 1/1000 samples of the 1960 and the 1970 Census of Population.  The Census samples provide much useful data on employed persons including such characteristics as sex, schooling, age, race, marital status, and class of worker.  I have excluded agricultural and unpaid family members because of well-known difficulties in estimating their earnings and hours of work.  All other persons who were at work during the Census week and who had their earnings in the year preceding the Census are included.

22,The Correlation Between Health and Schooling,['Michael Grossman'],1973-12-01,1973-12-01,,['Public Economics'],,,,"

This paper has two purposes.  The first is to develop a methodological framework that can be used to introduce and discuss alternative explanations of the correlation between health and schooling.  The second is to test these explanations empirically in order to select the most relevant ones and obtain quantitative estimates of different effects.  The empirical work is limited to one rather unique body of data and uses two measures of health that are far from ideal.  The methodological framework can, however, serve as a point of departure for future research when longitudinal samples with more refined measures of current and past health and background characteristics become available.

24,Optimal Adaptive Control Methods for Structurally Varying Systems,"['Alexander H. Sarris', 'Michael Athans']",1973-12-01,1973-12-01,,,,,,"

The problem of simultaneously identifying and controlling a time-varying, perfectly-observed linear system is posed.  The parameters are assumed to obey a Markov structure and are estimated with a Kalman filter.  The problem can be solved conceptually by dynamic programming, but even with a quadratic loss function the analytical computations cannot be carried out for more than one step because of the dual nature of the optimal control law.  All approximations to the solution that have been proposed in the literature, and two approximations that are presented here for the first time are analyzed.  They are classified into dual and non-dual methods.  Analytical comparison is untractable;  hence Monte Carlo simulations are used.  A set of experiments is presented in which five non-dual methods are compared.  The numerical results indicate a possible ordering among these approximations.

25,The Covariance Structure of Earnings and the On the Job Training Hypothesis,['John C. Hause'],1973-12-01,1973-12-01,,,,,,"

The fine structure of earnings is defined by a theoretically meaningful decomposition of the covariance matrix of earnings (or log earnings) time series.  A three-element variance components model is proposed for analyzing earnings of young workers.  These components are interpreted as the effects of differential on-the-job training (OJT) and differential economic ability.  Several properties of these components and relationships between them are deduced from the OJT model.  Background noise generated by a nonstationary first-order autoregressive process, with heteroscedastic innovations and time-varying AR parameters is also assumed present in observed earnings.  ML estimates are obtained for all parameters of the model for a sample of Swedish males.  The results are consistent with the view that the OJT mechanism is an empirically significant phenomenon in determining individual earnings profiles.

26,Migration Flows and Their Determinants: A Comparative Study of Internal Migration in Italy and the U.S.A.,['Swarnjit S. Arora'],1974-01-01,1974-01-01,,,,,,"

This paper has two goals: first to describe a theoretical model which derives relationships among migration decisions explicitly from utility maximization under uncertainty; and second, to examine why nations vary in their internal migration.  To explain variation in internal migration, we hypothesize that the degree of monetization and industrialization of an economy is inversely related to the family cohesiveness; hence, a given percentage increase in relative income will have higher migratory effect in a relatively more monetized economy.  The availability of higher initial information and better transportation systems in these economies strongly complement this effect.  These hypothesis are confirmed by the estimates based on the U.S. and Italian data.

28,The Wealth Effect in Occupational Choice,['Yoram Weiss'],1974-01-01,1974-01-01,,,,,,"

The purpose of this paper is to indicate regularities in the area of occupational choice using income-leisure analysis.  A simple one-period model is used to examine the effect of changes in nonhuman and human wealth on the choice of an occupation. It is argued that under certainty: An increase in nonwage income will increase the propensity to choose pleasant low-paying work activities.  An increase in human capital will also induce a choice of pleasant work activities if the income effect is dominant.  Under conditions of uncertainty an increase in nonwage income will tend to encourage the choice of risky high-paying work activities if their monetary returns are uncertain. If the nonmonetary returns of an occupation are uncertain the propensity to choose it will tend to decrease with wealth. Finally, an increase in human capital is likely to discourage the choice of occupations with risky monetary returns.

31,Price Expectations and Household's Demand for Financial Assets,['Lester D. Taylor'],1974-01-01,1974-01-01,,,,,,"

The effects of price expectations on consumption and saving has received relatively little attention, especially at the micro level.  This paper's effort is addressed to this void. More specifically, the paper's primary purpose is to investigate whether it is possible to discern empirically a relationship between individually held price expectations and decisions of households to hold particular types of assets. To this end, I have analyzed aggregate time - series data from the National Income Accounts and the Flow-of-Funds and two bodies of micro household data, each involving several thousand households and each containing fairly detailed information on price expectations.

32,Operational Time and Seasonality in Distributed Lag Estimation,['Peter K. Clark'],1974-02-01,1974-02-01,,,,,,"

The following paper discusses the analysis of some types of economic time series using an altered time scale, or operational time. It is argued that for some series, observations that are ordinarily thought of as equidistant in time are actually irregularly spaced in a more natural time scale. Section A discusses point or impulse sampling of related series and the estimation of distributed lag relationships between them. Section B discusses time-aggregated sampling. In Section C, operational-time methods are used to calculate the distributed lag relationship between starts and completions for single-family dwellings in the United States. The results are statistically compared with those of ordinary distributed lag methods.

33,Inflation and Market Structure 1967-1973,['Phillip Cagan'],1974-02-01,1974-02-01,,,,,,"

A variety of theories have been offered to explain why prices generally respond so little to declines in demand, and do so now less than formerly.  Most of these center around a dependence of prices on costs, or the anticipated trend of costs, and a greater disregard for short-run changes in demand.  The more appealing hypothesis is the simple one that price setters tend to adjust slowly to changes in market conditions; they transmit but do not originate inflation.   To find that prices in the less competitive markets respond more slowly to changes in market conditions - first lagging, then catching up - would support the theory that firms try to avoid frequent changes in prices but vary in their ability to do so.  Are lags in price adjustment related to market structure?  Previous empirical studies of the relationship are inconclusive on this point.  Earlier literature, largely theoretical, has suggested that concentrated industries tend to raise prices more rapidly, thereby exerting a permanent upward push on the price level.  Empirical studies have usually reported the opposite or no consistent relation, however.  On the lag-and-catching-up theory, the concentrated industries should exhibit greater increases in the period of waning inflation after 1969.  This study examines the data for such a pattern and finds striking evidence of it.

35,Changes in the Recession Behavior of Wholesale Prices: The 1920s and Post World War II,['Phillip Cagan'],1974-03-01,1974-03-01,,,,,,"

The present study examines the recession behavior of wholesale prices since World War II and compares it with the 1920s as the most recent period of earlier recessions with comparable severity. The focus is on changes in recession behavior, possible bias in the data, and differences in behavior between various groups of wholesale prices. (Differences between wholesale and consumer prices, though of importance, are not examined here.) The purpose is to extend the evidence on the degree and uniformity of the change in price behavior and to test various interpretations of those changes.

This working paper is a draft of a chapter in a larger manuscript which is concerned with the time series variations in fertility in the United States since 1920.

A recursive algorithm for estimating linear models with both constant and time-varying parameters is derived by maximization of a likelihood function. Recursive formulas are also derived for derivatives of the likelihood function; the derivatives are needed for numerical evaluation of some parameters. Smoothing formulas are also derived.

39,Unemployment Effects of Minimum Wages,['Jacob Mincer'],1974-05-01,1974-05-01,,,,,,"

Empirical investigation of employment effects of minimum wage legislation is a subject of continuing interest, judging by a growing number of studies. The older studies were concerned mainly with changes in employment in low-wage industries. In the more recent work, attention has shifted to effects on unemployment in low-wage demographic groups, such as teenagers. Despite the statistical difference there is no apparent recognition of a conceptual as well as substantive distinction between minimum wage effects on employment and those on unemployment. The purpose of this paper is to explore the analytical distinction between employment and unemployment effects in the hope of providing some understanding of the observations. Though related empirical work is far from being definitive the findings appear to be informative.

41,Theories of Economic Regulation,['Richard A. Posner'],1974-05-01,1974-05-01,,,,,,"

A major challenge to social theory is to explain the pattern of government intervention in the market - what we may call ""economic regulation."" Properly defined, the term refers to taxes and subsidies of all sorts as well as to explicit legislative and administrative controls over rates, entry, and other facets of economic activity. Two main theories of economic regulation have been proposed. One is the ""public interest"" theory, bequeathed by a previous generation of economists to the present generation of lawyers.  This theory holds that regulation is supplied in response to the demand of the public for the correction of inefficient or inequitable market practices. It has a number of deficiencies that we shall discuss. The second theory is the ""capture"" theory - a poor term but one that will do for now. Espoused by an odd mixture of welfare state liberals, Marxists, and free-market economists, this theory holds that regulation is supplied in response to the demands of interest groups struggling among themselves to maximize the incomes of their members. There are crucial differences among the capture theorists. I will argue that the economists' version of the ""capture"" theory is the most promising but shall also point out the significant weaknesses in both the theory and the empirical research that is alleged to support it.

49,Years and Intensity of Schooling Investing,['Arleen Leibowitz'],1974-08-01,1974-08-01,,,,,,"

An essential feature of schooling is not only that it occurs in a different site than most on-the-job training but also that it is more intensive. That is, a smaller proportion of gross potential earnings is sacrificed in on-the-job training than in schooling.  In estimating human capital earnings functions it has generally been assumed that during schooling 100% of gross potential earnings are invested in all years, while in on-the-job training this percentage is smaller and is a declining function of age. This assumption has been quite useful since it allows the identification of an estimate of the rate of return on schooling from a regression of earnings on years of schooling. This paper argues that the percentage of gross earnings invested may fall below 100% well before schooling is ended, that this percentage is likely to be correlated with years of schooling, and thus this procedure yields only a biased estimate of the rate of return to schooling.

50,Measuring the Effect of an Anti-Discrimination Program,"['Orley Ashenfelter', 'James J. Heckman']",1974-08-01,1974-08-01,,,,,,"

Since 1941, six Executive Orders have been issued forbidding Federal government contractors from discriminating against minority workers. In principle, all prospective contractors are required to demonstrate compliance with the law before a contract is let. The potential penalties are severe: failure to comply with the law may result in revocation of current contracts and suspension of the right to bid on future contracts.  Despite these provisions, doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of the Orders.  Defenders of the Orders cite cases in which contract award dates have been postponed until firms have taken steps toward compliance with the law. In this paper, we investigate these competing claims using data from 40,445 establishments sampled in 1966 and 1970. In the first section of this paper, we distinguish what can be measured from what cannot. We develop a framework to measure and interpret program effects. In the second section we discuss the design of our sample and present results of an analysis of the randomness of this sample. In the third and concluding section, we present the estimates and discuss their plausibility.

51,"Age, Experience and Wage Growth",['Edward P. Lazear'],1974-08-01,1974-08-01,,,,,,"

During the past decade, much has been said about the role that on-the-job training plays in augmenting one's stock of human capital.  Up to this point, little has been done to distinguish the effect of on-the-job training from that of aging on the increase in human wealth.  The reason rests primarily on the fact that it is difficult to observe  or even define in some appropriate way the amount of on-the-job training that an individual possesses. In this paper, a method is developed by which one may compare the effects of work experience to those of aging per se. The difference is then attributed to on-the-job training.

52,Transportation/Communication Considerations in the Location of Headquarters for Multi-Establishment Manufacturing Firms,['Warren G. Lavey'],1974-08-01,1974-08-01,,,,,,"

Usually transportation/communication (t/c) considerations appear as only two in a long list of factors which determine headquarters location patterns.  The research reported here singles out t/c considerations as the logical basis for headquarters location decisions. We ask: to what degree do transportation/communication consideration explain the patterns of headquarters location? The case of manufacturing firms with five or more establishments and no manufacturing activity at the headquarters location was examined. The t/c considerations were studied in terms of the advantages of close proximity between the headquarters of a firm and the manufacturing establishments of that firm and the advantages of close proximity between the headquarters of one firm and the headquarters of other firms. The findings of this research show that the logic of headquarters location patterns is heavily dependent on t/c considerations.

55,Social Costs of Monopoly and Regulation,['Richard A. Posner'],1974-09-01,1974-09-01,,,,,,"

When an industry is monopolized, price rises above and output falls below the competitive level. Those who continue to buy the product at the higher price suffer a loss, but this loss is exactly offset by the additional revenue that the monopolist obtains by charging the higher price. Other consumers, who are deflected by the higher price to substitute goods, suffer a loss, that is not offset by gains to the monopolist. This is the ""deadweight loss"" from monopoly, and in conventional analysis the only social cost of monopoly.  The loss suffered by those who continue to buy the product at the higher cost is regarded merely as a transfer from consumers to owners of the monopoly seller and has not previously been factored into the social costs of monopoly.  However, the existence of an opportunity to obtain monopoly profits will attract resources into efforts to obtain monopolies, and the opportunity costs of those resources are social costs of monopoly, too. Although the tendency of monopoly rents to be transformed into costs is no longer a novel insight, its implications both for the measurement of the aggregate social costs of monopoly and for a variety of other important issues relating to monopoly and public regulation (including tax policy) continue to be ignored.  The present paper is an effort to rectify this neglect.  Part I introduces the material.  Part II presents a simple model of the social costs of monopoly, conceived as the sum of the deadweight loss and the additional loss resulting from the competition to become a monopolist.  Part III uses the model to estimate the social costs of monopoly in the United States, and the social benefits of antitrust enforcement. Part IV explores the implications of the analysis for a variety of issues relating to monopoly and public regulation, such as public policy toward price discrimination and the choice between income and excise taxation.

The agrarian unrest in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century is examined. This unrest is often viewed as stemming from the inability of farmers to adapt to changing conditions in world agriculture. This hypothesis is tested in the context of a distributed lag supply function. Varying parameter estimation methods are used to trace the history of the parameters in the supply function and to decompose observed prices into permanent and transitory components over time. The patterns of variation are tested for conformity with a model of rational price-expectation formation. The conclusion is that farmers behaved as economic theory would predict, but that neither theory nor practice gave them relief from the troubles which plagued them.

62,The Private Enforcement of Law,"['William M. Landes', 'Richard A. Posner']",1974-11-01,1974-11-01,,,,,,"

An important question in the economic study of enforcement is the appropriate, and the actual, division of responsibilities between public and private enforcers. This question has been brought into sharp focus recently by an article in which Gary Becker and George Stigler advocate the privatization of law enforcement.  In the present article, we explore the idea that the area in which private enforcement is in fact clearly preferable to public enforcement on efficiency grounds is more restricted than Becker and Stigler believe; perhaps the existing division of enforcement between the public and private sectors approximates the optimal division.  Part I develops an economic model of competitive, profit-maximizing private enforcement. The model predicts the level of enforcement and the number of offenses that would occur in a world of exclusively private enforcement.  Part II refines the model to account for the presence of monopoly in the private enforcement industry, different assignments of property rights in legal claims, the effect of taxing private enforcers, nonmonetary penalties, and legal errors - elements ignored in the initial development of the model in Part I.  Part III contrasts our model with other economic approaches to the enforcement question. Part IV presents a number of positive implications of the model, relating to the choice between public and private enforcement of criminal versus civil laws, the assignment of exclusive rights to the victims of offenses, the budgets of public agencies, the discretionary nonenforcement of the law, and the legal treatment of blackmail and bribery. The positive implications of the model appear to be consistent with observations of the real world, although the findings in Part IV must be regarded as highly tentative. An appendix discusses the economics of rewards - an important method of compensating private enforcers.

63,Censored Regression Models with Unobserved Stochastic Censoring Thresholds,['Forrest D. Nelson'],1974-12-01,1974-12-01,,,,,,"

The ""Tobit"" model is a useful tool for estimation of regression models with a truncated or limited dependent variable, but it requires a threshold which is either a known constant or an observable and independent variable. The model presented here extends the Tobit model to the censored case where the threshold is an unobserved and not necessarily independent random variable. Maximum likelihood procedures can be employed for joint estimation of both the primary regression equation and the parameters of the distribution of that random threshold. The appropriate likelihood function is derived, the conditions necessary for identification are revealed, and the particular estimation difficulties are discussed. The model is illustrated by an application to the determination of a housewife's value of time.

The traditional forms are viewed as special cases of the Rational Structural Form.  Thus, the latter provides a unified framework for any treatment of the linear, time invariant modeling problem.  In particular, a solution of the estimation problem for the Rational Structural Form leads to the solution of the estimation problem for all traditional forms.

It is by now widely recognized that investment decisions play a major role in the determination of individual age-earnings profiles. The purpose of this paper is to present a simple life-cycle model of investment in human capital in which leisure choices are explicitly incorporated. In so doing, we integrate two previously disparate branches of life-cycle theory: models of labor supply with exogenous wages, and models of human capital formation with exogenous leisure.  Of course, to accomplish this, we must posit utility maximization as the individual's goal rather than income maximization.

The paper explains how the Almon polynominal lag specification can be made stochastic in two different ways - one suggested by Shiller and another following the lines of Lindley and Smith. It is shown that both the estimators can be considered as modified ridge estimators. The paper then compares these modified ridge estimators with the ridge estimator suggested by Hoerl and Kennard. It is shown that for the estimation of distributed lag models the ridge estimator suggested by Hoerl and Kennard is not useful but that the modified ridge estimators corresponding to the stochastic versions of the Almon lag are promising. The paper has two empirical illustrations.

72,The Goodness of Match,['Edward N. Wolff'],1974-12-01,1974-12-01,,,,,,"

Though the statistical techniques vary, the matching problem is essentially the same in each case and can be stated formally as follows: Given ""observations on X,Y from one sample and on X,Z from another sample, when will it be true that by matching observations according to X, an artificial Y,Z sample will result whose distribution is the true joint Y,Z distribution?""(Sims,1972, p. 355). Though the imputed Y,Z distribution will, in general, be different from the true Y,Z distribution, the closeness of the two yields a natural criterion of the goodness of match. By making certain simplifying assumptions, we can make this criterion operational. The goodness of match depends on how much of the relation between Y and Z is transmitted through X - that is, on how X ""mediates"" between Y and Z.  Since the functional form the lower and upper bounds on the true correlation between Y and Z takes depends on the number of X variables, we shall treat the problem in three stages: (a) The case of one mediating variable.(b) The case of two mediating variables. (c) The case of n mediating variables.

Because of reduced reliance on the official classification of commodities as durable or nondurable, a considerable increase in ability to explain consumer expenditures results as compared to multiequation models. Further empirical investigation provides strong evidence that: (1) private sector income is significantly better than disposable personal income for explaining consumer expenditures, (2) the M1 definition of money is similarly superior to both M2 and M3 definitions, and (3) the weight of current income in permanent income is about 10% per annum.

The estimator holding the central place in the theory of the multivariate ""errors-in-the-variables"" (EV) model results from performing orthogonal recession on variables rescaled according to the covariance matrix of the errors [7]. Our first principal finding, via Monte Carlo on the univariate model, essentially relegates this estimator to use only in large samples on very well-behaved data, i.e., with no trace of outlier contamination. A modification, requiring a robust preliminary slope, is proposed that essentially sets out the generalization to EV of the w-estimator in regression. It is demonstrated that the modification is robust to outlier contamination even in small samples, given a sufficiently good preliminary estimator. A candidate for a preliminary slope estimator based on the data is proposed arid its performance under simulation examined. Least-absolute residuals estimation in EV is cited as an alternative candidate.

85,On the Identification of Time Varying Structures,"['Thomas F. Cooley', 'Kent D. Wall']",1975-05-01,1975-05-01,,,,,,"

The identifiability of reduced form econometric models with variable coefficients is investigated using the control theoretic concepts of uniform complete observability and uniform complete controllability. First, a variant of the state space representation of the traditional reduced form is introduced which transcribes the underlying non-stationary estimation problem into one particularly suited to a Kalman filtering solution. Using such a formulation, observability and controllability can be called upon to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for identification of the specific parameterization. The results so obtained are completely analogous to those already established in the econometric literature, namely, that the parameters of the reduced form are always identified subject to the absence of multicollinearity(referred to as ""persistent excitation"" in the control literature). How-ever, now the multicollinearity condition is seen to depend on the structure of the parameter variations as well as the statistical nature of the explanatory variables. The verification of identifiability thus reduces to a check for uniform complete observability which can always be affected in econometric applications. Some consistency results are also presented which derive from the above approach.

A major conceptual error in the standard BLS and Lebergott unemployment estimates for 1933-1943 is reported. Emergency workers (employees of federal contracyclical programs such as WPA) were counted as unemployed on a normal-jobs-to-be-created instead of job-seekers unemployment definition. For 1934-1941, the corrected unemployment levels are reduced by two to three-and-a half million people and the rates by 4 to 7 percentage points. The corrected data show strong movement toward the natural unemployment rate after 1933 and are very well explained by an anticipations-search model using annual full-time earnings.

Thinking of generous unemployment insurance, I had no idea that my hyperbole would prove literally correct. Mrs. Schwartz's incomparable knowledge of data resources provided the key references.

91,Autoregressive Spectrum Estimation Technique Allied to Quarterly Consumer Durables Expenditure Data,['Warren G. Lavey'],1975-06-01,1975-06-01,,,,,,"

Classical spectral techniques can provide sharp insights into the cyclical patterns in a time series of economic data. Various problems in the application of classical spectral techniques, such as the choices of smoothing routine and bandwidth and the appearance of end-effects, inhibit the usefulness of spectral analysis. Alternatively, an autoregressive spectral technique does not share these problems, but does present the difficulty of the choice of the order of the autoregression. This paper applies classical and autoregressive spectral techniques to quarterly consumer durables expenditure data, discusses three approaches to the choice of the order of the autoregression, and compares the results of the different spectral techniques. Autoregressive spectral analysis provides a superior representation for this time series.

92,Schooling as a Wage Depressant,['Edward P. Lazear'],1975-06-01,1975-06-01,,,,,,"

We investigate the relationship between current schooling and current wage rates. Casual observation seems to reflect a discontinuity in wage rate growth which occurs when an individual completes school and joins the labor force as a permanent member. This suggests that the time spent in work while attending school is in some sense secondary. Here, the marginal value of the individual's time is considerably lower than the average value of his time. The problem is essentially one of ""anti-complementarities"" between the production of human capital through formal schooling and working in the primary occupation. More generally, the productivity of an individual's time in one endeavor is not independent of how the rest of his time is spent. If this is the case, students will be willing to accept lower paying jobs which do not greatly diminish the productivity of school time in lieu of jobs offering higher wages at the cost of a greater reduction in school time productivity. The wages of students, other things constant, are about 12% lower than those of non-students. The magnitude of this wage differential is surprisingly large and warrants investigation on empirical grounds alone. This paper explores the empirical relationship and examines various explanations for it. Finally, implications of the analyses are discussed.

The recent literature on rational expectations in macroeconomic theory is surveyed here with the objective of distilling from the various papers useful suggestions for econometric methodology.

The paper begins with a brief discussion of the theory of martingales as it has been applied to microeconomic theory. Then, the general linear rational expectations model (of which most models discussed in the literature are, in terms of their structure, special cases) is developed arid its properties, advantages and drawbacks discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the possibilities for estimation arid application of such linear models.

94,"Decision-Stage Method: Convergence Proof, Special Application, and Computation Experience",['Vinay Dharmadhikari'],1975-07-01,1975-07-01,,,,,,"

This paper presents a new method for obtaining exact optimal solutions for a class of discrete-variable non-linear resource-allocation problems. The new method is called the decision-state method because, unlike the conventional dynamic programming method which works only in the state space, the new method works in the state space and the decision space. It generates and retains only a fraction of the points in the state space at which the state functions are discontinuous; and thus overcomes to some extent the curse of dimensionality. It carries the cumulative decision-strongs associated with these points, and thus avoids the backtracking entailed by the conventional dynamic programming method for recovering the optimal decisions. A concise and complete statement of the method is given in Algorithm 2 and it is proved that the algorithm finds all exact optimal solutions. In addition the method is adapted for solving some problems with special structures such as block-angular or split-block-angular constraints and the resultant substantial advantages are demonstrated. The performance of Algorithm 2 on many resource-allocations problems is reported, along with investigations on many tactical decisions which have substantial impact on the performance. The performance of the computer implementation of Algorithm 2 is compared with that of the MMDP algorithm and it showed that for the class of problems at which the two are aimed, the decision-state Algorithm 2 performed better than MMDP algorithm both in terms of storage requirement and solution time. In fact, it achieved an order of magnitude saving in storage requirement.

This paper deals with the links between the development of new drugs, and particularly of innovative new drugs, and the international activities of  U.S. drug companies. While U.S. drug companies have developed new production processes - the most notable being the fermentation process for making penicillin - we concentrate in this paper on new products. Since production costs comprise less than 40 percent of the selling price of drugs and since the person choosing the drug rarely pays for it, growth in company sales and profits comes more from introducing new products than from cutting costs and prices of old products. The main novelty of our study is our examination of ""innovative"" as contrasted with ""imitative"" new drugs. Previous studies have generally focused on the total number of new drugs produced each year, but since our interest is in the causes and consequences of innovation, we have concentrated on the products we have rated as innovative. Section I explains our criteria for this distinction and presents our enumeration of the innovative new drugs for each of the 22 companies in our sample. In Section II we discuss trends in the rate of drug innovation and the factors influencing those trends. Section III describes our sample of drug companies and characterizes them with respect to their size, research investment, and innovativeness.  Section IV examines the relation of innovativeness to the foreign activities of individual firms. In Section  V we analyze, for a sample of 7 new drugs introduced by two companies, the rate at which use of the drugs was diffused among various countries arid the impact of the presence of manufacturing plants on the rate of diffusion.

This aspect has been explored by Spence (1973) and Stiglitz (1973) and will not be explicitly considered here.

It can be claimed that education is simply a normal consumption good and that like all other normal goods, an increase in wealth will produce an increase in the amount of schooling purchased. Increased incomes are associated with higher schooling attainment as the simple result of an income effect.  If this is so, schooling increases an individual's wealth only by the consumption value of the good, since it is a non-saleable asset. This paper will attempt to determine empirically the amount by which an increase in wealth is caused by schooling as distinguished from the amount by which the demand for schooling increases as the result of an increase in wealth.

A family of integer programs is considered whose right-hand-sides lie on a given line segment L. This family is called a parametric integer program (PIP). Solving a (PIP) means finding an optimal solution for every program in the family. It is shown how a simple generalization of the conventional branch-and-bound approach to integer programming makes it possible to solve such a (PIP). The usual bounding test is extended from a comparison of two point values to a comparison of two functions defined on the line segment L. The method is illustrated on a small example and computational results for some larger problems are reported.

109,Notes on Automating Stem and Leaf Displays,"['David C. Hoaglin', 'Stanley S. Wasserman']",1975-11-01,1975-11-01,,,,,,"

The stem-and-leaf display is a natural semi-graphic technique to include in statistical computing systems. This paper discusses the choices involved in implementing both automated and flexible versions of the display, develops an algorithm for the automated version, examines various implementation considerations, and presents a set of semi-portable FORTRAN subroutines for producing stem-and-leaf displays.

The present implementation of stem-and-leaf displays have evolved from the earlier one-line per-stem versions programmed by Michael D. Godfrey for the instructional computing package SNAP/IEDA on the IBM7094 and refined by Hale F. Trotter when SNAP/IEDA was converted to the IBM 360. We are also indebted to Paul W. Holland, Paul F. Velleman, and Roy E. Welsch for articu1ating the needs of a variety of users, to Neil E. Kaden and Virginia Klema for va1uble discussions of semi-portability, and to Stephen C.

111,Confidence Regions for Robust Regression,['Roy E. Welsch'],1975-11-01,1975-11-01,,,,,,"

This paper describes the results of a Monte Carlo study of certain aspects of robust regression confidence region estimation for linear models with one, five, and seven parameters. One-step sine estimators (c = l.42) were used with design matrices consisting of short-tailed, Gaussian, and long-tailed columns. The samples were generated from a variety of contaminated Gaussian distributions. A number of proposals for covariance matrices were tried, including forms derived from asymptotic considerations and from weighted-least squares with data dependent weights. Comparisons with: the Monte Carlo ""truth"" were made using generalized eigenvalues. In order to measure efficiency and compute approximate t-values, linear combinations of parameters corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the ""truth"" were examined. For design matrices with columns of modest kurtosis, the covariance estimators all give reasonable results and, after adjusting for asymptotic bias, some useful approximate t-values can be obtained. This implies that the standard weighted least-squares output using data-dependent weights need only be modified slightly to give useful robust confidence intervals. When design matrix kurtosis is high and severe contamination is present in the data, these simple approximations are not adequate.

112,A Beta-Logistic Model for the Analysis of Sequential Labor Force Participation by Married Women,"['James J. Heckman', 'Robert J. Willis']",1975-11-01,1975-11-01,,,,,,"

In this paper, we discuss statistical problems that arise in studying sequences of quantal responses (e.g., labor force participation) in panel data on heterogeneous populations (i.e., populations in which there is unobserved variation in response probabilities). Assuming that response probabilities are governed by a beta distribution, we derive a generalization of the cross-section logit model to enable it to deal with sequences of discrete events in panel data. This model is applied to panel data on labor force participation of married women. One of our findings is that the distribution of participation probabilities is U-shaped, indicating that most women have participation probabilities near zero or one.

The validity of using local market data to measure the benefits associated with policies adopted in an urban area is investigated .It is shown that the rest of the world is affected by taxing decisions undertaken in a single urban area, so that local data cannot perfectly measure the welfare effects of a policy change. Specifically, the fact that the willingness to pay for a tax increase is positive in the rest of the world suggests that cost-benefit analyses which do not account for the rest of the world may be biased.

116,Notes on the Tax Treatment of Human Capital,['Michael J. Boskin'],1975-11-01,1975-11-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

Section 1 presents a preliminary attempt at clarifying the ways in which taxes affect human capital accumulation.  Section 2 outlines a simple general equilibrium model with two capital goods - physical and human â€"" and the saving corresponding to each, to begin to deal with these issues. Once human capital is viewed as an alternative source of wealth and hence human capital investment as a source of current saving (re-sources withdrawn from current consumption to help increase future output),the old issue of the differential tax treatment of alternative types of capital arises. Sensible tax policy with respect to the taxation of either physical or human capital must take into account the tax treatment of the alternative asset. Section 3 outlines some points of departure for such an analysis.

119,Interequation Constraint and the Specification of Dynamic Structure,['Kent D. Wall'],1976-01-01,1976-01-01,,,,,,"

This note considers the effect of a class of linear inter-equation constraints in the specification of the lag structure in econometric models. In particular, attention is focused on the linear summing, or ""adding upâ€?, constraints which arise between equations in factor shares analysis. The consequences of such constraints on the specification of lag structures for models with dynamic adjustments and autoregressive or moving-average disturbances are presented in the form of linear restrictions which result in singular coefficient matrices . Thus, the structural (lag) specification of one equation depends on the structure of all other equations in the model.

121,Analysis of Longitudinal Earnings Data: American Scientists 1960-70,"['Lee A. Lillard', 'Yoram Weiss']",1976-01-01,1976-01-01,,,,,,"

The major findings of this study are as follows: (1) Simple cross section estimates grossly underestimate cohort profiles during the period 1960-70. Furthermore the growth in earnings is not uniform across experience groups and more recent vintages tend to have steeper profiles in most fields. Consequently the rate of return or present value comparisons based on cross sections are likely to be misleading even if the standard adjustment for growth is made. (2) For purposes of estimating mean profiles and mean effects of variables estimates based on pooled independent cross sections are quite close to those based on the more expensive longitudinal data. (3) There are important persistent unmeasured individual effects on both the level and growth of earnings. Consequently, individuals with the same observed characteristics will still have a wide variance in their permanent income.

124,Representing Symmetric Rank Two Updates,['David M. Gay'],1976-02-01,1976-02-01,,,,,,"

Various quasi-Newton methods periodically add a symmetric ""correction"" matrix of rank at most 2 to a matrix approximating some quantity A of interest (such as the Hessian of an objective function). In this paper we examine several ways to express a symmetric rank 2 matrix [delta] as the sum of rank 1 matrices. We show that it is easy to compute rank 1 matrices [delta1] and [delta2] such that [delta] = [delta1] + [delta2] and [the norm of delta1]+ [the norm of delta2]   is minimized, where ||.|| is any inner product norm. Such a representation recommends itself for use in those computer programs that maintain A explicitly, since it should reduce cancellation errors and/or improve efficiency over other representations. In the common case where [delta] is indefinite, a choice of the form [delta1] = [delta2 to the power of T] = [xy to the power of T] appears best. This case occurs for rank 2 quasi- Newton updates [delta] exactly when [delta] may be obtained by symmetrizing some rank 1 update; such popular updates as the DFP, BFGS, PSB, and Davidon's new optimally conditioned update fall into this category.

125,On Modifying Singular Values to Solve Possible Singular Systems of Non-Linear Equations,['David M. Gay'],1976-03-01,1976-03-01,,,,,,"

We show that if a certain nondegeneracy assumption holds, it is possible to guarantee the existence of a solution to a system of nonlinear equations f(x) = 0 whose Jacobian matrix J(x) exists but maybe singular. The main idea is to modify small singular values of J(x) in such away that the modified Jacobian matrix J^(x) has a continuous pseudoinverse J^+(x)and that a solution x* of f(x) = 0 may be found by determining an asymptote of the solution to the initial value problem x(0) = x[sub0}, xâ€™(t) = -J^+(x)f(x). We briefly discuss practical (algorithmic) implications of this result. Although the nondegeneracy assumption may fail for many systems of interest (indeed, if the assumption holds and J(x*) is non-singular, then x is unique), algorithms using(x) may enjoy a larger region of convergence than those that require(an approximation to) J[to the -1 power[(x).

This paper has examined the factors that affect the pattern of introduction of semiconductor innovations into the United Kingdom, studying both differences among products and differences among firms. The pattern of product innovations is based on the concept of a lifecycle process. A model is developed for estimating product life cycles in a way that gives information suitable for assessing induced changes in the host country industry. The analysis that follows is broken into two parts. Firstly, factors determining the rate of diffusion of the innovations in the host country are examined; secondly, factors determining the positions of individual firms within the life cycle are considered.

127,Identification Theory for Time Varying Models,"['Thomas F. Cooley', 'Kent D. Wall']",1976-03-01,1976-03-01,,,,,,"

The identification of time-varying coefficient regression models is investigated using an analysis of the classical information matrix. The variable coefficients are characterized by autoregressive stochastic processes, allowing the entire model to be case in state space form. Thus the unknown stochastic specification parameters and priors can be interpreted in terms of the coefficient matrices and initial state vector. Concentration of the likelihood function on these quantities allows the identification of each to be considered separately. Suitable restriction of the form of the state space model, coupled with the concept of controllability, lead to sufficient conditions for the identification of the coefficient transition parameters. Partial identification of the variance-covariance matrix for the random disturbances on the coefficients is established in a like manner. Introducing the additional concept of observability then provides for necessary and sufficient conditions for identification of the unknown priors. The results so obtained are completely analogous to those already established in the econometric literature, namely, that the coefficients of the reduced form are always identified subject to the absence of multicollinearity. Some consistency results are also presented which derive from the above approach.

Transferring Fortran subroutines from one manufacturer' s machine to another, or from one operating system to another, puts certain constraints on the construction of the Fortran statements that are used in the subroutines. The reliable performance of mathematical software should be unaffected by the host environment in which the software is used or by the compiler from which the cod eis generated. In short, the reliable performance of the algorithm is to be independent of the computing environment in which it is run. The subroutines of ROSEPACK (Robust Statistics Estimation Package) are Fortran IV source code designed to be semi-portable where semi-portable is defined to mean transportable with minimum change. *This paper described the guidelines by which ROSEPACK subroutines were written.

133,Toward a More General Theory of Regulation,['Sam Peltzman'],1976-04-01,1976-04-01,,,,,,"

In previous literature, George Stigler asserts a law of diminishing returns to group size in politics: Beyond some point it becomes counterproductive to dilute the per capita transfer. Since the total transfer is endogenous, there is a corollary that dirninishing returns apply to the transfer as well, due both to the opposition provoked by the transfer and to the demand this opposition exerts on resources to quiet it. Stigler does not himself formalize this model, and my first task will be to do just this. My simplified formal version of his model produces a result to which Stigler gave only passing recognition, namely that the costs of using the political process limit not only the size of the dominant group but also their gains. This is at one level, a detail, which is the way Stigler treated it, but a detail with some important implications -- for entry into regulation, and for the price-output structure that emerges from regulation. The main task of the paper is to derive these implications from a generalization of Stigler's model.

After exploring both the crucial role of the interest elasticity of the saving rate in the analysis of a wide variety of issues in economic - particularly tax - policy and reasons why previous studies of the effect of interest rates on consumption and saving have biased the estimated elasticity toward zero, this study presents new estimates of consumption functions based on aggregate U.S. time series data. The results are striking: a variety of functional forms, estimation methods and definitions of the real after-tax rate of return invariably lead to the conclusion of a substantial interest elasticity of saving.

It is the price behavior in primary manufacturing industries and its implication for general inflation that is the subject of this paper. The industries comprising primary manufacturing are quite diverse. They differ with respect to labor and capital intensity, domestic and international market structure and the markets that they supply -- consumer goods manufacturing, producer goods manufacturing and construction. To shed light on the price behavior of the group as a whole it is necessary to disaggregate the total somewhat. In this study they are broken down into eight separate industries. The exact definition of each, both in terms of 4-digit SIC industry and I-0 cell is available on request. In general, the eight separate industries consist of the primary manufacturers producing (1) textiles, (2) wood, (3) paper,(4) chemicals, (5) fertilizers,(6) stone, clay and glass, (7) iron and steel, and (8) nonferrous metals.

It is well established that the social and economic environment of medical care distinguishes its provision from that of other goods and services. While scholars have studied the influences of this idiosyncratic environment, there is relatively little empirical knowledge about how it affects decision-making in specific medical contexts. Through general conceptual discussion and consideration of a case study of leukemia chemo-therapy, this paper examines the medical decision-making process in one specific context: the response of physicians to the availability of an innovative treatment for a catastrophic illness. The manner in which the medical profession deals with serious illness is relevant to concerns as diverse as the promotion of economic efficiency and the preservation of human dignity.

141,Family Background and Optimal Schooling Decision,['Edward P. Lazear'],1980-10-01,1980-10-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

In this paper, another aspect of optimizing behavior is considered. Specifically, it asks whether variations in levels of attained schooling across groups can be explained by a model that assumes that capital markets are perfect and that individuals maximize wealth. The logic of the analysis proceeds as follows: First, a model is constructed that allows estimation of costs and returns to education for each individual, based on the assumption that all individuals face the same borrowing rates. Given costs and returns, one can obtain an optimal wealth-maximizing level of education for each individual. Differences between actually acquired and wealth-maximizing levels of education can then be calculated, and one can determine whether or not the residuals are systematically related to background variables. If, for example, low-income individuals have a consistently larger estimated wealth-maximizing level of education than actual level, one could conclude either that returns to schooling differed between groups or that capital market differences exist. The model allows these two explanations to be distinguished. Since differential returns are caused by wage differences across groups, the wealth-maximizing level can take these labor market variations into account. Any residual variation will be due to factors other than differential wage rates, presumably capital cost differences .

The purpose of the present note is to explore the structure of optimal income taxation/redistribution in an economy where the welfare of individuals depends in part on relative after-tax consumption, i.e., we specify individual welfare as a function of absolute and relative after-tax consumption, with diminishing marginal utility to each. With such a specification, of course, an additional incentive for income redistribution from wealthy to poor citizens is created and the logical impossibility of increasing tax rates to the point where disincentive effects actually reduce tax revenues is potentially removed. The analysis highlights the importance of the marginal valuation placed on upward social mobility in various ranges of the income distribution and its interaction with the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption; of course, ""labor supply"" elasticities, the form of the social welfare function, and the skill distribution continue to play an important role.

New (and replacement) capital is created by investment in the production of precedents.

147,Factors Affecting Divorce:  A Study of the Terman Sample,['Robert T. Michael'],1976-08-01,1976-08-01,,,,,,"

Within the past few years, renewed interest in understanding marital behavior has resulted in a number of studies which focus on an equation estimating the probability of divorce or remarriage. This paper reports on one such effort. It offers a brief rationale for and an estimation of probability functions for divorce rates at specific lengths of marriage duration for a very unrepresentative sample of American women -- a group of geniuses. The data are from the ""Terman sample"" of some 671 women selected in 1921 (together with a comparable group of men) by psychologist Lewis N. Terman. The sample was chosen from children enrolled in California schools in urban areas. It included children, preselected by their teachers, whose measured IQ was 135 or above. The sample thus represented students in the highest one percent of the school population in general intelligence. In another report I have compared the marital behavior of these Terman subjects to the relevant California population, controlling for the very high level of schooling and the somewhat constricted distribution of age at first marriage among the Terman subjects (Michael 1976).  The Terman subjects generally exhibited the same qualitative relationships between marital patterns and such variables as age at marriage and schooling as the California population. However, one should keep in mind the very special nature of this sample when comparing results with other studies.

In this paper, we will investigate the effect of six factors on occupational earnings inequality across all occupations in our sample and across occupations in five major Census subgroups. Those six factors are: differences in tasks, different levels of efficiency, institutional factors, time worked, the demand for labor and discrimination.  Age and schooling will receive primary attention in our work and it will be shown that they are important determinants of earnings inequality among professional and clerical occupations but not among skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled occupations. Ability is also hypothesized as an important factor, but no measure of ability is provided in our sample. Differences in time worked and labor demand conditions, as measured by industrial and urban-rural mix, will also be analyzed, and their effect on earnings inequality is strong in most of the occupational subsamples. Differences in the race and sex composition of occupations do not appear to be significant factors in occupational earnings inequality, and the explanation offered is that discrimination takes the form of occupational segregation rather than differences in pay for similar work. In the conclusion a sketch of a ""structural"" theory of income distribution is proposed to account for our results.

This paper, which seeks to identify factors contributing to the rate and character of technical transfer and to assess host-country research and development effort in response to foreign competition, is one of three examining the impact of technically-advanced companies, particularly American, on British industries. Beginning first with an analysis of imitation cycles in pharmaceuticals and making use of a model of these, the study proceeds to examine the transnational operations of American and other foreign companies, showing the connection between company size, sales and new product introductions.

157,Efficient Estimation of a Dynamic Error-Shock Model,"['Cheng Hsiao', 'P. M. Robinson']",1976-11-01,1976-11-01,,,,,,"

This paper is concerned with the estimation of the parameters in a dynamic simultaneous equation model with stationary disturbances under the assumption that the variables are subject to random measurement errors. The conditions under which the parameters are identified are stated. An asymptotically efficient frequency-domain class of instrumental variables estimators is suggested. The procedure consists of two basic steps. The first step transforms the model in such a way that the observed exogenous variables are asymptotically orthogonal to the residual terms. The second step involves an iterative procedure like that of Robinson [13].

158,The Market for Lawyers: The Determinants of the Demand for and Supply ofLawyers,['B. Peter Pashigian'],1976-12-01,1976-12-01,,,,,,"

Some additional evidence on the comparative effect of income, regulation, and other variables on the demand for lawyers is called for. One objective of this paper is to investigate the speed of adjustment of law schools to shifts in the demand for lawyers. Section I presents a theoretical model of the demand for and supply of lawyers. The empirical counterparts of the variables are introduced in Section II. Section III presents the results of the estimation and Section IV compares the actual number of lawyers with the number that would have existed if lawyers earned a normal return on their investment in legal education. Section V presents other evidence of an excess demand for lawyers and offers several explanations for the speed of adjustment of enrollments in law schools to shifts in the demand for lawyers. The paper ends with a summary of the major findings of the paper.

159,A Conic Algorithm for the Group Minimization Problem,['Bruno Simeone'],1976-12-01,1976-12-01,,,,,,"

A new algorithm for the group minimization problem (GP) is proposed. The algorithm can be broadly described as follows. A suitable relaxation of(GP) is defined, in which any feasible point satisfies the group equation but may have negative components. The feasible points of the relaxation are then generated in order of ascending costs by a variant of a well-known algorithm of Glover, and checked for non-negativity. The first non-negative point is an optimal solution of (GP). Advantages and disadvantages of the algorithm are discussed; in particular, the implementation of the algorithm (which can be easily extended so as to solve integer linear programming problems) does not require group arithmetics.

163,The Gains and Losses From Industrial Concentration,['Sam Peltzman'],1977-01-01,1977-01-01,,,,,,"

In essence, this paper will try to decompose the concentration-profits relationship into separate concentration-price arid concentration-cost relationships. By doing this, I hope to shed light on some of the allocative and distributive issues that, I suspect, give the subject its intrinsic interest, but which have not so far been confronted empirically: Does high concentration save or waste resources? Does it lead to higher prices? Who gains and loses from a social policy hostile to high concentration? Since the unique aspect of the paper is its focus on a concentration-cost relationship, most of the analytical effort is spent here. I review the theory underlying such a relationship, and develop and implement a model designed to estimate its importance. Subsequently, I try to estimate how much of the usual profit-concentration relationship is due to cost effects and how much to price effects. The main conclusion is that, while price effects are not absent, the cost effects so dominate them as to cast doubt on the efficacy of any general legal rule hostile to industrial concentration.

164,Alternative Trade Strategies and Employment - Plan of Research for Country Studies,['Anne O. Krueger'],1977-01-01,1977-01-01,,,,,,"

This paper was originally prepared as part of the first stage of the research project, Alternative Trade Strategies and Employment. The project as a whole is focused upon identifying the relationships between alternative trade strategies -- export promotion and import substitution -- and growth in the demand for labor. The project has altogether three stages: (1) the preparatory stage, in which the theory underlying the relationship between trade strategy and employment was developed and a methodology for undertaking empirical research was formulated; (2) the second stage, in which project participants undertook the empirical research for individual countries and also for particular topics of special interest for the project as a whole, based upon the papers prepared in the first stage; and (3) a summing up, in which the results of the individual studies are analyzed in order to ascertain what insights into the trade-employment relation seem generally applicable. At the present time, the second stage of the project is nearing completion. This paper constituted one part of the first stage of the project: it spells out much of the basic methodology that underlies the individual country studies.

165,Rosetak Document 4: Rank Degeneracies and Least Square Problems,"['Gene Golub', 'Virginia Klema', 'G. W. Stewart']",1977-02-01,1977-02-01,,,,,,"

In this paper we shall be concerned with the following problem. Let A be an m x n matrix with m being greater than or equal to n, and suppose that A is near (in a sense to be made precise later) a matrix B whose rank is less than n. Can one find a set of linearly independent columns of A that span a good approximation to the column space of B? The solution of this problem is important in a number of applications. In this paper we shall be chiefly interested in the case where the columns of A represent factors or carriers in a linear model which is to be fit to a vector of observations b. In some such applications, where the elements of A can be specified exactly (e.g. the analysis of variance), the presence of rank degeneracy in A can be dealt with by explicit mathematical formulas and causes no essential difficulties. In other applications, however, the presence of degeneracy is not at all obvious, and the failure to detect it can result in meaningless results or even the catastrophic failure of the numerical algorithms being used to solve the problem. The organization of this paper is the following. In the next section we shall give a precise definition of approximate degeneracy in terms of the singular value decomposition of A. In Section 3 we shall show that under certain conditions there is associated with A a subspace that is insensitive to how it is approximated by various choices of the columns of A, and in Section 4 we shall apply this result to the solution of the least squares problem. Sections 5, 6, and 7 will be concerned with algorithms for selecting a basis for the stable subspace from among the columns of A.

In this paper we intend to survey and suggest the theoretical framework of the important aspects of causality detection with the purpose of conveying to the reader the essential features and the different forms in which inferences may be drawn from given data. Section II presents the basic theorem characterizing the causality events and suggests two feedback detection methods which, like the one suggested by Pierce and Haugh (1977), are based on correlation analysis. In Section III we survey other well-known causality detection methods and try to relate and to compare them with the methods suggested in Section II. Section IV briefly reviews the theoretical controversy of the relationship between money and income and presents some empirical evidence based on the methods discussed in this paper. Conclusions are in Section V.

168,Wage Differentials Are Larger Than You Think,['Edward P. Lazear'],1977-03-01,1977-03-01,,,,,,"

This paper will employ a method (devised in Lazear [1976] ) to estimate the unobserved component of wages. The size of this component will be calculated for non-whites and whites separately and then compared. Since, as it turns out, the component is larger for whites than non-whites, observed wage differentials understate true differentials. Furthermore, comparison of the period between1966-1969 with the 1972-1974 period reveals that this unobserved differential increased substantially over time. The results of this study suggest that although the pecuniary non-white -- white differential has narrowed substantially between 1966 and 1974 for young men, the on-the-job training differential has increased by almost the exact same amount. This implies that in real wealth terms there has not been any narrowing of the differential at all. This will become more apparent in later years as those non-whites who were hired into skilled jobs today fail to be promoted or obtain higher paying jobs elsewhere at the same rate as their white counterparts.

We introduce a modification of Broyden's method for finding a zero of n nonlinear equations in n unknowns when analytic derivatives are not available. The method retains the local Q-superlinear convergence of Broyden's method and has the additional property that if any or all of the equations are linear, it locates a zero of these equations in n+1 or fewer iterations. Limited computational experience suggests that our modification often improves upon Eroyden's method.

170,The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use  And of Ordinal Marginal Utility,['J. Huston McCulloch'],1977-03-01,1977-03-01,,,,,,"

The Austrian theory of the ""marginal use"" is restated and extended. It is found that the Austrian concept of marginal utility (as derived from the marginal use) is not dependent on cardinal utility, and indeed is consistent with ""intrinsically ordinal"" utility. In this system, diminishing (ordinal) marginal utility is an implication of rational choice, rather than an assumption. Examples of the rank-ordering on commodity space, derived from the underlying rank ordering on want-set space in conjunction with the technological relationship between goods and wants, are given in the cases of independent, rival, and complementary goods. In each case the derived commodity preferences are quasi-concave, which suggests that the Hicksian assumption of quasi-concavity is superfluous. In each case, the Auspitz and Lieben-Edgeworth-Pareto criterion for net complementarity or rivalness emerges. It is shown that while a negative cross substitution elasticity is not a necessary condition for net complementarity, it is a sufficient condition under not very restrictive conditions.

171,The Effect of Minimum Wage Legislation on Income Equality: A TheoreticalAnalysis,['J. Huston McCulloch'],1977-03-01,1977-03-01,,,,,,"

Minimum wage legislation is frequently advocated in the belief that itcreates a more nearly equal distribution of income. A one-sector model of general equilibrium is used to analyze a universally applicable minimum wage, and a two-sector model is used to analyze a minimum wage that is only applied to certain industries. In both cases we find that a minimum wage may well lower equality (as computed by the Gini index) if we consider reasonable values for the parameters of these two models. In the absence of unemployment compensation, equality can increase only if the elasticity of substitution in production is quite low. In the one-sector case, however, equality necessarily rises if unemployment compensation is present and sufficiently generous.

172,Sample Selection Bias As a Specification Error (with an Application to the Estimation of Labor Supply Functions),['James J. Heckman'],1977-03-01,1977-03-01,,,,,,"

In this paper, I present a simple characterization of the sample selection bias problem that is also applicable to the conceptually distinct econometric problems that arise from truncated samples and from models with limited dependent variables. The problem of sample selection bias is fit within the conventional specification error framework of Griliches and Theil. A simple estimator is discussed that enables analysts to utilize ordinary regression methods to estimate models free of selection bias. The techniques discussed here are applied to re-estimate and test a model of female labor supply developed by the author. (1974). This paper is in three parts. In the first section, selection bias is presented within the specification error framework. In this section, general distributional assumptions are maintained. In section two, specific results are presented for the case of normal regression disturbances. Simple estimators are proposed and discussed. In the third section, empirical results are presented.

174,Educational Screening and Occupational Earnings,"['Edward N. Wolff', 'Joel Hay']",1977-04-01,1977-04-01,,,,,,"

The educational screening hypothesis states that beyond a certain point schooling functions as a signaling device to identify pre-existing talents. We test for the presence of screening by comparing the schooling and earnings of self-employed workers and of those employed by others in a sample set of occupations. We expect those employed by others to pursue additional schooling to signal prospective employers. We expect self-employed managers to acquire no additional schooling for signaling purposes. We expect other self-employed workers to obtain additional schooling to signal potential customers. Our empirical results, based on 1970 Census data, strongly support the case for screening. However, the relative magnitude of the screening portion of schooling is relatively modest, lying between approximately 5 and 10 percent.

This paper derives an estimation procedure which, when the same distributed lag appears twice in an equation to be estimated by least-squares regression, identifies all of the relevant coefficients and lag weights and also constrains the two sets of individual lag weights to be identical. The procedure for solving this identification-constraint problem involves prior imposition of a restriction on the lag weight sum -- i.e., it is necessary to impose the sum restriction before estimating the equation. A further useful feature of the derived procedure is that it facilitates conveniently imposing the sum restriction on all of the weights in a distributed lag even if the leading weight is independent of a polynomial restriction imposed on the others.

181,Price Behavior in the Light of Balance of Payments Theories,"['Irving B. Kravis', 'Robert E. Lipsey']",1977-06-01,1977-06-01,,,,,,"

The purpose of this paper is to describe the behavior of that subset of prices and price indexes that is relevant to the theory of balance of payments adjustment. The theoretical writings on the balance of payments may be viewed at this juncture as falling into two main groups -- the ""standard"" theories and the more recent monetary theories. Each of these is examined to determine the assumptions and predictions made about particular kinds of prices, and the empirical evidence regarding these prices is then set out. Although some assessment of the theories -- solely from the price aspect -- is offered, the emphasis is on the price structure and price behavior that ought to be captured in a satisfactory theory of the mechanisms of international adjustment. For pragmatic reasons, attention is placed mainly on the theory relating to exchange rate changes rather than on the explanation of adjustment with fixed exchange rates.

The present paper is intended to make a modest contribution to an under-standing of one small but important link in this complicated chain of interacting factors. It is a link that has often been ignored because strong simplifying assumptions have until very recently usually been made about it. We refer to the relation of exchange rate changes, export prices, and domestic prices. During the last few years a number of attempts have been made to examine the extent to which exchange rate changes were ""passed through""; that is, the extent to which a given depreciation in the U.S. dollar, for example, resulted in a corresponding decline in the price of U.S. exports in foreign currencies. However, the possibility that a change in the exchange rate might also alter the relationship between the export price and the domestic price of a given product, expressed in the same currency, has been almost completely ignored. The assumption made, implicitly by most past writers in the theory of international trade and more recently explicitly by advocates of the monetary approach to the balance of payments, has been that the ""law of one price"" applies to shipments destined for home markets and for foreign markets.

Section III applies this analysis to the value placed on time a1 located to the non-market sector, the effect of hours worked on fatigue and earnings, life cycle variations-in earnings and hours worked, investment in health, and the effect of marriage on the earnings and health of men and women. Section IV considers worker effort from the view point of firms, and shows how various characteristics of firms determine the wage rates offered and the effort supplied by their workers.

This paper discusses how private pension programs differ from public social security in their likely impact on aggregate saving. Although private pensions are likely to reduce direct saving by employees, this should be offset by the combination of companies' partial funding and the shareholders response to unfunded liabilities. In contrast to several earlier empirical studies that implied that social security does depress national saving, the current time series evidence suggests that the growth of private pensions has not had an adverse effect on saving and may have increased saving by a small amount.

This is the third of a sequence of papers on international flows of trade among fifteen Pacific Basin (PB) countries and between them and eleven regions in the Rest of the World (ROW). In Part I of the sequence (Hickman, Kuroda and Lau, 1977a) we presented and documented annual data on bilateral flows of total exports valued f.o.b. in current dollars among the twenty-six countries and regions for the years 1948 through1975. The primary data source is the Direction of Trade computer tape of the International Monetary Fund, but these data were supplemented from other sources, especially as regards the international trade of the socialist countries. The second report (1977b) extended the data base to include unit value export price indexes and the corresponding constant dollar trade flow matrices for the period 1955-1975. In this third report we analyze the changing pattern of PB trade over the same period, using as tools export growth decomposition indexes, trend analysis, and regression analysis of the price elasticity of import market shares. The present paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the trends in the export performance of the PB countries and ROW regions, as measured by the cumulative percentage change in each country's share of world exports between 1955 and 1975 and for selected sub periods. In Section 3 and Appendices B and C these export share changes are decomposed into three sources: changes in the degree of penetration of the various import markets, changes in the size of the import markets themselves, and an interaction effect. The decomposition indexes are shown in Section 4 to be dominated by the market penetration or competitiveness effect, so that a country gains or loses in world trade according to whether or not it can increase its shares of the markets in which it sells rather than as a passive result of changes in the size of the markets themselves. This leads to a descriptive analysis in Section 5 of the secular growth rates of the market shares of each country or region in the import markets of the twenty-five remaining countries and regions. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6 with art exploratory regression analysis of the responsiveness of the market shares to changes in the relative prices of the various exporting countries competing in each import market, leading to the general conclusion that relative prices do matter and presenting estimates of share or substitution elasticities in the various import markets.

193,The Optimal Taxation of Foreign Source Investment Income,"['Martin Feldstein', 'David G. Hartman']",1980-11-01,1980-11-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

Our paper begins with the relatively simple problem of optimal taxation as viewed by the capital-exporting (""home"") country when it can assume that its actions do not alter the tax rate in the host country. Section I also shows that when foreign investment accounts for a significant fraction of production in the host country, the capital-exporting country should tax foreign source investment income more heavily than is implied by the ""full taxation after deduction"" rule. The important question of tax rate interdependence is developed in Section II. In the third section we replace the assumption that all foreign investment is financed by a transfer of equity capital from the home country with the more realistic description that subsidiary firms borrow in the host country. Although this raises the profitability to the home country of investment by its foreign subsidiaries, we show that this need not alter the conclusions of the previous sections. We regard the present paper as only a first step in a proper analysis of the complex issue of optimal taxation of foreign source investment income. . The static analysis of the present paper should be extended to consider investment paths in growing economics. Finally, the purely nationalistic optimality criterion could be generalized to give some weight to the real income of the rest of the world.

This article continues the work on the analysis of the individual's decision to migrate, but differs from the previous studies by focusing on the relationship between job mobility and migration. First, the proportion of geographic mobility that occurs in conjunction with a job change is calculated. Second, it is shown that the true effects of human capital variables, job characteristics, and family variables on the decision to migrate are best measured when one takes account of the relationship between migration and job mobility. Third, the effect of migration on the wage gains of individuals is studied and again the need for distinguishing among moves that were associated with quits, layoffs, and transfers is clearly shown. Finally, by using three data sets that encompass different age groups (the National Longitudinal Surveys [NLS] of Young and Mature Men and the Coleman-Rossi Retrospective Life History Study), the importance of the relationship between migration and job mobility is demonstrated at different points in the life cycle.

Hopefully, the paper provides material for a missing chapter on family economics as well as an addition to the economics of labor supply arid of human capital formation.

200,Share-Tenancy and Family Size in the Brazilian Northeast,['Anna L. Ozorio de Alneida'],1977-08-01,1977-08-01,,,,,,"

In this paper it is proposed that high rural fertility in Latin America is a deliberate and rational adjustment to the conditions of agricultural production that prevail in many areas of the continent. The main finding is that share tenancy, the predominant form of organization of production in the sparsely populated central regions of the Northeast, and a common institution in much of Latin America, contains a set of powerful fertility inducements which are lost when households face a wage-labor situation in agriculture or in cities. Thus, the rapid decline of rural fertility in the past decade in Latin America may be due, in part, to the general demise of share tenancy and its replacement by sub-family farms (minifundios) dependent on wage labor. These broad implications are discussed in the final section of the paper.

It attributes the recent increase in divorce to improved contraceptive technology, reduced average duration of marriage (resulting from the age distribution of the population) and income growth. Projections suggest a flattening of the divorce rate series in the near future.

Given that application of the principle with full loss offset to all assets is impracticable, we may wish to consider provision of only a partial inflation-exclusion to assets for which it is feasible. The problem is examined in this paper by means of a simple model of anticipated inflation, in which individuals may invest either in assets for which full or partial inflation-exclusion is provided, or in cash, for which no loss offset is allowed. Among other issues, we shall examine the short and long run effects of taxation and of the provision of an inflation deduction on the rate of inflation and on the level of savings. We do not discuss the long-run optimum tax and deduction rates, because it turns out that for a given tax revenue, these instruments are perfect substitutes, i.e. their relative size does not affect the equilibrium configuration.

205,Structural Models of Interest Rate Determination and Portfolio Behavior in the Corporate and Government Bond Markets,"['Benjamin M. Friedman', 'V. Vance Roley']",1981-01-01,1981-01-01,,,['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper summarizes some recent work in which we have modeled long-term interest rate determination in an explicit demand-supply context, using multi-equation structural models and directly contrasts such models with unrestricted reduced-form models. Wholly apart from questions of disaggregation and institutional detail, the explicitly structural nature of demand-supply models necessitates additional theoretical constructs beyond those required by unrestricted reduced-form models. Some of these conceptual inputs are already available from established portfolio theory, and others represent objects of current or prospective research. Experience to date with structural models of long-term interest rate determination suggests, however, that the exploitation of the richer theoretical framework yields not only insights about portfolio behavior but, very likely, improved interest rate models as well.

207,Local Government Budgeting: The Econometric Comparison of Political and Bureaucratic Models,"['Martin Feldstein', 'Daniel J. Frisch']",1977-10-01,1977-10-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

The current paper presents a method of deciding the question of whether any given stage in the budget process is an example of the ""political"" or the ""bureaucratic"" model. We then use it to study local government spending on education. The basis for our method is the important difference between the effect of intergovernmental aid that is implied by the political budget model and by the bureaucratic budget model. According to the bureaucratic model, the effect of inter-governmental aid on each category of educational input (e.g., teachers' salaries, books, etc.) depends only on the change in total educational spending induced by the aid and not on the type of aid that causes the change in spending. In contrast, the political budget model implies that the overall expenditure increase is the result of separate decisions on each of the expenditure categories and that the changes in these expenditure categories will depend on the form of the intergovernmental aid. Our method of exploiting this difference is presented in detail below.

Although many economists, most notably Strotz, have discussed dynamic inconsistency and precommitment, none have dealt directly with the essence of the problem: self-control. This paper attempts to fill that gap by modeling man as an organization. The Strotz model is recast to include the control features missing in his formulation. The organizational analogy permits us to draw on the theory of agency. We thus relate the individual's control problems with those that exist in agency relationships.

This paper provides a formal setting for the analysis of the capital adequacy of an institution with deposits insured by a third party. An insured depositor has a claim against the institution and a contingent claim against the insurer. This paper analyzes the effect of the riskiness of the asset mix and the relative amount of deposits and capital on the potential liability of the insurer. It shows that an increase in asset risk, holding value constant, increases the value of equity and raises the potential liability of the insurer.

The distribution of wealth is one of the most important and least studied features of our economic life. A lack of good data on household wealth is the primary reason for the inadequate attention to this subject. Moreover, the evidence that is available from household surveys and estate records excludes the most important asset of the vast majority of households: the value of future social security benefits. The purpose of the current paper is to present evidence on the distribution of social security wealth and to use these estimates to analyze the impact of alternative methods of adjusting future benefits for changes in the price level.

The object of this paper is to examine the importance of capital market assumptions. A special continuous-time model is developed in sections II-IV which is applicable to the perfect capital market case. It can also be used when there is no capital market at all (section IV). For 'reasonable' parameter values the optimal replacement rate (ratio of benefits to gross wage) appears to be less than 20% when capital markets are perfect but over 70% when they are non existent (i.e. no saving or dis-saving).

In this paper we analyze the choice of diet for young children in low income families in the United States and its relation to the children's growth. Our most important finding is that the education and income levels in low income households are generally sufficient for the provision of adequate diets for children in the household. This conclusion is based on empirical results which show that low income parents have pushed the growth of their children through choice of diet nearly as much as possible, and which also show that mother's education and family income are insignificant determinants of the nutrient intakes of children in low income households.

This paper attempts to measure the effect of occupational licensing, restrictions on reciprocity, location specific investment in reputation and earnings on the interstate mobility of professionals. While 34 professional occupations are analyzed, special attention is focused on the legal profession. The comparatively low interstate mobility rate of lawyers may be due to state licensing and restrictions on reciprocity or to the investments made by lawyers to develop local reputations or to the investments made by lawyers in state specific law. Tests are conducted to distinguish among these three hypotheses.

This paper extends the analysis of aggregate factor supply to a model which accounts simultaneously for the consumption/saving and labor/leisure choices. A translog utility maximization model is used to derive the set of consumption and leisure demand equations; these in turn are estimated on U.S. aggregate time series data. The empirical results are striking: we estimate (quite precisely) substantial own and cross price elasticities for current and future consumption and labor supply. The implied interest elasticity of saving is approximately 0.4.The results suggest that previous studies of labor supply and/or consumption which have ignored cross-price effects are mis-specified. We also strongly reject the hypothesis that implicit social security had no effect on factor supply.

222,The Cumulative Unanticipated Change in Interest Rates: Evidence on the Misintermediation Hypothesis,['J. Huston McCulloch'],1977-12-01,1977-12-01,,,,,,"

The term structure of interest rates is carefully analyzed over the period 1947-77 in order to construct a monthly series on cumulative unanticipated changes in long-term interest rates. This series is a sort of synthetic interest rate, changes in which over several months or years represent entirely unanticipated changes in interest rates. The behavior of this series is examined over recognized business fluctuations, and it is found to be actually more reliably pro-cyclic than the raw long-term interest rate, in spite of Kessel's finding that the market tends to correctly predict the direction of change of interest rates over phases. That the series is pro-cyclic supports the hypothesis we have put forward in another paper, that business fluctuations may be caused by ""misintermediation"", by which we mean the traditional mis-matching of asset and liability maturities on the part of financial intermediaries.

223,The Private and Social Costs of Unemployment,['Martin Feldstein'],1977-12-01,1977-12-01,,,,,,"

This short note emphasizes and illustrates two basic points: (1) The private costs of unemployment, i.e., the costs borne by the unemployed themselves, vary substantially and are often extremely low. This low private cost is an important cause of the permanently high unemployment rate in the United States. (2) The social costs of unemployment, i.e., the costs of unemployment to the nation as a whole regardless of how they are distributed, must be judged by considering the specific policy by which a worker would be reemployed. It is wrong to regard unemployment as either without cost (because the unemployed enjoy the opportunity for job search and leisure) or as having a cost equal to lost output. Examples are given to show that output may overstate or understate true social cost, depending on the options available for reemployment.

This paper studies the wage determination process for a group of managerial employees in a major U.S. airline. As would be expected, those with greater-than-average schooling, pre-company labor market experience, and company service receive greater-than-average earnings. The analysis also addresses the question of whether or not the managers within a grade level who are paid more receive higher performance ratings by their supervisors. The answer is ""no"" in the case of those with more pre-company labor market experience (i.e., those who are older) and with more company service. This suggests that the salaries received by managers within a grade reflect their age and tenure with the company more than their present performance.

226,Fluctuation in Equilibrium Unemployment,['Robert E. Hall'],1977-12-01,1977-12-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Fluctuations in the equilibrium rate of unemployment can only be understood within a theory of the natural or equilibrium rate. It is not enough to say that unemployment is the difference between supply and demand in the labor market, though of course it always will be. In equilibrium, no participants in the market can have an unexploited opportunity to make themselves better off. At the equilibrium unemployment rate, employers cannot obtain labor at lower cost by offering work at below the market wage to the unemployed. Unemployed workers cannot raise their effective real incomes by taking lower wages in exchange for immediate employment. The task of the theory is to explain why any unemployment remains at all when these conditions are satisfied. Part of this problem has been studied in detail in the ""search theory"" of unemployment -- once a worker becomes unemployed, it is reasonably well understood why the worker does not become employed again immediately. The theory of why people become unemployed in the first place is less well developed and is the main concern of this paper. Most of the unemployed are looking for new work because their previous jobs ran out. Consequently, the main ingredient of a theory of the flow of workers into unemployment is a theory of the duration of employment. Such a theory is developed here, along reasonably standard lines.

This paper uses economic analysis to illuminate a variety of legal rules relating to rescue, a term we use broadly to describe any attempt to save a person or property from some peril. We first develop a model of a competitive market in rescues, as a benchmark for judging whether the legal rules of rescue can be viewed as attempts to simulate the operation of a competitive market in rescues. The model explicitly incorporates the possibility of rescues motivated by altruism. We then apply the model to a variety of legal settings in which rescue questions arise. We show that the well-developed body of rules governing rescue at sea (including the principles governing salvage awards and the rule of general average) are consistent with the economic model of professional (nonaltruistic) rescue and appropriate in the maritime setting. The rules of the common law governing rescues on land the physician who treats a passerby in distress) are also examined, and found to be in the main consistent with our economic model when altruism is taken into account, as are the differences between the maritime and common law rules. We then examine the choice between compensation and liability as methods of inducing rescue, and show that the common law's decision not to impose liability for failure to rescue (the ""Good Samaritan"" rule) may be consistent with efficiency because of the ""tax"" effects of such liability. We concluded that the array of legal rules and doctrines examined provide support for the hypothesis that the common law (including traditional maritime law) has been heavily influenced by a concern with achieving efficient allocation of resources.

Although the return to capital is a focus of research in both macroeconomics and public finance, each specialty has approached this subject with an almost total disregard for the other's contribution. Macroeconomic studies of the effect of inflation on the rate of interest have implicitly ignored the existence of taxes and the problems of tax depreciation. Similarly, empirical studies of the incidence of corporate tax changes have not recognized that the effect of the tax depends on the rate of inflation and have ignored the information on the rate of return that investors receive in financial  markets. Our primary purpose in this paper is to begin to build a bridge between these two approaches to a common empirical problem.

234,Inflation and the Excess Taxation of Capital Gains on Corporate Stock,"['Martin Feldstein', 'Joel Slemrod']",1978-02-01,1978-02-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

The present study shows that in 1973 individuals paid nearly $500 million of extra tax on corporate stock capital gains because of the distorting effect of inflation. A detailed analysis shows that the distortion was greatest for middle income sellers of corporate stock. In 1973, individuals paid capital gains tax on more than $4.5 billion of nominal capital gains on corporate stock. If the costs of these shares are adjusted for the increases in the consumer price level since they were purchased, the $4.5 billion nominal gain becomes a real capital loss of nearly $1 billion. As a result of this incorrect measurement of capital gains, individuals with similar real capital gains were subject to very different total tax liabilities. These findings are based on a new body of official tax return data on individual sales of corporate stock.

235,"Price Inflation, Portfolio Choice, and Nominal Interest Rates",['Benjamin M. Friedman'],1978-03-01,1978-03-01,,,['Monetary Economics'],,,"

Among the different kinds of economic behavior which may account for the familiar Fisherian relationship between nominal interest rates and expected price inflation, portfolio behavior is the most plausibly flexible in the short run. Since substitution into real assets is not a practical portfolio alternative for many investors, however, it is not obvious a priori how important lenders' portfolio behavior can be in bringing about the adjustment of interest rates which Fisher's theory associates with expected inflation. Given the importance of this adjustment for questions of both monetary theory and monetary policy, the underlying economic behavior merits explicit investigation. The empirical results presented in this paper provide evidence that lenders' portfolio behavior does play an important role in the expected-price-inflation/nominal-interest rate relationship. First, results indicate that five of the six major categories of investors in the U.S. long-term bond market reduce their demands for bonds in response to an increase in expected inflation. Secondly, the results of multi-equation partial-equilibrium experiments indicate that ,with all other things unchanged, this response by investors will raise the equilibrium nominal bond yield by about 2/3% in response to a 1% increase in expected inflation.

Traditionally, banks and financial intermediaries borrow short and lend long. This causes a risk of negative net worth (and failure, under simplifying assumptions), because the present discounted value of the assets is more volatile than that of the liabilities. This paper utilizes a new option pricing model for speculative assets whose log price relative is a symmetric stable Paretian random variable. This model is used to empirically evaluate the probability of failure and fair value of deposit insurance as a function of capital-asset ratio for a bank with demand liabilities and longer term, default-risk-free, perfectly marketable assets. The maturities used for the assets range from three months to 30 years (in order to incorporate thrift institutions). Implications for reserve requirement policy and for liability management are discussed.

Substantial shifts in wealth ownership from individuals to pension funds are currently taking place in the United States and also are in prospect for the foreseeable future. Moreover, pension funds typically exhibit portfolio preferences that are markedly different from those of individuals. In a world of heterogeneous investors, redistributions among wealth holders with different portfolio preferences will in general alter the structure of asset yields. Partial-equilibrium simulation experiments based on a model of the U. S. long-term bond market indicate that redistributions of saving flows from individuals to pension funds, in plausible magnitudes, can have major effects on the term structure of interest rates.

Extending the traditional treatment of the corporate tax to an economy with a progressive personal tax fundamentally changes the analysis. While the corporate tax system (CTS) does increase the total tax rate on corporate source income for some investors, the exclusion of retained earnings implies that the CTS lowers the tax rate for high-income investors. Analyzing such an economy requires replacing the traditional ""equal-yield"" equilibrium condition with a more general portfolio balance model. In this model, introducing a CTS can actually increase the corporate share of the capital stock even though the relative tax rate on corporate income rises.

It is argued that the grievance system plays a major role in the reduction in exit and that the reduction lowers cost and raises productivity.

Illustrative calculations of the distortions of financial policy and increases in risk premiums induced by the corporate tax are provided.

245,The Propagation of Prices in the Oil Industry,['Avram Kisselgoff'],1978-05-01,1978-05-01,,,,,,"

The main thrust of this report is the development of a price record that would provide a basis for the identification of the areas of activity in the oil industry in which significant price changes have occurred, with expectation that this type of information could serve as a useful ingredient in the policy-making process. The study presents estimates of the selling price of a barrel of oil at three stages of operations of the industry -- the wellhead, the refinery and the end-use levels. Prices of individual classes of petroleum products at refineries and at the end-use level were also estimated. The price data are provided for benchmark years 1958, 1963,1967 and 1972, as well as for 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976 when crude oil prices rose considerably. The estimating procedure is briefly described in the study. The examination of the transmission of prices from market to market within the oil industry shows that the steep rise in 1973-74 prices paid by end-users of petroleum products was due not only to the large increases in crude oil prices but also to the sizable in-creases in gross operating margins-labor costs, transportation, profits, etc. -- at the refinery and distribution levels. In the post-embargo years of 1975 and 1976, prices continued to advance but at a slower pace. The refiners' gross margins in 1975, however, declined somewhat; they rose significantly above the 1974 level in1976. The marketers' margins made further gains in 1975, but exhibited a decrease in 1976. Another finding is that during 1973-74 there was a considerable narrowing in the price differentials among the various re-fined products; in particular the price of residual fuel oil, which averaged 20 percent of the price of gasoline in the decade of the 1960's,rose to 52 percent of the price of gasoline by 1974. The narrowing process continued in 1975-1976.The study includes a short discussion of the effects of rising oil prices in 1973-1976 on the profitability of the petroleum industry and the general price level.

This study examines the effect of trade unionism on the dispersion of wages among male wage and salary workers in the private sector in the United States. It finds that the application of union wage policies designed to standardize rates within and across establishments significantly reduces wage dispersion among workers covered by union contracts and that unions further reduce wage dispersion by narrowing the white-collar/blue-collar differential within establishments. These effects dominate the more widely studied impact of unionism on the dispersion of average wages across industries, so that on net unionism appears to reduce rather than increase wage dispersion or inequality in the United States.

Positive selection in both groups implies no ""ability bias in these data.

251,A Theory of the Natural Unemployment Rate and the Duration of Employment,['Robert E. Hall'],1978-07-01,1978-07-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

In this paper, a theory of the natural or equilibrium rate of unemployment is built around a theory of the duration of employment. Evidence is presented that most unemployed workers became unemployed because their previous jobs came to an end; only a minority are on temporary layoff or have just entered the labor force. Thus, high-unemployment labor markets are generally ones where jobs are brief and there is a large flow of newly jobless workers. The model of the duration of employment posits that employment arrangements are the efficient outcome of the balancing of workers' and employers' interests about the length of jobs. Full equilibrium in the labor market also requires that the rate at which unemployed workers find new jobs be efficient. The factors influencing the resulting natural unemployment rate are discussed. Under plausible assumptions, the natural rate is independent of the supply or demand for labor. Only the costs of recruiting, the costs of turnover to employers, the efficiency of matching jobs and workers, and the cost of unemployment to workers are likely to influence the natural rate of unemployment strongly. Since these are probably stable over time, the paper concludes that fluctuations in the natural unemployment rate are unlikely to contribute much to fluctuations in the observed unemployment rate.

Problems of defining and measuring unemployemnt in the contemporary American economy are examined here using data from the official employment survey. The paper finds that only a minority of the unemployed conform to the conventional picture of a worker who has lost one job and is looking f or another job. Other important categories are those who have jobs but are not at work because the jobs have not yet started or because of layoff, workers who are in normal spells between temporary jobs, people who are looking into the possibility of work as an alternative to household duties, school, or retirement, and people who have come back into the labor force. None of these categories is dominant. One of the most significant findings is the large number of the unemployed (close to a million in 1977) who are looking for temporary work. Another important finding is that only a minority of the unemployed are looking for work as their major activity during the week of the survey. The majority of those classified officially as unemployed are identified by the household as keeping house, going to school, or retired.

Given the current corporate tax structure in the U.S., inflation may have an important impact on the production decisions of firms, notably the choice of capital durability. This paper presents a model of competitive behavior in which firms may choose the durability of their capital goods. We find that in the presence of inflation, the taxation of corporate profits may influence both the choice of asset life and the market value of equity. In particular, the failure to index depreciation allowances depresses share values and biases the choice of asset life toward greater durability. Integrating this analysis with the traditional one-sector monetary growth model, we study the general equilibrium impact of inflation on such long run characteristics of the economy as output per capita and the real rate of return received by investors.

Our results indicate that a tax structure similar to that in existence in the United States influences the cost of capital in a very different way than has been assumed previously and that the relative advantages of debt over equity as a method of finance, and capital gains over dividends as a vehicle for personal realization of corporate profits, may have been greatly overstated. These findings may help to explain certain aspects of corporate financial behavior that have seemed puzzling.

In recent years many contributions have appeared which examine the effects of corporate and personal taxation on firm financial policy. However, there has yet to appear an adequate explanation of why corporations continue to distribute dividends despite their disadvantageous tax treatment. We study this problem anew, in the context of an overlapping generations growth model with corporations financed by equity. Among our findings are: (1) capital owned by corporations may well be undervalued, even in the long run; (2) as a result of such undervaluation, firms may find it in the best interest of their stockholders to distribute dividends; and (3) an increase in the tax on distributions, while depressing the return to personal saving, may lead to an increase in the capital intensity of the economy. We also consider the criterion firms will use in evaluating new investment projects.

The objective of this paper is to define the relationship between a number of family characteristics and the health of white children aged 6 to 11 years residing in those families. The partial effects of family income on health are1l and seldom statistically significant. Indeed, some health problems -- high blood pressure, allergies, and tension -- are more likely to occur among children from high income families. The general finding of small partial income effects is supported by analysis of gross health differences between children from lower and higher income families. In those cases where significant gross health difference. do exist between children from these two income classes, decomposition of these gross differences shows them to be attributable in large part to factors other than income itself. The finding that differences in health related solely to income are smaller than commonly believed implies that policies to improve the well-being of children via income transfers, such as those advocated by the recent Carnegie Council on Children, would have, at best, very small effects on health. Indeed, the most important conclusion of our study is that the present tendency to base government child health programs on simplistic notions that income is the primary source of differences in children's health will not lead towards fruitful or successful public policy regarding children's health.

The ""lock-in"" effect is detectable once we divide individuals into categories on the basis of how much recent capital gains tax in- creases have affected them. Since the tax law changes, those individeals who are affected have realized significantly ldss capital gains relative to those not affected. This analysis, in `ddition to evidence fpom cross-sectional research reported in Feldstein and Yitzhaki (1978) and Feldstein, Slemrod and Qitzhaki (1978),indicates that estimates of the tax revenue change resulting from a reduction in capital gains taxation based on the assumption of unchanged realized gains may be misleading.

The relative magnitudes of the inventory and production responses have important implications for the overall cyclical behavior of the economy. Government policies that affect the costs of holding inventories and the costs of the temporary layoffs that accompany reductions in the level of output can therefore have significant effects on the magnitude of aggregate fluctuations. The current paper presents new econometric evidence on the nature of inventory adjustments and then examines how changes in inventory behavior affect the overall business cycle. The analysis in this paper was motivated by our discovery that the parameter estimates of the traditional productional adjustment model are not consistent with the observed magnitudes of inventory change and the production. We have shown here that this production adjustment model is a special case of a more general two-speed adjustment process in which both production and inventory targets adjust slowly. Our estimates of the two-speed model clearly reject the production adjustment model in favor of the target adjustment model in which the inventory target adjusts slowly to changes in sales but production adjusts rapidly to changes in the desired inventory. Our analysis of the spectral properties of a simple macroeconomic model show that the production adjustment model and the target adjustment model can imply quite different cyclical behavior of the economy as a whole. Depending on the autocorrelation of the disturbance, government policies that reduce the speed with which production responds to changes in desired inventories and that place greater reliance on inventory adjustment may stabilize national income. Further analysis of these questions with more realistic models would clearly be desirable.

261,Survey Evidence on The Rationality of Interest Rate Expectations,['Benjamin M. Friedman'],1980-12-01,1980-12-01,,,['Monetary Economics'],,,"

An analysis of predictions of six interest rates over 3-months-ahead and 6-months-aheadhorizons, surveyed regularly over eight years, casts doubt on the hypothesis that market participants' expectations are 'rational' in Muth's sense. Tests show that the survey respondents did not make unbiased predictions, that (especially for the 6-months-ahead predictions) they did not efficiently exploit the information contained in past interest rate movements, that their respective 3-months-ahead and 6-months-ahead predictions failed to be consistent in the sense required for 'rationality', and that (for long-term but not short-term interest rates) their predictions failed to exploit efficiently the information contained in common macroeconomic and macro-policy variables other than the money stock.

263,Adjudication as a Private Good,"['William M. Landes', 'Richard A. Posner']",1978-07-01,1978-07-01,,,['Law and Economics'],,,"

This paper examines the question whether adjudication can be viewed as a private good, i.e., one whose optimal level will be generated in a free market. Part I focuses on private courts, noting their limitations as institutions for dispute resolution and rule creation but also stressing the important role that the private court, in its various manifestations, has played both historically and today. Part II discusses a recent literature which has argued that the rules generated in the public court system, in areas of the law where the parties to litigation are private individuals or firms and the rules of law are judge-made, are the efficient products of purely private inputs. Our analysis suggests that this literature has overstated the tendency of a common law system to produce efficient rules, although areas can be identified where such a tendency can indeed be predicted on economic grounds. Viewed as a contribution to the emergent literature on the positive economic theory of law, our finding that the public courts do not automatically generate efficient rules is disappointing, since it leaves unexplained the mechanisms by which such rules emerge as they seem to have done in a number of the areas of Anglo-American judge-made law. However, our other major finding, that the practices and law governing private adjudication appear to be strongly influenced by economic considerations and explicable in economic terms, is evidence that economic theory has a major role to play in explaining fundamental features of the legal system.

266,Interest Rate Risk and the Regulation of Financial Institutions,"['Jay B. Morrison', 'David H. Pyle']",1978-07-01,1978-07-01,,,['Corporate Finance'],,,"

A bank or other financial institution is potentially subject to at least four types of risk: (1) Credit risk -- defaults or delays in repayments. (2) Fraud -- embezzlement or insider abuse. (3) Liquidity risk -- or high cost of obtaining needed cash. (4) Interest rate risk -- differential changes in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates shift. This paper reports a study of the interest-rate elasticity of the net worth of a commercial bank. Most of the study is devoted to the development of the necessary methodology to measure the interest-rate elasticity (IRE) of a bank's asset/liability mix. The report is organized into four major sections. The first summarizes the history of interest-rate elasticity models and points out the problems in applying them to bank assets and liabilities. An analytical framework is then developed to calculate the IRE of a portfolio of assets and liabilities. The next three sections apply the framework to a simulated bank. For simplicity, the bank is assumed to have only two classes of assets (commercial loans and cash) and three classes of liabilities(demand deposits, large denomination CD's, and capital). The second section develops models of the cash flows associated with each of the assets and liabilities. The third section quantifies the parameters necessary to calculate the net worth and IRE measures, and the fourth section details the design of a simulation and some simulation results for the 1973-75 period. The report concludes with a discussion of the regulatory implications of the study.

267,Interest Rate Changes and Commercial Bank Revenues and Costs,"['Sherman J. Maisel', 'Robert Jacobson']",1978-07-01,1978-07-01,,,,,,"

This paper estimates statistical cost. and revenue curves for a cross-section of banks in the years 1962-75. The primary data cover reported accounting or book rates of return. Approximations are also made to estimate economic or total returns. These approximations take into account changes in capital values during the year as a result of movements in interest rates measured by market yields of government securities of the proper duration. Book rates of return and costs adjust towards each other so that marginal rates received or paid for different activities tend to equalize. On the other hand, the rates of adjustment are slow. While movements in the cost of demand and time deposits correlate well with changes in market rates, not all of the advantages of interest rate ceilings are given up to depositors. Movements in interest rates cause sharp fluctuations in total returns. These movements are sharp enough so that in several years economic losses occurred rather than reported book profits. Furthermore, over this period the net economic returns of classes of assets were poorly correlated with their risks (their variance of returns).

268,Calculating the Present Value of An Asset's Future Cash Flows,['Stephen D. Nadauld'],1978-07-01,1978-07-01,,,,,,"

This paper describes both the theory and a computer program designed to calculate the present value of an asset's uncertain future cash flows. In this model expected flows may vary in each of ""t"" future periods. Flows are adjusted to a certainty equivalent by a correction factor derived from a covariance matrix of the flows and market returns. The flows are discounted by a full specification of the term structure of the risk-free interest rate. The specific model illustrated in the paper is that of expected cash flows from a mortgage portfolio. The computer program calculates the expected cash flow, the uncertainty correction, and the term structure of interest rates. Algorithms to solve for each of these factors are included. Alternatively, options are included to input the factors from exogenous forecasts or projections. In addition to calculating the present values under each specification for the factors, the program compares the present values derived from each particular specification.

271,Male Wage Rates and Marital Status,['Lawrence W. Kenny'],1978-07-01,1978-07-01,,,,,,"

Numerous studies have found that married men earn consider-ably more than single men of the same education, experience, etc. There are several possible explanations of this phenomenon. Recent theoretical developments in the economics of marriage predict that males with higher wage rates have a greater gain from marriage and are therefore more likely to marry. Alternatively, one of the benefits of marriage is specialization in the labor force; married men spend more hours in the labor force than single males and thus have a greater incentive to invest in human capital. The empirical work in this paper suggests that a large fraction of the unexplained wage differential between married males and unmarried males may be attributable to the former explanation.

This study presents new estimates of collective bargaining coverage and union membership for detailed U.S. industries. It compares the new coverage and membership figures with each other and with figures derived by researchers for the early 1960's and analyzes the divergences. This analysis leads to three primary conclusions:1) Estimated coverage percentages are on average higher than estimated membership percentages; 2) This relationship is primarily the result of the absence of union security clauses (under which covered employees must at some point become union members); 3) Even among production workers within detailed industries, private sector unionism has been dwindling during the past two decades.

274,The Dynamics of Youth Unemployment,"['Kim B. Clark', 'Lawrence H. Summers']",1978-08-01,1978-08-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper analyzes the dynamics of youth unemployment. Three broad conclusions emerge. First, the problem of youth joblessness extends beyond the unemployed. We find that over one-half of youth unemployment spells end in labor force withdrawal. Much of youth non-employment is not picked up in the official unemployment statistics, because many young people give up the search for work and leave the labor force. Second, a large part of youth unemployment is accounted for by a relatively small, hard core group of young people who experience long spells of unemployment. While most unemployment spells are short, this is due to the high rates of labor force withdrawal, rather than to job finding. Among male teenagers out of school, for example, we find that over half of unemployment was due to those with more than six months of unemployment in the year. Third, a shortage of attractive jobs is the principle source of long term non-employment. While instability and frequent turnover are major factors in determining the overall pattern of teenage unemployment, we find that the lack of desirable employment opportunities is the crux of the problem for those most seriously affected by youth unemployment.

This paper provides new empirical evidence on the effects of the Nixon wage-price controls on the price level. The major new wrinkle is that the controls are treated as a quantitative (rather than just a qualitative) phenomenon through the use of a specially-constructed series indicating the fraction of the economy that was controlled. According to the estimates, by February 1974controls had lowered the non-food non-energy price level by 3-4 percent. After that point, and especially after controls ended in April 1974, a period of rapid 'catch up' inflation eroded the gains that had been achieved, leaving the price level from zero to 2 percent below what it would have been in the absence of controls. The dismantling of controls can thus account for most of the burst of 'double digit' inflation in non-food and non-energy prices during 1974.

280,A Fixed Effect Logit Model of the Impact Of Unionism on Quits,['Richard B. Freeman'],1978-09-01,1978-09-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

There are two possible reasons for unionized workers to have lower quit rates than otherwise comparable nonunion workers: unions could organize employees with innately lower propensities to quit or they could reduce propensities by offering disgruntled workers alternatives to quitting in the form of grievance arbitration and related industrial jurisprudence systems. This paper uses a fixed effect logit model based on the conditional likelihood function to disentangle these two effects. The paper finds that the observed union-quit tradeoff is due largely to the impact of unionism on worker behavior rather than to the propensity of stable workers to be organized, supporting the notion that unions have important nonwage effects along the lines suggested by the ""exit-voice"" model of union activity.

Disequilibrium macroeconomic theory [e.g. Clower, and Barroand Grossman] is extended to deal with capital accumulation in the long run. A growth model a la Kaldor is chosen for a frame-work. The real wage is supposed to be adjusted slowly, therefore there may be excess demand or supply in the labor market. The transaction takes place at the minimum of supply and demand. Since income shares of workers and capitalists depend on which regime the labor market is in, different equations are associated to different regimes. Local stability of the steady state by the disequilibrium dynamics is demonstrated.

284,Crowding Out Or Crowding In? The Economic Consequences of Financing Government Deficits,['Benjamin M. Friedman'],1978-10-01,1978-10-01,,,"['Economic Fluctuations and Growth', 'Monetary Economics']",,,"

The prevailing view of the economic consequences of financing government deficits, as reflected in the recent economics literature and in recent public policy debates, reflects serious misunderstandings. Debt-financed deficits need not ""crowd out"" any private investment, and may even ""crowd in"" some. Using a model including three assets - money, government bonds, and real capital - the analysis in this paper shows that the direction of the portfolio effect of bond issuing on private investment depends on the relative substitutabilities among these three assets in the public's aggregate portfolio. Since the all-important substitutabilities that make the difference between ""crowding out"" and ""crowding in"" are determined in part by the government's choice of debt instrument for financing the deficit, this analysis points to the potential importance of a policy tool that public policy discussion has largely neglected for over a decade - debt management policy. When monetary policy is non-accommodative, within limits debt management policy can take its place in augmenting the potency of fiscal policy, or in improving the trade-off between short-run stimulation and investment for long-run growth.

289,Further Evidence On Expectations And The Demand for Money During the German Hyperinflation,['Jacob A. Frenkel'],1978-10-01,1978-10-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

Probably no event in monetary history has been more studied than the German hyperinflation of the early 1920's. Economists have been attracted to study this episode since it provides an environment that is close to a controlled experiment which is so rare in the study of social sciences. This paper provides further evidence on the role of expectations in effecting the demand for money during the German hyperinflation. One of the difficulties in studying empirically the role of expectations is the lack of an observable variable measuring expectations. This paper examines three measures of expectations that are derived from observed data from the market for foreign exchange. The first measure is based on the hypothesis that the forward exchange rate measures the expected future spot exchange rate and thereby provides an observable measure of the market's expectations concerning the depreciation of the currency. The other two measures distinguish between the forward exchange rate and the expected exchange rate and are based on the supplementary hypothesis that rational behavior requires expectations to be unbiased. Accordingly, the measures of expectations are constructed by using the forward exchange rate along with the information on the systematic relationship between forward and spot exchange rates. The various measures are then used in estimating the demand for money. The emphasis on measures of expectations that are based on data from the foreign exchange markets reflects the belief that in an inflationary economy with flexible exchange rates one of the relevant substitutes for holding domestic money is foreign exchange.

Current views about flexible exchange rate systems are based, to a large extent, on the lessons from the period of the 1920's during which many exchange rates were flexible. This paper re-examines the evidence from the perspective of the recently revived monetary approach (or more generally, asset-market approach) to the exchange rate. The analysis starts by developing a simple monetary model of exchange rate determination. The key characteristic of the model lies in the notion that, being a relative price of two monies, the equilibrium exchange rate is attained when the existing stocks of the two monies are willingly held. The equilibrium exchange rate is shown to depend on both real and monetary factors which operate through their influence on the relative demands and supplies of monies. The analysis then proceeds to examine the relationship between spot and forward rates for the Franc/Pound, Dollar/Pound and Franc/Dollar exchange rates and the results are shown to be consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. The monetary model is then estimated using monthly data and using the forward premium on foreign exchange as a measure of expectations. In addition to the single-equation ordinary-least-squares estimates, the various exchange rates are also estimated as a system using the mixed-estimation procedure which combines the sample information with prior information which derives from the homogeneity postulate and from known properties of the demand for money. The various results are shown to be consistent with the predictions of the monetary model.

It has been alleged that multinational firms fail to adapt their methods of production to take advantage of the abundance and low price of labor in less developed countries and therefore contribute to the unemployment problems of these countries. This paper asks two questions: do multi-national firms adapt to labor cost differences by using more labor-intensive methods of production in LDC's than in developed countries and do multinational firms' affiliates in LDC's use more capital-intensive methods than locally-owned firms? We concluded that both U.S.-based and Swedish-based firms do adapt to differences in labor cost, using the most capital-intensive methods of production at home and the least capital-intensive methods in low-wage countries. Among host countries, the higher the labor cost, the higher the capital intensity of production for manufacturing as a whole, within individual industries, and within individual companies. When we attempted to separate the capital-intensity differences into choice of technology and method of operation within a technology we found that firms appeared to choose capital-intensive technologies in LDC's but then responded to low wage levels there by substituting labor for capital within the technology. Similarly, U.S. affiliates appeared to use technologies similar to those of locally-owned firms but to operate in a more capital-intensive manner mainly because they faced higher labor costs.

The results presented below demonstrate that the structural modeling approach to interest rate determination not only stands apart from the sectoral disaggregation question conceptually but also performs fairly well without sectoral disaggregation empirically. This paper presents estimation and dynamic simulation results for an aggregated equivalent to the disaggregated model of the determination of bond yields developed in Friedman (1977; 1979). Instead of six bond demand and two bond supply equations, here there are but one demand and one supply equation. The empirical results show that, while disaggregation is of value in structural interest rate modeling (that is, the disaggregated model outperforms the aggregated one), even the aggregated structural model performs very well in comparison with familiar unrestricted reduced-form term structure equations.

The object of this paper is to test several familiar hypotheses about the relationship between the forward rates implied by the term structure and interest rate expectations, using the one ongoing systematic survey that samples market participants' expectations. The substitution of survey data for overidentified constructions removes the principal source of ambiguity that has plagued much of the earlier empirical literature of the term structure. Nevertheless, because of limitations in the available data, it is possible to perform these tests only for the very short end of the maturity spectrum. Section I briefly describes the nature of the interest rate expectations survey and the calculation of the forward rate series from observed term structure data. Sections II-V present the results of testing the hypotheses that the implied term premium is zero on average (II), that it varies systematically with interest rate levels (III), that it varies with outside asset supplies (IV), and that it varies with economic activity (V). Section VI summarizes the findings of these tests and discusses their implications

Recent years have seen considerable interest in the integration of the corporate and personal income taxes. Full integration, under which corporate-source income would be taxed only to shareholders, has significant economic advantages, but it suffers from severe practical difficulties. Some but not all of its advantages could be realized through dividend relief. Alternative means of providing dividend relief include a deduction for dividends paid, application of a lower corporate rate to distributed income than to retained earnings, and allowing shareholders a dividend-received credit for corporate taxes imputed to have been paid on their behalf. The proper treatment of tax preferences and international flows of corporate-source income raise important issues of tax administration and public policy. It is necessary, for example, to decide whether tax preferences are to be passed through to shareholders or nullified when preference income is distributed. Beyond that, ""stacking rules"" are required for the presumptive allocation of dividends between preference and taxable income. Further research on both economic effects and administrative feasibility is necessary for an adequate appraisal of integration.

In recent years, the study of labor supply has occupied the attention of a large number of economists. With the growth in interest in the topic and with the inevitable diversity of economic models and statistical methods proposed by new entrants in the field, the literature has developed its own folklore. The principal legend is that the empirical estimates of the same parameters obtained from the set of available studies display such diversity that they are of little use to policymakers. This paper disputes the folklore. We claim that there is more agreement than disagreement once a few reasonable criteria based on recent theoretical work are used to eliminate certain studies from consideration, and once we are careful about posing the question we seek the estimates to address.

The major findings are that: 1. unionism raises faculty pay but that the extent of the effect varies greatly by estimating model and time period covered; 2.the years a school has been organized has a stronger effect on pay than the standard 0-1 union dummy variable; 3. unionism raises the fringe benefit share of compensation; 4. the estimated coefficient on faculty unionism in cross-section regressions overstates the union impact because unionized schools tend to have been higher paying even before organization.

This study departs from earlier analyses of the effects of taxes on capital income in several respects. Probably the most important difference between this treatment and most preceding ones lies in the assumptions about the interest elasticity of saving. It is shown below that the common two-period formulation of saving decisions yields quite misleading results. A more realistic model of life cycle savings demonstrates that, for a wide variety of plausible parameter values, savings are very interest elastic. This implies that shifting away from capital income taxation would significantly increase capital formation, making possible long-run increases in consumption.

The organization of the paper is simple. We start by examining the real effects of anticipated inflation in an economy that has fully adapted to inflation. In particular, in this economy: (i) public institutions are fully attuned to inflation (or inflation proof), (ii) the same is true of private institutions, (iii) current and future inflation is fully reflected in inherited contracts, and (iv) future inflation is fully reflected in contracts for the future. After we have discussed the effects of anticipated inflation in this environment, we examine the real effects of inflation that arise as the assumptions (i) to (iv) are dropped one after the other. The effects cumulate in the sense that those present in the economy that has fully adapted to inflation are also present in economies with non-inflation proof institutions, and so on.

304,The Changing Cyclical Behavior of Wages and Prices: 1890-1976,['Jeffrey D. Sachs'],1978-12-01,1978-12-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

The persistence of inflation during periods of high unemployment poses the central problem for macroeconomic policy in coming years. The extent of success in reducing both inflation and unemployment will depend strongly on the short-run responsiveness of wage inflation to unemployment and excess capacity. This paper studies changes in the cyclical responsiveness of inflation from 1890-1976, and concludes that a given shortfall in production relative to potential now ""buys"" a smaller reduction in the rate of inflation than in the past. From 1890-1929, a one percent decline in industrial production reduced inflation about .45%; for 1950-1976, the same output decline is estimated to slow inflation only about .l%. The analysis makes use of two methods to study the changing cyclical behavior of inflation. Following an innovative study by Cagan, calculations are made for wage and price inflation before and after eighteen business cycle peaks. While inflation slows in almost every recession, the declines in inflation in recent years are less pronounced than earlier, even when controlling for business cycle severity. In a second section of the study, econometric evidence is provided that also strongly supports the hypothesis of increasing rigidity of wage and price Inflation over the business cycle. In the last section of the paper, some possible reasons are cited for the declining responsiveness of inflation to unemployment. Ironically, successful macroeconomic policy might be in part responsible. To the extent that activist macroeconomic policy breaks the link between current unemployment and expectations of future unemployment, it is argued, unemployment today will not induce wage cuts in contracts for future periods. Also, the tremendous increase in duration and coverage of collective bargaining agreements is suggested as an important force behind the shifting behavior of wages and prices during the period of study.

Much recent thought has been devoted to the macroeconomic importance of the existence of wage contracts. Still, some puzzling features of the most conspicuous form of wage bargaining, that done formally by employers and labor unions, deserve further theoretical attention. Among these important features are: 1. Collective bargaining agreements are rarely contingent on outside events even though the parties have very imperfect knowledge of prospective economic conditions during the period of the contract. The only important exception is the indexing of wages to the cost of living. 2. Employers are permitted wide discretion in determining the level of employment when demand shifts unexpectedly. As employment varies, total compensation varies according to a formula established in the agreement. 3. Agreements are not permanent but are renegotiated on a regular cycle. 4. In the process of renegotiation, the current state of demand has little impact on the new wage schedule. On the other hand, current wages in other industries have an important influence. This feature especially has been denied or ignored by economic theorists even though it is a prominent part of the thinking of labor economists on wage determination.

This paper examines the argument that restricting domestic firms' production abroad by for example, imposing a tax on foreign source income, can increase domestic welfare and alter the income distribution to favor labor. These arguments follow directly from a characterization of the international producer as a facilitator of capital flows. The available evidence suggests, however, that U.S. multinational firms have a much broader role than transferring abundant U.S. capital abroad. In this paper the firm Is viewed as able to compete abroad for a variety of reasons, including an ability to make use of technological and other cost advantages over local producers. Then, the effect of its operations abroad on the domestic capital stock is no longer so obvious. It is argued that at most a part of the marginal capital employed abroad is obtained at the expense of the capital stock of the domestic economy. The paper then presents a simple model which indicates that domestic labor can either gain or lose relative to capital, and home country welfare can either increase or decline, as a result of restricting the foreign operations of domestic firms. The results depend on the ultimate source of the capital placed abroad, the relative factor intensity of production by the multinational firm, and whether the multinational firm produces the home country's importable or exportable good. Since none of the cases considered seems totally implausible, the case for reducing international production cannot be made on the traditional grounds without further empirical evidence.

In this paper we explore income and race differences in nine measures of the health of children aged 6 through 11. We show that when health measures from mid-childhood are the subject of analysis, both income and race differences are much less pronounced than they are in infant mortality and birth weight data. We do find differences in the health status of black and white children and of children from high and low income families, but these differences by no means overwhelmingly favor the white or high-income children. With respect to differences by race, whether or not they are adjusted for differences in associated socioeconomic factors, black children in many cases are in better health than their white counterparts, In the case of income differences in health, the high income children do appear to be in better health according to most measures, but their advantage is greatly diminished when one controls for related socioeconomic factors like parents' educational attainment. Even so, for measures relating to the ""new morbidity,"" such as the presence of allergies or excessive tension, children from higher income families are in worse health.

309,How Elastic is The Demand for Labor?,"['Kim B. Clark', 'Richard B. Freeman']",1979-01-01,1979-01-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper investigates the magnitude of the elasticity of demand for labor in time series data using more general and complete models of demand than have been previously employed. It argues that previous analyses have imposed two invalid constraints in calculations, which bias downward estimated elasticities. The first invalid constraint is the assumption that real capital prices have an equal opposite effect to real wages in the demand equation. We show on measurement error grounds that this constraint should not be imposed in econometric work even when long run homogeneity of prices correctly characterizes the market. The constraint is rejected in the data. The second invalid constraint is that all explanatory variables have the same lag distribution. We argue that this constraint is invalid when decisions are made under uncertainty and find that it is also rejected by the data. The principal positive empirical finding is that with the constraints relaxed, the elasticity, of demand with respect to real wages is much larger than the estimates in the literature, indicating much greater price responsiveness on the demand side of the labor market than has previously been thought.

How internationally mobile is the world's supply of capital? Does capital flow among industrial countries to equalize the yield to investors? Alternatively, does the saving that originates in a country remain 'to be invested there? Or does the truth lie somewhere between these two extremes? The answers to these questions are not only important for understanding the international capital market but are also critical for analyzing a wide range of issues including the nation's optimal rate of saving and the incidence of tax changes.

311,Monetary Policy Under Exchange Rate Flexibility,['Rudiger Dornbusch'],1979-01-01,1979-01-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

The continuing depreciation of the dollar stands out as one of the big policy issues. It has started to impinge on U.S. monetary policy; it influences the chances for international commercial diplomacy, and it is enhancing the move toward European monetary integration. Above all it leaves most observers with a puzzle as to the causes of the ongoing depreciation. This paper will, of course, not resolve the puzzle. ft rather attempts to layout the basic analytical framework that has been developed for the analysis of exchange-rate questions and to relate it to the question of monetary policy. Part I concentrates on the development of the relevant theoretical framework. The main points to be made here are: (i) exchange rates are primarily deter-mined in asset markets with expectations playing a dominant role; (ii) the sharpest formulation of exchange-rate theory is the ""monetary approach, ""Chicago's quantity theory of the open economy; (iii) purchasing power parity is a precarious reed on which to hang short-term exchange-rate theory; (iv) the current account has just made it back as a determinant of exchange rates

312,Inflation and the Taxation of Capital Income in the Corporate Sector,"['Martin Feldstein', 'Lawrence H. Summers']",1979-01-01,1979-01-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

This detailed examination of the effect of inflation on the taxation of capital used by nonfinancial corporations considers not only the tax paid by the corporations them- selves but also the tax paid by the individuals and institutions that provide capital to the corporate sector. Although corporations deduct nominal interest payments that exceed real interest, the additional taxes that lenders pay slightly exceed the tax saving by corporate borrowers. Our calculations indicate that inflation raised the 1977 tax burden on corporate sector capital income by more than $32 billion, a 50 percent increase in the total tax burden.

This article examines international aspects of the provision of relief from the double taxation of dividends that now occurs under the ""classical"" American system of taxing corporate income to both corporations and shareholders. It reviews recent American debate over integration and dividend relief, the systems of dividend relief now being used in Europe, and commonly accepted standards for judging international tax policy. These standards are employed in the appraisal of existing arrangements in Europe, possible alternative systems for international taxation in a world of dividend relief, and, using the European-American situation as an example, relations between countries with dividend relief and those with classical systems.

318,"Information, Measurement, And Prediction In Economics",['Victor Zarnowitz'],1979-02-01,1979-02-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

This paper examines the flow of production and use of economic information and analyzes the effects of measurement errors, particularly as transmitted through expectations and forecasts. Economic data are subject to a variety of errors, and the uncertainty about economic measures tends to increase further with the amount and complexity of the processing per-formed on the underlying data as well as with the distance between the user and the processor. With some exceptions, economic time series lag significantly behind their reference periods and many undergo large revisions. The effective information lag includes not only the time required for incremental data to be produced and transmitted but also the time required for the signals to be extracted by the user. This lag is substantial for many important series. In general, there is no presumption that the measurement errors are random: Systematic errors are frequent and their sources and forms vary so much that they may be difficult to detect. In times of strong shocks and surprising developments (such as occurred earlier in this decade),measurement of short-term changes in the economy is particularly difficult and current signals are apt to be often misinterpreted. This can result in broadly diffused decision errors which in time are discovered, leading to sharp corrective reactions. Aggregative predictions from well known and influential sources show certain common patterns of error, which suggests that forecasters react similarly to the observed events and unanticipated shocks. Fore-casts of GNP and related variables are adversely affected by errors in both the preliminary data and the base level estimates. There is some support here for the hypothesis that information lags play a significant role ingenerating business cycles, but it is important to note that the errors involved in predicting the future are typically much larger than the errors involved in estimating the present or recent past.

319,Applied Welfare Economics with Discrete Choice Models,"['Harvey S. Rosen', 'Kenneth A. Small']",1979-02-01,1979-02-01,,"['Other', 'Macroeconomics']",['Public Economics'],,,"

Economists have been paying increasing attention to the study of situations in which consumers face a discrete rather than a continuous set of choices. Such models are potentially very important in evaluating the impact of government programs upon consumer welfare. But very little has been said in general regarding the tools of applied welfare economics indiscrete choice situations. This paper shows how the conventional methods of applied welfare economics can be modified to handle such cases. It focuses on the computation of the excess burden of taxation, and the evaluation of quality change. The results are applied to stochastic utility models, including the popular cases of probit and logit analysis. Throughout, the emphasis is on providing rigorous guidelines for carrying out applied work.

No cross-sectional consumer price index is currently available by state, and the BLS's cross-sectional ""family budget"" index for metropolitan areas is not well-suited for cross-state analyses. In this paper we propose an algorithm for constructing a state-specific Laspeyres price index using conveniently available information from the Census of Business and the Survey of Current Business. The index is calculated for each state (and for Census divisions and regions) for 1967 and 1972. Its characteristics are discussed, and it is used to deflate nominal per capita income by state. Comparing ""real"" income by state with nominal income by state, the former has substantially less variation cross-sectionally but greater variation over time (between 1967 and 1972).

In this paper, we present a simple general equilibrium model of the portfolio behavior of households and institutions, paying particular attention to the influence of differences in tax rates and attitudes toward risk. Under the plausible assumptions that households are more risk averse than institutions and possess a greater relative ""tax preference"" for equity versus debt, we are able to characterize the equilibria which may result when debt is subject to bankruptcy risk. Among the issues which we study are the effects of tax rate changes, changes in risk, and changes in firm leverage on the relative asset holdings of the two types of investor and the rates of return earned on equity and debt. Numerical simulations provide additional understanding of the model's characteristics.

In data with a group structure, incidental parameters are included to control for missing variables. Applications include longitudinal data and sibling data. In general, the joint maximum likelihood estimator of the structural parameters is not consistent as the number of groups increases, with a fixed number of observations per group. Instead a conditional likelihood function is maximized, conditional on sufficient statistics for the incidental parameters. In the logit case, a standard conditional logit program can be used. Another solution is a random effects model, in which the distribution of the incidental parameters may depend upon the exogenous variables.

326,A Capital Market In an Equilibrium Business Cycle Model,['Robert J. Barro'],1979-03-01,1979-03-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Previous equilibrium ""business cycle"" models are extended by the incorporation of an economy-wide capital market. One aspect of this ex-tension is that the relative price that appears in commodity supply and demand functions becomes an anticipated real rate of return on earning assets, rather than a ratio of actual to expected prices. From the stand-point of expectation formation, the key aspect of the extended model is that observation of the economy-wide nominal interest rate conveys current global information to individuals. With respect to the effect of money supply shocks on output, the model yields results that are similar to those generated in simpler models. Anew result concerns the behavior of the anticipated real rate of return on earning assets. Because this variable is the pertinent relative price for commodity supply and demand decisions, it turns out to be unambiguous that positive money surprises raise the anticipated real rate of return. In fact, this response provides the essential channel in this equilibrium model by which a money shock can raise the supply of commodities and thereby increase output. However, it is possible through a sort of ""liquidity"" effect that positive money surprises can depress the economy-wide nominal interest rate.

This paper analyzes the behavior of the current account and the exchange rate in the British economy during the 1970's, and discusses the outlook, as influenced by the availability of oil revenues, for exchange rate developments during the 1980's.Both trade and exchange rate behavior are affected by, and in turn affect, general macroeconomic developments and policy problems. In the short term, the major macroeconomic problems of the British economy are its high rates of inflation and unemployment. Over the long term, the underlying problem for the British economy is its slow productivity growth relative to the major OECD economies (except that of the United States).Two major themes permeate this paper. First, the accepted laws of economics continue to work in the United Kingdom; for example, low domestic demand and increased British competitiveness improve the balance of payments and slow the fall of the exchange rate. Second, Britain's achievement of macroeconomic goals depends upon the behavior of both nominal and real wages. The inflation rate will remain low only if the rate of change of nominal wages does; full employment with stable prices and current account balance will be achieved only if real wage growth is restrained or productivity growth increases.

The effect of unionization on productivity is examined in this paper using time-series data on selected establishments in the U.S. cement industry. The analysis combines statistical estimation of the union impact and interviews with union and management officials to forge a link between econometric estimation and the traditional institutional analysis of union policy and management adjustment. The econometric analysis primarily deals with the problem of identifying the impact of the union in the face of firm specific effects and adjustments in labor quality. The case studies are designed to shed light on the question of how unionization affects productivity. The empirical results support the conclusion that unionization leads to productive changes in the operation of the enterprise. Evidence from the case studies suggests that much of the gain in productivity derives from a series of extensive changes in management personnel and procedure. These adjustments are a management response to changes in the employment contract which follow unionization.

334,The Effect of Social Security on Saving,['Martin Feldstein'],1979-04-01,1979-04-01,,,,,,"

This paper, which was presented as the 1979 Frank Paish Lecture to the British Association of University Teachers of Economics, provides a non-technical summary of the recent studies of the effects of social security on private saving. The first section discusses the theoretical indeterminacy of the effect of social security while the second part reviews the empirical studies. Although the traditional life cycle theory of saving clearly implies that the anticipation of social security benefits reduces private saving, a richer theoretical framework suggests several reasons why the saving response cannot be unambiguously established by theoretical reasoning. These reasons include the indirect effects of social security on retirement behavior, private pensions, and gifts and bequests. The econometric studies resolve this uncertainty and indicate that social security appears to reduce private saving substantially. These studies include(1) aggregate time series evidence on the U.S. saving rates over the past 50 years, (2) microeconomic evidence on the accumulation of wealth by a large sample of individual households, and (3) international comparisons of saving rates in major industrial countries.

The behavior of several stochastic dynamic rational expectations models is studied when policy behavior can be described by a linear rule. Four policy components are distinguished: a current response component, a feedback component, an open-loop component and a stochastic component. Policy is evaluated in terms of the current and asymptotic first and second moments of the state variables. The importance of distinguishing between variability and uncertainty is brought out. The conditional variance is argued to be the appropriate measure of uncertainty. The analysis is applied to a model of foreign exchange market intervention.

This paper presents estimates of static and dynamic general equilibrium resource allocation effects for four alternative plans for corporate and personal income tax integration in the U.S. A medium-scale numerical general equilibrium model is used which integrates the U.S. tax system with consumer demand behavior by household and producer behavior by industry. Results indicate that total integration of personal and corporate taxes would yield an annual static efficiency gain of around $4 billion (1973 dollars). Partial integration plans yield less. Dynamic effects are larger, and our analysis indicates that full integration may yield gains whose present value is as large as $400 billion or 0.8% of the discounted present value of the GNP stream to the U.S. economy after correction for population growth. Plans differ in their distributional impacts, although these findings depend on the nature of replacement taxes used to preserve government revenues. The size of dynamic resource allocation effects are sensitive to the choice of the replacement tax, while static gains are reasonably robust.

338,Private versus Public Enforcement of Fines,['A. Mitchell Polinsky'],1979-04-01,1979-04-01,,"['Public Economics', 'Industrial Organization']",['Law and Economics'],,,"

The present paper analyzes the competitive, monopolistic, and public enforcement of fines allowing for the costs of enforcement to differ by the choice of the enforcer. There are a number of reasons to expect such differences. First, the benefits from coordinating enforcement -- for example, avoiding duplication of investigative effort and exploiting economies of scale in information processing -- are obtained under public enforcement and monopolistic enforcement, but not under competitive enforcement. Second, the profit motive might be imagined to lead to lower costs under either form of private enforcement relative to public enforcement. Third, when the revenue from fines under public enforcement is not sufficient to finance enforcement costs, there may be a deadweight burden incurred in making up the deficit from other sources. Conversely, if the fine revenue exceeds enforcement costs, the effective cost of enforcement would be lower. On balance, these considerations suggest that monopolistic enforcement may be cheaper than competitive enforcement, but that public enforcement could be more or less expensive than private enforcement.

This paper discusses ongoing research on the relation of money to economic activity in the post-World War I1 United States. As in previous work, the stress is on the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated movements of money. Part I deals with annual data. Aside from updating and refinements of earlier analysis, the principal new results concern joint, cross-equation estimation and testing of the money growth, unemployment, output and price level equations. The present findings raise some doubts about the specification of the price equation, although the other relations receive further statistical support. Part I1 applies the analysis to quarterly data. Despite the necessity to deal with pronounced serial correlation of residuals in the equations for unemployment, output and the price level, the main results are consistent with those obtained from annual data. Further, the quarterly estimates allow a detailed description of the lagged response of unemployment and output to money shocks. The estimates reveal some lack of robustness in the price equation, which again suggests some misspecification of this relation.

The relationship between high school training and work experience on the one hand and early labor force experience on the other are analyzed in the paper. In addition, the extent and nature of the persistence of early labor force experience is evaluated. The study is based on data for male youths from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. While there appears to be no relationship between job-related training in high school and post-graduation weeks worked or wage rates, there is a strong relationship between hours worked while in high school and both weeks worked and wage rates in the first four years after graduation. High school class rank and test scores also are positively related to early weeks worked and wage rates in the labor force. It is also found that after controlling for individual specific characteristics of youth, there is little relationship between weeks worked in the first year after high school graduation and weeks worked four years later. And there is almost no relationship between initial wage rates and wage rates four years later, other than those attributable to measured and unmeasured individual specific characteristics. There is little persistence of early experience that cannot be attributed to heterogeneity among youth. There is, however, an effect of early work experience on later wage rates, although it is of modest magnitude in this sample of high school graduates.

In modeling disequilibrium macroeconomic systems which one would want to subject to econometric estimation one typically faces the problem of whether the structural model can determine a unique equilibrium. The problem inherits a special form because the regimes in which the equilibria can lie are each linear. By placing restrictions on the parameters that insure the uniqueness of such a solution for each value of the exogenous and random variables, we can improve the estimation procedure. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness -- or ""coherency."" These conditions are applied to a variety of models that have been prominent in the literature on econometrics with 'switching regimes' such as those of self-selectivity (Maddala), simultaneous equation tobit and probit (Amemiya, Schmidt) and multi-market macroeconomic disequilibrium (Gourieroux, Laffont and Nonfort).

Among the numerous familiar sets of specific assumptions sufficient to derive mean-variance portfolio behavior from more general expected utility maximization in continuous time, the assumptions of constant relative risk aversion and joint normally distributed asset return assessments are also jointly sufficient to derive asset demand functions with the two desirable (and frequently simply assumed) properties of wealth homogeneity and linearity in expected returns. In addition, in discrete time constant relative risk aversion and joint normally distributed asset return assessments are sufficient to yield linear homogeneous asset demands as approximations if the time unit is small.

This paper points out the conceptual distinction between the rates of decay in the physical productivity of traditional capital goods and that of the appropriate revenues accruing to knowledge-producing activities, and notes that it is the latter parameter which is required in any study which constructs a stock of privately marketable knowledge. The rate of obsolescence of knowledge is estimated from a simple patent renewal and the estimates are found to be comparable to evidence provided by firms on the lifespan of the output of their R&D activities. These estimates, together with mean R&D gestation lags, are then used to correct previous estimates of the private excess rate of return to investment in research. We find that after the correction, the private excess rate of return to investment in research, at least in the early 1960's, was close to zero, which may explain why firms reduced the fraction of their resources allocated to research over the subsequent decade.

351,Social Security and Retirement: Evidence From the Canada Time Series,['Anthony J. Pellechio'],1979-05-01,1979-05-01,,,,,,"

This study examines whether social security influences the aggregate retirement rate in Canada. The life-cycle model of individual behavior provides the foundation for this study. The model indicates how social security can affect an individual's decision to retire. Further, the model is used to specify the variable that measures this effect. This variable is social security wealth which equals the present value of the social security benefits to which an individual is entitled. The model for individual retirement decisions is used to construct a model for the aggregate retirement rate. Time series data from Canada include a measure of social security wealth that matches the specification given by the life-cycle model. The estimate of the model yields evidence that social security induces retirement. An increase in social security wealth of approximately $2300 per capita measured in 1971 dollars has been estimated to raise the retirement rate by 5 to 6 points. The effect of the creation of the Canada and Quebec Pension Plan was to raise the retirement rate by 1.5 points in 1967.

Two economies, represented by Diamond-type overlapping-generations models and differing only in their pure rates of time preference, are joined together.

With a positive natural rate of growth, the low-time-preference country runs a current account surplus in the steady state but not necessarily outside it. If preexisting capital is not shiftable between countries, integration in the world economy makes the high-time-preference country worse off in the short run. The ranking of stationary utility levels under autarky and openness is ambiguous.

Employers often wish to know whether the factors used in selecting employees do in fact allow them to choose the most qualified applicants. Because the performance of those not chosen is not observed, sample-selection bias is a likely problem in any attempt to ""validate"" employee-selection criteria. With minor modifications, the recently-developed techniques for dealing with sample-selection problems can be used in this context. Using data on applicants for first-line supervisory positions and ratings of on-the-job performance of those hired, ordinary least squares estimates of the determinants of performance are compared with maximum-likelihood estimates which correct for selection bias. The correction for selection bias produces some appreciable improvements in some variables' coefficients, though the corrected estimates remain ""insignificant"" at conventional levels. Differences in the firm's stated and actual hiring criteria are also noted.

The present paper uses these data to estimate the effects of social security benefits on saving and retirement in an extended life cycle model.

356,International Trade and Income Distribution: A Reconsideration,['Paul R. Krugman'],1979-06-01,1979-06-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

The postwar expansion of trade among the industrial countries has not had the strong distributional effects which standard models of trade would have led us to expect. This paper develops a model which attempts to explain this observation, while at the same time making sense of some other puzzling empirical aspects of world trade. The basis of the model is a distinction between two kinds of trade: ""Heckscher-Ohlin"" trade, based on differences in factor proportions, and ""intraindustry"" trade, based on scale economies and product differentiation. To incorporate intraindustry trade into the model it is necessary to drop the usual assumptions of constant returns to scale and perfect competition; instead the paper deals with a world where economies of scale are pervasive and all firms possess some monopoly power. Surprisingly, it is nonetheless possible to develop a fully-worked-out general equilibrium model which remains simple and can be used to compare autarky and free trade. Two main results emerge from the analysis. First, the nature of trade depends on how similar countries are in their factor endowments. As countries become more similar, the trade between them will increasingly become intra-industry in character. Second, the effects of opening trade depend on its type. If intraindustry trade is sufficiently dominant the advantages of extending the market will outweigh the distributional effects, and the owners of scarce as well as of abundant factors will be made better off.

357,Labor Mobility and Wages,"['Jacob Mincer', 'Boyan Jovanovic']",1979-06-01,1979-06-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

In this essay we explore the implications of human capital and search behavior for both the interpersonal and life-cycle structure of inter-firm labor mobility. The economic hypothesis which motivates the analysis is that individual differences in firm-specific complementarities and related skill acquisitions produce differences in mobility behavior and in the relation between job tenure, wages and mobility. Both ""job duration dependence"" and ""heterogeneity bias"" are implied by this theory. Exploration of longitudinal data sets (NLS and MID) which contain mobility, job and wage histories of men in the 1966-76 decade yield several findings, among others:
1. The initially steep and later decelerating declines of labor mobility with working age are in large part due to the similar but more steeply declining relation between mobility and length of job tenure.
2. Given tenure levels, the probability of moving is predicted positively by the frequency of prior moves and negatively by education. The inclusion of prior moves in the regression reduces the estimated tenure slope because it helps to remove the ""heterogeneity bias"" in that slope.
3. The popular ""mover-stayer model"" is rejected by the existence of tenure effects on mobility.
 4. Differences in mobility during the first decade of working life do not predict long-run differences in earnings. However, persistent movers at later stages of working life have lower wage levels and flatter life-cycle wage growth.
5. The analysis calls for a reformulation of earnings (wage) functions. Inclusion of tenure terms in the function permits separate estimates of returns to general and specific human capital after correction for heterogeneity bias. A rough estimate is that 50 percent of life-time wage growth is due to general (transferable) experience and 25 percent each to firm-specific experience and inter-firm mobility.

The objectives of this preliminary study are threefold. The first is to analyze empirically the production structure of the Bell System at the aggregate level. Particular attention is focused on the pattern of substitution among the factor inputs and the degree to which the aggregate production function is characterized by economies of scale. In this connection, we explore the role of research and development in the Bell System as an input in the production process, and its interaction with the traditional inputs. Second, we examine the impact of external technological chance on the production structure of the Bell System. The issues here include not only the rate of such technical change, but also the extent to which it alters the optimal level and mix of inputs, that is, the factor bias of external technical change. The third objective is to explore the inter relationship between scale economies internal to the Bell System and external technical change in determining the rate of growth of total factor productivity (TFP) . Specifically, we propose and illustrate a methodology for composing the observed growth of TFP into a part related to scale economies and a part included by technical change. We address these issues by first estimate in a an aggregate translog cost function for the Bell System, using annual data for the period 1947-1976. The implied estimate of the scale economies is then used to explore the sources of the growth of TFP.

This paper is an attempt to assess the contribution of R&D to growth of output in U.S. manufacturing industries. The important issues to address are: whether the slower growth of R&D expenditures in recent years has been the cause of slowdown in the growth of productivity, and what the factors are in explaining the slower growth of R&D expenditures. After a brief survey of the major issues on this topic, a production function is formulated and estimated using tine series cross-section data for the manufacturing industries. Also, the factors determining the rate of growth of R&D expenditures in the 1958-75 period are identified by formulating a dynamic model of demand for R & D activity. The estimation results indicate that the stock of R & D, as a measure of stock of knowledge, positively and strongly affect growth of output in total manufacturing, total durable, and total nondurable industries. Potential growth of output is affected because of the slowdown of growth of stock of R&D since 1966, but the gross rates of return on stock of R&D have not changed much in the 1966-75 period. Growth of output, changes in relative prices, cyclical fluctuations of the economy, as well as changes in level of employment and capital stocks are the factors affecting R&D expenditures. The effect of government financing of R&D on private decisions regarding R & D expenditures differs among different industries. By and large, the results on this issue are basically inconclusive and require further investigation.

361,New Evidence That Fully Anticipated Monetary Changes Influence Real Output After All,['Robert J. Gordon'],1979-06-01,1979-06-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Robert Barro in his three papers on the topic(AER 1977, JPE 1978, and 1978 conference paper with Mark Rush). A distinction is drawn between the Lucas-Sargent-Wallace (LSW) theory that only unanticipated monetary changes influence real output, and the orthodox view that anticipated monetary changes influence real output in the short run during the interval of adjustment of prices to the monetary change. The LSW proposition requires for its validity a contemporaneous and equiproportionate response of the expected price level to the anticipated level of money or nominal CNP, whereas the orthodox approach requires that price expectations depend at least partly on the past history of prices rather than entirely on the expected level of nominal demand. The results uniformly support the orthodox approach. The Livingston expectations series exhibits a highly significant response to past price changes, and only a slight response to current expectations about nominal GNP or money. The actual inflation rate also depends heavily on past price changes, with an insignificant impact of current expectations of nominal GNP, or money. The equations that relate real output to the deviation of changes of nominal income (both anticipated and unanticipated) from past price changes fit the data significantly better than Barro's approach using current and lagged values of money ""surprises."" The pure version of the LSW approach relating real output only to current surprises is decisively rejected.

363,Can Productive Capacity Differentials Really Explain Earnings Differentials Associated with Demographic Characteristics? Case of Experience,"['James L. Medoff', 'Katharine G. Abraham']",1979-06-01,1979-06-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

This study uses computerized personnel microdata on the white male managerial and professional employees at a major U.S. corporation to address the following question: Can the additional earnings which are associated with more labor market experience at a point in time really be explained by higher productivity at the same point in time? Our answer to this question, based on both cross-sectional and longitudinal information, is that performance plays a substantially smaller role in explaining cross-sectional experience-earnings differentials and earnings growth than is claimed by those who have adopted the human capital explanation of the experience-earnings profile. This response depends critically on our assumption that the performance ratings which supervisors give to their white male managerial and professional subordinates adequately reflect the subordinates' relative productivity in the year of assessment; we present a great deal of evidence which strongly supports this assumption.

367,Fixed and Flexible Rates: A Renewal of The Debate,"['Jacques R. Artus', 'John H. Young']",1979-06-01,1979-06-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

The paper reviews the extent to which a decade of analysis and experience has altered thinking about the choice of an exchange rate system. The advantages of flexible rates are viewed to have been exaggerated. They do not permit governments to have permanently higher rates of economic activity at the expense of higher inflation as some thought. Further, the slow speed of adjustment to relative price changes limits the contribution of flexible rates to external adjustment in the short-run, and the degree of insulation from external influences that they provide. Finally, flexible rates tend to be fluctuating rates, and, although there is little empirical evidence so far showing that the fluctuations have had adverse effects on trade and capital flows, the exchange rate instability more than any other factor has led to a certain disillusionment with the floating rate system. Notwithstanding the drawbacks of flexible rates, there will be a continuing need for exchange rate flexibility over the next few years, and some analysis is given of the problems of achieving greater stability under flexible rates or the requisite amount of flexibility under pegged rates.

368,Optimal Tax Treatment of the Family: Married Couples,"['Michael J. Boskin', 'Eytan Sheshinski']",1979-07-01,1979-07-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper examines the appropriate tax treatment of the family in a series of analytical models and numerical examples. For a population of taxpaying couples which differ in earning capacity, we derive the optimal tax rates for each potential earner. These rates depend crucially upon own and cross labor supply elasticities and the joint distribution of wage rates. Our results suggest that the current system of income splitting in the United States, under which husbands and wives face equal marginal tax rates, is non-optimal. Using results from recent econometric studies, and allowing for a sensitivity analysis, the optimal tax rates on secondary workers in the family are much lower than those on primary earners. Indeed, our best estimate is that the secondary earner would face tax rates only one-half as high as primary earners.

The distinction between expected and unexpected shocks is an important part of the model. We also examine monetary and fiscal policies that might have offset the energy shock.

With a neutral tax system an increase in observed and anticipated inflation would not be expected to alter either real after-tax yields on bonds and equities or the ratio of the market value of equities to the replacement cost of corporate real capital. In the real world, however, declines in real after-tax bond yields and the relative value of shares have been observed. Feldstein (1976, 1978) has attributed both of these phenonema to the use of historic-cost depreciation, and the taxation of nominal capital gains. Our analysis supports his conjecture regarding the decline in real after-tax debt yields, but rejects his analysis of the cause of the decline in share values. The decline in share values can be attributed to many factors, but the most important is probably the favorable taxation of income from owner-occupied housing (no taxation of either implicit rents nor real capital gains). As a result housing has become more attractive with the acceleration of inflation, and households have substituted housing for equity shares. Other possible sources of the decline in share values are reduced profitability of existing capital, owing to increased regulatory costs and real energy prices, and a greater perceived risk in business operations.

Utilizing a model in which individuals search among lotteries on likely success at different jobs, this paper analyzes both the search decision when unemployed and the implications of the sorting process. The model correctly predicts both the direction and convexity of the age-unemployment relationship and the impact of experience on turnover and wages. Actions taken when unemployed have an important impact on equilibrium turnover rates, unemployment rates, and the work history of the pool of unemployed. The sorting model is used to analyze racial differences in youth unemployment and major empirical features of low income labor markets.

372,The Old Age Security Hypothesis and Population Growth,['Robert J. Willis'],1979-07-01,1979-07-01,,,['Economics of Aging'],,,"

In traditional societies it is often argued that parents' desire for old age security in the form of transfers from their children provides an important motive for childbearing. Some doubt has been cast on this ""old age security hypothesis"" by recent estimates which suggest that the rate of return on investments in children tend to be negative in most developing countries. This paper presents a theoretical model which integrates micro-level decision making about fertility and life cycle consumption into a dynamic macro-level model of overlapping generations in order to investigate the implications of this hypothesis. In this model, observation of a negative rate of return to children and positive population growth in a traditional society may imply (1) that the old age security motive for childbearing is, in fact, very strong; (2) that the rate of population growth is ""too high"" from a Paretian point of view; and (3) that each individual in current and all future generations could be made better off if the rate of population growth were lower and the level of old age consumption were increased, but that a reduction in population growth alone would reduce welfare. A social security tax and transfer policy could be devised to induce a Pareto optimal rate of population growth and distribution of life cycle consumption only if measures are taken to offset the divergence between the private and social rate of return to children created by the social security scheme.

377,Exchange Rates and Portfolio Balance,"['John R. Martin', 'Paul R. Masson']",1979-08-01,1979-08-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

An open economy portfolio balance model, describing allocation among money, a domestic bond, and a traded foreign currency bond is developed for a world of many countries. A special role is attributed to the dollar, namely that all internationally traded bonds are denominated in that currency. It is shown that in the short run with real variables exogenous and expectations static, stability requires that all countries except the U.S. be net creditors in dollar-denominated bonds. What data are available on inter-country claims suggest that some countries may well be net debtors abroad in foreign currency. In particular, if one excludes direct investment claims, private claims on the rest of the world by Japan and Canada have been negative over the period of floating rates since 1973. However, some preliminary reduced-form regression equations for the dollar exchange rates of these two countries do not support the implications of the portfolio balance model in the debtor case. On the other hand, an equation for a composite of Western European currencies (by our calculations, this group of countries is a net creditor) gives more promising results.

378,Labor Turnover and Youth Unemployment,"['Linda S. Leighton', 'Jacob Mincer']",1979-08-01,1979-08-01,,['Labor Economics'],,,,"

The main question of concern in this paper is why youth unemployment is high relative to unemployment of adults. The analysis is based largely on longitudinal micro-data in the NLS and MID panels of men, surveyed in the 1966-1976 decade. Since the duration of unemployment increases with age, incidence that is the probability of experiencing unemployment is the main focus of our analysis. The basic finding is that the at first rapid and then decelerating decline with age in the probability of unemployment stems from a similarly shaped relation between the probability of separation (from a job) and working age. The age patterns are, in turn, mainly due to the decline of probabilities as tenure lengthens. Indeed, at given levels of tenure, unemployment incidence does not at all decline with age, except among blacks and in periods of high unemployment. We conclude that the short tenure level of the young is the main reason for the age differential in unemployment. To check this we compare youth with short-tenured groups which are not adversely selected, migrants who were not unemployed before migration and immigrants. The comparison reveals that youth are in the same situation as others with little accumulated tenure. We do note, however, that unemployment declines more slowly for youth than for others, reflecting the gradually increasing commitment to work in the transition from school to work and from parental to own household. Increases in the duration of unemployment with age are ascribed, within a search model framework, to a decline in the probability of finding job vacancies among older movers. The inference of increasing difficulty in job finding is also consistent with observed increases in the probability of unemployment conditional on separation, declines in the quit/layoff ration, and in wage gains from moves as workers age.

379,A Strategic Theory of Inflation,['Mordecai Kurz'],1979-08-01,1979-08-01,,,,,,"

A strategic mechanism of price adjustment is introduced to explain inflations in the U.S. during 1909-1974. The mechanism follows from our theory that when the profit rate is above a normal-target rate, competitive forces operate to lower prices while if the profit rate is below the target a correlated strategy among firms operates to generate a rise in prices as a strategy to improve profitability. The notion of ""correlated strategy"" is adopted from game theory. The mechanism may operate in harmony or against demand and the net effect is what we call the ""basic inflation."" Contrary to a-priori notions of positive association between inflation rates and profit rates, our theory proposes a critical test of a negative association between these variables. Such a relationship is in fact empirically established. The analysis shows that large and persistent inflationary pressures are generated by low profitability and during 1971-1977 those accounted for some 20%-50% of total inflation. These pressures would be present even if no increase in cost occurs. This suggests that an important cause of the 1970's inflation is the low profit rate in the private sector and any public policy against inflation will fail if it does not aim at the same time to raise the profit rate on private capital.

This paper examines the movement of the Canadian dollar over the 1971-76 period. Although Canadian prices increased substantially more than U.S. prices over this period, there was no tendency for a systematic depreciation of the Canadian dollar. To explain this phenomenon requires the introduction of other factors into the exchange rate equation. Among the variables that proved significant are the Canadian terms of trade, measures of long-term borrowing, the relative cyclical position of Canada and the United States, and the market's errors in forecasting the current account balance. When used together with relative prices, these variables track the movement of the Canadian dollar very satisfactorily over the period.

The simplest macroeconomic models in which markets clear instantaneously, and expectations are rational preclude the existence of ""business cycles,"" that is, of serially correlated deviations of output from trend. This paper studies one of several mechanisms that can be used to make these so-called ""new-classical"" models produce business cycles; the mechanism is the gradual adjustment of inventory stocks. Two microeconomic models of inventory holdings are formulated. Both imply, first, that current output should be a decreasing function of the stock of inventories and, second, that inventories, once perturbed from equilibrium levels, should adjust only gradually. These two features are then embedded into an otherwise standard macroeconomic model in which markets clear instantaneously and expectations are rational. Two principal conclusions are reached. First, disturbances such as unanticipated changes in money will set in motion serially correlated deviations of output from trend. Second, if desired inventories are sensitive to the real interest rate, then even fully anticipated changes in money can affect real variables.

We develop a model of aggregate supply and demand in the open economy to explain the important characteristics of international macroeconomic adjustment in the 1970s. Traditional demand-oriented models cannot account for the worldwide phenomenon of rising inflation and unemployment in the mid-70s, or for the failure of most industrialized economies to recover from the deep recession of 1974-75. When aggregate supply is carefully treated, it is found that much of the inflation and sluggish output performance may be attributed to the jump in the real costs of intermediate inputs and the failure of real wages to adjust downward after the input price shock. A simulation model shows that fuel inputs are sufficiently important in production that a large part of the worldwide recession may be attributed to the change in the relative price of oil, since 1973. In an empirical section, it is suggested that countries differ in their response to supply shocks and macro-policies because of differences in key structural relationships, particularly in wage determination.

Proposals for achieving efficient allocation of capital between residential and nonresidential uses are also considered.

384,Time Series Changes in Youth Joblessness,"['Michael L. Wachter', 'Choongsoo Kim']",1979-08-01,1979-08-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

This study presents a time series analysis of the youth unemployment problem stressing the cohort overcrowding effect, a result of the baby-boom induced imbalance between younger and older workers. Several techniques are used to study the problem. First, reduced form unemployment equations are estimated for the disaggregated youth groups. The results indicate that secular swings in female and white youth unemployment rates do track well with the cohort imbalance hypothesis. However, relative increases in black male unemployment remain unexplained by this model. Second, alternative measures of youth unemployment are developed by treating school enrollment and military service as equivalent to employment. In addition, several employment-to-population ratio measures are explored. Third, equations for employment, unemployment, schooling and a residual category are estimated together. This allows one to analyze flows into and out of the four states with respect to changes in explanatory variables. The results suggest that youth unemployment rates, with the exception of the black male group, peaked in relative terms in the early l970s. A detailed analysis of the declining labor market position of blacks, however, uncovers puzzling results. Although black male unemployment rates are growing, and employment rates are declining, relative wages and school enrollment rates are increasing. In fact, at least half of the decline in black employment ratios can be associated with increasing school enrollment rates.

385,Labor Supply and Aggregate Fluctuations,['Robert E. Hall'],1979-08-01,1979-08-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Issues of labor supply are at the heart of macroeconomic explanations of the large cyclical fluctuations of output observed in modern economies. This paper starts with a serious empirical examination of the view that the labor market is always in balance-that every observed combination of employment and compensation is a point of intersection of the relevant supply and demand curves. I will call this the ""intertemporal substitution"" model of fluctuations. According to this model, workers are willing to shift their hours of work from one year to another in response to modest shifts in relative wages. The paper goes on to point out a strong implication of the pure inter- temporal substitution model, namely, the irrelevance of changes in the money supply for the labor supply function. A model where markets clear instantly ought to obey full monetary neutrality. The data refute this implication absolutely unambiguously. The money stock unambiguously shifts the labor supply function. The pure substitution model seems untenable in the light of this evidence. The paper then turns to explanations of the nonneutrality of money in the short run. According to the most carefully worked out line of thought, monetary shocks cause workers to make inappropriate intertemporal shifts in labor supply, because they lack complete information about the source of aggregate shocks and are forced to respond in the same way to real and nominal disturbances. Finally, the paper turns to the view that, in the short run, labor supply is largely irrelevant to the determination of aggregate employment.

387,The Estimation of Labor Supply Over Kinked Budget Constraints: Some New Econometric Methodology,['Anthony J. Pellechio'],1979-08-01,1979-08-01,,,,,,"

Most programs of taxation and income maintenance imply that the tax rate faced by an individual changes at different levels of labor supply. As a result, the individual's budget constraint is kinked which presents problems for the empirical study of labor supply. This paper develops econometric methodology for estimating labor supply in the presence of taxes. Equations for market wage and shadow price are used to describe labor supply choices over a kinked budget constraint This approach makes a distinction between the discrete choice of which segment or corner of the kinked constraint to work on and the selection of the actual number of hours of work along linear segments. A consistent procedure is derived that uses all the tax rates faced by the individual and relies on no more structure than has been used in the previous literature on labor force participation. This procedure summarizes the individual's kinked budget constraint by calculating the expected value of variables that assume different values on the sections of the constraint. Techniques for estimating the model based on a probit analysis of the decision to work above or below certain corners of the budget constraint are presented. Maximum likelihood estimation is also discussed.

Most contributions to optimal tax theory have assumed that all prices, including that of leisure, are known with certainty. The purpose of this paper is to analyze optimal taxation when workers have imperfect information about their wages at the time they choose their labor supplies. Both efficiency and redistributive aspects of the problem are considered. The paper begins with a discussion of the positive theory of wage taxation and labor supply under uncertainty. This is followed by a discussion of optimal taxation when individuals are identical, but their wages are stochastic. Finally, the case of simultaneous uncertainty and inequality is discussed. In this part of the paper it is assumed that the government's objective is to maximize a utilitarian social welfare function.

This study examines the international repercussions of national sterilization policies under fixed exchange rates and managed flexibility. The effects of sterilization on the country pursuing the policy are well-known, but the adverse effects on other countries have not been adequately explored. In this study, a stochastic framework is used to analyze the impact of balance of payments disturbances on key financial variables in the domestic and foreign countries. The effects of sterilization are explored under fixed rates, and the combined effects of foreign exchange intervention and sterilization are similarly investigated in a regime of managed flexibility. In either regime, sterilization by the foreign country imposes costs on the domestic country by magnifying the impact of balance of payments disturbances on the domestic financial market. The analysis has important implications for the use of reserve currencies: Countries issuing reserve currencies benefit from the automatic sterilization of their balance of payments surpluses or deficits, while countries using reserve currencies encounter the same cross country effects as with discretionary sterilization.

Employment matches under uncertainty are typically accompanied by opportunities for information acquisition. Workers can acquire specific information about productivity lotteries at the firm or general information affecting their probabilistic beliefs about work elsewhere. Enterprises can acquire specific information concerning the productivity of a particular worker or general information about different groups of workers in a production process. In all cases, the market equilibrium with flexible wages is efficient. Moreover, there is no opportunity for strategic behavior that would alter this result. Both forms of information are associated with rising earnings profiles over time, hut the steepness is greater in the general case. The negative turnover-wage relation is attributable in part to the lower match termination rate of workers with productive lob histories, who earn higher wages than their less productive counterparts. General information is associated with more termination of employment matches by employers and employees than is specific information. The implications of specific/general information for matching processes in many respects aralle1 the role of that distinction in human capital theory, strengthening the link between matching theories and earlier human capital analyses.

395,Adjusting Depreciation in an Inflationary Economy: Indexing versus Acceleration,['Martin Feldstein'],1979-10-01,1979-10-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

With the existing ""historic cost"" method of depreciation, higher inflation rates reduce the real value of future depreciation deductions and therefore raise the real net cost of investment. The calculations in this paper show that this rise in the net cost can be quite substantial at recent inflation rates; e.g., the real net cost of an equipment investment with a 13 year tax life is raised 21 percent by an 8 percent expected inflation rate if the firm uses a 4 percent real discount rate. The effects of inflation on the net cost of investment can be completely eliminated by indexing depreciation. A more accelerated depreciation schedule can also lower the net cost of investment and make that net cost less sensitive to the rate of inflation. The current paper examines a particular acceleration proposal and finds that, for moderate rates of inflation and real discount rates, the acceleration proposal and full indexation are quite similar. For low rates of inflation, high discount rates, or very long-lived investments, the acceleration proposal causes greater reductions in net cost than would result from complete indexing. Conversely, for high rates of inflation, low discount rates, or very short-lived investments, the acceleration method fails to offset the adverse effects of inflation. Since the acceleration and indexation methods have quite similar effects under existing economic conditions, the choice between them requires balancing the administrative simplicity and other possible advantages of acceleration against the automatic protection that indexation offers against the risk of significant changes from the recent inflation rates and discount rates.

This paper presents a theoretical model dealing with the duration of youth unemployment in West Germany. Duration can be expressed in terms of the underlying hazard function. After a brief discussion of a reasonable shape of the hazard function a distinction is made with respect to the probabilities of receiving a job offer and accepting it. Determinants of the latter decision are developed using a unified model of consumption, leisure, and job search. Uncertainty and some restrictions such as standard work time and entitlement to unemployment compensation are taken into account. The probability of receiving a job offer depends, among other factors, on the screening process undertaken by the firms .

This paper investigates the health of white adolescents, focusing particularly on the roles of family background and preventive medical care. This emphasis is motivated in part by our desire to study adolescent health in the context of the nature-nurture controversy. The findings indicate first, that family characteristics (especially mother's schooling) do have a significant impact on adolescent health and second, that preventive care is an important vehicle for this impact in the case of dental health hut not in the ease of physical health measures. Similarly, the greater availability of dentists has a positive impact on dental health, but greater availability of pediatricians does not alter the physical health measures. On the basis of these results we predict that government efforts to improve the dental health of adolescents with policies to lower the cost of dental care or increase the availability of dentists are much more likely to be successful than similar policies directed at improving their physical health.

This paper examines the persistence and long-term impacts of early labor force experiences. The paper reports a rise in employment rates for a cohort of young men as they age, but points out that those persons with poor employment records early have comparatively poor records later. In order to asses the extent to which differences in later employment and wages are causally related to these earlier employment experiences, the methodologies of Heckman, Chamberlain, and others are extended to account for Markov type persistence and a straight forward estimation technique results. In addition, a Sims type causality test is used to measure the true impact of work experience on wages. The paper concludes that the effects of a period without work do not end with that spell. A teenager who spends time out of work in one year will probably spend less time working in the next than he would have had he worked the entire year. Furthermore, the lost work experience will be reflected in considerably lower wages. At the same time, the data provide no evidence that early unemployment sets off a vicious cycle of recurrent unemployment. The reduced employment effects die off very quickly. What appears to persist are effects of lost work experience on wages.

This paper develops the theory of price measurement when quality change is ""nonproportional"", yielding increases in the user value of a given product in a different proportion than the increase in production cost associated with the quality improvement. The theoretical section demonstrates that ""nonproportional"" quality change is treated consistently by properly defined input and output price indexes; that both types of indexes should he based on quality adjustments that use the criterion of user value rather than production cost; and that if improvements in  energy efficiency are embodied in a good by its manufacturer, the prices of new models should be adjusted for the user value of these cost savings. The proposed approach is applied in a case study of the commercial aircraft industry. In contrast to the official price index for aircraft that rises at a 2.5 percent annual rate between 1957 and 1972,a new index is developed that declines at a 7.1 percent annual rate over the same period. The new index implies that output and productivity in the aircraft industry grew much faster than previously believed between 1957 and1972,while total factor productivity in the airline industry grew much less rapidly. The proposed quality adjustments for individual aircraft types are corroborated by price ratios observed in the used aircraft market.

Dividends seem to be more heavily taxed than capital gains. Why then do corporations pay dividends rather than repurchasing shares or retaining earnings? Either corporations are not acting in the interests of shareholders, or else shareholders desire dividends sufficiently for nontax reasons to offset the tax effect. In this paper, we measure the relative valuation of dividends and capital gains in the stock market, using a variant of the capital asset pricing model. We find that dividends are not valued differently systematically from capital gains. This finding is consistent with share price maximization by firms but inconsistent with the fact that most shareholders pay a heavier tax on dividends. We also show that the relative value of dividends provides an indirect measure of a marginal Tobin's q. The measured value of dividends relative to capital gains tends to be higher during prosperous periods, as is consistent with this interpretation. We hope that this time series on a marginal Tobin's q will prove to be useful in forecasting the rate of investment.

410,On Forecasting Interest Rates: An Efficient Markets Perspective,['James E. Pesando'],1979-11-01,1979-11-01,,,['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper reviews, from an applied forecasting perspective, the properties of short- and long-term interest rates in an efficient market. The paper emphasizes that efficient markets do not preclude economic agents from successfully forecasting movements in short-term interest rates. For brief forecast intervals, however, ex ante changes in long-term rates are sufficiently close to zero that economic agents are not likely to improve upon the no-change prediction of the martingale model. Economic agents, in effect, are not likely to succeed in forecasting short-term movements in long-term interest rates. An analysis of three sets of Canadian interest rate forecasts provides results which are consistent with the theoretical discussion, Further, these results parallel those obtained in recent studies of recorded forecasts in the United States, although the authors of these latter studies apparently failed to appreciate the nature of their findings.

412,"The Roles of Monetary, Financial and Fiscal Policy with Rational Expectations",['Willem H. Buiter'],1979-11-01,1979-11-01,,['Macroeconomics'],"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

The setup of the paper is as follows: Section I presents a fairly standard, small deterministic macromodel with a number of classical features. All markets clear instantaneously, there is no money illusion, and perfect foresight rules. The effects of monetary, financial, and fiscal policies in this model are analyzed. A number of nonneutrality propositions are stated. The drawback of this model is that it is ad hoc in the sense that private behavioral relationships have not been derived from explicit optimizing behavior. Section II, therefore, summarizes the results of some studies on debt neutrality and monetary superneutrality in a ""fully rational"" overlapping generations model. This leads to the conclusion that the ad hoc model of Section I is not a bad parable for such fully rational models. Section III abandons the assumption of universal instantaneous Wairasian equilibrium and considers the consequences of price and wage stickiness for the scope for stabilization policy; stochastic models are analyzed here, which also permits the consideration of some of the interesting issues associated with incomplete information.

413,Why Do Companies Pay Dividends?,"['Martin Feldstein', 'Jerry Green']",1979-12-01,1979-12-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Financial Economics']",['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper presents a simple model of market equilibrium to explain why firms that maximize the value of their shares pay dividends even though the funds could instead be retained and subsequently distributed to shareholders in a way that would allow them to be taxed more favorably as capital gains. The two principal ingredients of our explanation are:(1) the conflicting preferences of shareholders in different tax brackets and (2) the shareholders' desire for portfolio diversification, we show that companies will pay a positive fraction of earnings in dividends. We also provide some comparative static analysis of dividend behavior with respect to tax parameters and to the conditions determining the riskiness of the securities.

A multi-country econometric model is presented in this paper. The theoretical basis of the model is discussed in Fair (l979a), and the present paper is an empirical extension of this work. The model is quarterly and contains estimated equations for 44 countries. Most of the equations have been estimated by two stage least squares. The basic estimation period is 19581-19801 (89 observations). For equations that are relevant only when exchange rates are flexible, the basic estimation period is 1972II-19801 (32 observations). The trade matrix contains data for 64 countries. The U.S. part of the model is the model described in Fair (1976, 1980b). The model differs from previous models in a number of ways.(1) Linkages among countries with respect to exchange rates, interest rates, and prices appear to be more important in the model than they are in previous models. (2) There is no natural distinction in the model between stock-market and flow-market determination of the exchange rate.(3) The number of countries is larger than usual, and the data are all quarterly. (4) I alone have estimated small models for each country and then linked them together, rather than, as Project LINK has done, take models developed by others and link them together. The advantage of this approach is that the person constructing the individual models knows from the beginning that they are to be linked together, and this may lead to better specification of the linkages. The paper contains (1) a review of the theoretical basis of the model, (2) a description of the econometric model, including presentation and discussion of all the estimated equations, (3) a comparison of the predictive accuracy of the model to that of a fourth order autoregressive model, and (4) a brief discussion of the properties of the model. A much more detailed examination of the properties of the model is presented in Fair (1981).

This paper analyzes the school enrollment and labor supply decisions of teenagers and young adults as jointly deter-mined outcomes. The empirical results are based on an application of discrete multivariate analysis to a sample taken from the Survey of Income and Education. Higher relative wage offers are found to reduce the probability of a youth enrolling in school and to increase labor supply. However, the estimated impacts are very sensitive to adjustments made for the possibility that wage rate offers by firms are higher for full-time than for part-timework. Job availability, as measured by the local youth unemployment rate, has its strongest effect on the probability of enrollment and full-time labor force participation for nonwhite males, accounting, in the extreme, for a difference in this probability of almost 50 percent. Since a wage measure is included as an independent variable, we can be sure that the job availability measure is not acting as a surrogate for an absent wage variable, but instead has an impact of its own. Specific findings on the influence of various family and market characteristics are compared to those from earlier studies.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which family income and education are obstacles to the provision of adequate diets for young children in the United States. An examination of the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reveals the following:  1. Average nutrient intakes of young children are well above recommended dietary standards, with the exception of iron.  2. Average nutrient intakes for children in households of lower economic status are very similar to intakes of children in households of higher economic status. Rates of children's growth are also similar in these households.  3. Family income and education of the household head have statistically significant but very small positive effects on the nutrient intake levels of young children.  4. There are substantial effects of protein intakes on children's height and head growth, even though protein is consumed in excess of dietary standards. This finding and the apparent correlation between children's growth and their intellectual development brings to question the adequacy of present protein standards. Could American mothers, who provide very high protein diets for their children in households at all levels of socioeconomic status know more about what constitutes an adequate diet for their children than the experts do?

418,Monetary Policy and the 1979 Supply Shock,['Robert J. Gordon'],1979-12-01,1979-12-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

The most striking aspects of recent U.S. wage and price behavior are the small year-to-year variations in the rate of change of wages, the modest 1977-79 acceleration in the rate of change of both wages and the consumption deflator net of food and energy, and an unprecedented gap between the inflation rates recorded by the CPI and personal consumption deflator. A small and simple econometric model is used to forecast the consequences of various policies for the future growth of the monetary base. No policy will be able to prevent an acceleration in the growth rate of the personal consumption deflator net of food and energy from its recent 7 percent track to 8 percent or above in the first half of 1980. The gross personal consumption deflator will climb even faster, with the difference depending on the behavior of oil and food prices. Thereafter, the effect of slack labor markets will begin to allow inflation net of food and energy to decelerate substantially. A 6 percent rule for the monetary base is too conservative and causes the unemployment rate to rise to 8.5 percent in 1982. An 8 percent rule for the base is preferable, allows the unemployment rate to begin to fall after late 1981, and still achieves a deceleration of inflation net of food and energy from 8 percent in mid-1980 to 6 percent in 1983. Thereafter, the growth of the base should be slowed down to keep the economy from overshooting again.

419,Public Policy Toward Life Saving: Maximize Lives Saved vs. Consumer Sovereignty,"['William Gould', 'Richard Thaler']",1980-01-01,1980-01-01,,['Other'],['Health Economics'],,,"

This paper is a theoretical analysis of individual and societal demands for life saving. We begin by demonstrating that the allocation of health expenditures to maximize lives saved may be inconsistent with the willingness-to-pay criterion and consumer sovereignty. We further investigate the effects of information on aggregate willingness to pay. This discussion is related to the concepts of statistical and identified lives. Methods of financing health expenditures are considered. We show that risk averse individuals may reject actuarially fair insurance for treatments of fatal diseases even if they plan to pay for the treatment if they get sick. This result has implications regarding the choice of treatment or prevention. Finally, we examine the importance of the timing of life-saving decisions. A conflict arises between society's preferences before it is known who will be sick and after, even if it is known in advance how many people will be sick.

This paper formulates and estimates a structural life cycle model of labor supply. Using theoretical characterizations derived from an economic model of life cycle behavior, a two-stage empirical analysis yields estimates of intertemporal and uncompensated substitution effects which provides the information needed to predict the response of hours of work to life cycle wage growth and shifts in the lifetime wage path. The empirical model developed here provides a natural framework for interpreting estimates found in other work on this topic. It also indicates how cross section specifications of hours of work can be modified to estimate parameters relevant for describing labor supply behavior in a lifetime setting.

This paper emphasizes the importance of the interaction between tax rules and the management of monetary policy. The monetary authorities' failure to recognize the implications of the tax structure has caused them to underestimate just how expansionary monetary policy has been. Moreover, because of our fiscal structure, attempts to encourage investment by an easy-money policy have actually had an adverse impact on investment in plant and equipment. The paper discusses the desirability of substituting a policy of tight-money and positive fiscal incentives for the traditional goals of easy money and fiscal restraint. More generally, the paper stresses the significance of the fiscal structure as a determinant of macroeconomic equilibrium.

423,Sectoral Productivity Slowdown,['M. Ishaq Nadiri'],1980-01-01,1980-01-01,,['Econometrics'],"['Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship']",,,"

In this paper an attempt is made to answer two questions:1) What set of factors explains the recent slowdown of the U.S. aggregate labor productivity, and 2) whether the same set of forces account for the slowdown of sectoral productivity growth as well. We specify a model which relates measured labor productivity growth to capital/labor ratio, level and rate of change of utilization, stock of R & D, and the rate of disembodied technical change. The model is estimated using sectoral and aggregate data for the period 1949-1978.The results of the estimation suggest that the pattern of aggregate productivity growth can be explained by the growth of capital/labor ratio the gap between potential and actual output growth paths, the change in degree of utilization, the growth of stock of total R & D, and the time trend. In fact, both at the aggregate and sectoral levels, these factors account fairly well, first for the growth and then for the subsequent slowdown of labor productivity in the postwar period. To be sure, in some specific industries, the performance of the model could be improved. However, the overall conclusion reached is that the slowdown in growth of capital formation, the inability of the economy and various sectors to grow at their normal growth rates, and the slowdown in rate of technological change are some of the main reasons for the observed productivity slowdown of the recent years.

This paper develops an analysis of labor markets in which the use of layoffs to effect employment separations does not imply that markets fail to clear or that the amount of employment is suboptimal relative to current perceptions. This analysis focuses on the interaction between contractual arrangements for shifting risk from workers to employers and tax-financed unemployment insurance. The key element in the analysis is that unemployment insurance is more attractive than risk shifting as a way for workers to obtain income during unemployment. The paper also analyses the effects of risk shifting and unemployment insurance on the magnitude of employment fluctuations. The analysis implies that, given the existence of unemployment insurance, the existence of risk-shifting arrangements makes employment less variable.

This paper examines a model in which demand is uncertain and production must occur before demand is known for sure. By investing resources in information gathering activity, demand can be forecast. The paper investigates the relationship between the incentive to plan and market structure and conduct. Competition leads to too little planning, while monopoly leads to too high a price relative to the social optimum. A dominant firm with a competitive fringe turns out to be better. than either pure competition or monopoly. One interesting result is that the optimal production strategy of the dominant firm is to produce even when price is below marginal cost. Although such a production policy resembles that associated with ""predatory pricing"" (a practice which is thought to be socially undesirable), society would be harmed by prohibition of such a policy.

This paper makes no contribution to an understanding of the secular slowdown in productivity, except to add a new cyclical correction of the long-run trend. Its main objective is to examine the short-run behavior of aggregate labor productivity in isolation. In addition to the phenomenon of short-run ""increasing returns to labor"" identified in previous studies, it isolates an often overlooked but consistent tendency for productivity to perform poorly in the last stages of a business expansion. In 1956, 1960, 1969,1973, and now again in 1979, a productivity shortfall has developed, with absolute declines in the level of productivity occurring in every episode except the first, and in every episode before 1979 the shortfall has subsequently been made up. The paper is more successful in identifying this ""end-of-expansion"" phenomenon than in explaining it; the results suggest that firms tend consistently to hire more workers in the last stages of a business expansion than is justified by the level of output.

In section 1.2 we shall examine the optimal taxation of capital and labor incomes in a simple growth model and derive formulae for the optimal tax rates. These are used in section 1.3 to evaluate claims that abolishing capital income taxes would lead to large welfare gains. Inflation is introduced in section 1.4, and alternative approaches to modeling savings behavior are discussed in section 1.5. Finally, we shall look briefly at some of the empirical evidence on the effects of taxes on savings. Our analysis will be highly simplified. We shall ignore many of the issues stressed by the Meade Committee, such as the complex interaction between personal and corporate taxation, the sheer diversity of tax rates currently imposed on different forms of saving, and the portfolio aspects of personal saving. The relationship between expenditure on durables and saving and the effect of social security on consumption will also be left to one side, and we shall say little about the production side of the economy. (For surveys of the effects of taxes on investment, see Helliwell, 1976; King, 1977; and von Furstenberg and Malkiel, 1977.) Despite these omissions the model captures the essential features necessary to an evaluation of the efficiency arguments.

This paper applies the analytical framework of the monetary approach to exchange rate determination to the analysis of the Dollar/Pound exchange rate during the first part of the 1920's. The analysis uses monthly data up to the return of Britain to gold in 1925. The equilibrium exchange rate is shown to be influenced by both real and monetary factors which operate through their influence on the relative demands and supplies of monies. Special attention is given to examination of the relationship between exchange rates and the relative price of traded to non-traded goods. In the empirical work the prices of traded goods are proxied by the wholesale price indices and the prices of non-traded are proxied by wages. One of the key findings of the paper is the estimate of the elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the relative price of traded to non-traded goods. This elasticity is estimated with high precision and is shown to be .415 which provides an independent measure of the relative share of spending on non-traded goods. This estimate is consistent with other estimates obtained in studies of expenditure shares. The paper concluded with a dynamic simulation which indicates the satisfactory quality of the predictive ability of the model.

431,Money and the Dispersion of Relative Prices,['Zvi Hercowitz'],1980-01-01,1980-01-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

A price dispersion equation is tested with data from the German hyper-inflation. The equation is derived from a version of Lucas' (1973) and Barro's (1976) partial information-localized market models. In this extension, different excess demand elasticities across commodities imply a testable dispersion equation, in which the explanatory variable is the magnitude of the unperceived money growth. The testing of this hypothesis requires two preliminary steps. First, a price dispersion series is computed using an interesting set of data. It consists of monthly average wholesale prices of 68 commodities ranging from foods to metals, for the period of January, 1921 to July, 1923. The next step is the delicate one of measuring unperceived money growth. This estimation implies the postulation of an available information set and also a function relating the variables in this set to money creation. The function used was based on considerations related to government demand for revenue. The model receives support from the empirical analysis although it is evident that unincluded variables have important effects on price dispersion.

This paper reports an empirical test of a price dispersion equation, using data on the U.S. after World War II. The equation, derived elsewhere from aversion of the partial information-localized market models, relates price dispersion to the magnitude of changes in the aggregate disturbances. In order to test the model a series on price dispersion is computed using annual wholesale price indexes for the period 1948-76. The data on money shocks are the unanticipated money growth series estimated by Barro. The tests also include a measure of aggregate-real disturbances. From the theoretical point of view the results are negative. They reject the hypothesis that unexpected money shocks, as measured by Barro, affect price dispersion in the way predicted by the model. In a previous paper, a similar model was tested with data from the German hyperinflation and found supported to a considerable extent. The difference in the results may be related to the extreme magnitude of the monetary disturbances during that period, and to the apparently important effect of unincluded relative disturbances in the United States.

The direct answer to the opening question is ""probably not."" But how we get there needs documenting and may prove instructive on its own merits.

436,The Taxation of Exhaustible Resources,"['Partha Dasgupta', 'Geoffrey Heal', 'Joseph E. Stiflitx']",1980-01-01,1980-01-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper analyzes the effect of taxation on the intertemporal allocation of an exhaustible resource. A general framework within which a large variety of taxes can be analyzed is developed and then applied to a number of specific taxes. It is shown that there exists a pattern of taxation which can generate essentially any desired pattern of resource usage. Many tax policies, however, have effects which are markedly different both from the effects that these policies would have in the case of produced commodities-and from those which they are designed (or widely thought) to have. For instance, if extraction costs are zero, a depletion allowance at a constant rate (widely thought to encourage the extraction of resources) has absolutely no effect; its gradual removal (usually thought to be preferable to a sudden removal) leads to faster rates of depletion (and lower prices) now, but higher prices in the future; which its sudden and unanticipated removal has absolutely no distortionary effect on the pattern of extraction. More generally, it is shown that the effects of tax structure on the patterns of extraction are critically dependent on expectations concerning future taxation. (The changes in tax structure which have occurred in the past fifty years are of the kind that, if they were anticipated, (or if similar further changes are expected to occur in the future) lead to excessively fast exploitation of natural resources. However, if it is believed that current tax policies (including rates) will persist indefinitely, the current tax structure would lead to excessive conservationism. Thus, whether in fact current tax policies have lead to excessive conservationism is a moot question.

The balance of payments, changes in our terms of trade, and other foreign influences are widely believed to be a major, if not the dominant, cause of U.S. inflation. This is possible only if the international economy has caused a significant increase in the growth rate of the nominal quantity of money sup-plied, a significant decrease in the growth rate of the real quantity of money demanded, or both. Unlike non reserve countries maintaining pegged exchange rates, the balance of payments need not influence the growth rate of the nominal quantity of money supplied by the Federal Reserve System. The Fed's reaction function is estimated and no effects of the (scaled) balance-of-payments can be detected. Noris found any other channel by which the international economy has affected the growth rate of the nominal money supply. Changes in the terms of trade will cause some transitory self-reversing effects on real income, real money demand, and the price level and also some permanent shifts in these variables. Because the permanent shifts in the level are nonrecurring, they average out when we examine the average growth rate over substantial periods. Indeed for four year averages, all autonomous variability (domestic and foreign) contributes negligibly (standard error of O.4 percent per annum) to variations in average inflation. Thus, except possibly a supporting role in the short run, international economy has contributed negligibly to U.S. inflation.

This paper explores the economic factors which determine the variation of research effort across firms. The intra-industry coefficient of variation of research intensity is much larger than those of traditional factors. We show that this important fact is consistent with the theoretical argument that knowledge possesses unique economic characteristics, and that the demand for research depends both on the parameters of the production function for knowledge and on the ability of the firm to appropriate the benefits from the knowledge it produces. We propose and implement a framework for decomposing the observed intra-industry variance In research intensity into three components: demand inducement, a firm-specific structural parameter, and errors in the observed variables. The main empirical findings are that errors in the variables (especially research) are important, that very little of the structural variance in research intensity is accounted for by demand inducement, and that the bulk of the variance is related to differences in the firm-specific parameter. Both the theoretical and empirical analysis indicate that it is not reasonable to treat the demand for research in a manner analogous to the demand for traditional inputs, including capital. Substantially richer models are required to provide insight into the structure of incentives driving the demand for research.

This paper provides an empirical examination of the hypothesis that the forward exchange rate provides an ""optimal"" forecast of the future spot ex-change rate, for five currencies relative to the dollar. This hypothesis provides a convenient norm for examining the erratic behavior of exchange rates; this erratic behavior represents an efficient market that is quickly incorporating new information into the current exchange rate. This hypothesis is analyzed using two distinct, but related, approaches. The first approach is based on a regression of spot rates on lagged forward rates. When using weekly data and a one month forward exchange rate, ordinary least squares regression analysis of market efficiency is incorrect. Econometric methods are proposed which allow for consistent (though not fully efficient) estimation of the parameters and their standard errors. This paper also presents a new approach for testing exchange market efficiency. This approach is based on a general time series process generating the spot and forward exchange rate. The hypothesis of efficiency implies a set of cross-equation restrictions imposed on the parameters of the time series model. This paper derives these restrictions, proposes a maximum likelihood method of estimating the constrained likelihood function, estimates the model and tests the validity of the restrictions with a likelihood ration statistic.

440,Wage Expectations in the Labor Market: Survey Evidence on Rationality,['Jonathan S. Leonard'],1980-02-01,1980-02-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Using a new set of directly observed wage expectations among firms, this paper finds that in general firms' forecasts fail the unbiasedness and efficiency requirements of weak-form rational expectations. These market participants consistently underestimate the wages they actually end up paying, and their expectations do not efficiently utilize the information in past realizations. The mean absolute forecast error of two percent compares with an error of only five percent if static expectations were held. The major source of wage fore-cast error seems to be errors in predicting demand, rather than in predicting supply or the general price level. Wage forecast errors are positively correlated across fields with distinct supply patterns, and are positively correlated with quantity forecast error. The properties of stochastically weighted expectations and the effectiveness of the wage and price controls of the early 1970's are also discussed.

The hypothesis that minimum wages tend to discourage on the job training is largely supported by our empirical analysis.

Apart from a single exception, no effects are observable among the higher wage group whose education exceeds high school. The effects on job turnover are: a decrease in turnover among young NLS whites, but an increase among young NLS blacks and MID whites. Whether these apparently conflicting findings on turnover reflect a distinction between short and long run adjustments in jobs is a question that requires further testing.

The major conclusion of the paper is that private pension plans could offer retiring employees a choice between a conventional money-fixed annuity or a PPA, both of which would cost theemployer the same amount of money to fund, although this option would require the PPA benefitlevel in the first few years of retirement to be lower than that of the conventional annuity.

The 1970's witnessed the dramatic evolution of the international monetary system from a regime of pegged exchange rates into a regime of flexible rates. This paper surveys the key issues and lessons from the experience with floating rates during the1970's. The main orientation is empirical and the analysis is based on the experience of the three exchange rates: the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/French Franc, and the Dollar/DM. The first issue that is being examined is the efficiency of the foreign exchange market and the degree of exchange rates volatility. The analytical framework emphasizes that exchange rates are the prices of assets that are traded in organized markets and are strongly influenced by expectations about future events. The principal finding is that the behavior of the foreign exchange market has been broadly consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. The second issue concerns the relationship between exchange rates and interest rates. It is shown that during the inflationary period of the 1970's, exchange rates and interest rates were positively correlated. This positive association is interpreted in terms of the role played by inflationary expectations. The analysis draws a distinction between expected and unexpected changes in interest rates; it is demonstrated that changes in exchange rates are strongly associated with the unexpected component of changes in the interest rates. The third issue concerns the relationship between exchange rates and prices. It is shown that the experience of the 1970'sdoes not support the prediction of the simple version of the purchasing power parity theory and that the deviations from purchasing power parities can be characterized by a first-order autoregressive process. These deviations are then interpreted.

451,"Dynamic Aspects of of Children's Health, Intellectual Development, and Family Economic Status",['Robert A. Shakotko'],1980-02-01,1980-02-01,,['Public Economics'],['Health Economics'],,,"

This paper is an empirical investigation of childhood and adolescent health and cognitive development as determined by family economic variables. The model proposed recognizes that these processes may be jointly dependent, and may in part be determined by common unobserved factors; these factors may also be correlated with the observed family economic variables. A two-factor model is estimated using panel data, and the results indicate that when such factors are taken account of, family income is estimated to have no significant influence on health and cognitive development, but parents' education a strong positive influence.

455,A Consistent Characterization of a Near-Century of Price Behavior,['Robert J. Gordon'],1980-02-01,1980-02-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

This paper demonstrates that the commonly used Expectational Phillips Curve (EPC) framework cannot explain the last eighty-seven years of aggregate price behavior in the United States. The EPC explanation, which in its most general form relates price change to expected inflation and the level of detrended output, obscures the fact that price change has been much more closely related to the contemporaneous rate of change of detrended output. Over the near-century of annual data studied here, a change in output has shown a remarkably consistent tendency to be associated in annual data with a simultaneous change in the price level of about one-half as much. Stated another way, nominal GNP changes have been divided consistently, with two-thirds taking the form of output change and the remaining one-third the form of price change. This finding applies not only over the entire 1890-1978sample period, but also over three subperiods (1890-1929, 1929-53, and 1953-78).

456,Do Stock Prices Move Too Much to be Justified by Subsequent Changes in Dividends?,['Robert J. Shiller'],1980-02-01,1980-02-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper will develop the efficient markets model in Section I to clarify some theoretical questions that may arise in connection with the inequality (1) and some similar inequalities will be derived that put limits on the standard deviation of the innovation in price and the standard deviation of the change in price. The model is restated in innovation form which allows better understanding of the limits on stock price volatility imposed by the model. In particular, this will enable us to see (Section II) that the standard deviation of p is highest when information about dividends is revealed smoothly and that if information is revealed in big lumps occasionally the price series may have higher kurtosis (fatter tails) but will have lower variance. The notion expressed by some that earnings rather than dividend data should be used is discussed in Section III, and a way of assessing the importance of time variation in real discount rates is shown in Section IV. The inequalities are compared with the data in Section V.

The object of this essay is to gain an overview of developments in theAmerican financial markets since World War II, with particular attention to changes that have occurred either between the prewar and post-war years or within the past several decades. Inevitably such an effort must be selective. The primary emphasis here is on the interaction between the financial markets and the nonfinancial economy, in the sense of the demands that the nonfinancial economy has placed on the financial markets and the ways in which the financial markets have responded to these demands. In addition, much of this essay focuses on the evolving role of government in the financial markets and on the changes that it has brought about. Questions pertaining to the internal organization of financial markets and financial institutions, and to financial innovations per se, are also important, but they will receive less attention here.

459,Postwar Macroeconomics: The Evolution of Events and Ideas,['Robert J. Gordon'],1980-02-01,1980-02-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

This paper traces the evolution of macroeconomic events and ideas from the late 1940s to the present day. After a brief introduction that highlights the unique features of the main macroeconomic variables as compared to their behavior before 1947, the paper turns to an analysis of four main postwar sub-periods. The analysis of each sub-period begins with a summary of the dominant conceptual framework popular at the time, reviews the most surprising features of both demand fluctuations and supply phenomena, and concludes with a retrospective evaluation of policy. Many shifts in macroeconomic thinking can be traced to the influence of particular events. The small role that monetary changes played in explaining demand fluctuations in the first postwar decade helped maintain intact the Keynesian multiplier framework, but the increasing importance of autonomous monetary movements in the second decade laid the groundwork for a greater emphasis on the potency of monetary policy in the late 1960s. The widespread acceptance of monetarism owes much to the coincidence in 1968 of an unexpected acceleration in inflation together with the failure of the tax surcharge enacted in that year. Similarly, the increased degree of inertia evident in the behavior of inflation from 1954 on helped win ready acceptance for the idea of a stable Phillips-curve tradeoff, while the refusal of inflation to abate in 1970 helped solidify the victory of the natural hypothesis. A major theme of the paper is the gradual but profound shift in macroeconomics from the dominance of demand issues to a new emphasis on supply topics. Price controls, crop failures, and OPEC actions in the l970s have brought supply shocks to the forefront of policy discussions, revived fiscal policy asa means of countering supply shocks, and lessened support for a monetarist reliance on simple policy rules.

This paper assesses the theoretical and empirical basis for American labor union leaders' contention that imports have been a big source of job loss in the United States. It is shown, first, that identification of job losses ""due to imports"" is exceptionally difficult because economic growth affects adversely the industries believed affected by imports. Then, an accounting framework is employed to assess possible empirical orders of magnitude. The results are fairly conclusive in indicating that factors other than import competition have been primary in leading to structural shifts in employment.

This paper presents a summary and estimates of the Mark III International Transmission Model, a quarterly macroeconometric model of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands estimated for 1957 through 1976. The model is formulated to test and measure the empirical importance of alternative channels of international transmission including the effects of capital and trade flows on the money supply, of export shocks on aggregate demand, of currency substitution on money demand, and of variations in the real price of oil. Major Implications of the model estimates are:(1) Countries linked by pegged exchange rates appear to have much more national economic independence than generally supposed. (2) Substantial or complete sterilization of the effects of contemporaneous reserve flows on the money supply is a universal practice of the nonreserve central banks. (3) Quantities such as international trade flows and capital flows are not well explained by observed prices, exchange rates, and interest rates. (4) Explaining real income by innovations inaggregate demand variables works well for U.S. real income but does not transfer easily to other countries. The empirical results suggest a rich menu for further research.

463,Resolving Nuisance Disputes: The Simple Economics of Injunctive and Damage Remedies,['A. Mitchell Polinsky'],1980-03-01,1980-03-01,,,['Law and Economics'],,,"

In nuisance-type cases, legal commentators generally recommend  -- and the courts seem to increasingly use  -- the award of damages rather than the granting of an injunction of the harmed party. This essay compares the economic consequences of injunctive and damage remedies under a variety of circumstances. The discussion focuses on the ability of the remedies to deal with the strategic behavior of the litigants, the cost of redistributing income among the litigants (or classes of litigants), and the im-perfect information of the courts. In ideal circumstances  -- cooperative behavior, costless redistribution, and perfect information -- injunctive and damage remedies are equivalent. The presence of strategic behavior alone does not change this conclusion. However, if it is also costly to redistribute income, the remedies are no longer equivalent. When there are a small number of litigants in these circumstances, neither remedy is generally more effective. When there are a large number of litigants, the damage remedy is superior. Finally, and most realistically, if the courts also have imperfect information, neither remedy dominates the other. Thus, the general presumption in favor of damage remedies is not supported.

464,Monetary Accommodation of Supply Shocks under Rational Expectations,['Alan S. Blinder'],1980-03-01,1980-03-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

In dealing with the expectationists' arguments, I will divide them (somewhat artificially) into two groups. Arguments in the first group, which I call ""present disaster"" arguments, allege that econometric models err by understating the reaction of inflationary expectations. For example, it is claimed that a policy of monetary accommodation would increase inflationary expectations, shift the short-run Phillips curve upward, and defeat the purpose of the expansionary policy. Arguments in the second group, which I call ""future disaster"" arguments, are more subtle, but also more elusive. The idea is that by informing private agents that it will accommodate supply shocks in the future, the monetary authority would exacerbate the downward rigidity of wages and prices, thus making it more difficult to deal with future supply shocks. Such arguments are cases of the Lucas [12] econometric policy critique, since they suggest that policy changes will cause parameter shifts. Neither of these arguments is implausible on its face. The problem is that it is hard to know how to evaluate them until they are formalized in theoretical models and then tested empirically. This paper takes one small step in that direction by augmenting two popular macro models with rational expectations so that they are capable of dealing with supply shocks, and then examining both the present and future disaster arguments in the context of each.

465,How Effective Have Fiscal Policies Been in Changing the Distribution of Income and Wealth?,['Mervyn A. King'],1980-04-01,1980-04-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

Despite the expansion of empirical research in public finance, there remains consider- able uncertainty about the distributional consequences of fiscal policy. For this session, I have been asked to summarize some international comparisons. I shall divide the issue into two questions. How effective has fiscal policy been in reducing inequality? Mow big are the potential gains from further redistribution? In Section I, I examine some of the evidence on the redistributive effects of taxes and benefits in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. I shall concentrate on the distribution among house- holds, and not among the units, individuals, or by type of factor income. This ignores the fact that the formation of households is itself endogenous and depends, in part, on fiscal policy, especially subsidies to housing costs. Any statement about the impact of taxes on distribution depends on a counter-factual assumption about the distribution which would be observed in the absence of taxes and benefits. Since there is no overwhelming evidence in favor of any one particular set of assumptions, I shall argue that it is helpful to pose a second question, the answer to which docs not depend on assumptions about incidence. Given the distribution which emerges from the existing system of taxes and benefits, what would be the gains from attempting further redistribution? Finally, in Section III some suggestions are presented for future research.

My topic is the question: what difference does the set of commercial policies chosen by a developing country make to its rate of economic growth? Three points are salient. First, in its present state, trade theory provides little guidance as to the role of trade policy and trade strategy in promoting growth. Second, the empirical evidence overwhelmingly indicates that there are important links between them. Third, a number of hypotheses as to the reasons for these links have been put forward, but there is not as yet sufficient evidence to enable us to estimate their relative importance.

An index of Inequality is constructed which decomposes into two components, corresponding to vertical and ""horizontal"" equity respectively. Horizontal equity Is defined in terms of changes in the ordering of a distribution. The proposed index is a function to two inequality aversion parameters. One empirical application is for comparison of a pre-tax distribution with a post-tax distribution, and an example of this is given for the distribution of incomes in the UK in 1977. There is a trade-off between ""horizontal""and vertical equity, and for particular combinations of the inequality aversion parameters the original distribution will be preferred to the final distribution. The paper concludes with an application of the proposed index to a model of optimal taxation.

470,Accelerating Inflation and the Distribution of Household Savings Incentives,['Edward J. Kane'],1980-04-01,1980-04-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Econometrics']",['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This study describes how accelerating inflation has led households indifferent economic and demographic classes to reallocate their ""transactable savings."" Cross-section data from the 1962 and 1970 Surveys of Consumer Finances are used to estimate both the composition of accumulated households having and prospective rates of return on this saving. The paper shows that accelerating inflation has, in thee presence of comprehensive ceilings on deposit interest rates, altered the savings incentives of different types of households. The effect has been to bias small savers toward leveraged investments in tangible assets (especially real estate) and large savers toward certificates of deposit and marketable bonds. Small savers with disadvantaged access to credit are simply victimized. Our analysis helps to explain a number of anomalous features of the 1975-1979 macroeconomic recovery, particularly the dominant role of consumer spending, the unprecedented expansion of household debt, the boom in housing, and declining flows of household savings into deposit institutions. These data underscore the unintended consequences of trying to reconcile deposit-rate. ceilings with accelerating inflation. This combination of policies unpleasantly distorts the sectoral composition of spending and risk-bearing (crowding out some productive business investment) and aggravates inequities in the distribution of income and opportunity.

The hypothesis that forward prices are the best unbiased forecast of future spot prices is often presented in the economic and financial analysis of futures markets.  This paper considers the hypothesis independently of its implications for rational expectations or market efficiency and in order to stress this fact, the term ""speculative efficiency"" is used to characterize the state envisaged under the hypothesis. If a market is subject to efficient speculation, the supply of speculative funds is infinitely elastic at the forward price that is equal to the expected future spot price. The expected future spot price is a market price determined as the solution to the underlying rational expectations macroeconomic model. Although the paper is primarily concerned with testing this hypothesis in the foreign exchange market, the methodology introduced in the paper is of general application to all futures markets.

This paper examines the relationship between macroeconomic objectives of controlling inflation and trade-regime objectives in stabilization programs of developing countries. It is seen that there need be, in principle, no close relationship between the two, as a crawling peg exchange-rate policy can prevent inflation from affecting the performance of the foreign sector. In practice, trade regime objectives have been linked with inflation-reducing objectives, often to the detriment of resource allocation and growth. Differences between devaluation under liberalized regimes and under exchange control are also examined.

Since the move to generalized floating in1973, exchange rates between major currencies have displayed large fluctuations. This turbulence of foreign exchange rates is an important concern of government policy and its explanation is a challenge for theories of foreign exchange market behavior. In Section I of this paper, we document the extent of turbulence in foreign exchange markets by examining (i) the magnitude of short-run variations in exchange rates relative to other measures of economic variability; (ii) the degree of divergence between actual and expected changes in exchange rates; and (iii) the extent to which exchange-rate movements have diverged from movements of relative national price levels. In Section II, we provide a general explanation of this turbulence in terms of the modern ""asset market theory"" to exchange-rate determination. This theory emphasizes that exchange rates, like the prices of other assets determined in organized markets, are strongly influenced by the market's expectation of future events. In this context, we also discuss the narrower technical question of ""foreign exchange market efficiency."" Finally, in Section III, we address the question of whether turbulence in the foreign exchange markets has been ""excessive"" and what policy measures can (or should) be taken to reduce it.

A simplified model is constructed to analyze the role played by vocational training programs In high schools. The model assumes that there are two kinds of educational programs in high schools, vocational and general. It also assumes that there are two types of jobs for high school graduates. One job requires training that either can be obtained from a vocational program in high school or as general training on the job. The other job has no special training requirements. The model is used in two ways. First, it is used to examine how the equilibrium outcome is affected by limitations on the number of places in the vocational training program and by the minimum wage. Second, it helps to determine what can be. learned from studies that take what has become a standard approach to evaluating high school vocational training programs  -- attempting to estimate the productivity of this program by comparing the earnings of vocational and nonvocational program graduates. We conclude that whether or not limitations on enrollments In vocational programs and minimum wages influence the wage difference between vocational and nonvocational program graduates, findings based on the standard approach to cost-benefit analysis of high school vocational training programs may prove to be highly misleading guides for policy.

The quantitative effects and even the existence of ""human capital depreciation"" phenomena has been a subject of controversy in the recent literature. Prior work, however, was largely cross-sectional and theiotgitudina1 dimension, if any, was retrospective. Using longitudinal panel data (on married women in NLS) we have now established that real wages at reentry are, indeed, lower than. at the point of labor force withdrawal, and the decline in wages is bigger the longer the interruption. Another striking finding is a relatively rapid growth in wages after the return to work. This rapid growth appears to reflect the restoration (or ""repair"") of previously eroded human capital. The phenomenon of ""depreciation"" and ""restoration"" is also visible in data for immigrants to the United States. However, while immigrants eventually catch up with and often surpass natives, returnees from the non-market never fully restore their earnings potential.

The test generates some evidence consistent with the implication of debt clientele theory that, over time, firms' debt ratios should vary with the relative tax incentives which their investors have to hold debt. Changes in the relative structure of taxes, however, at best only partially account for the time series behavior of debt ratios, especially in the case of high debt firms.

The location of overseas manufacturing production by U.S. firms seems to have been strongly influenced by common factors that operate in all industries: notably proximity to the United States and to other markets. Within industries, the choices made by parent firms among locations appear to show a tendency of ""opposites attract,"" with low-wage and low-capital-intensity parents choosing high-wage, high-capital intensity countries and high-wage, high-capital-intensity parents making the opposite choice. Production for export seems to have been most strongly attracted by large internal markets in host countries. Economies of scale in production presumably made large markets also economical as export bases. Another factor was high trade propensities of host countries, which we interpret as representing access to imported materials at low world prices or better transport, finance, and other trade facilities. Labor cost seems to have been a weak influence on location choices. U.S. firms tended to export from high-wage countries but the high productivity in such countries more than offset the high wages. However, labor cost, to the extent we could measure it, was not in general a major influence on the location of export production.

In a recent article in this Journal,  Robin Boadway has argued that the appropriate requirement for neutrality is that the present value of the returns from an initial investment of [1pound], using the social discount rate, should be equal for all projects undertaken at the margin. We have few qualifications about this approach itself; although discounting with the social rate of time preference (STP) may be inappropriate in the current context. However, we would take issue with two aspects of Boadwav's application of his view of neutrality. The first problem concerns the appropriate definition of the constraint on firm leverage which would arise from the existence of limited liability. We believe Boadway's assumption to be inappropriate, and find that its replacement with what we argue to be the correct one leads to important revisions in evaluating the neutrality of different incentives. Another point we would make is that Boadway's results depend crucially on the absence of both personal taxes and inflation. We argue below that once realistic account has been taken of these important elements of the problem, general results about the neutrality of different incentives can no longer be derived, so that while Boadway's criterion may be appropriate, its application promises to be very difficult.

484,Fixed Costs and Labor Supply,['John F. Cogaj'],1980-06-01,1980-06-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This study is a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of time and money costs of labor market participation on married women's supply behavior. The existence of fixed costs implies that individuals are not willing to work less than some minimum number of hours, termed reservation hours. The theoretical analysis of the properties of the reservation hours function are derived. The empirical analysis develops and estimates labor supply functions when fixed costs are present, but cannot be observed in the data. The likelihood function developed to estimate the model is an extension of the statistical model of Heckman (1974) that allows the minimum number of hours supplied to be nonzero and differ randomly among individuals. The empirical results indicate that fixed costs of work are of prime importance in determining the labor supply behavior of married women. At the sample means, the minimum number of hours a woman is willing to work is about 1300per year. The estimated fixed costs an average woman incurs upon entry into the labor market is $920 in 1966 dollars. This represents 28 percent of her yearly earnings. Finally, labor supply parameters estimated with the fixed cost model are compared to those estimated under the conventional assumption of no fixed costs. Large differences in estimated parameters are found, suggesting that the conventional model is seriously misspecified.

This paper presents a long-run model of the open economy in a world of fixed exchange rates and imperfect substitutability between bonds denominated in different currencies. The model explicitly accounts for the wealth flow accompanying current-account imbalance and for the flow of interest payments associated with international lending. Both the dynamic and steady-state implications of the model are quite different from those of models that specify the capital account as a continuing flow responding to the level of interest rates. In particular, we find that when there exists outside government debt, open-market policy is not in general neutral in the long run. We also find conditions under which the central bank is able to hold the domestic price level constant in the face of an inflationary disturbance from abroad without exhausting, in the long run, its stock of domestic assets.

486,Economic Growth and the Rise of Service Employment,['Victor R. Fuchs'],1980-06-01,1980-06-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Industrial Organization']",['Labor Studies'],,,"

The distribution of employment among Agriculture, Industry, and Service within countries is closely related to the level of real Gross Domestic Product per capita. As real income rises, Agriculture's share falls, Service employment rises, and Industryâ€™s share rises to a peak at about $3,300 (1970 dollars) per capita and then declines. U.S. time series and OECD cross-sections follow almost identical patterns of employment change. The decline of Agriculture is attributable primarily to differences in income elasticity of demand but the shift from Industry to Service is attributable primarily to differential rates of growth of output per worker. Economic growth also contributes to the rise of service employment through an increase in female labor force participation because families with working wives tend to spend a higher proportion of their income on services. Productivity tends to grow less rapidly in the Service sector than in the rest of the economy, but the shift of employment to Services was not a major factor in the slowing of aggregate productivity in the United States in the 1970's.

Asset prices set in a competitive market need not be martingales; that is, it need not be true that the best predictor of future prices is the current price. Nonetheless, statistical tests for this property are sometimes treated as tests for the proper functioning of an asset market; asset prices often seem to have the property to a close approximation, and it is sometimes supposed that the martingale ought to be imposed on econometric models of asset markets and forecasts made from them. This paper shows that under general conditions, which allow among other things for risk aversion among market participants, competitive asset prices ought to be locally -- over small units of time  -- martingale-like. This implies that tests of proper functioning of the market ought to be conducted with data at fine time intervals; results of such tests should not be used to justify imposing the martingale property on a model's long-term projections of asset prices.

This paper summarizes the theoretical role of intertemporal substitution variables in the ""new classical macroeconomics."" An important implication is that positive monetary shocks tend to raise expected real returns that are calculated from the usual partial information set, but tend to lower realized real returns. After reviewing previous empirical findings in the area, the study reports new results on the behavior of returns on the New York Stock Exchange and on Treasury Bills. The analysis isolates realized real rate of return effects that are significantly positive for a temporary government purchases variable and significantly negative for monetary movements. However, the results do not support the theoretical distinction between money shocks and anticipated changes in money. Since the study focuses on realized real returns, which can be measured in a straightforward manner, there is no evidence on the hypothesis that expected real returns, which are calculated on the basis of incomplete in-formation, rise with monetary disturbances. Because this proposition is sensitive to the specification of information sets, It may be infeasible to test it directly.

493,Exchange Rate Risk and the Macroeconomics of Exchange Rate Determination,['Rudiger Dornbusch'],1980-06-01,1980-06-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

This paper discusses the link between portfolio diversification models of exchange risk and the macroeconomics of exchange rate determination. A first part sets out the mean-variance model of portfolio choice for the case of two nominal assets with random real returns. From there the model is made ""international"" by a specification of the world inflation process. The concept of exchange risk is discussed in terms of the variability of the real exchange rate. The paper shows that when all randomness in real returns derives from variability of the real exchange rate, rather than from inflation variability, full hedging is possible. Even for the case of no real exchange rate variability, it is shown, variability of the nominal rate of depreciation is a determinant of the portfolio composition. The risk premium is derived and discussed in terms of the deviation of the anticipated rate of depreciation from the interest differential. The actual rate of depreciation may exceed the interest differential either because of news or because of a risk premium that depends on the relative asset supplies compared to their shares in a minimum variance portfolio. An appendix investigates the implications of tastes and differences and shows that there is an additional component of the premium due to differences in consumption patterns. The portfolio model is integrated In a macro-model to show how the relative supplies of non-monetary assets, through yield and valuation effects, determine the impact and long run consequences of real and nominal monetary disturbances. The integration of the portfolio and macro models relies crucially on the properties of the demand for money. A demand for money that depend. on the average return on securities, rather than on the domestic interest rate, implies that portfolio considerations do not affect exchange rates.

The purpose of this paper is two fold. First, to estimate, using structural methods, the extent to which capital flows undermined West German monetary policy during the Bretton Woods years 1960 to 1970 and second, to show that earlier reduced form estimates of the capital-account offset coefficient are tainted by simultaneity bias thanks to the Deutsche Bundesbank's systematic policy of sterilization, and so overestimate the true coefficient. The paper distinguishes between the short-run or one-quarter offset coefficient and the long-run coefficient implied by the full adjustment of all asset markets. An aggregative structural model German financial markets yields short-run coefficients between .50 and .65implying substantial Bundesbank control over the monetary base, at least in the short-run. A formal test for simultaneous-equations bias provides evidence that variations in domestic credit cannot be regarded as exogenous and that equations regressing capital flows on changes in domestic credit and other variables exaggerate the extent of the offset.

It is well understood that a tax which distorts relative prices generates a welfare cost or ""excess burden"" in addition to any associated transfer of resources, but there remains considerable controversy and confusion with respect to procedures for measuring this excess burden. The purpose of this paper is to clarify matters concerning what is one of the most basic concepts in welfare economics. We describe and evaluate a number of alternative conceptual experiments which might lie behind an excess burden calculation, showing how these notions can be represented graphically and algebraically and how they can be approximated numerically.

499,On the Almost Neutrality of Inflation:  Notes on Taxation and the Welfare Costs of Inflation,['Joseph E. Stiglitz'],1980-07-01,1980-07-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

In this paper I attempt to clarify the nature of the losses associated with inflation within a conventional model of a competitive economy. I shall argue that were inflation fully anticipated, it would be ""almost neutral"" provided (a) that the tax system were fully indexed and (b) that interest were paid on bank deposits (as to an increasing extent it is in the United States). However, unanticipated inflation may have significant effects.

500,The Transmission of Disturbances under Alternative Exchange-Rate Regimeswith Optimal Indexing,"['Robert P. Flood', 'Nancy Peregrim Marion']",1980-07-01,1980-07-01,,['International Economics'],"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

The paper develops a general stochastic macroeconomic model which can be used to study the international transmission of disturbances under alternative exchange-rate systems. Four types of exchange-rate systems are considered: uniform flexible exchange rates, uniform fixed exchange rates, two-tier exchange rates in which the current-account exchange rate is fixed and the capital-account exchange rate is flexible, and two-tier exchange rates with separate, floating rates for current and capital-account transactions. It is assumed that expectations are rational, so only the unexpected portion of macro policy alters the level of output. In addition, private contracts form the underpinning of the aggregate supply function, and they can be adjusted optimally in response to the country's choice of exchange-rate regime. It is shown that when the home country takes all prices as exogenous and wages are optimally indexed, the country is fully insulated from foreign disturbances under the two fixed-rate regimes but not under the two flexible-rate regimes. Even so, the fixed-rate regimes are inferior to the flexible-rate regimes in terms of their ability to minimize output variance. When the home country is large in the market for its own produced good, these results must be modified. The analysis makes two general points. First, one cannot assume stability of structure when assessing the consequences of alternative exchange-rate regimes. For example, the slope of the aggregate supply curve and the rationally-formed expectations in the asset markets can respond dramatically to the government's choice of exchange-rate regime. Second, exchange-rate regimes that provide full insulation from foreign disturbances may nevertheless be inferior to other regimes in terms of their ability to maximize social welfare.

This paper introduces an imported input into a model of art open economy with developed financial markets, a flexible exchange rate, and some degree of market power on the export side. The model is designed to investigate the impact of an increase in imported input prices on the exchange rate, domestic interest rate, income and nontraded-goods prices. The analysis reveals that changes in various structural parameters, such as the degree of market power or the extent of demand-side openness"" or ""financial openness,"" alter the transmission of foreign price disturbances to the domestic economy.

The optimal timing of real investment is studied under the assumptions that investment is irreversible and that new information about returns is arriving over time. Investment should be undertaken in this case only when the costs of deferring the project exceed the expected value of information gained by waiting. Uncertainty, because it increases the value of waiting for new information, retards the current rate of investment. The nature of investor's optimal reactions to events whose implications are resolved over time is a possible explanation of the instability of aggregate investment over the business cycle.

503,Modeling Price Rigidity or Predicting the Quality of the Good that Clears the Market,['Dennis W. Carlton'],1980-07-01,1980-07-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

To say that the price of some good is inflexible over time has little meaning if the ""good"" is changing over time. In this paper we concentrate on delivery lags as being the only dimension other than price that varies. We show how one can predict the relative importance of price and delivery lag fluctuations as equilibrating mechanisms. The complications of the theory as well as the surprising results underscore the complexity of predicting price behavior when the characteristics of the good are endogenous. The empirical results provide strong support for the theory that delivery lags are an important influence on market behavior and therefore that an understanding of their influence is crucial in predicting how markets will respond to supply and demand shocks.

The purpose of this paper is to review theoretical analysis and results of empirical research on the effects of taxation on private saving and economic welfare.  One basic conclusion of section II is that long-established results of theoretical analysis are often ignored or misunderstood by economists, as well as by policy-makers, and the lessons of more recent theoretical analyses of optimal taxation have been only dimly perceived. This generally inadequate conceptual state of affairs is mirrored in empirical analysis, the subject of section III, where it appears that the few serious scholars working at trying to untangle the effects of taxation on saving and welfare have not always been asking -- or even recognizing -- the ""right""questions. But the problems of empirical analysis go beyond those that result from failure to frame the research question carefully. Limitations posed by inadequate data and econometric difficulties make it difficult even to arrive at a satisfactory answer to the wrong question.

We investigate the stochastic relation between income and consumption (specifically, consumption of food) within a panel of about 2,000 households. Our major findings are: 1. Consumption responds much more strongly to permanent than to transitory movements of income. 2. The response to transitory income is nonetheless clearly positive. 3. A simple test, independent of our model of consumption, rejects a central implication of the pure life cycle-permanent income hypothesis. The observed covariation of income and consumption is compatible with pure life cycle-permanent income behavior on the part of80 percent of families and simple proportionality of consumption and income among the remaining 20 percent. As a general matter, our findings support the view that families respond differently to different sources of income variations. In particular, temporary income tax policies have smaller effects on consumption than do other, more permanent changes in income of the same magnitude.

506,Does Anticipated Monetary Policy Matter?  An Econometric Investigation,['Frederic S. Mishkin'],1980-07-01,1980-07-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Econometrics']",['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Recent theorizing with business cycle models which incorporate features of the Friedman-Phelps natural rate model along with rational expectations lead to the following policy conclusions. Anticipated changes in aggregate demand policy will have already been taken into account in economic agents behavior and will thus evoke no further output or employment response. Therefore, deterministic feedback policy rules will have no impact on output fluctuations in the economy. These policy implications of what Modigliani has dubbed the Macro Rational Expectations (MRE) hypothesis are of such importance that a wide range of empirical research is needed for its verification or refutation. Recent empirical work has tested the ""neutrality"" implication of the MRE hypothesis that anticipated monetary policy does not affect output or unemployment. Although this empirical work has frequently been favorable to the MRE hypothesis, it suffers from several deficiencies that create suspicion about the robustness of the results. This paper is an attempt to conduct an econometric investigation of the implications of the MRE hypothesis which does not suffer from these deficiencies. The results here strongly reject the neutrality implications of the MRE hypothesis: unanticipated movements in monetary policy are not found to have a larger impact on output and unemployment than anticipated movements. This evidence casts doubt on previous evidence that is cited as supporting the view that only unanticipated monetary policy is relevant to the business cycle.

508,State and Local Taxes and the Rate of Return on Nonfinancial Corporate  Capital (revised as W0740),"['Martin Feldstein', 'James M. Poterba']",1980-07-01,1980-07-01,,,"['Public Economics', 'Monetary Economics']",,,"

Although states and localities collect a substantial amount of revenue from corporate profits taxes and property taxes on corporate capital, these taxes have been inadequately reflected in previous calculations of the effective corporate tax rate and the pretax rate of return to corporate capital. The present study focuses on non-financial corporations and begins by estimating the profits taxes and property taxes which these corporations pay to state and local governments. These estimates are then used to calculate the pretax rate of return on non-financial corporate capital; the results suggest that the conventional omission of state-local property taxes leads to an understatement of this rate of return by about one percentage point. The effective tax rate on non-financial corporate profits is also computed, taking account of state-local taxes. These taxes amount to approximately sixteen percent of the pretax profits of non-financial corporations. The total effective tax rate on these corporations is shown to have risen substantially during the past two decades; it averaged more than seventy percent in the most recent five-year period. The series for the rate of return and effective tax rate are used to compute the real after-tax rate of return on non-financial corporate capital. The calculations show that this number has declined recently, reaching 2.3 percent in 1979. This is to be contrasted with after-tax returns of over five percent which prevailed during the mid-1960s.

This paper examines empirically the effect of unfunded pension obligations on corporate share prices and discusses the implications of these estimates for national saving, the decline of the stock market in recent years, and the rationality of corporate financial behavior. The analysis uses the information on inflation-adjusted income and assets that large firms were required to provide for 1976 and subsequent years. The evidence for a sample of nearly 200 manufacturing firms is consistent with the conclusion that share prices fully reflect the value of unfunded pension obligations. Since the conventional accounting measure of the unfunded pension liability has a number of problems (which we examine in the paper), it would be more accurate to say that the data are consistent with the conclusion that shareholders accept the conventional measure as the best available information and reduce share prices by a corresponding amount. The most important implication of the share price response is that the existence of unfunded private pension liabilities does not necessarily entail a reduction in total private saving. Because the pension liability reduces the equity value of the firm, shareholders are given notice of its existence and an incentive to save more themselves. For this reason, unfunded private pensions differ fundamentally from the unfunded Social Security pension and the other unfunded federal government civilian and military pensions.

The paper develops frequency distribution of annual health expense for a variety of family compositions. The basic data resource was a sample of claims for a large group of federal employees in 1977. The primary data were compared in several aspects against three other sources of reference data on expenses by the non-aged population; the comparisons were reassuring. The method of convolution is used to obtain family frequency distributions from the distribution for individual adults and children. This technique is necessary when the claims data do not record family com-position. In consequence, the results may not be nationally representative of households which are relatively large or affected by unemployment. Aside from this special reservation, the experience of the non-elderly federal employee families seems to be a useful resource for policy analysis.

This paper is a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing production location decisions by a multinational corporation. It starts with a simple model of optimization for a firm facing the choice between exporting and producing abroad a single differentiated final product and then develops the model to take account of production of intermediate as well as final products, the existence of scale economies, and finally, the effects of transport cost and of factors affecting the cost of production. The share of foreign output is shown to be related to the level of transport cost, to the size of host-country markets, to host-country wage levels relative to those of the home country, in combination with labor intensities of production. All of these relationships in turn are shown to interact in various ways with economies of scale in affecting the choice of production locations.

513,"Market Wages, Reservation Wages, and Retirement Decisions","['Roger H. Gordon', 'Alan S. Blinder']",1980-07-01,1980-07-01,,"['Labor Economics', 'Public Economics']",,,,"

The paper is an empirical cross-section study of the retirement decisions of American white men between the ages of 58 and 67. predicated on the theoretical notion that an individual retires when his reservation wage exceeds his market wage. Reservation wages are derived from an explicit utility function in which the most critical taste parameter is assumed to vary both systematically and randomly across individuals. Market wages are derived from a standard wage equation adjusted to the special circumstances of older workers. The two equations are estimated jointly by maximum likelihood, which takes into account the potential selectivity bias inherent in the model (low-wage individuals tend to retire and cease reporting their market wage). The model is reasonably successful in predicting retirement decisions, and casts serious doubt on previous claims that the social security system induces many workers to retire earlier than they otherwise would. The normal effects of aging (on both market and reservation wages) and the incentives set up by private pension plans are estimated to be major causes of retirement.

Demographic differences in patterns of employment variation over the business cycle are examined in this paper. Three primary conclusions emerge. First, both participation and unemployment must be considered in any analysis of cyclical changes in the labor market. Second, young people bear a disproportionate share of cyclical employment variation. Third, failure to consider participation has led to undue pessimism about the effect of aggregate demand policy on high unemployment groups. If participation did not surge, reduction in overall unemployment to its 1969 level would reduce the unemployment of almost all demographic groups to very low levels.

After a brief review of actual practice in the evaluation of country risk, the paper discusses a number of modifications in the standard theory of efficient international financial markets that are necessitated by the existence of country risk., For macroeconomic policy, the major implications are that domestic and foreign assets become imperfect substitutes and that world demand for domestic assets is likely to be less than perfectly elastic, even in the ""small country"" case, Even under a fixed exchange rate, a measure of domestic control over domestic interest rates therefore exists.

This paper is an application of efficient markets theory to analyze empirically the relationship of money supply growth and long-term interest rates. This approach has the advantage over earlier research on this subject in that it imposes a theoretical structure on this relationship that allows easier interpretation of the empirical results as well as more powerful statistical tests. In the interest of ascertaining the robustness of the results, many different empirical tests are carried out in this paper, and they uniformly do not support the proposition that increases in the money supply are correlated with declines in long rates.

520,Transition Losses of Partially Mobile Industry-Specific Capital,['Don Fullerton'],1980-07-01,1980-07-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

Comparative static models typically assume homogeneous and mobile factors in estimating the economic effects of a tax policy change. Even dynamic models employ a given homogeneous capital stock in two different al locations for the first period of two equilibrium sequences. This malleable capital assumption causes overstatement of early efficiency gains from policies designed to improve factor allocation. on the other hand, immobile factor models would understate such gains by assuming that no capital ever relocates. The model in this paper attempts to bridge this gap by restricting each industry's capital reduction to its rate of depreciation. The stock of depreciated capital from the previous period represents an industry-specific type of capital which may earn a lower equilibrium return. The usage of mobile capital above this minimum constraint is limited by the total gross saving of the economy, including all industries' depreciation and consumer net saving. The industry-specific capital model suggests, for example, that previous estimates of the dynamic efficiency gain from full integration of personal and corporate taxes in the U.S. are overstated by about $5 billion. The model could also be used to estimate distributional impacts on individuals with more than proportionate ownership of capital in particular industries.

The paper analyzes the problem of short-term adjustment to a fall in the price of competing imports when thee is wage and price rigidity. This is done in terms of a two-sector model which incorporates a domestically producible import good and a semi-tradeable home good. The effect of a fall in import prices on domestic employment, prices and the balance of payments under nominal or real wage rigidity is analyzed in the various market disequilibrium regimes. The possible responses in terms of demand management and exchange rate (or tariff) policy as well as supply management are analyzed. The theory is then applied to the stagflationary environment of the 1970s within a modified framework in which the price of imported raw materials has simultaneously risen. This helps to show how the above adjustment problem crucially depends on the nature of the underlying macroeconomic environment.

523,Aggregate Land Rents and Aggregate Transport Costs,"['Richard J. Arnott', 'Joseph E. Stiglitz']",1980-07-01,1980-07-01,,['Environmental and Resource Economics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper explores the relationship between aggregate land rents and aggregate transport costs for land markets in which locations differ solely in terms of accessibility. That there exists a relationship between land rents and transport costs has been recognized at least since the time of von Thunen. The precise relationship between the two is, however, not generally well-understood. For instance, until quite recently it was considered correct to estimate the benefits from a transport improvement by the induced change in aggregate land rents at those locations where travel costs are reduced. This procedure can be shown to be correct only in very special circumstances. This paper presents a very general characterization of the relationship between aggregate land rents and aggregate transport costs. In some special cases, the relationship turns out to be remarkably simple: for a circular city with linear transport costs, aggregate transport costs are precisely twice aggregate land rents, independent of the distribution of tastes or income; for a linear city with linear transport costs, aggregate transport costs are equal to aggregate land rents. One corollary of our general analysis is that aggregate land rents may stay the same or actually fall in response to a transport improvement which makes everyone better off. In the first section we consider a simple example. The second derives the basic theorems of the paper, while the third examines their implications for the relationship between the benefits from a transport improvement and the change in aggregate land rents induced by the improvement. And in the fourth section, we examine the extent to which the theorems of section II generalize.

Previous models of the demand for money are either inconsistent with contemporaneous adjustment of the price level to expected changes in the nominal money supply or imply implausible fluctuations in interest rates in response to unexpected changes in the nominal money supply. This paper proposes a shock-absorber model of money demand in which money supply shocks affect the synchronization of purchases and sales of assets and so engender a temporary desire to hold more or less money than would otherwise be the case. Expected changes in nominal money do not cause fluctuations in real money inventories. The model is simultaneously estimated for the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands using the postwar quarterly data set and instruments used in the Mark III International Transmission Model. The shock-absorber variables significantly improve the estimated short-run money demand functions in every case.

The analysis shows the importance of going beyond the traditional assumption that net-of-tax yields are equated for all assets.

Keven (1975)showed that use of a current account indicator alone would not stabi1iereserves, while a reserve indicator results in unstable fluctuations in the exchange rate. This paper begins by analyzing the problem in the frame work of Phillips (1954), in which the current account indicator is ""proportional"" and the reserve indicator is ""integral."" We then analyze the problem in a deterministic optimal control framework, and finally as a problem in stochastic control. In all cases the optimal combination is a weighted average, which we call the Keven-Phillips formula. With a fairly low variance of the current account, its weight falls in the range 0.47-0.65. Rising variance reduces its weight in the optimal formula.

529,The Historical Evolution of Female Earnings Functions and Occupations,['Claudia D. Goldin'],1980-08-01,1980-08-01,,,['Development of the American Economy'],,,"

Of all the changes in the history of women's market work, few have been more impressive than the rapid emergence and feminization of the clerical sector and the related decline in manufacturing employment for women. Although a century ago few women were clerical workers, as early as 1920 22% of all employed non-farm women were, and about 50% of all clerical workers were women. Employment for women in the clerical sector expanded at five times the annual rate in manufacturing from 1890 to 1930, and during the same period of time wages for female clerical workers fell relative to those in manufacturing. This paper explores the underlying causes of these dramatic sectoral shifts by estimating the relationship between earnings and experience for manufacturing and clerical workers from 1888 to 1940. It is seen that earnings profiles for employment in manufacturing rose steeply with experience and peaked early, while those in the clerical sector were much flatter and did not peak within the relevant range. Returns to off-job training and depreciation with age and with time away from the labor force also differed between these occupations. A model of sectoral shift is developed in which workers choose occupations and therefore the time path of training on the basis of their life-cycle labor force participation and their consumption value of education. The coefficients from the earnings function estimations are used to demonstrate that the decline in the relative wage of clerical to manufacturing work from 1890 to 1930 can be explained by such a model, Finally, it is shown that a sizable percentage of the difference in the growth of female employment in the manufacturing and clerical sectors can be explained by various labor supply factors.

The paper provides a theoretical framework for analyzing policy formation among independent authorities operating in an interdependent environment. This is then applied to the analysis of optimal monetary policy in a stochastic two-country model with rational expectations. The main conclusions are 1) Optimal monetary policy requires a finite response of the money supply to the exchange rate (which is the only contemporaneously observed variable.) Neither a fixed nor a freely floating exchange rate is likely to be optimal. 2) Output stabilizing monetary policy may well require 'leaning with the wind' in the foreign exchange market, expanding the money supply when the home currency depreciates, thus increasing the volatility of the exchange rate. 3) The ability of the monetary authorities to influence real variables is due to the assumption that the private sector does not make exchange rate-contingent forward contracts.4) There are likely to be gains from policy coordination.

533,The Tax Advantages of Pension Fund Investments in Bonds,['Fischer Black'],1980-08-01,1980-08-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

I believe that every tax-paying firm's defined benefit pension fund portfolio should be invested entirely in bonds (or insurance contracts). Although the firm's pension funds are legally distinct from the firm, there is a close tie between the performance of the pension fund investments and the firm's cash flows. Sooner or later, gains or losses In pension fund portfolios will mean changes in the firm's pension contributions. Shifting from stocks to bonds in the pension funds will increase the firm's debt capacity, because it will reduce the volatility of the firm's future cash flows. Shifting from stocks to bonds in the pension funds will give an indirect tax benefit equal to the firm's marginal tax rate times the interest on the bonds. There is no indirect tax benefit if the pension funds are invested in stocks. Fully implementing the plan will mean shifting all of the stocks in the pension fund to fixed income investments, and putting all new contributions into fixed income investments. Shifting $2 million from stocks to bonds has a present value for the firm's stockholders of about $1 million. Shifting from stocks to bonds in the pension funds will reduce the firm's leverage. To offset this, the firm can issue more debt than it otherwise would have issued. The money raised can be invested in the firm or used to buy back the firm's stock. This version of the plan, with more bonds in the pension fund and more debt on the firm's balance sheet, is equivalent to the following transactions: (1)sell a portfolio of stocks on which no taxes are paid, and buy the firm's stock on which no taxes are paid; and (2) issue the firm's bonds at an after-tax interest rate, and buy other firm's bonds at a before-tax interest rate.

534,"Incomplete Information, Risk Shifting, and Employment Fluctuations",['Herschel I. Grossman'],1980-08-01,1980-08-01,,['Other'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

This paper explores one of the ways in which acceptance of the hypothesis that labor market transactions involve arrangements for shifting risk from workers to employers strengthens the case for accepting the hypothesis that incomplete information is the critical factor in producing the positive effect of aggregate demand for output on aggregate employment. The analysis shows that the introduction of risk-shifting arrangements into models of incomplete information eliminates the dependence of the relation between aggregate demand and aggregate employment on the relative strengths of the usual substitution and income effects on labor supply of perceived real wage rates or perceived real interest rates. In addition, the analysis shows that the apparent fact that workers choose an amount of risk shifting that gives them constant nominal wage rates implies that incomplete information would produce a positive effect of aggregate demand on aggregate employment. The key to these results is that risk shifting allows workers to use the value of product associated with high levels of demand to supplement the income associated with low levels of demand. Consequently, they can choose high employment instates of high demand without causing a corresponding reduction in their expected marginal utility of consumption.

535,Some Aspects of the Canadian Experience with Flexible Exchange Rates in the 1970s,"['Charles Freedman', 'David Longworth']",1980-08-01,1980-08-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

In this study, the authors examine three aspects of the Canadian experience with flexible exchange rates in the 1970s: the movements in the Canadian dollar-U.S. dollar exchange rate, the sharp growth of external borrowings by Canadians in the 1974-76 period, and the real effects of relative price movements. Several theoretical and empirical exchange rate models are found to have done poorly in explaining the movements of the value of the Canadian dollar over the decade. In the examination of external borrowings in the mid-1970s, it is concluded that there was some response in borrower and lender behaviour to movements in nominal long-term interest rate differentials. Four sources of explanation for such behaviour are examined. A three-sector model comprising non-tradable goods, resource-based tradable goods and non resource-based tradable goods, is used to study the effects of changes in raw material prices, domestic unit labour costs, and the exchange rate on various real variables in the Canadian economy.

539,Time Preference and Health: An Exploratory Study,['Victor R. Fuchs'],1980-08-01,1980-08-01,,['Public Economics'],['Health Economics'],,,"

This paper reports the results of an exploratory survey designed to measure differences in time preference across individuals and to test for relationships between time preference and schooling, health behaviors, and health status. Approximately 500 adults age 25-64 were surveyed by telephone. Time preference was measured by a series of six questions asking the respondent to choose between a sum of money now and a larger sum at a specific point in the future. Approximately two-thirds gave consistent replies to the six questions. The implicit interest rate revealed in their replies is weakly correlated with years of schooling (negative), cigarette smoking (positive), and health status(negative). Family background, especially religion, appears to be an important determinant of time preference.

This paper studies the macroeconomic effects of an increase in the price of an imported intermediate production input. The framework of the analysis is a small open economy with abating exchange rate and endogenous terms if trade, in which saving depends on residents'(variable) rate of time preference. Contrary to popular conceptions, an intermediate price shock may lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate in both the short run and the long run, and is likely to occasion a current-account surplus. The terms of trade between foreign and domestic finished goods always improve in the long run.

541,Three Papers on Brazilian Trade and Payments,"['Eliana A. Cardoso', 'Rudiger Dornbusch']",1980-09-01,1980-09-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

This report brings together three separate, short papers on problems of Brazilian trade and payments. The following topics are addressed: the determinants of export behavior in the manufactures sector, measures of the real exchange rate and the monetary approach applied to the external balance. In the paper on export behavior of manufactures, we report estimates of an export supply equation. We show that for the period 1959-1977 exports of manufactures were determined by productive capacity, the relative price (inclusive of subsidies) facing exporters and the domestic output gap. The equation describes well the behavior of exports and documents on export price elasticity of unity and a significant responsiveness of exports to the level of domestic demand relative to capacity. The study of real exchange rates examines a number of different empirical measures of external competitiveness. Specifically, we look at the manufactures terms of trade, the relative wholesale prices in Brazil and abroad, export prices relative to home prices and export prices relative to prices in world trade. The comparison of these real exchange rate measures points out the important role that composition effects played in Brazilian export growth. A large fraction of Brazilian exports is in the area of processed foods that experienced a particularly sharp increase in their relative price in world trade in 1968-1974. The paper dealing with the monetary approach explains reserve and exchange rate behavior in terms of domestic credit and the determinants of nominal money demand. It corrects earlier estimates in the literature and, while sustaining the success of a monetary approach, it also qualifies that approach by drawing attention to the role of monetary liabilities of the consolidated banking, system.

542,Expected Inflation and Equity Prices: A Structural Econometric Approach,['David S. Jones'],1980-09-01,1980-09-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the effects of expected inflation on the general level of common stock prices using a structural rather than a reduced-form approach. To this end, an aggregative partial-equilibrium structural econometric model of the U.S. equity market is constructed using quarterly flow-of-funds data. The primary endogenous variable in this model is the Standard and Poor's Index of 500 Common Stock Prices, P. After passing several standard validation exercises he model is used to perform a number of simulation experiments designed o assess the impact of expected inflation on P. To anticipate, we find that increases in expected inflation depress current equity prices by bout the same amount as found in a related study of Modigliani and Cohn: a l00 basis point increase in expected inflation, holding real interest rates constant, is predicted to lower the general level of equity prices by 7.8%. In the course of constructing the structural equity market model equity demand equations are estimated for households, life insurance companies, open-end investment companies, property and casualty insurance companies, and state and local government retirement systems. Equations are also estimated for the demand for mutual fund shares by households and equity issues by U.S. nonfinancial corporations.

The paper is a study of the price level and relative price effects of a policy to monetize gold and fix its price at a given future time and at the then prevailing nominal price. Price movements are analyzed both during the transition to the gold standard and during the post-monetization period. The paper also explores the adjustments to fiat money which are necessary to ensure that this type of gold monetization is non-inflationary. Finally, some conditions which produce a run on the government's gold stock leading to the collapse of the gold standard and the timing of such a run are examined.

In a number of influential recent papers, Taylor (1979a, b; 1980a, b) has analyzed the behaviour of an economy characterized by staggered over-lapping wage contracts and rational expectations. His model has the ""Keynesian"" feature that the second moment of the distribution function of real output is not invariant under changes in the deterministic (and known) components of monetary policy rules. The reason for this is the inertia in the money wage process induced by the staggered multi-period contracts and the assumption that the wage payments due in any given period under the contract are not ""indexed"", that is not made contingent on the actually realized values of such nominal variables as the general price level. We retain the crucial assumption of multi-period (staggered) non-contingent contracts but wish to examine the consequences of altering Taylor's assumption that wage bargainers are influenced by relative money wages rather than relative real wages. In Taylor's model money wage contracts are negotiated without reference to past, current and expected future prices. Our suggested modification that wage bargainers are influenced by relative real wages, which we consider somewhat more plausible, has some interesting implications for the empirical estimation of models with staggered wage contracts (see especially Taylor, 1980b).

This paper explores the portfolio behavior of investors differing with respect to both tax rates and risk-aversion, emphasizing the role of constraints on individual and firm behavior in ensuring the existence of and characterizing portfolio equilibrium. Under certain conditions on the securities available in the market, which also are required for shareholders to be unanimous in supporting firm value maximization, investors will be segmented by tax rate into two groups, one specialized in equity and the other in debt. Though the relative wealths of the two groups determines the aggregate debt-equity ratio, each firm will be indifferent to its financial policy.

547,Inflation and the Tax Treatment of Firm Behavior,['Alan J. Auerbach'],1980-09-01,1980-09-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Financial Economics']",['Public Economics'],,,"

In the past decade, economists have be-gun to realize that inflation, even when fully anticipated, constitutes a great deal more than a tax on money balances. The primary reason for inflation's wider impact is the existence of a tax system designed with stable prices in mind. This paper offers a brief summary of the effects of inflation on the tax treatment of the firm, focusing on four important decisions the firm makes: the scale of investment; the method of finance; the durability of assets used in production; and the holding period of these assets. There are a number of interesting and related issues which cannot be covered in a paper of this length. As I will be considering inflation that is both uniform and fully anticipated, questions concerning the behavior of the firm in response to uncertainty about inflation, or to a concommitant change in relative prices, will not arise.

Just as war is too important to be left to the generals, the impact of taxes and transfers on the aggregate unemployment rate is too important to be left to the macroeconomists. I therefore subject the issue of how tax and transfer policy affects unemployment and aggregate supply to a detailed, microeconomic examination of the effects of individual tax and transfer program structures. This inductive approach is, I believe, likely to provide a far better guide to discovering how changes in these policies have worked through the economy than would a macroeconomic approach that ignored the programs' complexities.

551,The Variance and Acceleration of Inflation in the 1970s: Alternative Explanatory Models and Methods,"['Jon Frye', 'Robert J. Gordon']",1980-09-01,1980-09-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

The paper attributes the behavior of U.S. inflation to four sets of factors: aggregate demand shifts; government intervention in the form of the Nixon price controls and changes in the social security tax rate and the effective minimum wage; external supply shocks that include the impact of the changing relative prices of food and energy, the depreciation of the dollar, and the aggregate productivity slowdown: and inertia that makes the inflation rate depend partly on its own lagged values. Considerable attention is given to alternative methods of measuring the impact of government intervention, including the Nixon controls, Kennedy- Johnson guideposts, and the Carter pay standards. The results imply that direct intervention has been futile, since the guidelines and pay standards had no effect at all on inflation, while the Nixon-era controls had only a temporary impact that stabilized both the inflation rate and the level of real output. Some previous studies have had a problem in explaining why inflation was so rapid in 1974 and have been forced to conclude that the termination of the Nixon controls raised prices more than the imposition of controls had lowered them. We find that much of the explanation of rapid inflation in 1974 is the same as that in 1979-80: the shortfall of productivity growth below its ever-slowing trend rate of growth raised business costs and forced-extra price increases, and the depreciation of the dollar in 1971-73 and 1978 boosted the prices of exports and import substitutes, Rapid demand growth, the 1979-80 oil shock, the depreciation of the dollar, the productivity slow- down, and payroll tax increases all help to explain why the inflation rate accelerated between 1976 and 1980 by much more than was generally expected two or three years ago.

553,"Inflation, Income Taxes, and Owner-Occupied Housing",['James M. Poterba'],1980-09-01,1980-09-01,,"['Public Economics', 'Macroeconomics']",['Public Economics'],,,"

Owner-occupied housing receives favorable treatment under current tax law for several reasons. A homeowner's imputed rent is not taxed, and mortgage interest payments are tax deductible. Many past studies have analyzed the effects of these provisions. Inflation's importance in determining the implicit subsidy to owner-occupied housing has received less attention. Since home- owners can deduct their nominal mortgage payments, they do not bear the full cost of higher interest rates. They also receive essentially untaxed capital gains on their homes during periods of high inflation. The after-tax capital gains outweigh the higher after-tax interest payments, so inflation reduces the effective cost of homeownership. This paper develops a simple model to estimate the effect of higher expected inflation rates on the real price of houses and the equilibrium housing stock. Simulation results suggest that the inflation-tax interactions can have a substantial impact on the housing market. The increases in expected inflation during the 1970s could have accounted for as much as a thirty percent increase in real house prices. Over time, builders should respond to higher home prices and increase the amount of new construction. The persistence of current inflation rates could lead ultimately to a twenty percent increase in the housing stock.

This paper develops a simple theoretical model of the effect of an oil price increase on exchange rates. The model shows that the direction of this effect depends on a comparison of the direct balance of payments burden of the higher oil price with the indirect balance of payments benefits of OPEC spending and investment. In the short run, what matters is whether the U.S. share of world oil imports is more or less than its share of OPEC asset holdings; in the long run, whether its share of oil imports is more or less than its share of OPEC imports. Casual empiricism suggests that the initial effect and the long run effect will run in opposite directions: an oil price increase will initially lead to dollar appreciation, but eventually leads to dollar depreciation.

This paper uses contemporaneous monetary data to carry out econometric tests of the ""equilibrium"" approach to modeling the relation between monetary disturbances and macroeconomic fluctuations. The theoretical analysis introduces into an equilibrium macroeconomic model the availability of preliminary data on current monetary aggregates and the process of accumulation of revised monetary data. The econometric analysis tests two hypotheses derived from this extended model. One hypothesis concerns the neutrality of perceived monetary policy. The other hypothesis concerns the nonneutrality of errors in preliminary monetary data. The econometric results imply rejection of both of these hypotheses. These tests provide strong evidence against the reality of the equilibrium approach.

Though the U.S. labor market is justly notorious for high turnover and consequent high unemployment, it also provides stable, near-lifetime employment to an important fraction of the labor force. This paper investigates patterns of job duration by age, race, and sex, with the following major conclusions: 1. The typical worker today is holding a job which has lasted or will last about eight years. Over a quarter of all workers are holding jobs which will last twenty years or more. Sixty percent hold jobs which will last five years or more. 2. The jobs held by middle-aged workers with more than ten years of tenure are extremely stable. Over the span of a decade, only twenty to thirty percent come to an end. 3. Among workers aged thirty and above, about forty percent are currently working in jobs which eventually will last twenty years or more. Three-quarters are in jobs which will last five years or more.4. The duration of employment among blacks is just as long as among whites. Even though the jobs held by blacks are worse in almost every other dimension, they are no more unstable than those held by whites. 5. Women's jobs are substantially shorter than men's, on the average. Only about a quarter of all women over the age of thirty are employed in jobs which will last over twenty years, whereas over half of men over thirty are holding these near-lifetime jobs.

This is a first report from a larger study of inventive activity of U.S. firms and some of its consequences. It reports on the relationship between patents applied for and R&D expenditures based on data for 121 large corporations covering the 1968-1975 period. The main conclusion is that there is a statistically significant relationship between a firm's R&D expenditures and the number of patents it applied for and receives. This relationship is very strong in the cross-sectional dimension (squared partial correlations of .8 or higher). It is weaker in the within-firm time-series dimension (partial r[squared]'s of .2 to .3). Attempts to fit an unconstrained distributed lag relationship yields only significant coefficients for the first and last terms in the lag structure, indicating both a quick response of patenting to changes in R&D and a small but persistent effect of past R&D, the truncation of this long lag being reflected in a significant coefficient for R&D lagged five years. In spite of these difficulties, patent counts do measure something systematic and hence are worthy of further study.

This paper shows that, contrary to commonly held views, the provisions of the social security law actually provide strong work incentives for older men. The reason is that, for most workers, higher current earnings lead to higher future social security benefits. These incentives have been particularly strong for workers under 65 years of age and, although they will be reduced somewhat when the 1977 amendments to the social security law become fully effective, they will remain substantial. The findings raise serious questions about recent econometric work attributing the decline in labor force participation rates of older men to the social security system.

565,The Use of Volatility Measures in Assessing Market Efficiency,['Robert J. Shiller'],1980-10-01,1980-10-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

My initial motivation for considering volatility measures in the efficient markets models was to clarify the basic smoothing properties of the models to allow an understanding of the assumptions which are implicit in the notion of market efficiency. The efficient markets models, which are described in section II below ,relate a price today to the expected present value of a path of future variables. Since present values are long weighted moving averages, it would seem that price data should be very stable and smooth. These impressions can be formalized in terms of inequalities describing certain variances (section III). The results ought to be of interest whether or not the data satisfy these inequalities, and the procedures ought not to be regarded as just ""another test"" of market efficiency. Our confidence of our understanding of empirical phenomena is enhanced when we learn how such an obvious property of data as its ""smoothness"" relates to the model, and to alternative models (section IV below).On further examination of the volatility inequalities, it became clear that the inequalities may also suggest formal tests of market efficiency that have distinct advantages over conventional tests. These advantages take the form of greater power in certain circumstances of robustness to data errors such as misalignment and of simplicity and understandability. An interpretation of volatility tests versus regression tests in terms of the likelihood principle is offered in section V.

This report presents two unrelated, short papers on exchange rate rules and on the real value of the external debt. The paper on exchange rate policy uses the Taylor model of overlapping, long term wage contracts to ask whether accommodating or PPP oriented exchange rate policies tend to stabilize output. In earlier work I had shown that exchange rate indexing, while destabilizing prices enhances the stability of output. The result is qualified hereby showing that the exchange rate not only affects aggregate demand directly but operates also, through the cost of imported intermediates, on the price level. It is shown that unless monetary policy is sufficiently accommodating this latter effect may dominate with the consequence that increased exchange rate indexation reduces output stability .The paper on the real value of external debt poses the question how to integrate external debt holdings in the traditional framework used to evaluate the effects on real income of changes in world prices. It is shown that integrating debt service liabilities in a comprehensive income measure makes real disposable income equal to the value of output less the real value of real interest payments on the external debt. Furthermore, with the CPI being the appropriate deflator for foreign debt, a rise in export prices raises income in proportion to exports while a rise in import prices lowers real income in proportion to Imports. The proper accounting of debt in a comprehensive income framework, noting the intertemporal budget constraints, thus restores the conventional treatment of the income effects of price changes.

This paper represents the first empirical application of a model of trade union behavior that has been discussed in the literature for over thirty years. The wages and employment o typographers are examined to see whether they can be usefully characterized as the outcome of a process by which the union maximizes an objective function containing wages and employment and is constrained by a trade-off between these two variables as represented by the employer's labor demand function. Our functional form assumptions permit investigation of some familiar special cases of union behavior. We find the parameter implications of both the wage bill maximization hypothesis and the rent maximization hypothesis to provide inferior explanations of the movement of wages and employment of these workers compared with our more general formulation.

Almost all developed economies at some time during the 1970s seemed supply-constrained. Even much of measured excess capacity was arguably redundant due to energy price shocks, environmental policy, and other structural flux of the 1970s. Little analytical work has been carried out on the macroeconomics of open economies under such supply constraints. This paper attempts a beginning. Its focus is on the international transmission of various macroeconomic shocks, and on their implications for the current account, capital account, and exchange rate. The paper captures both the foreign repercussions and the terms-of-trade effects of various shocks. Conclusions are based on an analytical model that assigns behavior to each of two regions relating to one nontradeable input, one tradeable output, and one tradeable financial asset. International exchange between the two regions is characterized by sequential ""temporary equilibria,"" each consistent with economically and institutionally constrained optimization, yet each simultaneously consistent with failure of output and input markets to clear. International transactions take place in capital markets and through a foreign exchange market that do clear continuously through flexible exchange rates. The abstract reduced form of the model is derived, then applied empirically, using parameters and initial values that incorporate data and consensus beliefs about the U.S. and the rest of the world in the 1970s. The most important conclusions of the exercise are:(1) Floating exchange rates fail to insulate either supply-constrained economy from unanticipated shocks in the other. International transmission is direct -- the impacts on the two regions of any shock have the same sign.(2)Exchange rates and the terms of trade between the supply-constrained economies are moderately sensitive to incomes policies and changes in technology/productivity trends (elasticities of 0.5 to 1.5 in absolute value) and relatively insensitive to fiscal policy and distributionally neutral wage-price guidelines. Wage-favoring incomes policies, liquidity-financed fiscal expansion, tighter wage-price guidelines, and slackening of technology/productivity growth all cause depreciation of the domestic currency and deterioration of the terms of trade.(3)These same shocks all promote ""internationalization"" of commodity and financial markets. Export volume, import volume, claims on foreigners, and indebtedness to them all grow as a result, sometimes by significant amounts (elasticities as high as 1.5 in response to each shock taken independently of the others, and larger elasticities in response to combinations of shocks).

This study examines the determinants of the reservation wage of unemployed persons in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1976. The theoretical section presents the derivation of an optimal reservation wage and shows the source of an ambiguity of some explanatory variables. The data basis are unemployed persons leaving the unemployment register within a given sample week. For a subset of them, we know their reservation wage and a set of personal characteristics. Other variables, such as the wage offer distribution and demand side variables, are obtained by employing other data. Methodological problems, such as as a sample selection bias, are taken into account. As a result, individual characteristics and the wage offer distribution are dominant causes of the reservation wage, but demand side variables and the entitlement to unemployment compensation play minor roles.

This paper presents evidence bearing on the question of international influences on the U.S. capital market. Both the examination of relative magnitudes of international asset holdings and the estimation of a simple partial-equilibrium capital market model indicate that such influences are potentially quite important. In particular, we find that the effects on international flows on the long-term new-issue corporate bond rate in the U.S. are highly significant. Since this interest rate is often seen as crucial in domestic investment decisions, the paper provides reason to believe that investment in the U.S. is significantly influenced by international capital transactions.

Among the more important findings of the first in a series of analyses using the simulation model are the following: 1. Under OASI alone, the long-run deficit amounts to $632 billion in 1977dollars. This is roughly the size of the regular privately held national debt. This occurs primarily because of the impending large increase in the ratio of retirees to workers early in the next century and in spite of already legislated impending large payroll tax increases. 2. The long-run deficit is quite sensitive to assumptions concerning productivity growth and the length of the retirement period. For example, a one year increase in the latter (perhaps due to a gain in life expectancy) increases the real present value of the deficit by about$250 billion.3. Current retirees and older workers will be receiving a large multiple of taxes paid plus interest. Younger workers ultimately will not even break even. The overall pattern of benefits, taxes and transfers will depend heavily upon the time pattern of responses to the deficit and the form the response takes.4. Several types of options exist for eliminating the deficit and even for freeing up resources for other purposes. Delaying retirement by three years on average relative to current patterns will eliminate the deficit (mainly reducing total benefits paid); and separating the transfer and annuity components of the system also offers potentially large deficit reductions (but implies part of the sum will be used to finance an expanded transfer payment system from general revenues).

584,Self-Employment and Labor Force Participation of Older Males (Revised),['Victor R. Fuchs'],1980-11-01,1980-11-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This longitudinal analysis of the labor market behavior of older, urban white males in 1969, 1971, and 1973 focuses on changes from wage-and-salary to self-employment and changes from working to non-working status. In each two-year transition approximately four percent of wage-and-salary workers switched to self-employment. They were primarily men who were previously self-employed or who were in wage-and-salary occupations with characteristics similar to self-employment, e.g., managers and salesmen. For a blue collar worker employed forty hours per week the predicted probability of switching was close to zero. Controlling for a large number of economic and demographic variables, the self-employed were significantly more likely to continue to work, partly by reducing their workweek to under 35 hours. Other significant predictors of continuing to work are good health, years of schooling, white collar occupation, no expectation of a private pension, and a workweek longer than fifty hours. Age is also important, especially at the eligibility ages set by social security.

585,International Transmission under Pegged and Floating Exchange Rates: An Empirical Comparison,['Michael R. Darby'],1980-12-01,1980-12-01,,['International Economics'],"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

This paper continues the investigation of the surprisingly slow and weak international transmission of inflation indicated by the Mark III International Transmission Model. The Mark IV Simulation Model is presented. This is a simplified version of the Mark III Model which retains the transmission channels found significant in the Mark III and is suitable for simulation experiments. Separate versions of the Mark IV model describe the pegged and (dirty) floating exchange regimes. In order to be consistent with the stochastic processes governing policy variables in the sample period, policy experiments involved one percentage point increases in the disturbances of those processes for a single quarter with the behavior thereafter governed by the estimated process. U.S. money shocks were immediately mimicked (in accord with the monetary approach) in Germany but only with a lag (specie-flow mechanism) in the Netherlands. Canada and the U.K. showed only Keynesian absorption transmission. Weaker transmission is generally found under floating exchange rates with a J-curve important in the dynamics. No significant international transmission was found in experiments involving money shocks in the U.K. and Germany and real government spending shocks in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. The money shock experiments indicated short-run money control in U.K. and Germany, although less under pegged than floating rates.

In theory, Federal debt management policy potentially plays an important role in determining Treasury and private security yields. However, empirical studies have been unable to detect any significant effects from Federal debt management. In large part the insignificance of relative asset supply effects associated with Federal debt management policy may result from the use of unrestricted reduced- form models of interest rate determination. Using a disaggregated structural model of the markets for corporate bonds, equities, and four distinct maturity classes of Treasury securities. Federal debt management policy is found to significantly affect Treasury and private security yields. Furthermore, the yields on corporate bonds and equities are influenced disproportionately.

587,Effects of Shifting Saving Patterns on Interest Rates and Economic Activity,['Benjamin M. Friedman'],1980-12-01,1980-12-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

Individuals in the United States consistently do most of their saving through financial intermediaries, but over time there have been and continue to be major shifts in people's reliance on specific kinds of intermediary institutions. In recent years, for example, individual savers have relied progressively more on pensions and thrift institutions and progressively less on life insurance companies. Moreover, legislative and regulatory actions currently under discussion would further alter the pattern of individuals' saving flows. This paper assesses the potential effects on interest rates, and via interest rates (and asset prices and yields more generally) on nonfinancial economic activity, of four specific shifts in saving behavior: additional pension contributions financed by individuals, additional pension contributions financed by businesses, additional purchases of life insurance by individuals, and additional deposits in thrift institutions by individuals. The paper's results indicate that such shifts, in plausible magnitudes, would have significant effects not only on interest rates and asset-liability flows but also on both the level and the composition of nonfinancial economic activity. In particular, although the specific effects differ from one shift to another, each would disproportionately stimulate capital formation in comparison to other forms of spending.

During the past decade, the inflation rate has been very high by historical standards, yet the U.S. tax law has yet to adjust to this fact. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what degree the lack of indexing of the corporate and personal income taxes by itself ought to have resulted in a change in corporate investment and financial policy, and in capital gains or losses to existing owners of corporate equity. In studying these questions, the paper models corporate financial and real decisions simultaneously, unlike other recent studies. The principle conclusions of the paper are: 1) the doubling of corporate debt-value rations can easily be rationalized solely by the interaction of inflation and the tax laws, 2) the stock market and the level of investment behaved much less favourably than would have been forecast focusing solely on the increased inflation rate, and 3) more pessimistic expectations, perhaps in combination with increased riskiness, would provide a consistent rationale for observed behaviour.

The paper develops an analytical framework to discuss the determinants of the premium in the black market for dollars in Brazil. While the specific details of the model were chosen with the Brazilian case in mind, the structure of the model is quite general and suitable for application to black markets for currency elsewhere. The building blocks of the model are three. A capital asset pricing approach is used to derive an asset demand for dollars, or equivalently a real yield premium in market equilibrium. The current account of the black market is specified in terms of the sources and uses in the flow market for dollars, mainly smuggling proceeds and flows associated with tourism. The model is closed by a model of official exchange rate policy and the assumption of rational expectations. In comparative static applications the model has the properties of current account oriented models of the exchange rate. Unanticipated current account improvements due, for example, to increased export taxes that promote smuggling, lead to a decline in the premium. Asset market disturbances, such as increased inflation uncertainty or increased variability in the official real exchange rate policy are shown to have ambiguous effects on the premium. In applying the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated disturbances it is shown that the current expectation of a future maxi-devaluation leads to an immediate rise in the premium, with a subsequent decline when the maxi actually takes place. The paper concludes with a discussion of seasonal patterns in the premium. It is shown-that for ""always"" anticipated disturbances there is no jump in the premium, but a gradual adjustment that precedes the actual seasonal in the current account.

The symmetry restriction in a system of financial asset demands has frequently been employed to reduce the number of independent parameters to be estimated. The theoretical implications of the symmetry restriction are examined in this paper, and it is found that symmetry implies a particular type of risk averse portfolio behavior. The symmetry restriction is also examined empirically, and the evidence supports symmetry only in cases where coefficients on cross-asset yields are insignificantly different from zero.

594,Taxes and Corporate Capital Structure in an Incomplete Market,"['Robert A. Taggart', 'Jr.']",1980-12-01,1980-12-01,,['Financial Economics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper extends Merton Miller's 1977 analysis of corporate capital structure decisions to the incomplete capital markets case. As in Miller's model, aggregate demand for corporate leverage is curtailed as interest rates on taxable bonds rise. Unlike Miller's model, however, capital structure is not a matter of indifference to all equilibrium shareholders. Market incompleteness and tax arbitrage restrictions combine to prevent marginal rates of substitution from being equalized for all investors and hence their preferences are not unanimous. In addition, costs associated with debt induce a tendency for lower cost firms to issue a larger proportion of total corporate debt.

The paper first identifies how large must be the range in which ex ante yields on long-relative to short-term bonds vary if term premiums -- are to account for a significant fraction of the variance of the holding- period yields on long-term bonds. This paper then extends Shiller's bound to the case of a time-varying term premium and readily identifies the variance in the term premium necessary to salvage the efficient markets model if the variance of these holding-period yields exceeds the bound implied by the rational expectations model. The role of transactions costs is noted and the possibility explored that evidence of excess volatility need not imply the existence of unexploited profit opportunities under the rational expectations model.

We formulate a variable cost function model in which certain inputs are treated as quasi-fixed, and develop a simple statistical test of whether optimization occurs for the quasi-fixed inputs. It is shown how to retrieve characteristics of the long-run cost function from the variable cost parameters, with specific reference to the cost elasticity and the elasticities of substitution. We also present a model of the I returns to R & D in the context of a regulated firm and show how to I estimate the net rate of return to R & D from the variable cost function. A translog version of the model is estimated for the Bell System for the period 1947-1976. The empirical results suggest substantial long-run economies of scale at the aggregate level. The formal envelope test indicates that the Bell System's use of capital and R & D was cost- minimizing during the post-war period, but the conclusion is seriously qualified by evidence that the power of the test in this application is low. Finally, we estimate the net rate of return to R & D in the Bell System in the range of 25-40 percent, which is somewhat higher than available estimates for manufacturing industries.

The paper develops a model of exchange-rate and current-account determination for a small economy peopled by infinitely lived, utility-maximizing households. In this setting, a central-bank purchase of foreign exchange has no real effects when central-bank foreign reserves earn interest at the world rate and the proceeds are returned to the public. In contrast, an increase in the monetary growth rate does have real effects, even in the long run. The model developed here implies that an increase in government spending may lead to a surplus on current account. The external adjustment process predicted by the model is one in which consumption, real balances, anti external assets all rise or fall simultaneously.

600,Social Insurance and Consumption: An Empirical Inquiry,['Daniel S. Hamermesh'],1980-12-01,1980-12-01,,"['Labor Economics', 'Public Economics']",,,,"

The main stated purposes of social insurance programs have been the maintenance of consumption by people suffering from misfortunes, and the stabilization of employment. Despite this, most recent research on unemployment insurance (UI) and Old Age Insurance has focused on secondary labor-market effects, with only a few studies looking at stabilization, and none considering effects on consumption. In this study we examine how UI will affect the consumption of recipients. For some individuals UI will help remove the constraints on consumption during periods of reduced income that arise from insufficient savings and imperfect capital markets, while for others the UI benefits merely augment the entire lifetime consumption stream. The model enables us to estimate what fractions of the population fall into these two categories. If individuals are also constrained in the allocation of their reduction consumption, consumption propensities out of UI will differ from those out of nonrecipients' income. The model is tested on aggregate time-series data covering 41 consumption categories for 1959-1978:II, and on over 14,000 individuals from the 1972-73 Consumer Expenditure Survey. In both data sets we find no more than half of UI benefits are consumed as if the recipients' consumption were constrained during times of unemployment. In both samples spending out of UI benefits is disproportionately on luxuries, though UI recipients spend greater shares of their income on necessities. The results imply that a large part of social insurance payments does not go to prevent serious imbalances in individuals' lifetime consumption profiles.

Oil prices, commodity prices and American monetary policy, the last operating through a variety of channels, have all figures prominently in explanations of the international inflation process in the last 1960s and early '70s. Our major purpose in this paper is to test these various hypotheses. We do so in the context of a reduced-form rational-expectations price equation which we estimate for the United States and seven other industrial countries using quarterly data for the period 1955 through 1976. The principal conclusion that emerges from this exercise is that movements in domestic money in these countries served as the key link in the inflation process. The factors that produced these monetary changes, however, differed among countries. Price shocks of various sorts were clearly of secondary importance. The other important set of conclusions concerns the demand for money. In place of a traditional stock adjustment model, we used, GLS with a second- order correct ion for autocorrelation. We believe this produced more plausible estimates of the parameters of the long-run demand function and of the adjustment process it self.

604,"Inflation, Taxation, and Corporate Investment: A q-Theory Approach",['Lawrence H. Summers'],1980-12-01,1980-12-01,,,"['Public Economics', 'Economic Fluctuations and Growth']",,,"

This paper presents an analysis of the effects of tax policy on capital accumulation and valuation based on James Tobin's q theory of investment. As Tobin has explained, aggregate investment can be expected to depend in a stable way on q, the ratio of the stock market valuation of existing capita1 to its replacement cost. For example, increases in the rate of return on physical capital raise its market value and cause increased investment until equilibrium is restored. Although models linking the stock market to investment have been estimated, they have not previously been used to examine the impact of tax policies. The basic idea underlying the approach taken here can be described quite simply. It is generally assumed that the stock market valuation of corporate capital represents the present value of its future dividend stream. In the model of this paper, the effects of tax changes on future profits are used to estimate the impact of those changes on the stock market. These estimates in turn are used as a basis for gauging the impact of the tax changes on capital formation. This approach, working through q, can provide estimates of the effects of policy announcements and of personal tax reforms as well as estimates of the distributional impact of alternative reforms. A distinct feature of the model developed here is that it is rooted in a microeconomic theory that integrates the interests of the corporation and its shareholders.

605,Tax Policy and Corporate Investment,['Lawrence H. Summers'],1980-12-01,1980-12-01,,,"['Public Economics', 'Economic Fluctuations and Growth']",,,"

This paper overviews the issues connected with proposals to spur investment using tax incentives. There are four main conclusions: (1) The rate of net capital formation in the U.S. has declined very substantially. This decline has been associated with a sharp fall in the after tax return to investors in the corporate sector. (2) Increasing the share of output devoted to business capital formation would not have a large effect on the rate of productivity growth, inflation or employment. However, it would contribute substantially to intertemporal economic efficiency. The welfare gains achievable through investment incentives approach $100 billion. (3) Measures to spur investment are likely to have substantial effects. The lags are, however, very long. For example, it is estimated that the elimination of capital gains taxes would raise the capital stock by 29 percent in the long run, but by only 4 percent within five years. (4) Through judicious design of tax policy, it is possible to spur investment with only a small revenue cost. It is crucial to take account of the effect of anticipated policy on the level of investment. Traditional Keynesian econometric approaches are ill-suited to this goal.

This paper suggests that to a large extent. the increases in the value of housing and decreases in the value of corporate capital may have a common explanation, the inter- action of inflation and a nonindexed tax system. The acceleration of inflation has sharply increased the effective rate of taxation of corporate capital income, while reducing the effective taxation of owner- occupied housing. These changes have been capitalized in the form of changing asset prices. In the long run, they will lead to significant changes in the size and composition of the capital stock. The first section of the paper describes in more detail the nonneutralities caused by inflation. A simple model showing how inflation and taxation interact to determine asset prices is presented in the second section. The third section presents some crude empirical tests suggesting that increases in the expected rate of inflation may account for a significant part of the asset price changes which have been observed. A final section concludes the paper by commenting on some implications of the results.

The logarithm of the purchasing power ratio (PPR) is shown for seven countries and three alternative price indices to follow a stationary and invertible process in the first differences. This means that permanent shifts in the parity value accumulate over time. Therefore, as the prediction interval lengthens, the variance of the level of the PPR goes towards infinity while the variance of its average growth rate goes to zero. Since the variance of the permanent shifts is substantial: (1) Harmonized money growth cannot maintain constant exchange rates; reserve flows feedback is required. (2) Economic explanations of the permanent shifts are an important research topic.

The flow of production and use of economic information consists of the collection and processing of primary data, the reporting of the resulting measures, and the transformation of the latter into signals or messages that presumably aid knowledge or decision-making. Each stage contributes to the return and costs, quality and errors of the information. The processes involved on the micro and macro levels show important similarities and interact ions. The uncertainty about economic information increases with the probability of error in the underlying data and their processing and interpretation. Many errors cannot be promptly detected and eliminated but can be gradually reduced over time, as attested by the revisions in economic statistics. This paper presents substantial evidence on the accuracy of provisional estimates of quarterly and monthly changes in eighteen important variables. Measures of several aspects of data quality and of average lags of data release and signal detection are provided for a collection of 110 widely used economic indicators. These materials help identify the location of the more serious measurement errors by variable and period, and they show that informational lags of five and more months are frequent. The errors and lags of information may lead to apparently ""systematic"" but not readily detectable and removable errors in expectations. This is likely to happen, in particular, in times of great surprises and shocks when measurement of short-term changes in the economy is most difficult and current signals are often misread. Some illustrations are drawn from the events of 1970-75.

Various health information was collected in the base year of the survey, and we use these base year reports as measures of health which are predetermined with respect to educational behavior in the subsequent five years. We examine individuals' choices of post-secondary activities (which include different types of post-secondary education and no post-secondary education), and the rate at which individuals leave educational activities, in an effort to determine if the behavior of disabled individuals differs from healthy individuals, and if these differences could be attributable to health problems.

In this paper we use data from the Retirement History Survey (RHS) to examine the relationship of some sociodemographic and economic variables to morbidity and mortality. Since the RHS is a longitudinal survey, we are able to study current health conditioned on prior health as well as the more usual unconditioned estimates. We find that health is related to education and marital status though the marital effects are much weaker when we condition for prior health. These effects persist when we control for income and use of medical facilities. An interesting finding is that married men seem to persist in the state of poor health rather than dying.

Deciding whether to fund a given health program involves both statistical and ethical issues. Traditional statistical methods of measuring program effectiveness may give misleading results unless careful attention is paid to the question of population heterogeneity. Even within particular age and sex categories, members of a population typically differ in both their mortality rate and the extent to which they would benefit from a given medical intervention. It may or may not be possible to identify the risk factors (e. g., weight, smoking behavior) that explain these differences. If an intervention confers unequal benefit on different risk groups, it will change their mixture within the population over time. If those helped most are those at greatest risk, a ""traditional assessment"" will overstate intervention benefits. Greater accuracy can be achieved through a ""standardized assessment, "" which calculates intervention benefits separately for each distinctive risk group of the population. For example, a traditional assessment of pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine probably overstates program benefits and underestimates costs. Failure to recognize population heterogeneity also creates pitfalls in interpreting the results of clinical trials of new drugs, as illustrated by the example of sulfinpyrazone. As more sophisticated statistical methods improve our understanding of differential program benefits, they will also raise ethical problems. Use of a standardized assessment, for instance, may make it clear that it is cost-effective to give an intervention to certain groups (e.g., nonsmokers, the elderly) but not others. Considering this problem from an ""original position"" may reveal an ethically acceptable basis for making such decisions on the basis of efficiency. We believe that if people were unaware of which risk group they themselves would fall into, they would elect to allocate resources according to the principle of cost-effectiveness.

The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the causes of the rapid decline in the infant mortality rate in the United States in the period after 1963. The roles of four public policies are considered: Medicaid, subsidized family planning services for low-income women, maternal and infant care projects, and the legalization of abortion. The most striking finding is that the increase in the legal abortion rate is the single most important factor in reductions in both white and nonwhite neonatal mortality rates. Not only does the growth in abortion dominate the other public policies, but it also dominates schooling and poverty.

A recurring theme in the literature on taxation has been uncertainty about the incidence of the corporate income tax. The answer may be even more elusive for state taxes than for federal taxes. As seen by one state, a cor- porate income tax levied on the basis of formula apportionment of total income is a composite of taxes levied on whatever factors enter the state's apportion- ment formula. Such a tax is likely to be borne primarily by residents of the taxing state, as consumers, immobile workers, and owners of land and immobile capital. Substantial shifting to consumers or capitalists throughout the nation is unlikely.

This study discusses newly collected data concerning the role played by seniority in U.S. firms' termination and promotion decisions.

For what percentage does protection against job loss grow with seniority even when current value to the firm does not? While there appear to be important differences for hourly versus salaried employees and for those covered by collective bargaining versus those not so covered, the new evidence presented strongly supports the claim that seniority independent of productivity plays a major role in the compensation and termination decisions affecting all employee groups at most U.S. workplaces.

624,An Intertemporal Analysis of Taxation and Work Disincentives: An Analysis of the Denver Income Maintenance Experiment,['Thomas E. MaCurdy'],1981-01-01,1981-01-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper formulates an empirical model of consumption and labor supply that explicitly incorporates income taxes in a multiperiod setting. This model relies on few assumptions and provides a robust framework for estimating parameters needed to predict the response of consumption and hours of work to changes in a consumer's lifetime resource constraints. The empirical specifications developed here apply when a consumer is uncertain about future prices, taxes, income, and tastes, and the estimation of these specifications does not require explicit modeling of either a consumer's expectations or the history of a consumer. The empirical model accommodates both progressive and regressive tax schemes. Estimation of the model involves no complicated procedures; a full set of parameter estimates can be obtained with the application of standard two-stage least squares techniques. The final sect ion of the paper estimates a particular specification of the model using data from the Denver Income Maintenance Experiment. The empirical formulations proposed here are particularly well suited to deal with the kinds of tax schemes used in NIT experiments and the limited duration of those programs.

625,Explanations of Exchange Rate Volatility and Other Empirical Regularities in Some Popular Models of the Foreign Exchange Market,['Robert P. Flood'],1981-02-01,1981-02-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

The present paper is intended to accomplish two tasks. First, models predicting overshooting and magnification, respectively, will be checked for their consistency with two key empirical regularities: A. The observed pattern of price level vs. exchange-rate volatility. B. The observed pattern of spot exchange-rate vs. forward exchange-rate volatility. Second, a widely neglected reason for exchange-rate volatility, activist monetary policy, will be studied.

When subsidies and tariffs are applied to imports with fluctuating prices, it is shown that the output response of domestic producers depends on market structure and their attitude toward risk. The domestic industry response is contrasted under two types of market structure, a monopoly and a competitive industry. Some unanticipated results suggest caution in the implementation of trade policy.

629,The Real Price of Oil and the 1970s World Inflation,['Michael R. Darby'],1981-02-01,1981-02-01,,['Macroeconomics'],"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

This paper shows that the effects on real income and the price level of the 1973-1974 oil price increase are quite ambiguous on both theoretical and empirical grounds. The theoretical analysis reviews standard results and extends them to analyze the steady-state equilibrium and endogenous monetary policy reaction functions. It is shown that standard models and parameter values imply trivial reductions in real income and ambiguously signed changes in the price level. It is noted, however, that other special models can rationalize empirical findings of large effects. Direct real- oil-price effects in an extended Barro-Lucas real income equation are estimated for eight countries. Although statistically significant and substantial direct effects are found for about half the countries, it is noted that these coincided with countries undergoing price decontrol during 1973- 1974. Thus price-control biases in real GNP data provide an acceptable alternative explanation for the estimated effects. Simulation experiments in an international model illustrate the wide range of real income and price level effects which are consistent with the data. Further research is proposed to narrow the range of possible effects.

631,When Is a Positive Income Tax Optimal?,['Fischer Black'],1981-02-01,1981-02-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

When will the optimal mix of a constant income tax with a constant consumption tax involve a positive income tax? The assumptions of the model in which this question is asked include (1) identical individuals with coincident lifetimes who work in every period; (2) initial endowments of physical capital; (3) fixed government expenditures; and (4) government borrowing (or lending) that goes to zero when the world ends. In a model like this, we can ignore the transition problem. If we allow the constant tax on income from capital and the constant tax on wage income to be at different rates, we can ask a further question. When will the optimal mix of all three taxes (including the consumption tax) involve a positive tax on either income from capital or wage income?

633,The Impact of Unions on the Labor Market for White and Minority Youth,['Harry J. Holzer'],1981-02-01,1981-02-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper presents estimates of the effects of unions on the wages of young black and white males who are both union and nonunion workers. It also presents estimates of union effects on employment for these groups, as well as their union membership rates. While unions have a very substantial, positive effect on the wages of young union workers, particularly for young blacks, they have a negative effect on the wages of young blacks who are not unionized. The effects of unions on employment are negative for both groups and especially for blacks. As for the relative access to unionized employment, young blacks within the labor force have membership rates that are roughly comparable to those of young whites. However, rates for young blacks appear to be somewhat lower after accounting for differences in rates of labor force participation between young blacks and whites. Young blacks also continue to be under-represented in the crafts and construction industries, which are heavily unionized, while being overrepresented in the relatively nonunionized, low-wage service sector. These results suggest that increasing the access of young blacks to unionized employment would improve their positions in the labor market.

636,On the Predictability of Tax-Rate Changes,['Robert J. Barro'],1981-02-01,1981-02-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Some previous analyses have suggested that the smoothing of tax rates over time would be a desirable guide for public debt management. One implication of this viewpoint is that future changes in tax rates would be unpredictable based on current information. This proposition is tested by examining the behavior of U.S. federal and total government tax (and ""non-tax"")receipts relative to GNP. The sample for the federal government goes back to1879, while that for total government starts in 1929. Some econometric problems with using time-averaged data are discussed. The main empirical results accord with the theoretical analysis -- in particular, there is first, little indication of drift in the tax rates; second, insignificant relations of tax-rate changes to the own history of changes; and third, little explanatory value for tax-rate changes from a vector of lagged variables, which include the behavior of government spending and real output. If the findings are sustained, they imply that the existing IJ.S. time series data do not isolate periods in which current overall tax rates would be perceived as high or low relative to expected future rates. Accordingly, it may be impossible to use these data to evaluate policies that entail intertemporal manipulation of aggregate tax rates.

639,Nested Tests of Alternative Term-Structure Theories,['Edward J. Kane'],1981-03-01,1981-03-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

Controversies in term-structure theory center around the existence and variability of term premia in securities yields. In this paper, the term premium on a default-free n-period bond is defined as the difference between its observable yield to maturity and the average expected per-annum rate of return on an n-period strip of rollover investments in one-period bonds. To test alternative term-structure theories without introducing ex post proxies for expectational variables, this paper uses a set of cross-section interest-rate forecasts collected jointly with Burton Malkiel of Princeton University from a population of large institutional lenders at four different phases of a single interest-rate cycle. Statistical tests strongly confirm the existence of nonzero term premia at each survey date, thereby rejecting the pure-expectations theory of the term structure. Additional tests are unable to reject restrictions implied by the liquidity-premium hypothesis that term premia should be positive and increase with maturity. Finally, contrary to the martingale hypothesis, ex ante term-premium data vary significantly overtime and show a positive association with the level of interest rates.

The examination of foreign takeovers is a way of distinguishing between the characteristics of f inns and industries that encourage takeovers and the effects of foreignness or of takeovers per se. Foreigners have tended to take over Swedish firms that are of above average size within each industry. 'Very .few takeovers are of the smallest groups of firms: those with fewer than 20 employees or even those with fewer than 200. However, the firms taken over are not large compared to Swedish companies of 200 employees or more. In fact, they are well below average size within that group. The firms taken over are more skill-oriented or technology-oriented than Swedish-owned firms in the same industries. However, takeovers are not particularly prevalent in industries in which firms in general are large or skill-oriented or technology-oriented. Thus the select ion of firms for takeover is based on f inn characteristics, not industry characteristics. After takeover by foreigners, firms grow somewhat faster than Swedish-owned firms in the same industries. The technological characteristics of the firms, by the crude measurements we have been able to apply so far, do not seem to be affected in any consistent way by takeover.

643,The Effect of Risk on Interest Rates: A Synthesis of the Macroeconomic and Financial Views,['Pentti J.K. Kouri'],1981-03-01,1981-03-01,,,"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

This paper analyzes the effects of real income and price level uncertainty on equilibrium interest rates. It is demonstrated that even if there are no outside nominal assets, the interest rate on nominal bonds contains a risk premium, or as the case may be, a risk discount. The sign, and the magnitude, of the deviation from the Fisher parity depends on the covariance between the purchasing power of money on the one hand and real income on the other. The second part of the paper extends the model into a model of two countries, two monies and two bonds denominated in these two monies. It is shown, in contrast with statements made in the literature, that the 'efficiency' of international financial markets does not imply equality of expected real interest rates on bonds denominated in different currencies, nor does it imply that the forward exchange rate should be an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. This is again true even when there are no outside nominal assets in the world economy.

This paper aims to remedy difficulties with some extant empirical tests of the monetary approach to exchange rate determination. Four problems are addressed: explication of and allowance for real exchange rate changes; imposition of interest parity; use of the forward rate as an unbiased predictor of the spot rate; and modeling implications of official intervention in foreign exchange markets and of possible efforts to sterilize effects of intervention in the monetary base. Empirical tests conducted with monthly data on the dollar-DM exchange rate from March, 1973 -December,1979 do not permit rejection of the complex joint hypothesis represented by equations estimated to test the monetary approach. Still, there remained unexplained a large portion of the behavior of the dollar-DM exchange rate in the 1973-79 monthly sample employed. This result suggests that exchange rates may be viewed as prices determined in asset markets where a large and unsystematic flow of information, not captured by monetary or other variables, produces large, unsystematic movements.

This paper examines the empirical relation between stock returns and dividend yields. Several equilibrium pricing models incorporating differential taxation of dividends and capital gains are nested as systems of time series regressions. Estimates of these models and tests of parameter restrictions implied by the models are conducted within the context of Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression. It is concluded that the data fail to support these models as well as the hypothesis that dividends are neutral. The inability to distinguish between these competing hypotheses suggests the need for further research before definitive conclusions are reached regarding the tax impacts of dividends.

650,Some Theoretical Aspects of Base Control,['Charles Freedman'],1981-03-01,1981-03-01,,,['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper focuses on the implications of using the monetary base or bank reserves as an instrument to control a monetary aggregate. Following analysis of a series of theoretical models of increasing complexity, it is concluded that in a system with either institutional or structural lags base control may entail very sharp and possibly undamped oscillations of short-term interest rates. The shorter the time period over which the authorities choose to bring the monetary aggregate back to its target, the more volatile will be the movements of interest rates. Furthermore, there is an asymmetry in the U.S. institutional structure such that rigid implementation of the base control system will under certain circumstances lead to a decline in short-term interest rates to very low levels. The final section of the paper is devoted to the examination of the Canadian institutional structure emphasizing the differences between the U.S. and Canadian systems.

This paper considers the possible employment effects of reforming minimum-wage policy to incorporate indexation of the nominal minimum wage .The analysis assumes that both the demand for the labor services of minimum-wage workers and the setting of the nominal minimum wage rate under existing policy depend in part on rational expectations of future average wage rates. The analysis implies that, if the indexation ratio of the nominal minimum wage to the recent-past average wage rate were large relative both to the level and trend of the expected rate of average wage inflation and to the existing relative minimum-wage target, indexation would decrease the average level over time of minimum-wage employment. The analysis also implies that, if the year-to-year variation in expected wage inflation were large relative to the year-to-year variation in unexpected wage inflation, indexation would increase the year-to-year variation in minimum-wage employment.

Early retirement options alter the accrual of pension benefits, increasing the fraction of total benefits accrued in the early years of work. This is true regardless of whether de facto no worker exercises the early retirement option. No currently used actuarial method correctly calculates the cost of an early retirement option. Early retirement options must be considered in calculating age/compensation profiles. Furthermore, the early retirement option can effectively be used to encourage less productive older workers to retire, without the firm having to reduce the nominal salary of such workers.

655,The Effects of Government Regulation on Teenage Smoking,"['Eugene M. Lewit', 'Douglas Coate', 'Michael Grossman']",1981-04-01,1981-04-01,,['Public Economics'],['Health Economics'],,,"

We examine the impact of three sets of government regulations on the demand for cigarettes by teenagers in the United States. These are: (1) the excise tax on cigarettes, (2) the Fairness Doctrine of the Federal Communications Commission, which resulted in the airing of anti-smoking messages on radio and television from July 1, 1967 to January 1, 1971,and (3) the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970, which banned pro-smoking cigarette advertising on radio and television after January 1, 1971.Teenage price elasticities of demand for cigarettes are substantial and much larger than the corresponding adult price elasticities. The teenage smoking participation elasticity equals -1.2, and the quantity smoked elasticity equals -1.4. It follows that, if future reductions in youth smoking are desired, an increase in the Federal excise tax is a potent policy to accomplish this goal. The contention of the proponents of the advertising ban that the Fairness Doctrine failed in the case of teenagers is incorrect. According to our results, the doctrine had a substantial negative impact on teenage smoking participation rates. Extrapolations suggest that the advertising ban was no better or worse a policy than the Fairness Doctrine.

656,Minimum Wages and the Demand for Labor,['Daniel S. Hamermesh'],1981-04-01,1981-04-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

I formulate measures of the effective minimum wage, based on broad definitions of the labor costs that face employers, and use these measures in reestimating some simple equations relating the relative employment of youths and adults to the U.S. minimum wage using aggregate data for 1954-78.I then ground the model more closely in the theory of factor demand, first by adding the relative wages of youths and adults to the equation describing their relative employment, and then by specifying a complete system of demand equations for these two types of labor. Teen employment responds quite robustly to changes in the effective minimum in these specifications, with an elasticity of -0.1. A translog cost function defined over young workers, adults, and capital shows that the effective minimum wage reduces employers' ability to substitute other factors for young workers. Using both sets of results, I find that a subminimum wage for youths would have increased their employment with at most a small loss of jobs among adults.

Improved understanding of retirement behavior is a key to better understanding of many important economic problems. In as close as we can come to a general ""social experiment,"" real Social Security benefits were increased substantially for the period we study the retirement patterns of a cohort of white males: 28% on average between 1970 and 1972, with the maximum benefit increased by over 50% in real terms between 1968 and 1976. Other important structural changes in the method of computing benefits were also made. Hence, we have extremely detailed longitudinal data on a cohort of people spanning the years of most active retirement behavior (ages 58-67) over a period of abrupt change in the economic incentives surrounding their retirement . We have analyzed these data in a variety of ways to examine the impact of the changes in Social Security, as well as other factors, on retirement probabilities. The most simple to the most sophisticated analyses reveal the same set of inferences: 1. The acceleration in the decline in the labor force participation of elderly men over the period 1969-73 was primarily due to the large increase in real Social Security benefits; our probability equations estimate effects of changes in real benefits combined with the actual changes to predict declines in participation rates virtually identical to actual observed changes from independent data. 2. Social Security wealth interacts with other assets. A substantial fraction of the elderly appear to have few other assets and this group shows a markedly larger propensity to retire early, e.g., at age 62 when Social Security benefits become available. We find strong evidence of this liquidity constraint effect for an important subgroup of the elderly. 3. The magnitude of the induced retirement effect is large enough that if it is ignored in estimating the direct fiscal implications of major changes in benefit provisions, these may be substantially underestimated . 4. We interpret our results in the historical context of a particular cohort undergoing a major, unanticipated transfer of wealth via larger real benefits. We make no attempt to distinguish these from the long- run effects if the system were to remain unchanged for many years or if future changes were readily predictable.

A factor-price frontier framework is used to clarify the analogy of an increase (decrease) in raw material prices with that of autonomous technological regress (progress). Factor-price profiles estimated for the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan bring out the major role of raw materials in the profit and product wage squeeze after 1972, with some differences between countries. The production model, in conjunction with estimates obtained from the factor-price frontier, attributes almost all the slowdown in total productivity to the rise in relative raw material prices. It is also shown that part of the apparent productivity riddle has to do with the common use of double-deflated national accounting measures of value added, which have an inherent measurement bias.

663,Distributional Implications of Imperfect Capital Markets,['Joon Koo Lee'],1981-04-01,1981-04-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

The primary aim of this study is to analyze the impact of imperfections in capital markets on individuals' lifetime allocation plans and the resulting implications for income distribution. The model builds upon Samuelson's overlapping generation model with human capital and bequest motives playing central roles. The model developed here introduces a limit on the individual's ability to borrow. One of the most important consequences of this constraint is that human investment falls short of the level where its marginal return is equal to that of non-human investment. The comparative static results show that an individual who has been subject to the borrowing constraint would increase human investment unambiguously if he were allowed to borrow freely against future earnings. Discussions of the distributive implications of this result suggest that the elimination of the borrowing constraint has a potential of enhancing both intragenerational income equality and intergenerational mobility. The simulation results show that the elimination of the borrowing limit would bring about a significant improvement in income distribution without having an adverse effect on efficiency.

A number of recent empirical studies have rejected the hypothesis that forward exchange rates are unbiased forecasts of future spot exchange rates. This result implies that there have been opportunities for speculative profit during the post Bretton Woods period. Observers of the floating rate system have also noted that exchange rates have been more volatile than they were anticipated to be in the 1960's. In this paper, the link between the volatility of exchange rates and the existence of opportunities for speculative profit is explored. The question answered in the paper is the following: if there were no opportunities for speculative profit, would exchange rates have been more stable? The answer is yes. This answer implies that speculation (intervention) based upon the forecasting equation described in the paper would be both profitable and stabilizing.

With the major currencies continuously moving (if not floating freely) against each other, a country that does not choose to float must decide what to peg to. If it pegs to the SDR it floats against all currencies. Thus in the system begun in the early 1970s the very concept of a fixed exchange rate is unclear. In this situation many countries have chosen to peg their currencies to a basket, or a weighted average of other currencies. The analysis of this paper is focused on fluctuations in real exchange rates. We first show that pegging to a currency basket is the same as holding constant a real effective exchange rate that uses a specific set of weights depending on a chosen policy target. We also show the weights that correspond to particular targets for stabilization policy. Next we discuss several problems involved in choosing and computing optimal weights or the equivalent real effective rate. It is shown that the index formula itself aggregates countries that are in a currency area, so that monetary authorities should use weights based on trade with countries rather than on currency denomination of trade. Finally, we report on an initial empirical investigation of pegging practices in Greece, Portugal, and Spain. These are all countries that have moved to basket pegs, with geographically diversified trade. We present initial estimates of the implicit weights in their baskets, and find that all three countries experienced real appreciation relative to the basket during the l970s.

668,"Wives' Labor Force Participation, Wage Differentials and Family Income Inequality: The Israeli Experience",['Reuben GRonau'],1981-04-01,1981-04-01,,['Econometrics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

Recent decades have witnessed a sharp increase in the labor force participation of married women. The paper investigates the effect of wives' earnings on family income distribution. This effect depends on the in-equality of women's earnings as compared with other sources of income, on the correlation between the two and on the woman's share in total income. These in turn depend on participation patterns, labor supply and sex related wage differentials. In general, only the correlation between the various sources of income has an unambiguous effect on inequality, the effects of the other factors depending on the specific values of the parameters. In Israel where there are sharp differences in participation rates of married women and in sex related earnings differentials by schooling group, wives' earnings reduce total family income inequality, increasing at the same time the between-group (ethnic and schooling group) variability. The paper examines the effect of changes in the participation rate and the wife-husband earnings gap on family income inequality. It compares the effect of wives' earnings with other income sources (e.g., transfers) and examines the implication of separate tax returns for inequality.

The purpose of this paper is to review available evidence on the impact of federal equal employment opportunity programs. While Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 11246 have been in effect for over 15 years, the lag in data collection and evaluation means that little can be said regarding the last few years' experience. In particular, evidence on the impact of recent administrative changes in the agencies responsible for enforcement is unavailable. In general, time series studies find significant improvements in the relative labor market position of blacks compared with whites since 1965. While several arguments have been advanced that these gains are illusory, the most plausible interpretation is that much of the apparent progress is real. Cross-sectional studies of the impacts of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (which enforces the nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements of the Executive Order) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (which enforces Title VII) have been much less conclusive. Half of the major studies of the OFCCP find that the program had the intended effects on the relative position of blacks -- or at least black males. Unfortunately, variations in conclusions among studies are not readily explained, even after a careful look at the competing data and methods. Equally disturbing is the inability of studies producing positive results to associate such impacts with the ""levers"" by which OFCCP might exert influence. Studies of EEOC impacts are more vulnerable to problems of identifying the appropriate control group, since Title VII covers contractor and noncontractor firms. Apart from evidence that relative black employment grew considerably faster in firms which must report to EEOC (firms with over 15 employees are subject to Title VII, but only those with 100 or more must report to EEOC), available studies have not produced consistent evidence of EEOC impact. Besides the lack of strong cross-sectional support for the time series conclusions, three puzzles emerge: (1) What caused the decline in black male labor force participation which began about the same time as the federal antidiscrimination effort? (2) Why did black females advance more rapidly than black males since the federal effort began? (3) Why did advantaged blacks advance more rapidly than less advantaged blacks?

General equilibrium models have recently been used to simulate the effects of many proposed tax changes. However, in modeling the effects of the government on the economy, these models have assumed for simplicity that marginal tax rates equal the observed average tax rates, and that marginal benefit rates are zero. The main purpose of this paper is to derive improved estimates of various marginal tax and benefit rates. Most importantly, we include in the model recent theories concerning the effects of combined corporate and personal taxes on corporate financial and investment decisions. The conclusions previously derived concerning the effects of corporate tax integration are then reexamined in light of the proposed changes.

This study analyzes the Consent Decree of the United States' basic steel industry which reformed plant seniority systems to accommodate issues of equal employment opportunity. The plant-by-plant litigation brought under Title VII and Executive Order 11246 is shown to be the main catalyst which brought representatives of the steel industry, of the United Steel Workers of America, and of the appropriate government agencies to negotiate this industry-wide solution. The principal terms of the steel industry Consent Decree are: the establishment of a mechanism to implement the Decree; the uniform institution of plant-wide seniority; the retention of pay rates after transfer to a position that provides a lower pay rate than the previous position; the establishment of goals for minority representation in trade and craft jobs; and a back pay settlement. The analysis of these provisions reveals two related points. Black representation in trade and craft jobs increased in the four year period after the Decree, with an indication that the increase was greater than pre-1974 employment trends would have predicted. However, 1978 black/white employment figures indicate that underutilization of blacks in these positions still persists.

This paper studies the efficient agreements about the dependence of workers' earnings on employment, when the employment level is controlled by firms. The firms ' superior information about profitability conditions is responsible for this form of contract governance. Under plausible assumptions, such agreements will cause employment to diverge from efficiency as a byproduct of their attempt to mitigate risk. It is shown that, if leisure is a normal good and firms are risk neutral, employment is always above the efficient level. Such a one-period implicit contracting model cannot, therefore, be used to ""explain"" unemployment as a rational byproduct of risk sharing between workers and a risk neutral firm under conditions of asymmetric information.

Firms' beliefs that they may be unable to sell as much as they would like at the market price leads not only to a quantity spillover (even when prices are flexible) but also to a spillover of product demand elasticity onto the elasticity of labor demand. Hence, optimal firm behavior can be expected to produce a negative correlation between the (absolute value of) the wage elasticity and the unemployment rate. This hypothesis is tested on three sets of data. 1) For low-skilled workers in the United States in 1969 there is weak support for this hypothesis; 2) In time-series data for the U.S. there is no evidence for the hypothesis (there is essentially no cyclical variability in the elasticity); and 3) In time-series data for the United Kingdom there is fairly strong evidence supporting it. We also find that, in both the U.S. and the U.K., the demand elasticity for labor decreased in the 1970s to an extent that does not appear to be explained by changes in other factor prices.

This paper provides quantitative estimates of the output, price, interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among a number of countries. The econometric model that is used for this purpose is described in Fair (1981), and the present paper is an extension of this work. The linkages are examined by changing various policy variables and observing the resulting change in the endogenous variables. The model is also used to estimate what is called the ""exchange rate effect"" on inflation. One of the ways in which monetary and fiscal policies may affect a country's inflation rate is by first influencing its exchange rate, which in turn influences import prices, which in turn influences domestic prices. The model allows this exchange rate effect on inÂ£ lat ion to be estimated. The results in the paper give a good indication of the properties of the model. The linkages among countries are complicated and there are few unambiguous effects with respect to sign. This is true not just in principle but also in fact. Depreciation, for example, increases GNP for Japan, but decreases it for Germany and the U.K. A spending in- crease leads to a depreciation in Japan, but to an appreciation in Germany and the U.K. A spending increase in the U.S. has noticeably different effects on different countries. The results also show the importance of price, interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among countries as well as the usual trade linkages.

678,Information and Capital Markets,['Joseph E. Stiglitz'],1981-05-01,1981-05-01,,['Other'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper provides the foundations of a general theory of information and the capital market. We show that in a pure gambling market, even with asymmetric information, there cannot exist an equilibrium with trade with rational individuals. We argue that although a pure exchange stock market is not a pure gambling market, most of the trade on the stock market arises from irrationality on the part of some investors and the rational response on the part of other investors to take advantage of that irrationality. We show that the private returns to information acquisition and dissemination differ markedly from social returns and as a result the market equilibrium is not a (constrained) Pareto optimum. Moreover, we show how firms' actions, e.g. the fraction of shares retained by the original entrepreneurs, the debt equity ratio, and the level of investment, may convey information about firm characteristics. This in turn affects the behavior of firms. As a result, the original owners of firms will be incompletely diversified, firms will not take actions which maximize their stock market value, and, in particular, they may behave in a risk averse manner, paying attention to own risk (which traditional theory suggests that the only risk firms should care about is the correlation with the market).

679,Has the Rate of Investment Fallen?,['Martin Feldstein'],1981-05-01,1981-05-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Although the ratio of gross fixed nonresidential investment to GNP has decreased very little since the late 1960rs, the corresponding net investment ratio declined by nearly 40 percent between the second half of the 1960's and the second half of the 1970's. Four-fifths of this decline was due to the increased ratio of depreciation to GNP and only one-fifth to the decreased ratio of gross investment to GNP. The increased ratio of depreciation to GNP was in turn due in equal amounts to the higher ratio of capital to GNP and to the higher rate of depreciation. Nearly half of the higher depreciation rate was due to the increased rate of depreciation of equipment and nearly half to the increased share of equipment in the capital stock.

681,Alternative Tax Rules and Personal Savings Incentives: Microeconomic Data and Behavioral Simulations,"['Martin Feldstein', 'Daniel Feenberg']",1981-05-01,1981-05-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

This study examines the potential effects on personal savings of alternative types of tax rules. The analysis makes use of two extensive samples of information on individual savings and financial income: the 1972 Consumer Expenditure Survey and a stratified random sample of 26,000 individual tax returns for that year. The first type of tax rule that we consider would permit all tax-payers to make tax deductible contributions to individual savings accounts. The interest and dividends earned in these accounts would also accumulate untaxed. A potential problem with any such plan is that Individuals could in principle obtain tax deductions without doing any additional saving merely by transferring pre-existing assets into the special accounts. The evidence that we have examined indicates that this Is not likely to be important in practice since most taxpayers currently have little or no financial assets with which to make such transfers. For example, a plan permitting contributions of 10 percent of wages up to $2000 a year would exhaust all the pre-existing assets of 75 per-cent of households in just 2 years. Our evidence also shows that a ceiling on annual contributions of 10 percent of wages still leaves an increased saving incentive for more than 80 percent of households since fewer than 20 percent of households currently save as much as 10 percent a year. Specific simulations of a variety of such proposals show that even when income and substitution effects balance for a representative taxpayer (implying no change in his consumption) aggregate saving would rise considerably. The second type of tax rule that we examine would increase the current $200 interest and dividend exclusion. In 1972, among families with incomes of $20,000 to $30,000, 55 percent had more than $200 of interest and dividends; for those with incomes of at least $30,000, 82 percent had more than $200 of interest and dividends. For such families, the$200exclusion provides no incentive for additional saving. Our analysis considers four ways of strengthening the saving incentive while limiting the reduction in tax revenue:(1) a limit of $1000 on the interest and dividend exclusion; (2) a 51) percent exclusion of interest and dividends up to a $1000 limit; (3) exclusion of interest and dividends in excess of 5 percent of income over$10,000with an exclusion limit of $1000;and (4)exclusion of 20 percent of interest and dividend income without any limit. The revenue effects of all of these options were found to be quite small. But even with quite modest elasticities of current consumer spending with respect to the relative prices of present and future consumption, these plans could increase saving by significantly more than the reduction in tax revenue.

682,Simulating Nonlinear Tax Rules and Nonstandard Behavior: An Application to the Tax Treatment of Charitable Contributions,"['Martin Feldstein', 'Lawrence B. Lindsey']",1981-05-01,1981-05-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper examines how the tax simulation method can be extended to incorporate nonlinear budget constraints and nonstandard economic behavior. We simulate the effect of extending the charitable deduction to nonitemizers and study the effect of alternative ""floors"". The specific simulations indicate that the econometric evidence on charitable giving implies that extending the charitable deduction to nonitemizers would raise individual giving by about 12 percent of the existing total amount or $4.5 billion at 1977 levels. The extension would reduce tax revenue by slightly less, about $4.1 billion. A floor of $300 or 3 percent of AGI would reduce the revenue loss by 30 to 40 percent, even if there is significant bunching. The effect of the floor on increased giving depends critically on whether taxpayers' behavior is guided by conventional demand principles or by the net altruism rule. A reasonable conclusion is that a floor would reduce giving by less than the increased revenue but that the difference between them would not be very large.

683,The Decline in Black Teenage Employment: 1950-1970,['John F. Cogan'],1981-05-01,1981-05-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper examines the causes of the decline in black male teenage employment from 1950 to 1970. During this period, the employment-to-population ratio of black youth (age 16-19) declined from 46.8 percent to 27 percent. The white teenage employment ratio, in contrast, remained constant. The primary source of the decline is traced to the virtual demise of the market for low-skilled agricultural labor. All of the black teenage employment decline during this period occurs in the South. The employment ratio among those living outside the South actually increases. Within the South, the entire decline in employment is accounted for by a reduction in agricultural employment. This study argues that technological progress is the principal cause of the agricultural employment decline among black youths. Spurred by the rapid advance and adoption of labor-saving technology, southern agricultural production was transformed from a relatively labor intensive process to a highly capital intensive one. As a result, the demand for low-skilled agricultural labor plummeted. By 1970, a formerly important source of black youth employment virtually ceased to exist. Black teenagers who were displaced from agricultural work were not absorbed by the nonagricultural sector. An additional finding of this paper is that the federal minimum wage acted as an important barrier to nonagricultural employment in the South. The raw data reveal significant reductions in black teenage employment growth in precisely those industries where coverage of the minimum wage was increased : retail trade, construct ion, and the service sector. Regression estimates indicate a quantitatively large minimum wage effect.

Many macroeconomic models involving rational expect at ions give rise to an infinity of solution paths, even when the models are linear in all variables. Some writers have suggested that this non-uniqueness constitutes a serious weakness for the rational expectations hypothesis. One purpose of the present paper is to argue that the non-uniqueness in question is not properly attributable to the rationality hypothesis but, instead, is a general feature of dynamic models involving expectations. It is also argued that there typically exists, in a very wide class of linear rational expectations models, a single solution that excludes ""bubble"" or ""bootstrap"" effects -- ones that occur only because they are arbitrarily expected to occur. A systematic procedure for obtaining solutions free from such effects is introduced and discussed. In addition, this procedure is used to interpret and reconsider several prominent examples with solution multiplicities, including ones developed by Fischer Black and John B. Taylor.

688,Pitfalls in the Construction and Use of Effective Tax Rates,"['David F. Bradford', 'Don Fullerton']",1981-06-01,1981-06-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

A cost of capital formula can be a useful tool in estimating the effective tax rate on a dollar of marginal investment in a particular industry. There are a number of procedural issues, however, which can greatly affect the resulting estimates. First, tax rate estimates vary with the interest rate used in the formula. Second, the nonlinearity of tax rate formulas may lead to anomalous results. For example, an investment that is actually subsidized may appear to bear a positive tax. Or, tax rates may become arbitrarily large when the project's rate of return approaches zero. Third, effective tax rate results depend on the assumed relationship between inflation and nominal interest rates. Our conclusion is that much sensitivity analysis and specificity are required in studies that undertake to estimate effective tax rates.

This paper examines the implications of the most common system of taxing foreign source income. It is argued that, because the repatriation of earnings to the home country investor and not the earnings themselves are typically the source of tax liability, the foreign source income tax should affect foreign investment differently depending on the required transfers of funds within the firm. One implication of viewing the tax in this fashion is that in order to maximize after tax profits, a firm should finance its foreign investment out of foreign earnings to the greatest extent possible. That is, a firm's required foreign return jumps at the point at which desired foreign investment just exhausts foreign earnings. This allows us to draw a distinction between ""mature"" foreign operations, which are at any point in time financed at the margin by reinvested earnings (and perhaps also pay dividends to their: parent firm in the home country), and ""immature"" foreign affiliates, which rely on funding from their parents (and should not be paying dividends). It is noted that survey evidence on multinational firm behavior is consistent with this distinction. Direct investment data indicate that mature foreign operations probably account for nearly ninety percent of U. S. foreign direct investment. The discussion then turns to investment incentives. It is shown that the home country's rate of tax on foreign source income and the presence or absence of a foreign tax credit should be irrelevant to a mature foreign operation's investment and dividend decisions. This conclusion, which conflicts sharply with the conventional wisdom, follows because the home country tax acts as an unavoidable cost. New firms' investment decisions are, on the other hand, influenced by home country taxes.

The consumption beta theorem of Breeden makes the expected return on any asset a function only of its covariance with changes in aggregate consumption. It is shown that the theorem is more robust than was indicated by Breeden. The theorem obtains even if one deletes Breeden's assumptions that (a) all risky assets are tradable, (b) investors have homogeneous beliefs, (c) other assets can be traded without transactions costs and (d) that all assets have returns which are Ito processes.

We consider the problems that may arise when cross sectional data alone are used for inferences about individual welfare, the existence of elites, the possibilities of class boundaries, the openness of a society, etc. We also consider problems with alternative measures of socio-economic position. We then use a sample of 2400 households observed over one or two decade intervals together with data on the population of households at each observation point to examine mobility within the distribution of wealth for an almost closed economy, Utah, 1850-1870. We use information on households to examine those characteristics that contribute to mobility. We find considerable mobility, much apparently stochastic, within quite highly skewed distributions of wealth that also exhibit increasing inequality through time.

693,Monetary Policy and Short-Term Interest Rates: An Efficient Markets-Rational Expectations Approach,['Frederic S. Mishkin'],1981-06-01,1981-06-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

The impact of a money stock increase on nominal short-term interest rates has been a hotly debated issue in the monetary economics literature. The most commonly held view -- also a feature of most structural macro models--has an increase in the money stock leading, at least in the short-run, to a decline in short interest rates. Monetarists dispute this view because they believe that it ignores the dynamic effects of a money stock increase. This paper is an application of efficient markets-rational expectations theory to analyze empirically the relationship of money supply growth and short- term interest rates. This approach has the advantage over earlier research on this subject in that it imposes a theoretical structure that allows easier interpretation of the empirical results as well as more powerful statistical tests. In the interest of ascertaining the robustness of the results, many different empirical tests are carried out in this paper, and they uniformly do not support the proposition that increases in the money supply are correlated with declines in short rates.

This paper establishes that, far from being able to derive the principle of horizontal equity from utilitarianism, the principle is actually in- consistent with utilitarianism in a variety of circumstances. We derive conditions under which (a) it is optimal to impose random tax schedules (ex post randomization) ; and (b) it is optimal to randomize the tax schedules imposed on a set of otherwise identical individuals (ex ante randomization). The implications for optimal tax theory are discussed. More generally, it is shown that there are a number of potentially important economic situations with which the principle of horizontal equity may be inconsistent not only with utilitarianism but even with Pareto optimality.

695,Familial Love and Intertemporal Optimality,['Herschel I. Grossman'],1981-06-01,1981-06-01,,['Other'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper analyzes the intertemporal efficiency and optimality of steady states within overlapping-generations models in which the utility of individual working couples , depends on the consumption of their parents and children as well as their own consumption. The analysis considers both a basic model in which altruistic behavior can take only the form of gifts of consumption goods from working couples to their retired parents and an extended model in which altruistic behavior also can take the form of bequests from parents to their surviving children. In the basic model, saving only involves storing consumption goods, whereas the extended model includes capital and neoclassical production. The following conclusions from the analysis apply to both models: An altruistic utility function promotes inter-temporal efficiency. However, altruism creates an externality that implies that satisfying the conditions for efficiency does not insure intertemporal optimality. Nevertheless, if the utility of working couples is appropriately sensitive at the margin to their own consumption, their parents consumption, and their children's consumption, the steady state that is consistent with individual behavior is both efficient and optimal.

697,Implications of the Changing U.S. Labor Market for Higher Education,['Richard B. Freeman'],1981-06-01,1981-06-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper examines evidence regarding the impact of the changed labor market on the higher educational system. Four basic propositions can be drawn from the paper's findings. Firstly, the labor market for the highly educated underwent a downturn in the 1970s, reducing the relative earnings of new college graduates and forcing them into jobs not normally considered as requiring college training. Secondly, this downturn resulted in a leveling off, and, in the case of white males, a sharp decline, in college enrollment. Statistical and survey questionnaire data show that this is due to the economic responsiveness of potential students to market incentives. The effects of this labor market change were most severe in the liberal arts, teaching, and academic and research-oriented occupations. In other business-oriented fields such as management and accounting, and in engineering, economic opportunities remained substantial or in some cases improved. Consistent with these changes were changes in enrollments and degrees. Depressed job markets experienced rapid declines in enrollment, while fields such as engineering experienced an increase in enrollment. Concurrently, professional schools benefited while liberal arts schools suffered from labor market induced patterns of change in enrollment.

700,Risk and Return: A New Look,['Burton G. Malkiel'],1981-06-01,1981-06-01,,,['Monetary Economics'],,,"

One of the best documented propositions in the field of finance is that, on average, investors have received higher rates of return on in- vestment securities for bearing greater risk. This paper looks at the historical evidence regarding risk and return, explains the fundamentals of portfolio and asset pricing theory, and then goes on to take a new look at the relationship between risk and return using some unexplored risk measures that seem to capture quite closely the actual risks being valued in the market. The paper concludes that the best single risk proxy is not the traditional beta calculation but rather the dispersion of analysts' forecasts. Companies for which there is broad consensus with respect to future earnings and dividends seem to be less risky (and hence have lower expected returns) than companies for which there is little agreement among security analysts. It is possible to interpret this result as contradicting modern asset pricing theory, which suggests that total variability per se will not be relevant for valuation. As is shown in the paper, how- ever, this dispersion of forecasts could well result from different companies being particularly susceptible to systematic risk elements and thus the dispersion measure may be the best individual proxy available to capture the variety of systematic risk elements to which securities are subject.

This paper begins by examining the ways in which pension liabilities are and are not like corporate bonds. Some conceptual issues involved in valuing future pension obligations are then discussed. The second section considers the advantage to firms of fully funding their pension obligations and the reasons why many firms nevertheless choose to have unfunded obligations. The third section then summarizes the results of research on the effect of unfunded pension liabilities on the equity value of firms. The first three sections thus consider the role of pensions at the level of the individual firm. The two sections that follow focus on the current and future role of pensions in the national economy. More specifically, section 4 examines the effect of private pensions on the nation's saving rate, paying special attention to the implication of unfunded pension obligations. The fifth section then discusses the impact of inflation on the private pension system and the likely future for indexed and unindexed private pensions.

704,Debt and Economic Activity in the United States,['Benjamin M. Friedman'],1981-06-01,1981-06-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper documents a long-standing stability in the relationship between outstanding debt and economic activity in the United States, and explores the implications for capital formation of several hypotheses that could explain this observed phenomenon. The aggregate of outstanding credit liabilities of all nonfinancial borrowers in the United States bears as close a relationship to U.S. non- financial economic activity as do the more familiar asset aggregates like the money stock (however measured) or the monetary base. This stability in the debt-to-income relationship reflects the net outcome of pronounced but offsetting movements of the public and private components of the total debt aggregate. Three different hypotheses provide potential explanations for this phenomenon. Two of these, one emphasizing taxpayers' actions and one based on credit market borrowing constraints, carry the implication that increases in government debt outstanding associated with financing budget deficits crowd out private financing and hence private capital formation. The third hypothesis, which emphasizes the portfolio preferences of lenders, implies that increased government financing will not crowd out private capital formation but will cause the private sector to shift from debt to equity financing.

This paper investigates how a small country fares in an exchange-rate union if that country is subject to real and monetary disturbances originating at home and abroad. By joining a union, the country can fix the exchange rate between its currency and the currency of another country or countries. The paper asks whether or not fixing this exchange rate helps to modify the effects of disturbances on the domestic economy. This question is investigated within a model consisting of an aggregate demand equation dependent upon the terms of trade, an aggregate supply equation in which labor supply is responsive to the general price level, and a financial equation that determines the exchange rate of the domestic currency relative to one of two foreign currencies (the other being determined by triangular arbitrage) . Aggregate supply behavior varies depending upon whether wages respond to prices with a lag or are indexed to current changes in the general price level. Because the small country model cannot be used by itself to analyze the effects of foreign disturbances, the paper introduces models of two foreign countries with the same analytical structure as the domestic country model. Foreign disturbances are studied in two stages, first within the foreign model, then within the domestic model. The analysis shows that one of the most important factors determining the effects of the union is the degree of wage indexation in the domestic economy. The greater the degree of indexation, the less difference there is between output variation in the union and in a flexible regime. Apart from wage behavior, two other factors are important: the sources of the disturbances and the pattern of trade. Contrary to common belief, the case for a union is not necessarily strengthened if disturbances primarily originate outside the union and if the domestic country trades primarily with other members of the union.

708,"Inflation, Flexible Exchange Rates, and the Natural Rate of Unemployment",['Robert J. Gordon'],1981-07-01,1981-07-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Other']",['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

The most important conclusion of this paper is that the growth rate of the money supply influences the U.S. inflation rate more strongly and promptly than in most previous studies, because the flexible exchange rate system has introduced an additional channel of monetary impact, over and above the traditional channel operating through labor-market tightness. Lagged changes in the effective exchange rate of the dollar, through their influence on the prices of exports and import substitutes, help to explain why U.S. inflation was so low in 1976 and why it accelerated so rapidly in 1978. Granger causality tests indicate that lagged exchange rate changes influence inflation, but lagged inflation does not cause exchange rate changes. A policy of monetary restriction in the 1980s is shown to cut the inflation rate by five percentage points at about half the cost in lost output as compared with the consensus view from previous studies. The paper defines the ""no shock natural rate of unemployment"" as the unemployment rate consistent with a constant rate of inflation in a hypothetical state having no supply shocks and a constant exchange rate. A new estimate of this natural rate concept displays an increase from 5.1 percent in 1954 to 5.9 percent in 1980 that is entirely due to the much-discussed demographic shift in labor-force shares and relative unemployment rates. Other higher estimates of the natural unemployment rate, close to 7 percent in 1980, result from the use of a naive Phillips curve that relates inflation only to labor-market tightness and inertia variables. The paper contains extensive sensitivity tests that examine the behavior of the basic inflation equation over alternative sample periods; that enter the growth rate of money directly and track the behavior of a money- augmented equation in dynamic simulation experiments; and that test and reject the view that wage-setting behavior is dominated by ""wage-wage inertia"", that is, the dependence of wage changes mainly on their own past values.

As a companion paper to our work on students' application and colleges' admission decisions, we have estimated a joint discrete-continuous utility maximization model of college attendance and college completion. The paper is motivated by the possibility that test scores are poor predictors of who will succeed in college and thus may not promote optimal investment decisions and may indeed unjustly limit the educational opportunities of some youth. We find that: (1) College attendance decisions are strongly commensurate with college completion. Persons who are unlikely to attend college would be very likely to drop out of even their ""first-choice"" colleges, were they to attend. College human capital investment decisions are strongly mirrored by the likelihood that they will pay off. (2) Contrary to much of the recent criticism of the predictive validity of test scores, we find that their informational content is substantial. After controlling for high school class rank, for example, the probability of dropping out of the first-choice college varies greatly with SAT scores. (3) Individual self-selection, related to both measured and unmeasured attributes, is the dominant determinant of college attendance.

A model combining student preferences for college with university admissions decisions is estimated to provide information on the role of test scores in the determination of post-secondary educational opportunities. In contrast to implications of much of the recent criticism of tests and their use, we find that scholastic aptitude test scores are more strongly related to student application and choice of college ""quality"" than to college admissions decisions. In addition, although there is a substantial correlation between test scores and high school performance, we find that both post-secondary school preferences and ultimate opportunities are related as much to performance in high school as to test scores themselves. Although SAT scores certainly exclude some persons from schools, our findings indicate that they do not represent a dominating constraint on the college opportunities of high school graduates.

The effects of minimum wage legislation on the employment and wage rates of youth are estimated using a new statistical approach. We find that without the minimum, not only would the percent of out-of-school youth who are employed be 4 to 6 percent higher than it is, but also that these youth would earn more. In particular, the expected hourly earnings of youth with market wage rates below the 1978 minimum are 10 percent lower with the minimum than they would be without it. Thus, an effect of the minimum is to increase the concentration of non-employment among low-wage workers and to reduce their earnings relative to higher wage workers as well. The minimum wage accounts for possibly a third of the difference between the employment rates of black and white youth, according to our results. Our methodology is based on parameterization of the effect of the minimum on the distribution of ""market"" employment outcomes and market wage rates that would exist in the absence of the minimum. A concomitant of the estimation procedure is joint estimation of market wage and employment functions that would pertain if there were no minimum.

This paper examines the relationship between inflation, exchange rates, and the pattern of international trade and payments in a small economy with utility-maximizing agents and a transactions demand for money. Fully anticipated inflation has real effects in the model through its role as a tax on money and thereby on monetary transactions. An increase in the rate of monetary expansion generally reduces the value of domestic output and alters the composition of domestic production. The result is a change in the pattern of international comparative advantage and trade flows. The initial depreciation of the exchange rate following an increase in the rate of monetary expansion is accompanied by a trade surplus and capital outflow, while the subsequent depreciation is accompanied by a trade deficit.

This paper examines the sharing of risk under three different remedies for breach of contract. The risk considered arises from the possibility that, after a seller and buyer have entered into an agreement for the exchange of some (not generally available) good, a third party who values the good more than the original buyer may come along before delivery has occurred; the seller will want to breach. It is shown that this risk is optimally allocated by the expectation damage remedy if the seller is risk neutral and the buyer is risk averse, by the specific performance remedy if the opposite is true, and by a liquidated damage remedy if both parties are risk averse. The level of damages under the liquidated damage remedy is also shown to be bounded by the expectation measure of damages and a ""damage equivalent"" to the specific performance remedy. By means of a numerical example, it is shown that use of the prevailing remedy for breach of contract -- the expectation damage remedy -- may plausibly cause a welfare loss of as much as 20% due to inappropriate risk sharing.

This paper describes the essential similarity between ""modern"" commercial policy, with its rent-like revenues, and capital transfers. Import barriers are shown to have consequently ambiguous effects on nominal and real exchange rates. The paper also examines some important supply-side welfare Costs and consequences of import barriers through their influence on current asset prices and future capital formation. The model on which the observations are based is an aggregated fixed-endowment, full-employment, general-equilibrium model similar to those used in the pure theory of international trade, with financial capital and foreign exchange markets that are integrated in a manner consistent with the asset/portfolio-balance approach to exchange rates. The model is empirically calibrated to reflect the U.S. and the rest of the world in the early 1980's. In this empirical stylization, U.S. import barriers are shown (1) to reduce national consumption possibilities more significantly than is usually thought to be the case; (ii) to discourage U.S. physical capital formation; and (iii) to have significant yet variable effects on exchange rates, where the variability depends on the distribution between the U.S. and the rest of the world of the rent-like revenues implicit in the import barriers. It is notable that the more favorable this distribution to the U.S. the larger is the dollar depreciation caused by import barriers.

718,"The Allocation of Capital Between Residential and Nonresidential Uses: Taxes, Inflation and Capital Market Constraints","['Patric H. Hendershott', 'Sheng Cheng Hu']",1981-07-01,1981-07-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Public Economics']",['Public Economics'],,,"

We have constructed a simple two-sector model of the demand for housing and corporate capital. An increase in the inflation rate, with and with- out an increase in the risk premium on equities, was then simulated with a number of model variants. The model and simulation experiments illustrate both the tax bias in favor of housing (its initial average real user cost was 3 percentage points less than that for corporate capital) and the manner in which inflation magnifies it (the difference rises to 5 percentage points without an exogenous increase in real house prices and 4 percentage points with an exogenous increase). The existence of a capital-market constraint offsets the increase in the bias against corporate capital, but it introduces a sharp, inefficient reallocation of housing from less wealthy, constrained households to wealthy households who do not have gains on mortgages and are not financially const rained. Widespread usage of innovative housing finance instruments would overcome this reallocation but at the expense of corporate capital. Only a reduction in inflation or in the taxation of income from business capital will solve the problem of inefficient allocation of capital. The simulation results are also able to provide an explanation for the failure of nominal interest rates to rise by a multiple of an increase in the inflation rate in a world with taxes. When the inflation rate alone was increased, the ratio of the increases in the risk-free and inflation rates was 1.32. An increase in the risk premium on equities, in conjunction with the increase in inflation, lowered the simulated ratio to 1.10, introduction of a supply price elasticity of 4 and an exogenous increase in the real house price reduced the ratio to 1.03, and incorporation of the credit-market. constraint reduced the ratio to 0.95.

719,The Efficiency of Decentralized Investment Management Systems,['David S. Jones'],1981-07-01,1981-07-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

The primary purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that decentralized investment management systems may not always be efficient. Specifically, within the context of a particular portfolio choice paradigm it is shown that a given decentralized investment management system is (weakly) efficient if and only if the joint probability distribution of asset rates of return satisfy certain covariance restrictions. If these restrictions do not obtain then the asset portfolios generated by this decentralized structure will generally be inferior to those which would be generated by a completely centralized structure. This paper also discusses how the managers of departments within an efficient decentralized structure should behave so as to generate portfolios which are optimal from the point of view of the institution as a whole. Generally, departmental managers should behave as if they have less risk aversion than the institution as a whole. In fact, a given manager should be more risk averse the greater the value of his portfolio. Finally, we note that the efficiency concept employed in this paper is equivalent to the proposition that certain assets admit consistent simple sum aggregation. It is shown that this implies that the efficient decentralization of investment decisions permits the institution to economize on the information which must be passed to higher level departments.

721,Bilateral Contracts,"['Jerry R. Green', 'Seppo Honkapohja']",1981-07-01,1981-07-01,,['Other'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

The basic form of economic exchange is a bilateral relationship between buyer and seller. If economic conditions are common knowledge there is no problem in principle to determine the efficient quantity to trade. But if benefits are known only to the buyer and costs are known only to the seller a situation of bargaining under incomplete information results. Instead of relying on the vagaries of a bargaining outcome, which might be quite costly to implement, economic inefficiency is likely to be improved by a contractual arrangement that could be agreed upon in advance. In such contracts various aspects of the exchange could be allocated to the two parties involved. For example, a price per unit might be fixed in advance and the buyer might be allowed to name his quantity in the light of the information he has about benefits. A more complex version would present the buyer with a non-linear price schedule. Alternatively the supplies might be given control. While these solutions are fairly well understood, there are other types of arrangements in which control is mutual. This paper studies contracts of this nature. We examine the feasibility of implementing various agreements and the nature of optimal bilateral contracts under these informational circumstances. When the random influences impact both parties significantly, full efficiency is not attainable. We show that contracts involving mutual control might sometimes be superior to the best contract giving one side or the other exclusive dominance.

724,Tax Aspects of Corporate Pension Funding Policy,['Jeremy I. Bulow'],1981-07-01,1981-07-01,,['Financial Economics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper explores four models of firms' pension liabilities. All of the models yield the result that if it is the stockholders who gain or lose from a change in the market value of pension fund assets, a pension fund invested entirely in bonds will maximize that gain. If a firm's pension liabilities are considered to be no more than the present value of accrued benefits, then most plans for salaried employees would maximize the pension's value by having their assets entirely in bonds. However, for less well funded plans such as most union plans, holding both stocks and bonds or even all stocks may maximize the value of the firm.. Implicit contracts on the liability side of the pension balance sheet can encourage holding some stock, but implicit contracts on the asset side are likely to encourage increased bond holdings.

The common elements of these tests are highlighted. In particular, cross-equation tests for rationality or the short-run neutrality of money are shown to be equivalent to more common regression tests in the literature. Also discussed are the conditions for identification and the implications for whether hypotheses are testable.

727,On the Design of Contracts and Remedies for Breach,['Steven Shavell'],1981-08-01,1981-08-01,,['Other'],['Law and Economics'],,,"

The implications of uncertainty for the design of contracts and of remedies for their breach are studied. After characterizing complete contingent contracts, incomplete contracts are examined. Specifically, in view of difficulties in making contingent provisions (costs of enumeration and of bargaining; verification of occurrence of events), it is shown for which contingencies provisions are made. Then, in the major part of the paper, two important implicit substitute for contingent terms are analyzed. The first is provided by remedies for breach of contract; for when a party must pay damages for breach, he will be induced to fulfill his obligations in approximately those contingencies which would have been agreed upon under the terms of a detailed contract. The second substitute for contingent terms lies in the opportunity for renegotiation in light of circumstances, since renegotiation will occur in more or less those contingencies where the contract terms would have differed under a more detailed agreement.

The effect of social security and other forms of government debt on national savings is one of the most widely debated policy questions in economics today. Some estimates suggest that social security has reduced U.S. savings by almost forty percent. This paper examines recent cross-section and time series empirical tests of the social security-savings question and argues that, given current data, neither type of test has much potential for settling the controversy. In particular, there are a number of specification problems relating to social security time series regressions that can easily lead to highly unstable coefficients and to rejection of the hypothesis that social security reduces savings, even if it is actually true. These points are demonstrated by running regressions on hypothetical data generated by a perfect foresight life-cycle growth model developed previously by the authors. While the data is obtained from a model in which social security reduces the nation's capital stock by almost twenty percent, time series social security regression coefficients vary enormously depending on the specified level of the program, the preferences of hypothetical households, the level of concommitant government policies, and the time interval of the data.

In the household sector of the Flow of Funds Accounts, the difference between net acquisition of financial assets and net financial savings is equal to a statistical discrepancy which is often quite large relative to the reported changes in asset holdings. This means that the budget restrictions emphasized in the Brainard-Tobin approach to specifying asset demand equations are not satisfied by the data commonly used to estimate such equations. The view adopted in this paper is that the statistical discrepancy should be thought of as resulting from measurement error in the Flow of Funds data. By imposing a structure on the measurement error, a consistent estimator is developed and used to estimate asset demand equations for the household sector. The demand equations are similar in specification to those used by others so that the results allow a direct assessment of the effects of alternative treatments of the statistical discrepancy. The empirical results suggest that qualitative conclusions about the effects of financial flows and interest rates on asset demands are not affected by the way the statistical discrepancy is treated. Quantitative conclusions are, however, affected.

733,Taxation and On-the-job Training Decisions,['Harvey S. Rosen'],1981-08-01,1981-08-01,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Labor Economics']",['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper is an econometric analysis of the on-the-job training (OJT) decisions of a group of white American males during 1975. The data are obtained from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which asked a very careful series of questions concerning the individual's OJT status. Each individual's internal rate of return is estimated and used as an explanatory variable to predict the probability of taking OJT. The individual's marginal tax rate is also entered in the equation. The results suggest that income taxation has tended to increase the probability of being involved in OJT. I conjecture that this is because income taxation makes investment in physical capital a less desirable vehicle for carrying consumption into the future, and hence increases the attractiveness of human capital.

734,Social Security and the Decision to Retire,['Anthony J. Pellechio'],1981-08-01,1981-08-01,,['Public Economics'],,,,"

This study examines empirically whether social security influences the retirement decisions of individuals. The framework for this study is the life-cycle model of individual behavior. The life-cycle model shows that there are two main ways in which social security can affect behavior. One way is through the change in an individual's lifetime income that social security can bring about. The other way has to do with how the system changes compensation for work. Social security's income and substitution effects are included in a model for examining retirement decisions. This model is based on the model of labor force participation that has become standard in the literature on labor supply. The data used in this study come from the Social Security Administration and are particularly well suited for this study. Retirement models are estimated separately for samples of 62-64 and 65-70 year old men. The empirical results support the conclusion that social security influences the decision to retire. The magnitude of behavioral responses to changes in social security benefits are reported and implications for future behavior are discussed.

This paper proceeds as follows. We first identify the essential services provided by a financial system and then derive the characteristics of the system that would exist in a technologically advanced society unfettered by nonneutral taxes and regulations. Next we consider how taxes and regulations have shaped the existing American financial structure. Finally, we posit likely tax and regulatory changes and conjecture as to how technological innovation will further interact with these changes to alter the American financial system. Our basic contentions are that the tax and regulatory influences are eroding and that the system will eventually move toward the unfettered financial system described in the first section.

This paper examines how the optimal Pigouvian tax should be adjusted to reflect administrative costs. Several cases are examined, depending on whether the administrative costs are fixed per firm taxed or are a function of the amount of tax collected, and on whether such costs are borne by the government or by the taxed firm. In some cases, the presence of administrative costs increases the optimal tax above the external cost, while in other cases it leads to a decrease in the tax.

This paper appraises the conflicting contentions found in the majority and dissenting opinions in Commonwealth Edison Co. et al. v. Montana et al. about the feasibility of basing findings of constitutionality under the Interstate Commerce Clause on the results of incidence analysis. Severance taxes, property taxes, corporate income taxes levied by both producing and consuming states, and gross receipts taxes levied by consuming states in conjunction with price controls are considered. Factors affecting tax exporting by producing states include the degree of geographic concentration of natural resources, cartelization by producing states, the mobility of various resources, international competition, natural substitutability, government regulations, the prevalence of long-term contracts, and transportation costs. The analysis of tax exporting is sufficiently complicated that attempting to base constitutionality on estimates of tax exporting is fraught with danger, especially in times of rapid economic and institutional change, in part because it is so difficult to know when the tax exporting question is being asked properly.

Most discussions of corporate capital structure have been set in the context of a complete capital market. In this paper we study the determinants of capital structure for the incomplete markets case, where incompleteness manifests itself in the form of divergent borrowing and lending rates. We argue that firms have a natural incentive to tailor their financing choices so as to narrow such divergences. While this implies an optimal capital structure for firms in the aggregate, however, competition will drive out profits, and the capital structure of any individual firm may still be a matter of indifference. Firms' incentive to try to complete the market provides a rationale for corporate finance even in a taxless environment. This incentive may also shed light on such related issues as corporate mergers, the use of complex securities and the role of financial intermediaries.

748,Aspects of the Optimal Management of Exchange Rates,"['Jacob A. Frenkel', 'Joshua Aizenman']",1981-09-01,1981-09-01,,['International Economics'],"['International Trade and Investment', 'Economic Fluctuations and Growth', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

This paper analyzes aspects of the economics of the optimal management of exchange rates. It shows that the choice of the optimal exchange rate regime depends on the nature and the origin of the stochastic shocks that affect the economy. Generally, the higher is the variance of real shocks which affect the supply of goods, the larger becomes the desirability of fixity of exchange rates. The rationale for that implication is that the balance of payments serves as a shock absorber which mitigates the effect of real shocks on consumption. The importance of this factor diminishes the larger is the economy's access to world capital markets. On the other hand, the desirability of exchange rate flexibility increases the larger are the variances of the shocks to the demand for money, to the supply of money, to foreign prices and to purchasing power parities. All of these shocks exert a similar effect and their sum is referred to as the ""effective monetary shock."" It is also shown that the desirability of exchange rate flexibility increases the larger is the propensity to save out of transitory income. When the analysis is extended to an economy which produces traded and non-traded goods it is shown that the desirability of exchange rate flexibility diminishes the higher is the share of non-traded goods relative to traded goods and the lower are the elasticities of demand and supply of the two goods.

Implementing a 'gradualist' policy of monetary contraction, in an open economy with a freely floating exchange rate but with nominal inertia in domestic labor costs, can lead to prompt and substantial changes in the nominal and real exchange rate. One of the virtues claimed for such exchange rate 'overshooting', however, is its immediate effect on the price level and so on domestic wage and price inflation. In this paper we show that, in a model which is 'super-neutral' and has nominal inertia in both the level of labor costs and their trend or core rate of growth, this early overshooting of the exchange rate does not succeed in cutting the output costs of reducing steady-state inflation. Those output and unemployment costs which are initially avoided by over- valuing the currency have to be paid later when this overvaluation is corrected. Relative to other policies which achieve the same effect on steady-state inflation, exchange rate overshooting brings inflation down more quickly.

The principal finding is that the longitudinal/cohort earnings profile for college graduates flattened markedly relative to that for high school graduates in the 1970s. With smaller growth rates of earnings for the college educated in the period than in previous decades, the evidence lends no support to the hypothesis that the graduates who suffered economic losses during the period will recover the traditional college advantage as time proceeds. The finding that the longitudinal profile of college graduates flattened contrasts sharply with the steepening of cross-section profiles in the period, raising serious doubts about the validity of standard cross-section analyses of age-earnings curves to assess lifetime income profiles and investments in training.

The present paper analyses the effect of the interaction between tax rules and inflation on the size and allocation of the capital stock with particular emphasis on the role of owner-occupied housing. The analysis is developed in the framework of an economy that is in equilibrium and in which a constant fraction of disposable income is saved. In this model, I show that, with current U.S. tax laws, an increase in the rate of inflation reduces the equilibrium amount of business capital employed in the economy and raises the amount of housing capital. The analysis also shows that a higher rate of inflation lowers the real net-of-tax rate of return to the provider of business capital. In a richer model than the current one, i.e., in a model in which the rate of personal saving was an increasing function of the net rate of return, a higher inflation rate would therefore lower the rate of saving. The present analysis also shows that permitting firms to depreciate investments more rapidly for tax purposes increases the accumulations of business capital but that, unless firms are permitted to expense all in- vestment immediately, an increase in inÂ£ lat ion continues to depress the accumulation of business capital.

This paper measures the impact of nonassumable, fixed-rate, long-term mortgage financing on household mobility and housing demand during a period of accelerating inflation (l965_71l). We calculate that typical households who bought houses during the l96l7l period and utilized this type of financing would not have moved until the 1975-77 period. And this is in spite of rising incomes and a sharp fail in the real rental price or user cost of housing. We conclude that the nonassumable, fixed-rate mortgage is largely responsible for bath sluggish housing demand in the l967-79 period and its surge in the 1976-79 period. Housing activity would have been far more stable had variable-rate mortgagee been employed. Finally, the enormous gap between current mortgage rates and those existing in the19705 and the resultant huge capital gains on existing mortgages does not bode well for housing activity in the near term future.

This paper develops a methodology for simulating the effects of alternative corporate tax reforms on the stock market valuation and investment plans of individual firms. The methods are applied to estimate the effects of alternative corporate tax reforms on the 30 Dow Jones companies. The estimates are all based on extensions of Tobin's ""q Theory of Investment"" to take account of the effects of tax policy. As well as providing the basis for the estimates of the effects of tax policy, the results here provide strong microeconometric support for the q theory of investment. The q theory approach provides a superior method for estimating the effects of investment incentives because it recognizes the effects of changes in the cost of capital on the desired level of output. The results suggest that some potential tax reforms could have potent effects, which vary widely among firms. For example, complete indexation of the tax system would raise the Dow Jones average by an estimated 7.6 percent. The variance among companies is substantial with the effect ranging from -13 percent for Sears to 20 percent for American Brands.

This paper examines the current-account response to anticipated future increases in real oil prices as well as to unexpected increases which may be temporary or permanent in nature. The analysis is conducted using an intertemporal two-period model of a small open economy which produces both traded and nontraded goods and imports its oil. The paper identifies the channels through which various types of oil price increases affect the current account. The inclusion of nontraded investment and consumer goods permits oil price increases to generate intertemporal and static substitution effects in production and consumption which alter net international saving. Moreover, the relative oil-value-added ratio in the traded and nontraded sectors plays a crucial role in shaping these substitution effects and hence the current-account response.

762,The Holding Period Distinction of the Capital Gains Tax,['Steven Kaplan'],1981-09-01,1981-09-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

United States tax law distinguishes between short-term and long-term capital gains. By taxing long-term gains at a lower rate the law creates an incentive for investors to postpone the realization of short-term gains. This study examines the lock-in effect induced by the differential tax treatment of long- and short-term gains. Analysis of data on corporate stock transactions from 1973 suggests that the lock-in effect is large and, thus, causes investors to alter their investment portfolios. The existence of such an effect is inefficient and results in a reduction in capital market efficiency. The inefficiency might be justified if there were convincing reasons which supported the existence of the holding period distinction. It is commonly argued, for instance, that eliminating the distinction would encourage short-term speculation at the expense of long-term commitment to capital. It is also claimed that this would result in a loss of revenue to the government. This study relies on IRS data and simulations using the NBER-TAXSIM file to examine the validity of these arguments. The results of this study suggest that the holding period distinction is not very effective in deterring speculation and does not increase government revenues; in fact, it may decrease them.

764,The Potential for Using Excise Taxes to Reduce Smoking,"['Eugene M. Lewit', 'Douglas Coate']",1981-09-01,1981-09-01,,['Public Economics'],['Health Economics'],,,"

We examine the potential for reducing cigarette smoking through increases in cigarette excise taxes by estimating the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes. Using information on individual smoking behavior for a sample of adults in the 1976 Health Interview Survey, we estimate the adult price elasticity of demand for cigarettes to be -.45. Moreover, we find that price has its greatest effect on the smoking behavior of young males and that it operates primarily on the decision to begin smoking regularly rather than via adjustments in the quantity of cigarettes smoked by smokers. It follows that, if future reductions in cigarette smoking are desired, Federal excise tax policy can be a potent tool to accomplish this goal, but only in the long run. An excise tax increase, if maintained in real terms, would discourage smoking participation by successive cohorts of young adults and those reduced smoking levels would be reflected in aggregate smoking as these cohorts mature. In the short run however, the impact of an excise tax increase on aggregate cigarette consumption would be relatively small.

Section 14(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act permits certain classes of employers to pay full-time students a wage fifteen percent below the minimum wage. This study develops a new data base from administrative records, our own survey of participating company and establishment managers, and published information on local labor markets to investigate employer responses to a subminimum wage program. Our analysis of the full-time student certification program has yielded four general conclusions. First, while the most important users of the program are institutions of higher education, certain non-educational employers in the retail and service sectors employ a sufficiently large and increasing number of students below the minimum wage to suggest that the program has considerable attractiveness in the private sector. Second, area labor market conditions are a major determinant of which establishments with permits to pay students subminimum wages in fact make use of the program and the extent of that use. Establishments in areas characterized by high wages and low levels of unemployment, implying high costs in employing or locating substitute labor, make more use of student subminimum workers than establishments in areas with lower costs for substitute labor. The magnitude of the effect of area wage is, however, sensitive to the precise specification of the full-time student employment equation and the variable used to measure area wage. Although this sensitivity leads to variations in the estimation of the elasticity of substitution between student and other labor, reasonable estimates of this elasticity range from .5 to 1.0. Among company characteristics, unionism reduces program usage, while certain company incentives promote use of the program. Finally, restrictions in the law placed on hours worked at the subminimum appear to be a major reason for failure to employ students under this program.

This paper examines the conventional monetary equation of exchange rate determination. Under certain exogeneity conditions, one can write the price level, at home and abroad, as the ratio of the nominal money supply to the demand for real money balances. Then, since the exchange rate is the domestic price of foreign exchange, one can equate the exchange rate to the ratio of domestic to foreign prices. This then allows one to write, and estimate, the exchange rate as a function of the money supply differential, income differential and interest rate differential. If the domestic and foreign money demand errors are autocorrelated, and if deviations from purchasing power parity are autocorrelated, tests based on the above model may be invalid. Only if all autoregressive parameters are equal will test results be valid. A full information maximum likelihood procedure is used to estimate and test the assumptions necessary for the conventional procedure to be correct. Finally, two alternative models of exchange rate determination are considered to illustrate the importance of introducing the error terms at the beginning of the analysis.

There is discussion in both Canada and the United States of the government's requiring private pension plans to provide contractual cost-of-living protection. This paper employs both an auction and an implicit contract model to identify the compensating wage differentials required of possible indexing initiatives. The contract model, motivated by the prevalence (especially in Canada) of ad hoc cost-of-living adjustments to pensions in pay, presumes that workers have a call option on the investment earnings in excess of the interest rate assumption used to value the plan. The case for policy action would appear to rest on either (1) the assumption that workers misperceive the value (and, possibly, the security) of pension benefits or (2) the presumption that society should subsidize pension income by providing to pension plans an investment vehicle (such as an index bond) whose risk-return characteristics cannot be duplicated by portfolios of existing assets.

769,Collective Bargaining and Compulsory Arbitration: Prescriptions for the Blue Flu,['Casey Ichniowski'],1981-09-01,1981-09-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper reveals that municipal police departments are much less likely to strike in states that have collective bargaining laws than in states with no police bargaining law or when police bargaining has been outlawed. Unlike previous research which has used the state as the unit of observation, this study examines the municipal level decision to strike for a pooled cross-section of 2998 municipal police departments. Pooled cross-section estimates of this study reveal two important relationships. First, municipalities in states that provide for collective bargaining in any form experience significantly fewer police strikes than do municipalities in environments where there is no law or where police bargaining is specifically outlawed. Second, among states with duty-to- bargain rights for police, those with compulsory arbitration provisions experience significantly fewer strikes. Fixed-effect estimates that consider strike probabilities of the same cities under different statutes qualifies the first finding. Municipalities that experienced a change from a ""no law"" environment to a bargaining law environment are less likely to experience strikes while in the ""no law"" environment than are municipalities which have always been in no law environments. However, fixed-effect estimates confirm the finding that a compulsory arbitration provision significantly reduces strike propensities. Interviews with representatives from cities that experienced a police strike suggest that state agencies responsible for the administration of arbitration mechanisms could help avoid strikes by avoiding lengthy delays in the arbitration process after the expiration of contracts.

This essay examines the role of economic research in affecting the recommendations of the National Commission of Unemployment Compensation, and the likely impacts of that Commission and economists' research findings on policy. Using a questionnaire addressed to Commission members, I find that most became quite aware of the results of research on the labor- market effects of unemployment insurance, with the degree of recognition proportional to the strength of the consensus among economists on a particular result; that the members had little awareness of the identity of particular economists who had done the research; and that, though the members claimed their recommendations were influenced importantly by research, that influence is difficult to detect in the Commission's Report. Because that Report goes against the tenor of current labor- market policy, its short-run impact will likely be small; and, because the focus of interest in policy will change over time, its long-term influence may not be great. Economic research, though, is shown to have had an immediate impact in three specific cases; and its long-run effect, by conditioning the policy discussion, has been and will likely be substantial.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute some new measurements to t112 discussion of trends in the terms of trade between manufactured goods exports of developed countries and primary product exports of developing countries. The new measures are manufactured goods price indexes that are derived from price data rather than from unit value data and include some corrections for quality change. Our calculations indicate that the prices of manufactured goods exported by developed countries to developing countries have risen over twenty years or so by 75 per cent, as compared to the 140 per cent shown by the generally used UN unit value indexes. The decline in terms of trade for these goods relative to primary products has been almost 50 per cent over this period. Over tile last hundred years, fluctuations in the terms of trade of manufactured goods relative to primary products !lave been very wide, as far as we can tell from the inadequate measures we have. Impressions about trends have been highly dependent on choices of beginning and end years. There is very little evidence for a long-run trend in either direction.

775,Monetary Aggregates as Targets: Some Theoretical Aspects,['Charles Freedman'],1981-09-01,1981-09-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

In the mid-1970s the Bank of Canada, along with a number of other central banks, began to set explicit targets for monetary growth and to emphasize the long-run role of monetary aggregates in controlling the rapid upward trend of prices. There are three distinct ways of viewing and interpreting a policy of setting growth targets for monetary aggregates. The first is associated with the work of William Poole, the second is derived from the reduced-form model initially developed at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and the third, which the author has labeled the feedback- rule approach, is related to the techniques developed within central banks to implement the policy of monetary targeting. In this paper the author sets forth the logic and examines the implications of these three methods when the principal aim of policy is reducing the rate of inflation. He also examines the question of gradualist versus ""cold-shower"" policies and the criteria for selecting a monetary aggregate as a policy target.

The paper presents a dynamic portfolio model under currency inconvertibility which rationalizes the recent Egyptian experience of real exchange rate appreciation and currency diversification following the increase in oil exports and the partial financial liberalization that took place after 1976. The two shocks are linked because the relative price of manufacturing exports in terms of oil is also the premium of the black market rate over the official exchange rate. The effects of various official exchange rate policies on the temporary equilibrium values of the premium and the real wage and on the steady-state values of asset stocks are examined. A review of the Egyptian experience shows that as the model suggests the official devaluation of 1979 was ineffective against the ""Egyptian disease"" so that little can be expected from the 1981 devaluation. In light of the model results, a crawling peg policy is proposed instead.

778,The Effects of Incomes Policies on the Frequency and Size of Wage Changes,['John H. Pencavel'],1981-10-01,1981-10-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

Along with house rents, wages have frequently been described as the ""stickiest"" prices in the economy, rarely adjusted more than once a year. Because of this stickiness (which arises from the transactions costs involved in changing wages), a distinction exists between the adjustment of wages and the size of that adjustment. This distinction has important implications for empirical investigations of the determinants of aggregate money wage changes because the equations fitted in these studies are almost invariably plagued with aggregation bias unless the non-synchronous pattern of wage settlements in different sectors of the economy is taken into account. This is a particularly relevant issue when evaluating the effectiveness of incomes policies since some policies have operated by postponing the implementation of new wage settlements (in which case they are directed towards the occurrence of the event) while other policies have taken the form of specifying a permissible ceiling on wage increases (in which case they are designed to affect the extent of occurrence of the event, but not its occurrence). One purpose of this paper is to reevaluate the effectiveness of incomes policies by making use of information from one industry both on the frequency of wage settlements and on the size of wage changes when a settlement takes place. Our empirical work leads us to conjecture whether the apparent ""statistical significance"" reported by researchers with respect to the performance of variables in models of aggregate wage changes reflects primarily the effects of these variables on the probability of wages being adjusted rather than the effects on the magnitude of wage changes conditional upon wages being adjusted.

This paper presents two key facts which call into question the value of unemployment rates as barometers of labor market tightness. First, while both unemployment rates and unsatisfied labor demand proxies perform reasonably well on their own in compensation growth equations, in models which include both, only the unsatisfied demand variable appears to matter. Second, the past decade's outward shifts in Phillips plots can to a substantial degree be tied to outward shifts in plots pairing the relevant unemployment rate and unsatisfied demand proxies. The paper also provides results which indicate that Phillips relationships which are defined in terms of unsatisfied demand variables appear to be somewhat more stable than those using unemployment rates. Taken together, our findings have a clear message for those concerned with macroeconomic theory and policy: labor market pressure on wages can be more reliably assessed by looking at measures of unsatisfied labor demand than by looking at the unemployment rates on which most earlier analyses have focused.

A country that decides to fix its exchange rate thereby gives up control over its own inflation rate and the determination of the revenue received from seigniorage. If the country goes further and uses a foreign money, it loses all seigniorage. This paper uses an optimal inflation tax approach to analyze the consequences for optimal rates of income taxation and welfare of the alternative exchange rate and monetary arrangements. From the viewpoint of seigniorage, a system in which the country is free to determine its own rates of inflation is optimal; fixed exchange rates are second best, and the use of a foreign money is worse. The paper notes that seigniorage is only one of the factors determining the choice of optimal exchange rate regime, but also points out that rates of seigniorage collection are high, typically accounting for five or more percent of government revenue.

Investment abroad has come to play a major role in the total investment undertaken by U.S. firms. Despite this development, very little attention has been paid to the impacts of domestic tax policy on foreign investment. One reason has been the presumption that, since changes in domestic tax rules ordinarily also apply to foreign-source income, policy changes should affect foreign and domestic investment similarly. However, the fact that the tax on foreign-source income is deferred until the income is repatriated represents a crucial difference in the treatment of foreign and domestic income. So long as the U.S. tax is deferred, the effective U.S. tax rate on foreign-source income can be shown to be irrelevant to a firm's optimal foreign reinvestment decision. Foreign investment is now largely accomplished by firms reinvesting earnings abroad, so the reinvestment decision is of primary importance. Thus, a decrease in the effective U.S. tax rate which applies to both domestic and foreign investment income can be thought of as a cut in the tax on domestic investment income, which is encouraging to domestic investment (perhaps at the expense of foreign investment), combined with a cut in the tax on foreign investment income, which has no effect on the optimal foreign reinvestment decision. Consequently, the impacts on foreign and domestic investment of an apparently neutral policy could be very different . Another reason that the response of foreign investment has been neglected in domestic policy discussions is the lack of evidence on the magnitude of that response. This paper utilizes the theory just described to confirm that foreign investment is influenced negatively and quite strongly by the after-tax rate of return to domestic investment. A further test, in which a ""gross domestic rate of return"" term and a ""domestic tax"" term are included separately, produces coefficients virtually equal in absolute value, confirming that the net domestic rate of return is the appropriate variable. The results indicate that a tax incentive which has been found to raise net domestic investment by a dollar reduces net foreign investment by at least twenty cents. This conclusion is further reinforced by results from a forward-looking (Tobin's q) mod el. While these results do not point to the primary outcome of a domestic policy change being a domestic-foreign reallocation of the capital stock, they indicate that a significant reallocation does take place. With open economy tax analysis still in its infancy, the question of how this evidence alters the usual conclusions is largely an open one.

While previous time series studies have quite consistently found that the minimum wage reduces teenage employment, the extent of this reduction is much less certain. Moreover, because few previous studies report results of more than one specification, the causes of differences in estimated impacts are not well understood. Less consensus is evident on the effect of the minimum wage on teenage unemployment, or its relative impact on black and white teenagers. The purpose of this paper is both to update earlier work and to analyze the sensitivity of estimated minimum wage effects to alternative specification choices. In addition to providing estimates of the effect of minimum wage increases on aggregate employment and unemployment rates of teenagers, we explore several related issues: the relative importance of changing the level and coverage of the minimum wage; the timing of responses to a change in the minimum; effects on part-time and full-time work; effects on young adults (age 20-24).

The paper sets out an overlapping generations model in an open economy context. In the absence of productive capital a real consol is the vehicle for intertemporal consumption smoothing. The presence of a long term asset implies that the anticipated future path of the economy, through the term structure of interest, affects current generations. The model is applied to issues in the closed and open economy. These include the effects of debt issue on asset prices and welfare, the effect of present or anticipated future income growth, permanent or transitory. In the open economy context we investigate the welfare and current account effects of income changes on debt issue. The role of international differences in risk aversion is studied.

This paper analyzes trade in manufactured goods that are produced via a vertical production structure with many stages, where some value is added at each to an intermediate product to yield a good-in-process ready for the next stage. We consider the stage at which a good is traded to be an economically endogenous variable, with comparative advantage determining the pattern of production specialization by stages across countries. We study how endowment changes and policy shifts move the margin of comparative advantage, which thus provides a channel for resource allocation adjustment that is additional to the usual ones of factor substitution and changes in the quantity of output.

The first half of the nineteenth century was a critical juncture regarding the emergence of female participation in the market economy, the increase in the wage of females relative to that of adult males, and the evolution of large scale firms in both mechanized and non-mechanized industries. We present the first systematic and comprehensive description of these events as they evolved in the states of the Northeast to 1850. Our sources are primarily samples taken from three early censuses and reports of manufacturing, 1820, 1832, and 1850. Our principal findings are: (1) that women and children composed a large share (over 40% in 1832) of the entire manufacturing labor force during the initial period of industrialization in the U.S., but that this share began a secular decline as early as 1840; (2) that the wage of females (and boys) relative to that of adult males rose wherever large scale manufacturing establishments spread and that by 1850 this ratio had risen to almost 90% its long-term level; (3) that the labor force participation of young unmarried women in the industrial counties of the Northeast was, in 1832, high by late nineteenth century standards; and (4) that the employment of females and boys was closely associated with production processes used by large-scale establishments. Women and children had been a previously under-utilized and large segment of the potential labor force, and their harnessing by manufacturing was a critical factor in the industrialization of the Northeast.

This paper provides a formal analysis of the current account balance in a dynamic model with optimizing agents. Two analytical ideas are stressed. First, an economy's current account balance depends as much on fixture economic trends as on the current economic environment. A shift in fiscal policy, for example, will have one effect on the current account if it is perceived to be temporary and another if it is seen to be permanent. Second, temporary disturbances in the economy have permanent effects, by altering the entire future path of the economy's international indebtedness.

Free trade is not optimal for a small country that faces uncertain terms of trade if some factors are immobile - ex post, and markets for contingent claims are incomplete. The government can improve social welfare by using commercial policy that serves as a partial substitute for missing insurance markets. Using a combination of analytical and simulation techniques we demonstrate that optimal policy for this purpose will often have an anti-trade bias. We also show that the usual preference by economists for factor or product taxes and subsidies over tariffs and export subsidies may not be justified in this context.

799,A General Equilibrium Model of Taxation with Endogenous Financial Behavior,['Joel Slemrod'],1981-11-01,1981-11-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper presents and utilizes a new general equilibrium simulation model of capital income taxation. Its chief advantage over existing models of the effects of taxation is that it recognizes that agents may adjust their financial behavior in response to changes in the way that capital income is taxed. By integrating a structural treatment of portfolio choice and financial markets into a standard multi-sector model of taxation, the model can trace the general equilibrium impact of these financial adjustments and calculate the tax-induced changes in the allocation of factors and output as well as the distributional effects of any tax change. The model is used to simulate the impact of completely indexing the tax system for inflation. The results indicate there would be significant financial adjustment in response to indexing. A large shift in the distribution of private risk bearing accompanies a slight reallocation of the capital stock away from owner-occupied housing toward its other uses and a substantial change in the ownership of the housing stock by income class. All in all, indexing the tax system of an economy like the U.S. in 1977 seems to lead to an efficiency gain, slightly hurts the lowest income classes, and substantially improves the welfare of the highest income groups. The simulation results should, however, be considered tentative due to uncertainty about the values of several parameters and the relatively simple formulations of the determinants of portfolio choice and the U.S. financial structure.

804,The Economics of Wage Floors,['Jacob Mincer'],1981-11-01,1981-11-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper contains a theoretical analysis of and summaries of empirical information on consequences of wage floors in the labor market imposed by minimum wages and by labor unions. Excess supplies are rationed in part probabilistically (""first come, first served""), and in part systematically -- by raising hiring standards, or by discrimination and nepotism. Effects on employment, unemployment, and labor force participation, and on wage differentials between the II covered'' and the free sector follow. Empirical information on these effects is cited in the minimum wage case, but only wage differentials are analyzed in the union context. Other consequences outlined here are: lengthening of school attendance, reduction of hours of work, substitution of paid out wages for fringes in the minimum wage case. However, union pressure on fringes is greater than on wages. This strategy produces larger income and greater job security for union members. The minimum wage reduces opportunities for job training and consequent wage growth. Quits initially decline as wages are pushed up, but turnover is likely to increase as the training content of jobs is reduced. Union wage and fringe advantages reduce quits significantly. However, training as well as wage growth are reduced.

808,"Union Effects: Wages, Turnover, and Job Training",['Jacob Mincer'],1981-11-01,1981-11-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This study explores the existence of a net union premium and of the extent of rationing by quality of the resulting excess supply. The net union premium was estimated by relating changes in wages to changes in union status of the same worker in longitudinal panels (NLS and MID), and by two cross-section wage level regressions, a ""prospective"" and ""retrospective"" which permit more direct observation of selectivity in hiring. Over a half of the cross-section differential of over 20% for the ""same"" (standardized) worker is a net union rent and much of the rest reflects a quality adjustment in hiring, as measured by wages. This conclusion was less reliable for older workers. Subsequent analysis explores the effects of successful union wage pressure on: quit rates, fringe benefits, wage profiles, and training. The reduction in quit of union joiners depends on the size of the net wage premium. Quit rate differentials are also positively related to the gross, cross-section wage differentials within groups of workers, classified by location and occupation, less so by industry. In Section 4, it is hypothesized that the imposition of larger fixed labor costs (such as fringes) helps to deter employers from preferring reductions in hours to reductions in men, and it helps to stabilize employment in the face of fluctuating demand, by a more frequent use of overtime and of temporary layoffs in the union sector. This hypothesis links the size of fringe benefits to the union wage gain. An analysis of firms in 70 industries confirms this link. Union pressure is exerted on the whole tenure profile of wages. The explicit linking of wage levels to seniority reduces incentives for worker investment in general (transferable) training. The total volume of training is indeed reported to be smaller in union jobs, and this is consistent with the flatter profile.

810,Secular Patterns in Corporate Finance,"['Robert A. Taggart', 'Jr.']",1981-12-01,1981-12-01,,['Financial Economics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

Trends in the financing of the corporate sector have been widely discussed in both business and academic circles. It is frequently argued, for example, that corporations' use of debt financing has increased dramatically in recent years. These discussions have been hampered, however, by the lack of a unified theoretical framework. In this paper, an attempt is made to develop such a framework using existing corporate finance theory and some extensions thereof. This theory is then used to interpret available data on aggregate corporate financing patterns over the course of the twentieth century. It is found that corporations' use of debt has undeniably increased in the post-World War II period. Nevertheless, the relative corporate debt level was unusually low in the 1940's and current debt levels are not unprecedented when viewed in the context of the entire century. The tax system, in conjunction with inflation, has probably played an important role in the postwar increases in corporate debt, but these factors appear insufficient to explain longer-term trends. It is argued, then, that supplies of competing securities, such as federal government bonds, as well as the secular development of the financial intermediary system, may also be important determinants of long-run corporate financing patterns.

This paper describes an empirical study of the effects of federal minimum wage policy on aggregate employment, on the employment of various demographic groups, and on employment in low-wage industries. The analytical framework permits separate testing both for direct employment effects of the level and coverage of the minimum wage and for indirect employment effects resulting from a possible role for the minimum wage as a cause of monetary nonneutrality. Another innovation in this study is the inclusion of rational expectations of expected future relative minimum wages as determinants of the demands and supplies of labor services. The study finds that minimum-wage policy seems not to affect aggregate employment or average wages either directly or indirectly. Minimum-wage policy, however, has large and statistically significant effects on the industrial and demographic composition of employment, with employment decreasing in certain low-wage industries and for teenagers and for young men but increasing for young women and for adults. A major part of these effects are associated with anticipated future changes in the level of the minimum wage.

This paper examines one of the possible factors which has contributed to the significant recent growth in the Social Security Administration's Disability Insurance program: that of health care incentives under the program. The examination of health care incentives involves a 2-period, 2-state insurance model under uncertainty which incorporates two general types of insurance. One form of insurance is disability insurance, and the other is the individual; ""own"" insurance or own risk bearing -- which is represented by acute care and preventive care expenditures. The model predicts a positive effect of disability insurance on acute care, while the extent to which disability insurance discourages preventive care depends largely on the effect of preventive care on the price of disability insurance. Regression estimates using data from the 1969 Longitudinal Retirement History Study(LRHS) indicate an elasticity of prescription drug expenditures (acute care) with respect to benefits of about .5, and an elasticity of use of X-rays and inoculations (preventive care) with respect to benefits of about -.004.

Diagrammatic exposition is used to study the 'Dutch disease', and in particular the distinction between the short term wealth effects (causing a real appreciation and a movement of variable factors from tradable to non-tradable industries) and between the long-run effects on total investment, its sectoral allocation and its finance by foreign borrowing. The framework further enables analysis of the different allocational effects of temporary versus permanent raw material price increases, when the two sectors differ in material use. Also discussed are the effects of changes in the world interest rate on factor allocation and foreign borrowing as well as the allocational effects of government intervention in the case of temporary real wage rigidity.

Our paper presents a methodology that can be used to estimate the extent of noncompliance with the overtime pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The methodology is applied to data from the May 1978 Current Population Survey and the 1977 Michigan Quality of Employment Survey. These data suggest that the fraction of covered workers working overtime who fail to receive a premium of at least time and a half, as called for by the legislation, is in the range of 25 percent. They also suggest that the extent of noncompliance is greater in those industries in which size class exemptions to the legislation exist (retail trade and selected service industries). Finally, probit analyses of the determinants of noncompliance suggest that decisions about whether to comply with the overtime provisions of the FLSA are at least partially based on the associated benefits and costs.

This paper seeks to discover the criteria by which workers are judged to be ""troubled,"" to examine the severity of the economic problems facing ""troubled"" groups, and to determine whether the condition of these people is relatively permanent or the result of transitory setbacks. The paper provides a broad overview of some of the literature on troubled groups in the labor market, and puts forth several basic propositions about those having trouble in the labor market. Among these are the fact that many workers at the bottom of the income distribution are permanently plagued by problems of low earnings, that workers who drop substantially in the earnings distribution do not recover their previous economic positions, and that personal, unobserved characteristics are important factors in the labor market problems of individuals. Another finding is that areas with high rates of unemployment tend to experience these rates for a decade or more, classifying most regional differences in unemployment as permanent rather than transitory.

This paper investigates the hypothesis that surprise changes in the money supply and anticipated inflation (the Mundell-Tobin effect) are both inversely related to the expected real interest rate. The two novel aspects of the investigation are tests of the hypothesized impact of money surprises on real rates while simultaneously testing the Mundell-Tobin hypothesis and estimation employing transfer function methodology developed by Box and Jenkins (1970). The transfer function enables the investigator to entertain the hypothesis that residuals may not follow a simple AR-1 process, as is usually assumed in corrections for correlated residuals, but rather may be appropriately represented by a more complex ARMA process. Based on quarterly data from 1959-1 - 1980-IVY results obtained constitutes failure to reject either an inverse relationship between money surprises and expected real interest or an inverse relationship between anticipated inflation and expected real interest. These findings do not constitute a rejection of market efficiency.

821,New Measures of Labor Cost: Implications for Demand Elasticities and Nominal Wage Growth,['Daniel S. Hamermesh'],1981-12-01,1981-12-01,,"['Labor Economics', 'Econometrics']",['Labor Studies'],,,"

This study develops alternative quarterly measures of labor costs that refine the published data on hourly earnings and hourly compensation for the period 1953-1978. These new series account for deviations of hours paid for from hours worked, for the tax treatment of wages under the corporate income tax, and for variations in the user cost of training. They generally produce somewhat higher elasticities of labor demand, and explain variations in employment over time slightly better than do the published series. They also provide a different view of the recent path of wage inflation in the United States, suggesting that nominal wage growth has been more responsive to variations in the rate of price inflation than the published labor-cost series indicate. A data appendix lists the values of these new series; one series (that which adjusts for the hours paid/hours worked distinction) can be updated with readily avail- able data by persons interested in using these more appropriate measures of the cost of labor facing employers.

822,Alternatives to the Current Maximum Tax on Earned Income,['Lawrence B. Lindsey'],1981-12-01,1981-12-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

The Maximum Tax on Personal Service Income was intended to reduce the maximum marginal tax rate on earned income to 50 percent. In general it did not achieve this result, although it did lower marginal tax rates on both earned and unearned income. This paper considers the effect of different tax rate structures on the total tax revenue collected from high income taxpayers. The sensitivity of tax avoidance practices to marginal tax rates is estimated using four different specifications. These estimates are then combined with plausible parameter values for income and substitution effects in the supply of labor to produce a range of elasticities of taxable income with respect to tax rates. The NBER Taxsim model is then used to estimate the effects of different rate structures on tax revenue.

Speculative runs on asset price fixing schemes are most often attributed either to an inexplicable mass hysteria or to a sudden, unpredictable random disturbance. Such attribution places runs and panics outside of the realm of scientific inquiry. Alternatively, in this paper I define the notion of a run as a discontinuous shift in portfolio asset holdings brought about by a belief in the end of the price fixing regime. I also argue that runs are foreseeable events and employ the current difficulties of S & L's to serve as an extended example which emphasizes such predictability.

824,Inflation and the Valuation of Corporate Equities,['Lawrence H. Summers'],1981-12-01,1981-12-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper examines the relationship between inflation and the return on individual corporate securities. This question is of substantial importance in light of the puzzling behavior of the stock market over the last decade. Conventional financial theory holds that equity should be a good inflation hedge since it represents a claim of real rather than nominal assets. Yet a negative relationship between both expected and unexpected inflation and stock market returns has been widely documented. This relationship, which appears to antedate the surge in inflation over the last 15 years. might provide an explanation for the market's surprising recent performance. This paper studies differences across firms in the response of stock market values to changes in expected inflation in an effort to explore the reasons for the aggregate negative relationship between inflation and stock market values. Two opposing hypotheses about the impact of inflation on market valuation are contrasted. The ""inflation illusion"" hypothesis holds that investors are not able to see through nominal accounting statements and respond to reported rather than real profits. The opposing ""tax effects"" hypothesis holds that firms which report spuriously high profits due to inflation are penalized because the extra tax burden incurred reduces real profits. The results from the 1970's strongly bear out the predictions of the tax effects hypothesis. Aggregate calculations suggest that the interaction of inflation and taxation can account for a large part of the decline in the stock market which has been observed over the past decade. A significant part of the remainder appears to be due to increasing investor awareness of the need to adjust for historic cost depreciation.

825,The Impacts on Capital Allocation of Some Aspects of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981,"['Patric H. Hendershott', 'James D. Shilling']",1981-12-01,1981-12-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper develops and employs a five-asset, four-household and single-business sector simulation model to measure the long-run impacts of the major provisions of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 on the allocation of a fixed capital stock among owner-occupied housing, rental housing, and nonresidential capital. The specific provisions analyzed are the increases in tax depreciation for nonresidential capital and rental housing and the reduction in the maximum tax rate on unearned income. Our analysis suggests a 6 percent increase in nonresidential capital, an 11 percent decline in owner-occupied housing and little change in rental housing (the increase in the number of renters -- the homeownership rate declines by 1 1/2 percentage points -- offsets a decline in the quantity of rental services demanded per renter). In the absence of an increase in aggregate saving, real pretax interest rates rise by nearly two percentage points. Corporate profit taxes decline by 60 percent, and after-tax earnings rise by 25 percent. As a result of the Act, the net (of depreciation) user costs for the three types of capital will almost be equalized.

826,Productivity and R and D at the Firm Level,"['Zvi Griliches', 'Jacques Mairesse']",1981-12-01,1981-12-01,,,"['Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship']",,,"

This paper analyzes the relationship between output, employment, and physical and R&D capital, for a sample of 133 large U.S. firms covering the years 1966 through 197. In the cross sectional dimension, there is a strong relationship between firm productivity and the level of its R&D invespments. In the time dimension, using deviations from fire means as obserrations and unconstrained estimation, this relationship bomes closa to vanishing. This may be due, in part, to the increase in collinearity between trend, physical capital, and R&D cap)tal in the within dimension, leaving little ildependent variability there. When the coefficients of the first two variables are constrained to reasonable values, the R&D coefficient is both sizeable and significant. The possibility of simultaneity between output and employment decisions in the short run is also investigated. Allowing for this via the use of a semi-reduced form equations system yields rather high estimates of the importance of R&D capital relative to physical capital. Our data do not allow us, however, to answer any detailed questions about the lag structure of the effects of R&D on productivity. These effects are apparently highly variable, both in timing and magnitude.

Much of the debate surrounding the enactment of President Reagan's tax plan was concerned with the short run effects of macroeconomic stimulation.  Now that the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 has become law, it is appropriate to look again at the long run effect of these tax cuts. This paper measures, for 37 different assets and for 18 different industries, the reduction in effective corporate tax rates that result from the acceleration of depreciation allowances and the expansion of the investment tax credit. It also uses a detailed dynamic general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy to simulate the effects of the new Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) on revenues, investment, long run growth, and capital allocation among industries. We find significant welfare gains from ACRS, but we find larger welfare gains from alternative plans that were not adopted.

In this paper we analyze the determinants of the evolution of ex- change rates within the context of alternative models of exchange rate dynamics. We examine the overshooting hypothesis in models which emphasize differential speeds of adjustment in asset and goods markets as well as in models which emphasize portfolio balance considerations. We show that exchange rate overshooting is not an intrinsic characteristic of the foreign exchange market and that it depends on a set of specific assumptions. We also show that the overshooting is not a characteristic of the assumption of perfect foresight nor does it depend in general on the assumption that goods and asset markets clear at different speeds. As long as the speeds of adjustment in the various markets are less than infinite, the key factor determining the short run effects of a monetary expansion is the degree of capital mobility. When capital is highly mobile, the exchange rate overshoots its long-run value and when capital is relatively immobile the exchange rate undershoots its long-run value. Within the context of the portfolio-balance model we show that the effects of a monetary expansion on the dynamics of exchange rates and in particular on whether exchange rates overshoot or undershoot their equilibrium path depend critically on the specification of asset choice, on the degree of substitution among assets, and on the quality of the various assets in being an inflation hedge, Specifically, when internationally traded goods are a better inflation hedge than nontraded goods, the nominal exchange rate overshoots the domestic price level and conversely.

This paper is a highly selective review of our knowledge about the scope for sterilized intervention in foreign exchange markets under alternative exchange-rate regimes. Section I demonstrates the potential importance of simultaneous-equations bias in single-equation econometric studies of the capital-account offset to monetary policy under fixed exchange rates. The empirical record suggests that, in the case of West Germany, sterilization was a feasible short-run monetary strategy in the 1960s. Section II notes that there is considerable recent evidence of imperfect asset substitutability under the managed float. While limited substitution between bonds of different currency denomination is a precondition for the efficacy of sterilized foreign-exchange intervention, it is no guarantee of efficacy. Whether limited substitutability can in fact be exploited in a predictable manner by central banks is a distinct, and unanswered, question.

The paper uses an intertemporal perfect-foresight optimizing model to analyze the effect of transitory terms-of-trade shocks on a small open . economy's current-account and utility time profiles. An adverse terms-of-trade shift known to be temporary induces the economy to run down its stock of external assets in the period before the terms of trade revert to their initial level. Subsequently, the assets consumed during this period are reaccumulated. The current-account response is due only in part to a desire to smooth out the future consumption stream. In addition, households know that the real value of any debt incurred while the terms of trade are unfavorable will be reduced sharply when the terms of trade improve. This opportunity for intertemporal price speculation causes the time path of instantaneous utility to be discontinuous,

Unlike price expectations, which are central to macroeconomic theory and have been examined extensively using survey data, formation of individuals' horizons, which are central to the theory of life-cycle behavior, have been completely neglected. This is especially surprising since life expectancy of adults has increased especially rapidly in Western countries in the past ten years. This study presents the results of analyzing responses by two groups--economists and a random sample--to a questionnaire designed to elicit subjective expectations and probabilities of survival. It shows that people do not extrapolate past improvements in longevity when they determine their subjective horizons, though they are fully aware of levels of and movements within today's life tables. They skew subjective survival probabilities in a way that implies the subjective distribution has greater variance than its actuarial counterpart; and the subjective variance decreases with age. They also base their subjective horizons disproportionately on their relatives' longevity, and long-lived relatives increase uncertainty about the distribution of subjective survival probabilities. As one example of the many areas of life-cycle behavior to which the results are applicable, the study examines the consumption-leisure choices of the optimizing consumer over his lifetime. It finds that shortfalls in utility in old age because people's ex ante horizons had to be updated as -- average longevity increased are relatively small. This implies that large subsidies to retirees under today's Social Security system cannot be justified as compensation for an unexpectedly long retirement for which they failed to save.

In this paper a three-country model based on intertemporal maximizing behavior is constructed in order to analyze the effects of oil price increases on welfare levels and trade balance positions. The model can also be used to assess the effects of oil price increases on the world interest rate, on the final goods terms of trade between oil importers (what is sometimes called the real exchange rate), and on output, investment and savings levels, oil imports, wages, and consumption at each date. The analysis highlights the role of structural asymmetries between oil importers in accounting for differences in trade balance responses. A number of structural differences are isolated in turn in order to determine their influence on the final goods terms of trade, which is the key factor in affecting relative trade balance positions.

Thus, to the extent that arbitrariness is characteristic of agents' behavior it is not resolve6 but only masked by the fixing of exchange rates.

845,Expectations and Forecasts from Business Outlook Surveys,['Victor Zarnowitz'],1982-01-01,1982-01-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Each quarter since 1968 the National Bureau of Economic Research, in collaboration with the American Statistical Association, has been collecting a large amount of information on the record of forecasting in the U. S. economy. This paper is a progress report on a comprehensive study of the distribution of individual predictions from these surveys. It covers forecasts of quarterly developments in the year ahead for six variables representing inflation, real growth, unemployment, percentage changes in GNP and spending on consumer durables, and business inventory investment. The 79 respondents who participated in at least 12 of the 42 surveys covered constitute a broadly based and diversified group of experts and agents, mostly from the world of corporate business and finance -- executives, analysts, economic consultants, also some government and academic forecasters. The data are in certain respects uniquely rich. The first part of the paper reviews briefly the models of economic expectations and discusses the potential and problems of using survey data for testing these models. The second part offers a comparative analysis of the individual prediction series from the NBER-ASA as well as some earlier surveys. There are gains from combining predictions from different sources, e.g., the group mean forecasts are on the average over time more accurate than most of the corresponding sets of individual forecasts or expectations. But there is also a moderate degree of consistency in the relative 2erformances of individual fore- casters, some of whom score well above average with respect to several variables and predictive horizons. The third section presents the distributions of an array of absolute accuracy measures for the survey respondents, regressions of actual on predicted values, and associated tests of bias and autocorrelation of error. The marginal forecast errors tend to increase, and the correlations between predictions and realizations tend to decrease, as the target quarter recedes into the future. The tests of the joint null hypothesis that the regressions have zero intercepts and unitary slope coefficients are very unfavorable to expectations of inflation, but they show the forecasts of the other variables generally in much better light. Inflation has been largely underestimated, with the predicted rates lagging behind the actual rates. On the other hand, real growth has been on the average overestimated. The incidence of autocorrelation in the prediction errors was also much higher for inflation than for the other variables. A summary of findings is provided. The fifth and last section lists some additional questions raised by this study, to be dealt with in another paper.

Arthur M. Okun's last book, Prices and Quantities, contributes a theory of universal wage and price stickiness, but provides no explanation at all of historical and cross country differences in behavior. The core of this paper provides a new empirical characterization of price and wage changes over the last century in the U.S., U.K., and Japan, in order to demonstrate the wide variety of historical responses that have occurred. Equations for changes in the GNP deflator, in the hourly manufacturing wage rate, and in the real wage rate are estimated, with attention to the influence of both demand and supply disturbances. Because of the long sample period involved, extending back to 1875 for the U.K. and to 1892 for the other two countries, there is extensive attention to shifts in parameters. My description of U.S. data differs from Okun's framework by rejecting his wage-wage formulation of the postwar U.S. inflation inertia process, by allowing the impact of demand disturbances to depend on both the level and rate of change of aggregate demand, by allowing demand to influence price- setting as well as wage-setting behavior, and by stressing the fact that inertia in the U.S. adjustment process is purely a postwar phenomenon rather than the universal fact implied by Okun. The results for the U.K. and Japan com- pound the conflict with Okun's analysis, since in these two countries wages have been far from sticky, even in postwar years. Prices and wages were particularly flexible in the U.S. during World War I and its aftermath, in Japan since 1914, and in the U.K. since the mid-1950s. The last half of the paper provides an analysis of behavior in labor markets and product markets. The unique nature of the U.S. postwar adjustment reflects its unique institution of three-year staggered wage contracts, and the analysis attempts to explain why we do not observe perfect insulation of nominal wages from shifts in nominal demand. The section on the product markets examines the factors that explain why prices are often pre-set, and why the speed of adjustment to demand shocks is sensitive to the nature of aggregate information available.

Particular attention is paid to a novel part of ACRS that creates a ""safe harbor"" for a wide range of sale-leaseback arrangements, effectively permitting the sale of depreciation deductions by investors without taxable income.

This paper is a re-examination of the relationship between research and development (R&D) activity and total factor productivity (TFP) at the industry level during the period extending from the early 1960's to the mid-1970's. The data base consists of NSF data on applied R&D expenditures by product class, matched to TFP indices derived from the detailed Census-Penn-SRI manufacturing data file. A hypothesis suggested by previous research on the R&D-productivity relationship is that, due, perhaps, to the depletion of scientific opportunities, the ""potency'' of R&D as a source of technological progress has declined in recent years. Our findings indicate, however, that the relationship between an industry's R&D-intensity and its productivity growth did not disappear; if anything, the relationship was stronger in recent years. The overall deceleration in productivity in recent years has affected R&D-intensive industries, but to a lesser extent than it has other industries. What cannot be found in the data is strong evidence of the differential effects of the slowdown in R&D itself. The time series appear to be too noisy and the period too short to detect what the major consequences of the retardation in the growth of R&D expenditures may yet turn out to be.

This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of input price shocks on economic growth, with a focus on United Kingdom manufacturing in the 1970s. The theoretical model predicts a discrete decline in out- put and productivity after an input price rise, and a longer-run slowdown in productivity growth, real wage growth, and capital accumulation. These features characterize the United Kingdom and most other OECD economies after 1973. The empirical results confirm the important role of input prices in recent U.K. adjustment, but also point to an important role for other supply and demand factors.

It is well known that a domestic resource discovery gives rise to wealth effects that cause a squeeze of the tradeable good sector of an open economy. The decline of the manufacturing sector following an energy discovery has been termed the ""Dutch disease,"" and has been investigated in many recent studies. Our model extends the principally static analyses to date by allowing for: (1 ) short-run capital specificity and long-run capital mobility; (2) inter- national capital flows; and (3) far-sighted intertemporal optimizing behavior by households and firms. The model is solved by numerical simulation.

This paper analyzes the interaction of money and the price level with a business cycle that is fully real in origin, adopting a view which differs sharply from traditional theories that assign a significant causal influence to monetary movements. The theoretical analysis focuses on a banking system that produces transaction. services on demand and thus reflects market activity. Under one regime of bank regulation and fiat money supply by the monetary authority, the real business cycle theory predicts that (i)movements in external monetary measures should be uncorrelated with real activity and(ii) movements in internal monetary measures should be positively correlated with real activity. Preliminary empirical analysis provides general support for this focus on the banking sector since much of the correlation between monetary measures and real activity is apparently with inside money.

The labor supply decision by an individual involves the effect of the disability benefit structure (potential benefits) on labor force participation. Probit estimates from the 1969 original sample of the Longitudinal Retirement History Study (LRHS) indicated an elasticity of participation with respect to benefits of -0031 for married men aged 58-63, and -.023 for all men of the same age group. The magnitude of these estimates are much less than those found by authors such as Parsons, and suggest relatively insignificant efficiency losses in terns of reduced work effort.

Throughout the industrialized world, macroeconomic performance since the mid-1970s has been very poor, and the prospects in the near term remain bleak. While there is no consensus among macroeconomists regarding the diagnosis (or cure) of these ills, the major competing schools of thought have focused most of their blame on macroeconomic policy. This paper summarizes a series of studies, in collaboration with Michael Bruno, suggesting rather that supply shocks coupled with real wage rigidities are a central source of the poor macroeconomic performance. Various hypotheses are mentioned as a source for the resistance to real wage cuts, and some illustrations of the policy implications of supply shocks are provided.

Many models of exchange rate determination imply that movements in money supplies and demands should result in movements in exchange rates. Hence, if rational agents are attempting to forecast exchange rate movements, they should in the first instance forecast movements in the supplies of and demands for money balances. Furthermore, if these underlying variables follow some stable autoregressive processes agents should use those processes to make their forecasts. If we identify the forward rate with the market's expectation for the future spot rate, rationality of expectations will imply testable cross-equation restrictions in a joint model of the autoregressions and exchange rate forecasting equation. This strategy is implemented in the paper using data on the L UK/$US and DM/$US exchange rates from the recent floating rate period.

Excessive layoffs in bad times and excessive quits in good times both stem from the same weakness in practical employment arrangements: the specific nature of worker-firm relations creates a situation of bilateral monopoly. Institutions which have arisen to avert the associated inefficiency cannot mimic the separation decisions of a perfect-information, first-best allocation rule. Simple employment rules based on predetermined or indexed wages are in many cases the most desirable among the class of feasible employment arrangements. More complicated contracts which seem to deal more effectively with turnover issues are either infeasible because of informational requirements or create adverse incentives on some other dimension.

This paper presents a systematic analysis of the purchasing power parity hypothesis (PPP). This hypothesis states that the exchange rate is equal to the ratio of the domestic price level to the foreign price level. It has recently been argued that PPP performs poorly in the 1970s. This paper examines several possible explanations for this poor performance . We examine PPF in the 1920s and the 1970s, using monthly and quarterly data, to see if the relationship has changed over time. We also examine PPP in a multi-exchange rate world, allowing a quite general error process so as to allow deviations from PPP to be autocorrelated and correlated across currencies. We are then able to examine the degree to which the world has become more interdependent. We also provide evidence that deviations from PPP may follow a random walk. Finally, the role of the U.S. dollar as base currency is examined. We find, in general, that PPP holds quite well as a long run proposition, but the deviations from PPP tend to persist.

This paper examines the financing decisions of regulated public utilities. It is argued that the regulatory process affects utility financing choices both by conditioning the environment in which these choices are made and by creating opportunities for firms to influence the regulated price through strategic financing behavior. The nature of this regulatory effect continually changes, however, as economic conditions change and as regulators, firms and consumers adapt to one another's decisions. The direction of the impact on utility financing, therefore, may differ both over time and across regulatory jurisdictions. This theory of regulatory influence is tested by examining several episodes in the financing experience of U.S. electric utilities from 1912 to 1979. Evidence of a regulatory effect on utility financing is found particularly for the early years of state commission regulation. Examples of an adaptive response pattern on the part of regulators, firms and consumers are also cited.

First, common efficient markets-rational expectations tests are compared, and it is shown that four of the five tests considered are asymptotically equivalent, and that the fifth is less restrictive than the other four. Second, the joint hypothesis is tested using weekly data for Treasury bills maturing in exactly 13 and 26 weeks beginning in 1970 and ending in 1979. In contrast, previous studies using comparable data have typically discarded 12/13 of the sample to form a nonoverlapping data set. Finally, a more complete set of possible determinants of time-varying term premiums is tested.

870,The Trade-Off between Wages and Employment in Trade Union Objectives,['John H. Pencavel'],1982-03-01,1982-03-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper demonstrates that, contrary to a widely-held opinion, the determination of the goals of unions is fully amenable to empirical analysis. A characterization of the wage and employment-setting process in unionized markets is adopted and its qualitative implications examined. The first-order condition for this model is fitted to time- series data on the newspaper industry from ten cities. The Inter- national Typographical Union 's objective function reveals very restricted opportunities for substituting wages for employment in response to a change in the slope of the employer's labor demand function. Larger union locals place greater emphasis on wages versus employment than smaller union locals.

Currently U.S. Federal Income Tax schedules do not maintain marriage neutrality, that is, tax liabilities depend upon marital status. This paper shows the extent and distribution of the departure from neutrality both under current law and the new (1981) tax act. The new tax law establishes a secondary earner's deduction of 10% of secondary earner's wages (up to 3U00 dollars). The child-care credit is also liberalized. Analyses of the revenue, welfare and labor supply effects of these provisions are also given.

873,Aggregation and Stabilization Policy in a Multi-Contract Economy,"['Alan S. Blinder', 'N. Gregory Mankiw']",1982-04-01,1982-04-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

This paper presents a model of a multi-sector economy in which each sector is characterized by a different type of wage or price stickiness. The various sectors experience the same exogenous shocks and have the same money supply. The analysis shows demand shocks pose no serious problems for stabilization policy. In contrast, supply shocks force the policymaker to choose between stability in one sector and stability in another. The analysis also shows the economy cannot be usefully aggregated into a single sector model. Such an aggregation misleads the economist as to the economy's underlying structure and obscures the tradeoffs the policymaker must confront. In particular, a feedback rule chosen on the basis of an aggregate model could be better or worse than a passive policy.

874,Welfare Aspects of Government Issue of Indexed Bonds,['Stanley Fischer'],1982-04-01,1982-04-01,,,['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Government issue of bonds indexed to the price level has long been recommended by economists, to no observed effect. Recently skepticism has been expressed about the real effects of such government action, or indeed of any government financial intermediation. This paper examines two main approaches that might argue for government issue of indexed bonds. The first asks what financial intermediation can be provided by government that the private sector cannot provide. The answer is that the government can use its taxation powers to make possible intergenerational risk sharing that private markets cannot. This argument suggests government issue of bonds indexed to wage income. The second approach discusses optimal forms of government debt issue in light of the government's ability to manipulate the payoffs on debt which has an uncertain real return. In this context indexed debt has the potential advantage of enforcing consistency in government financing and actions

875,Risk Attitudes in Health: An Exploratory Study,"['Friedrich Breyer', 'Victor R. Fuchs']",1982-04-01,1982-04-01,,['Public Economics'],['Health Economics'],,,"

Recent studies on human decision-making under uncertainty have revealed the following typical behavioral principles: (1) the importance of the status quo as a reference point (""target"") for assessing outcomes, (2) the prevalence of risk-aversion for gains, i.e. above-target payoffs, but risk-seeking for potential losses, and (3) a tendency to give more weight or ""marginal utility"" to a small loss than a gain of the same size. We investigate whether and how these aspects carry over from the money to the health context, examining the responses to a questionnaire by 325 patients from three outpatient facilities in Palo Alto, California. The questionnaire consisted of twelve hypothetical choice situations each with the choice between two alternative modes of treatment for a supposed illness. In each case, one of the options promised a certain (favorable or unfavorable) health effect, the other one a probabilistic effect. The majority choices confirm the relevance for the health context of all three above-mentioned principles. Risk-aversion for gains, risk- seeking for losses and the differences in slope of the utility function were all significant and substantial in magnitude. When trying to trace back differences in risk attitudes to demographic or socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents, we find that education is the most important corre1ate:choices of people with more years of schooling exhibit less risk-aversion for gains and less risk-seeking for losses and thus correspond to a more linear relationship between health and utility.

878,What! Another Minimum Wage Study?,"['Mary Eccles', 'Richard B. Freeman']",1982-04-01,1982-04-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

The Minimum Wage Study Commission was established in 1977 to aid Congress in investigating the effects and possible consequences of two proposed changes in the minimum wage law: indexing the wage to inflation and providing for a youth differential. This paper seeks to determine to what extent the Minimum Wage Study Commission's work has been helpful in policy debate, and compares the Commission's findings with those of the more conservative American Enterprise Institute. The paper also examines whether the Commission's final product was worth three years of study and $17 million. Our overall finding is that the Commission's report appears to have had little or no policy impact. The research did little to expand upon similar studies done prior to 1977, and cannot be said to be worth three years and $17 million. However, policy-makers still regard the report as a useful and credible examination of the effects of the mini- mum wage on the economy.

879,Piece Rate vs. Time Rate: The Effect of Incentives on Earnings,['Eric Seiler'],1982-04-01,1982-04-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper presents a detailed examination of the effect of piece rates and other forms of incentive compensation on individual employee earnings. The study examines the impact of incentives on the earnings of over 100,000 employees in 500 firms within the footwear and men's and boys' clothing industries. Two distinct incentive effects are observed. First, incentive workers' earnings are more disperse than identical time workers' earnings within both firms and occupations. This greater variance is maintained with the addition of controls for heterogeneity of individual characteristics between the two sectors. Second, incentive workers receive an earnings premium, in part to compensate for the greater variation in their income, and partially as a result of an incentive- effort effect. The incentive earnings premium averages 14%, controlling for individual characteristics, occupational classification, and individual firms. Subsequent decomposition of the incentive-earnings premium reveals that the compensating differential for variation in earnings accounts for a minority of the incentive earnings premium. This supports the view that increased effort by incentive employees leads to relatively greater earnings.

As an aid to interpreting the results of height-by-age studies this paper investigates the relationship between average height and per capita income. The relationships among income, nutrition, medical care, and height at the individual level suggest that average height is nonlinearly related to per capita income and that the distribution of income is an important determinant of average height. Empirical analysis rests on 56 height studies and per capita income estimates for 20 developed or developing countries.

This paper examines the effect of liquidity constraints on consumption expenditures using a single-time cross-section data set. A reduced-form equation for consumption is estimated on high-saving households by the Tobit procedure to account for the selectivity bias. Since high-saving households are not likely to be liquidity constrained, the estimated equation is an appropriate description of how desired consumption dictated by the life cycle-permanent income hypothesis is related to the variables available in the cross-section data. When the reduced-form equation is used to predict desired consumption, the gap between desired consumption and measured consumption is most evident for young households.

This paper describes corporate investment and financing decisions when managers have inside information about the value of the firm's existing investment and growth opportunities, but cannot convey that information to investors. Capital markets are otherwise perfect and efficient. In these circumstances, the firm may forego a valuable investment opportunity rather than issue stock to finance it. The decision to issue cannot fully convey the managers' special information. If stock is issued, stock price falls. Liquid assets or financial slack are valuable if they reduce the probability or extent of stock issues. The paper also suggests explanations for some aspects of dividend policy and choice of capital structure.

885,An Intertemporal Model of Saving and Investment,"['Andrew B. Abel', 'Olivier J. Blanchard']",1982-04-01,1982-04-01,,"['Other', 'Macroeconomics']",['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

The standard model of optimal growth, interpreted as a model of a market economy with infinitely long-lived agents, does not allow separation of the savings decisions of agents from the investment decisions of firms. Investment is essentially passive: the ""one good"" assumption leads to a perfectly elastic investment supply; the absence of installation costs for investment leads to a perfectly elastic investment demand. On the other hand, the standard model of temporary equilibrium used in macroeconomics characterizes both the savings-consumption decision and the investment decision, or, equivalently, derives a well-behaved aggregate demand which, in equilibrium, must be equal to aggregate supply. Often, however, we want to study the movement of the temporary equilibrium over time in response to a particular shock or policy. The discrepancy between the treatment of investment in the two models makes imbedding the temporary equilibrium model in the growth model difficult. This paper characterizes the dynamic behavior of the optimal growth model with adjustment costs. It shows the similarity between the temporary equilibrium of the corresponding market economy and the short-run equilibrium of standard macroeconomic models: consumption depends on wealth, investment on Tobin's q. Equilibrium is maintained by the endogenous adjustment of the term structure of interest rates. It then shows how the equivalence can be used to study the dynamic effects of policies; it considers various fiscal policies and exploits their equivalence to technological shifts in the optimal growth problem.

887,Post-War Capital Accumulation and the Threat of Nuclear War,['Joel Slemrod'],1982-05-01,1982-05-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

The hypothesis of this paper is that the performance and, in particular, the rate of capital accumulation of the post-war U.S. economy has been influenced by the changes in the public perception of the threat of a catastrophic nuclear war. An increased threat shortens the expected horizon of individuals and firms, and thus reduces the willingness to postpone present consumption in favor of investment. The hypothesis is tested by expanding a standard savings function estimation technique to include a measure of the perceived threat of nuclear war. Four alternative measures of the perceived threat are considered, all of which are based on the setting of the clock published monthly in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which reflects the editors' judgment about the likelihood of a nuclear conflict. The tests all support a large and statistically significant impact of the threat of nuclear war on the rate of private saving. These tests are not viewed as conclusive evidence in favor of the economic impact of the perceived threat of nuclear war. Nevertheless, this research suggests that economists may have been overlooking an important source of variation in the post-war, post-nuclear U.S. economy. Conceivably, it could affect not only the private savings rate but also such things as the level of investment in human capital, the level of asset prices, the term structure of interest rates, and the rate of inflation.

889,Inflationary Finance under Discrepion and Rules,['Robert J. Barro'],1982-05-01,1982-05-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Inflationary finance involves first, the tax on cash balances from expected inflation, and second, a capital levy from unexpected inflation. From the standpoint of minimizing distortions, these capital levies are attractive, ex post, to the policymaker. In a full equilibrium two conditions hold: 1) the monetary authority optimizes subject to people's expectations mechanisms, and 2) people form expectations rationally, given their knowledge of the policymaker's objectives. The outcomes under discretionary policy are contrasted with those generated under rules. In a purely discretionary regime the monetary authority can make no meaningful commitments about the future behavior of money and prices. Under an enforced rule, it becomes possible to make some guarantees. Hence, the links between monetary actions and inflationary expectations can be internalized. There is a distinction between fully-contingent rules and rules of simple form. A simple rule allows the internalization of some connections between policy act ion and inflationary expectations, but discretion permits some desirable flexibility of monetary growth.

Understanding inventory movements is central to an understanding of business cycles. This paper presents an empirical study of the behavior of inventories in the automobile industry. It finds that inventory behavior is well explained by the assumption of intertemporal optimization with rational expectations. The underlying cost structure appears to have substantial costs of changing production as well as substantial costs of being away from target inventory, the latter being a function of current sales. Given this cost structure, whether inventory behavior is stabilizing or destabilizing depends on the characteristics of the demand process. In the automobile industry, inventory behavior is destabilizing: the variance of production is larger than the variance of sales.

This paper examines the welfare consequences of changing the current U.S. income tax system to a progressive consumption tax. We compute a sequence of single period equilibria in which savings decisions depend on the expected future return to capital. In the presence of existing income taxes, the U.S. economy is assumed to lie on a balanced growth path. With the change to a consumption tax, individuals save more and initially consume less. As the capital stock grows, consumption eventually overtakes that of the original path, and the economy approaches the new balanced growth path with higher consumption and a greater capital stock. Both the transition and the balanced growth paths enter our welfare evaluations. We find that the discounted present value of the stream of net gains is approximately $650 billion in 1973 dollars, just over one percent of the discounted present value of national income. Larger gains occur if further reform of capital income taxation accompanies the change. We examine the sensitivity of the results, both to the design of the consumption tax and to the values of elasticity and other parameters. The paper also contains estimates of the time required to adjust from one growth path to the other.

This paper conducts a theoretical comparison of the potential effectiveness, in terms of money stock controllability, of interest rate and reserve instruments. Whereas previous studies have been basically static, the present analysis is carried out in the context of a dynamic macroeconomic model with rational expectations. Particular attention is paid to the distinction between contemporaneous and lagged reserve accounting (CRA and LRA). The criterion employed is the expectation of squared deviations of the (log of the) money stock from target values that are reset each period. Analysis in the basic model suggests the following substantive conclusions. (1) With a reserve instrument, monetary control will be more effective under CRA than LRA. (2) With a reserve instrument and LRA, control will be poorer than with an interest rate instrument. (3) For a wide range of parameter values, control will be better with a reserve instrument and CRA than with an interest rate instrument.

A Keynesian idea of considerable historical importance is that, in the presence of a liquidity trap, a competitive economy may lack--despite price flexibility--automatic market mechanisms that tend to eliminate excess supplies of labor. The standard classical counterargument, which relies upon the Pigou effect, has typically been conducted in a comparative-static framework. But, as James Tobin has recently emphasized, the more relevant issue concerns the dynamic response (in ""real time"") of an economy that has been shocked away from full employment. The present paper develops a dynamic analysis, in a rather standard model, under the assumption that expectations are formed rationally. The analysis permits examination of Tobin's suggestion that, because of expectational effects, such an economy could be unstable. Also considered is Martin J. Bailey's conjecture that, in the absence of a stock Pigou effect, Keynesian problems could be eliminated by expectational influences on disposable income.

Although a great deal of empirical research on productivity measuremant has taken place in the last decade, one issue remaining particudarly controversial and deaisive is the manner by which one adjusts the productivity residual for variations in capital and capacity utilization. In this paper we use the Marshallian framework of a short run production or cost function with certain inputs quasi-fixed to provide a theoretical basis for accounting for variations in utilization. The theoretical model implies that the value of services from stocks of quasi-fixed inputs should be altered rather than their quantity. This represents a departure from most previous procedures that have adjusted the quantity of capital services for variations in utilization. In the empirical illustration, we employ Tobin's q to measure the shadow value of capital, and find that for the U.S. manufacturing sector, we can attribute about 50% of the traditionally measured decline in productivity growth during 1973-77 to a decline in capacity utilization. Hence, adjusted for utilization, the 1973-77 productivity slowdown in U.S. manufacturing is considerably less than that measured using traditional productivity accounting techniques.

The paper examines the annuity designs implicit in these innovations, and shows them to be variants of the standard variable annuity.

This paper reconsiders the effects of taxation on risky assets, recognizing the importance of variations in asset prices. We show that earlier analyses which assumed that depreciation rates are constant and that the future price of capital goods is known with certainty are very misleading, as guides to the effects of corporate taxes. We then examine the concept of economic depreciation in a risky environment, and show that depreciation allowances, if set ex-ante, should be adjusted to take account of future asset price risk. Some empirical calculations suggest that these adjustments are large, and have important implications for the burdens of, and non-neutralities in, the corporate income tax.

Modern neoclassical theories of the business cycle posit that aggregate fluctuations in consumption and employment are the consequence of dynamic optimizing behavior by economic agents who face no quantity constraint. In this paper, we estimate an explicit model :f this type. In particular, we assume that the observed fluctuations correspond to the decisions of an optimizing representative individual. This individual has a stable utility function which is additively separable over time but not necessarily additively separable in consumption and leisure. We estimate three first order conditions which represent three margins on which the individual is optimizing. He can trade off present consumption for future consumption, present leisure for future leisure and present consumption for present leisure. Our results show that the aggregate U.S. data are extremely reluctant to be characterized by a model of this type. Not only are the overidentifying restrictions statistically rejected but, in addition, the estimated utility function is often not concave. Even when it is concave the estimates imply that either consumption or leisure is an inferior good.

Conditions are provided to validate the casual argument that majority voting in unions and the seniority system together provide an explanation for the lack of union wage adjustment. A modified version of the model allows the job queue to deviate from a strict seniority ranking. In this context I ask, what importance can be attached to the seniority system in determining the wage response to international competition?

If price decisions are taken neither continuously nor in perfect synchronization, the process of adjustment of all prices to a new nominal level will imply temporary movements in relative prices. It might then well be that, to avoid these movements in relative prices, each price setter will want to move his own price slowly compared to others. The result will be a slow movement of all prices to their new nominal level, and substantial inertia of the price level. This paper formalizes this intuitive argument and reaches four main conclusions: (1) Even small departures from perfect synchronization can generate substantial price level inertia. (2) If price decisions are desynchronized, even anticipated movements in money will usually have an effect on economic activity. It is however possible to find paths of money deceleration which reduce inflation at no cost in output. (3) Price desynchronization has implications for relative price movements as well as for the price level. Goods early in the chain of production have more price and profit variability than goods further down the chain. (4) Price inertia, if it is due to price desynchronization, may be difficult to remove. It may well be that, given the timing decisions of others, no agent has an incentive to change his own timing decision: the time structure of price desynchronization may be stable.

There has been very little study of the consequences of pension wealth for the composition of household portfolios. Using individual data for 10,118 Canadian households we estimate the portfolio effect of pension wealth. Because most households do not own all of the assets which we are able to distinguish, we model asset demands as a mixed discrete-continuous portfolio choice problem. We find that whereas there is an identifiable effect of pension wealth on total private savings, the effect on portfolio choice is less significant. Moreover, within the area of portfolio composition the main effect is in terms of the particular number and combination of assets held rather than the amount of any given asset as a proportion of total wealth.

In this paper we estimate and compare several alternative exchange rate models that have received wide attention, but little comparison, during the 1970s. In order to compare purchasing power parity (PPP), nominal interest rate parity, real interest rate parity, and portfolio balance models, we first strip each down to its essential core and undertake comparable single-equation tests of both 'hard' and 'easy' (more and less constrained) versions of each model. We then embed each of the 'hard' versions in a new macroeconomic model of Canada, and assess their implications for the impacts of monetary and fiscal shocks. Using annual Canadian data from the 1950s and 1970s, all of the models have single-equation errors of about 3%, except for the 'hard' versions of PPP and real interest parity, which are heavily rejected by the data. In a macroeconomic context, the models have modestly different implications for the effects of fiscal shocks, and diverge more widely under monetary shocks.

905,Are Bond-Financed Deficits Inflationary? A Ricardian Analysis,['Bennett T. McCallum'],1982-06-01,1982-06-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

This paper considers the possible theoretical validity of the following ""monetarist hypothesis"": that a constant, positive government budget deficit can be maintained permanently and without inflation if it is financed by the issue of bonds rather than money. The question is studied in a discrete-time, perfect-foresight version of the competitive equilibrium model of Sidrauski (1967), modified by the inclusion of government bonds as a third asset. It is shown that the monetarist hypothesis is invalid if the deficit is defined exclusive of interest payments, but is valid under the conventional definition. It is also shown that the stock of bonds can grow indefinitely at a rate in excess of the rate of output growth, provided that the difference is less than the rate of time preference. In addition to the main analysis, the paper includes comments on alternative deficit concepts, a brief consideration of data pertaining to the announced budget plans of the Reagan administration, and a new look at a much- studied issue: whether the operation of a Friedman-type constant money growth rule (with non-activist fiscal rules) would be dynamically feasible.

906,Inflation Uncertainty and Interest Rates: Theory and Empirical Tests,"['Richard Hartman', 'John H. Makin']",1982-06-01,1982-06-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper develops two models, one involving risk neutrality and the other risk aversion, which suggest that inflation uncertainty affects interest rates. Both models give rise to essentially the same interest rate equation for estimation. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that inflation uncertainty affects interest rates. Interpreted in terms of the risk neutral model, the empirical results suggest that inflation uncertainty has a negative impact on nominal interest rates and a positive impact on the expected real rate. If the results are interpreted in terms of the risk averse model, inflation uncertainty has a negative impact on nominal interest rates. The expected real rate is not of direct interest in a risk averse world. The results raise real questions about the use of the Fisherian definition of the real interest rate in situations when there is uncertainty about inflation rates. It is argued that even with risk neutrality the Fisherian definition of the real rate is not the appropriate concept upon which to base economic decisions if inflation uncertainty is present. The appropriate concept is an expected real rate which involves an adjustment for uncertainty. Moreover, if the world is risk averse, the expected real rate is not a relevant concept for economic decisions.

This paper integrates exchange-rate policy into a model of exchange- rate behavior, and examines the data econometrically to infer hypotheses about policy behavior in the 1970s. The model shows how unanticipated movements in money, the current account, and relative price levels will cause first a jump in the exchange rate, and then a movement along a ""saddle path"" to the new long run equilibrium. Here the role of ""news"" in moving the exchange rate is clear. The model is used to analyze the options available to the central bank that wants to reduce the jump in the exchange rate following a real or monetary disturbance. The distinction is made between monetary policy and sterilized intervention, and a regime in which the domestic interest rate is used as the policy variable is also studied. Systems of vector autoregressions (VARs) for each of four countries -- the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan -- are estimated, and the correlations among their residuals are studied. These represent the ""innovations,"" or ""news"" in the time series. A clear pattern emerges in these correlations, in which policy in the U.S. and to a lesser extent Japan, drives exchange rates, and policy in Germany and the U.K. reacts. It appears that U.S. monetary policy is essentially determined by domestic considerations, with the exchange rate moving as a consequence. In Japan, interest rates are varied in response to movement in the current-account and relative price levels, and the effects on the exchange rate are partially neutralized by sterilized intervention. Germany and the U.K. react to movements in their exchange rates by moving interest rates, and sterilized intervention.

Although the analysis is made within the framework of a public pension plan, it applies equally well to organized private pension plans where participation is virtually mandatory and where individually designed programs are not practical. An additional feature of the plans examined is that they provide for life annuities during both the accumulation and retirement phases of the life cycle.

911,A Comparison of Methodologies in Empirical General Equilibrium Models of Taxation,"['Don Fullerton', 'Yolanda K. Henderson', 'John B. Shoven']",1982-06-01,1982-06-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

Computational general equilibrium models have proven useful in the area of long run analysis of alternative tax policies. A sizable number of studies have been completed which examine policies such as a value-added tax, corporate and personal income tax integration, a consumption or expenditure tax, housing subsidies, and inflation indexation.. This paper reviews the methodologies used in these models. We focus on eight specific models and review in turn: levels of disaggregation, specification of the foreign sector, financial modeling, the measurement of effective tax rates, heterogeneity and imperfect mobility, factor supply, treatment of the government budget, and technical issues associated with implementation. The paper includes some new experiments in connection with simulations of integration of the personal and corporate income tax systems in the United States. We compare the resulting welfare gains in models with different levels of disaggregation, and we discuss alternative justifications for specific disaggregations. We also examine the sensitivity of results to alternative specifications of households' endowments of labor and leisure. Our survey underscores the importance of the assumed elasticities of labor supply with respect to the net of tax wage, and of saving with respect to the net of tax rate of return. Unfortunately, these are also parameters for which there is not a consensus in the economics profession. The survey finds that there are several aspects of modeling that are especially ripe for further progress: the roles of government and business financial decisions, the dynamics of a life-cycle approach, and the measurement of incentive tax and transfer rates.

913,Panel Data,['Gary Chamberlain'],1982-06-01,1982-06-01,,"['Econometrics', 'Labor Economics']",['Labor Studies'],,,"

We consider linear predictor definitions of noncausality or strict exogeneity and show that it is restrictive to assert that there exists a time-invariant latent variable c such that x is strictly exogenous conditional on c. A restriction of this sort is necessary to justify standard techniques for controlling for unobserved individual effects. There is a parallel analysis for multivariate probit models, but now the distributional assumption for the individual effects is restrictive. This restriction can be avoided by using a conditional likelihood analysis in a logit model. Some of these ideas are illustrated by estimating union wage effects for a sample of Young Men in the National Longitudinal Survey. The results indicate that the lags and leads could have been generated just by an unobserved individual effect, which gives some support for analysis of covariance-type estimates. These estimates indicate a substantial omitted variable bias. We also present estimates of a model of female labor force participation, focusing on the relationship between participation and fertility. Unlike the wage example, there is evidence against conditional strict exogeneity; if we ignore this evidence, the probit and logit approaches give conflicting results.

914,The Economic Status of the Elderly,"['Michael D. Hurd', 'John B. Shoven']",1982-06-01,1982-06-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

In the first part of the paper using official data sources, we estimate the real income of the elderly and of the rest of the population during the 1570s. We find that income per household of the elderly has increased more rapidly than income per household of the rest of the population, even though the elderly's fraction of income from work decreased greatly. In the rest of the paper we use the 1969 and 1975 Retirement History Surveys to estimate income, wealth and inflation vulnerability of households whose heads were ages 58 through 63 in 1969. The income data verified the results from the official data. The 1969 wealth data show that a representative person on the eve of retirement has small holdings of financial assets: most of the assets are in housing, Social Security and Medicare. Between 1969 and 1975 real wealth increased slightly on average. There was some tendency for the distribution to tighten. We found that contrary to popular opinion, on average the elderly are not especially vulnerable to a sudden increase in either prices or the rate of inflation. Most of their assets are inflation protected. The wealthy are most vulnerable to inflation.

This paper presents the results of a study of productivity growth and R&D in the 1970s using data on narrowly defined 'business units within a firm. Estimates are developed under different assumptions about technology ,industry effects, and changes in the return to R&D over time. The R&D data are broken down into process and product expenditures, and some information is available on past success in developing proprietary technology, andontheincidenceofma3or changes in technology in the recent past. The results suggest a significant relationship between R&D and the growth of productivity; in versions using total factor productivity as the dependent variable, the estimated rate of return to R&D investment is about 20 percent. We find some evidence that R&D has its biggest effect on productivity in those markets where major changes in technology have occurred in the recent past. Previous success in developing proprietary process technology affects total factor productivity directly, but appears to have little effect on estimated returns to R&D. The notion that the productivity of R&D declined in the l970sfinds Little support in this data. Irrespective of model specification, trends in the R&D coefficient are substantively arid statistically insignificant. Our calculations suggest that reduced investment in R&D may have accounted for at least 10 percent of the decline in total factor productivity growth in the l970s.

The paper begins with the development of models explaining the mortgage refinancing and assumption decisions of households Having identified the economic variables influencing these decisions, we then simulate the models for different values to determine under what conditions households will refinance or assume. Finally, we draw some implications of these results for: (1) the impact of a decline in mortgage rates on the asset portfolio yields of mortgage lending institutions and (2) the effect of the observed rise in interest rate volatility, including the optimal terminations response of mortgage borrowers, on the terms of the mortgage contract and the returns to mortgage lenders on recently issued mortgage loans.

This paper reports preliminary estimates of an econometric simulation model capable of a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of unemployment insurance on measured and actual employment, unemployment and non-participation. The data are longitudinal comprising information on 75,000 households sampled in the Current Population Surveys of March and April 1978. The simulation model is constructed from multi- nomial logit equations characterizing individuals' labor force transitions. These equations provide estimates of the effects of UI on job loss, labor force exit, and entry into the labor force, as well as the effect of UI on unemployment duration and temporary layoffs. The results are rather inconclusive, but suggest the importance of further research on I21 and transitions in and out of the labor force.

The international price linkage in a single commodity model can be explained trivially by the law of one price or the quantity theory of money. In this paper, we formulate a simple sectoral, general equilibrium model with money. The transmission of price pressures from the world market to nontradable sectors of a domestic economy depends on industry structure, and the size of the direct price substitution effect and the indirect money and income effect through the balance of payments. The structural model is then empirically implemented for Japan, 1956-77. Various dynamic simulations conducted show both the overall magnitude of imported inflation and the relative importance of three major channels of transmission (price, money and income) in Japanese inflation during the period covered. These results imply that closing of one channel of transmission such as the monetary channel by a completely sterilizing monetary policy does not insulate the domestic economy from foreign price disturbances.

This paper presents a theoretical model to describe the effects of default risk on international lending to LDC sovereign borrowers. The threat of defaults in international lending is shown to give rise to many characteristics of the syndicated loan market: (1) quantity rationing of loans; (2) LDC policies designed to enhance creditworthiness; (3) prevalence of short maturities on international loans; and (4) a prevalence of bank lending relative to bond-market lending

This paper assesses the quantitative effects of a shift to monetary restraint in the United States on the DM-$ exchange rate and the German economy. The results indicate that such effects are large. If Germany keeps its money growth unchanged, it will tend to experience a sharp and sustained depreciation of the deutsche mark and a significant increase in inflation and in unemployment. If it adopts an equivalent policy of monetary restraint, it will tend to benefit from a marked decline in inflation, but the cost in terms of lost output is extremely large.

927,Economic Implications of ERISA,"['Jeremy I. Bulow', 'Myron S. Scholes', 'Peter Menell']",1982-07-01,1982-07-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

If the intent of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, was to assure that beneficiaries of insolvent pension plans receive adequate pension benefits, sharp increases in nominal rates of interest have blunted that purpose. Without an increase in these rates, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC, the insurance agency established to guarantee benefits, faced large liabilities on the terminations of pension plans. We examine the economics of pension funds and the funding of pension funds before and after the enactment of ERISA. The Act changed the economics of pension funds. The PBGC, the employer, and the employees have interests in the assets of the pension plan. The PBGC can tax corporations to pay off liabilities and to fund guaranteed benefits; employers can terminate pension plans or overfund them; employees can ask for more benefits or claim the assets in the fund. Although the PBGC insures benefits, the insurance agent forbears, not acting quickly to protect its own interests. To prevent potential huge increases in its liabilities, the PBGC could require that employers hedge the guaranteed benefits, and fund their increases in promised benefits. Given its policies, these requirements could protect the PBGC.

Owner-occupied housing is said to be favored in the tax code because mortgage interest and property taxes can be deducted in the computation of one's income tax base in spite of the fact that the returns from owner- occupied housing = not taxed. The special tax treatment reduces the user cost of capital for owner-occupied homing. The issue treated in this paper is the measurement of the tax rate to be employed in the user cost calculations. It is argued that different tax rates am appropriate for the tenure choice and quantity-demanded decisions, and that these values depend on the detailed tax position of the household and the method of finance. Average 1977 tax rates for households in different income ranges are calculated using the NBER TAXSIM microeconomic data file on individual tax returns

930,Consumption During Retirement: The Missing Link in the Life Cycle,['Daniel S. Hamermesh'],1982-07-01,1982-07-01,,"['Other', 'Public Economics']",['Labor Studies'],,,"

This study presents the first evidence on the relation of consumption to lifetime wealth, based on data from the 1973 and 1975 Retirement History Survey that have been linked to Social Security earnings records. Nearly 500 white, married, fully retired couples ages 62-69 form the basis of the analysis. On average their consumption early in retirement exceeds by 14 percent the income that their financial, pension and Social Security wealth can generate. This implies that their saving, both private and through Social Security, is insufficient to sustain consumption throughout the rest of their lives. Additional evidence based on changes in spending between 1973 and 1975 shows that these households respond by reducing their real consumption at a rate sufficient to generate positive changes in net financial worth within a few years after retirement. These two pieces of evidence can be rationalized by a rate of time preference much higher than the interest rate, coupled with either a bequest motive or uncertainty about the length of life. They also imply that, even when combined with private pensions and savings, Social Security in the United States today does not enable most recipients to maintain their living standard at the levels they enjoyed before they retired.

This paper proposes a framework which integrates convex costs of adjustment and expectations formation in the determination of investment decisions in R&D at the firm level. The model is based on cost minimization subject to the firm's expectations of the stream of output and the price of R&D, and results in equations for actual and multiple-span planned investment in R&D and for the realization error as functions of these expectations. The model accommodates alternative mechanisms of expectations formation and provides a methodology for testing these hypotheses empirically. We derive estimable equations and testable parameter restrictions for the rational, adaptive and static expectations hypotheses. The empirical results using pooled firm data strongly reject the rational and static expectations hypotheses and generally support adaptive expectations.

932,The Optimal Use of Fines and Imprisonment,"['A. Mitchell Polinsky', 'Steven Shavell']",1982-07-01,1982-07-01,,,['Law and Economics'],,,"

This paper examines the use of fines and imprisonment to deter individuals from engaging in harmful activities. These sanctions are analyzed separately as well as together, first for identical risk-neutral individuals and then for two groups of risk-neutral individuals who differ by wealth. When fines are used alone and individuals are identical, the optimal fine and probability of apprehension are such that there is some ""underdeterrence."" If individuals differ by wealth, then the optimal fine for the high wealth group exceeds the fine for the low wealth group. When imprisonment is used alone and individuals are identical, the optimal imprisonment term and probability may be such that there is either underdeterrence or overdeterrence. If individuals differ by wealth, the optimal imprisonment term for the high wealth group may be longer or shorter than the term for the low wealth group. When fines and imprisonment are used together, it is desirable to use the fine to its maximum feasible extent before possibly supplementing it with an imprisonment term. The effects of risk aversion on these results are also discussed.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of estimating distributed lags in short panels. Estimates of the parameter of distributed lag relationships based on single time-series of observations have been usually rather imprecise. The promise of panel data is in the N repetitions of the time-series that it contains which should allow one to estimate the identified lag parameters with greater precision. On the other hand, panels tend to track their observations only over a relatively short time interval. Thus, some assumptions will have to be made on the contribution of the unobserved presample x's to the current values of y before any lag parameters can be identified from such data. In this paper we suggest two such assumptions; both of which are, at least in part, testable, and outline appropriate estimation techniques. The first places reasonable restrictions on the relationship between the presample and in sample x's while the second imposes conventional functional form constraints on the lag coefficients. The paper concludes with an example which investigates empirically how to construct a ""capital stock"" for profit or rate of return regressions.

The main objective of this paper is to understand and to evaluate recently expressed popular anxiety about large American fiscal deficits. The paper begins with a discussion of problems involved in measuring the fiscal deficit. A general conclusion is that all interesting measures of the federal fiscal deficit have increased substantially over the past eight presidential terms and are likely to increase further in the near future. The paper goes on to analyze possible connections between fiscal deficits and inflation, economic growth, and fluctuations in the level and composition of economic activity. Important conclusions are that monetary policy, inflation, and aggregate economic activity are all largely independent of the fiscal deficit, but that the fiscal deficit can have major effects on the division of output between consumption and investment. Key elements in the analysis are the effects of taxation on consumption and investment demands and the relations between real and financial developments.

This paper considers a world in which pension funds may default, the cost of the associated risk of default is not borne fully by the sponsoring corporation, and there are differential tax effects. The focus is on ways in which the wealth of the shareholders of a corporation sponsoring a pension plan might be increased if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) follow simple and naive policies. Under the conditions examined, the optimal policy for pension plan funding and asset allocation is shown to be extremal in a certain sense. This suggests that the IRS and the PBGC may wish to use more complex regulatory procedures than those considered in the paper.

This paper compares alternative liability rules for allocating losses from defective products when consumers under- estimate these losses and producers may have some market power. If producers do not have any market power, the rule of strict liability .leads to both the first-best accident probability and industry output. If producers do have some market power, strict liability still leads to the first-best accident probability, but there will now be too little output of the industry. It is shown that if market power is sufficiently large, a negligence rule is preferable. Under this rule, firms can still be induced to choose the first-best accident probability, but now the remaining damages are borne by consumers. Since consumers underestimate these damages, they buy more than under strict liability. However, there is a limit to how much the negligence rule can encourage extra consumption. It is shown that if market power is sufficiently large, the rule of no liability may then be preferred to the negligence rule. Without any liability imposed, producers will not choose the first-best accident probability. However, this may be more than compensated for by the increased output of the industry.

This paper explores how unfunded pension obligations affect the market values of firms. Finns appear to choose the interest rate they use in discounting future benefit obligations so as to balance the tax advantages of a low rate against the more healthy looking annual reports a high rate allows. Investors seem to penetrate this ruse and value firms as if obligations were figured at a standard rate. The rate thus used seems to be much lower than current long term interest rates. Pension liabilities are therefore overemphasized by the market. There is also some evidence that pension assets are undervalued. This suggests that growth of the private pension system might increase savings by investors and firms.

Potential biases associated with conventional analyses, which either ignore the existence of minimum hours constraints or assume they are pervasive, are discussed in the context of structural life cycle retirement models. A more realistic but still imperfect specification, which can be estimated given available data, assumes minimum hours constraints on the main job and variable hours elsewhere.

For many years a system of leading, coincident, and lagging economic indicators, first developed in the 1930s by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), has been widely used in the United States to appraise the state of the business cycle. Since 1961 the current monthly figures for these indicators have been published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in Business Conditions Digest. Similar systems have been developed by government or private agencies in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and more recently in many other countries. A few years ago the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) set up a working party to develop this type of analysis and most of the member countries participated. The Center for International Business Cycle Research at Rutgers University has given guidance in this field to some fifteen countries during the past three years, in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. Our purpose in this paper is to explain briefly the theory and rationale underlying this approach to economic forecasting, describe the more important statistical procedures used, and review the evidence on how the indicators have performed in practice. The tests of performance concentrate on data not used in the selection of the indicators, in the United States and nine other countries. We conclude with some suggestions for future research and development, including the application of the approach to the analysis of inflation.

Earlier claims that pensions serve as severance pay are corroborated by a new data set drawn from the 1980 Banker's Trust corporate pension plan study. A model is developed that shows how pension values which vary with the age of retirement make both workers and firms better off by moving the equilibrium in the direction of a perfect-information, first-best optimum. This requires that pension values decline with the age of retirement beyond a certain point. Evidence from the 1975 and 1980 data sets supports this claim. To the extent that any significant change has occurred between 1975 and 1980, most important is that the ratio of early retirement pension value to normal retirement pension value has increased.

This paper investigates the nature and the presence of bubbles in financial markets. Are bubbles consistent with rationality? If they are, do they, like Ponzi games, require the presence of new players forever? Do they imply impossible events in finite time, such as negative prices? Do they need to go on forever to be rational? Can they have real effects? These are some of the questions asked in the first three sections. The general conclusion is that bubbles, in many markets, are consistent with rationality, that phenomena such as runaway asset prices and market crashes are consistent with rational bubbles. In the last two sections, we consider whether the presence of bubbles in a particular market can be detected statistically. The task is much easier if there are data on both prices and returns. In this case, as shown by Shiller and Singleton, the hypothesis of no bubble implies restrictions on their joint distribution and can be tested. In markets in which returns are difficult to observe, possibly because of a nonpecuniary component, such as gold, the task is more difficult. We consider the use of both ""runs tests"" and ""tail tests"" and conclude that they give circumstantial evidence at best.

The evidence and analysis in this paper support the earlier findings of Feldstein and Horioka (1980) that sustained increases in domestic savings rates induce approximately equal increases in domestic rates of investment. New estimates for the post-OPEC period 1974-79 imply that each extra dollar of domestic saving increases domestic investment by approximately 85 cents in a sample of 17 OECD countries. An explicit analysis of the problems of identification and simultaneous equations bias suggests that the regression estimates are more relevant as a guide to the long-run response of international capital flows than to their short-run behavior. Coefficient estimates based on annual variations in savings and investment are subject to potentially severe simultaneous equations bias that is not present when annual observations are averaged over a decade or more and the regression is estimated with a cross-country sample of these averages. A portfolio model of international capital allocation that is presented in the paper indicates that the short-run change in the rate of net foreign investment in response to a sustained increase in domestic saving is likely to be substantially greater than the ultimate steady state response.

After reconciling these false contrasts, we show how some of the approaches still give different predictions about the effects of monetary and fiscal policy using differing assumptions about the international mobility of goods and financial assets.

950,General Equilibrium and Business Cycles,['Fischer Black'],1982-08-01,1982-08-01,,['International Economics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

The general equilibrium models in this paper, with complete markets, can give the major features of business cycles. The models include real investment, but information is costless and is available to everyone at the same time. Fluctuations in the match between resources and wants across many sectors create major fluctuations in output and unemployment, because moving resources from one sector to another is costly. Fluctuations in the demand for the services of durable goods causes much larger fluctuations in the output of durables, and causes unemployment that takes the form of temporary layoffs. Since specialized factors cooperate in producing goods and services, it makes sense to lay people off in groups rather than lowering wages and waiting for them to quit. Similarly, a vacancy is created when a specialized factor is missing from such a group. Technology comes with varying levels of risk and expected return associated with the degree of specialization. More specialization means more severe fluctuations and a higher average level of unemployment, along with a higher average level of output and growth. Monetary policy, interest rates, and fiscal policy have no special roles to play in the model.

This paper deals with the allocational effects and implications for efficiency of a tax system in which the rate of tax on capital income differs depending on the recipient of the income and on the type of capital producing the income. It suggests that, in their attempts to measure the distortionary effect of the U.S. capital income tax system, economists may have been looking in the wrong places. In the presence of uncertainty, the intersectoral distortion may be much less than had previously been imagined. However, the tax system distorts at two other margins which have not received much attention. It distorts the inter-household allocation of the housing stock, since the after-tax rate of interest is one component of the opportunity cost of owner-occupied housing. It also distorts the inter-household allocation of risk-bearing. Calculations using a simple commutable general equilibrium model suggest that the excess burden from these latter two distortions are significant components of the total distortionary impact of the tax system.

952,Long Run Trends in Patenting,['John J. Beggs'],1982-08-01,1982-08-01,,,"['Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship']",,,"

This paper examines the patenting in the U.S. from its origins in 1790 up to 1980. The prime intent was to identify relationships between patenting and the rate of industrial development, and to further look for any regular cyclical patterns in the time series of patents themselves. To this end, detailed records were gathered on annual patenting, along with key descriptive data on industry structure for a sample of twenty industries for the period 1850 through 1940. In general the correlations between changes in the rate of patenting and changes in industry characteristics are small. A tentative conclusion is that the rate of change in patenting may move inversely with the rate of change in value added. This leads the author to speculate on a ""defensive R&D hypothesis"" which may reflect strongly the choice of sample industries. The industries in the study were in existence in 1850 and managed to ward off challenges from other new industries so as to still be in existence in 1940. At each new challenge from a new product or a foreign competitor these industries have attempted to protect their existing capital stock by upgrading the production process and final product. While these changes do not normally represent major technological advances they are of a ""tinkering"" variety which are likely to produce large numbers of patents. A spectral analysis of the 190 year time series of patents issued suggests that the rate of change of this variable might be characterized as a moving average process with lags at five and eight years. An interpretation of this result is offered, along with caution against over interpretation.

956,Valuing Pensions (Annuities) with Different Types of Inflation Protection in Total Compensation Comparisons,['James E. Pesando'],1982-08-01,1982-08-01,,,['Public Economics'],,,"

Pensions provided in the public sector are often indexed, while pensions in the private sector typically are not. To conduct the total compensation comparisons that ostensibly guide government pay policy, one must value annuities which differ in their degree of inflation protection. This paper conducts this exercise from the viewpoint of modem finance theory, and contrasts the results with those of a representative government, the Government of Canada. The results suggest that governments may typically understate the value of indexed pensions and overstate the value of pensions which receive incomplete inflation protection. A contributing factor is the apparent belief that standardizing actuarial assumptions is sufficient to ensure comparability, in spite of the fact that risk is ignored and that interest rate and inflation assumptions are typically not those of the market.

This paper examines the relationship between U.S. corporations' management of their pension plans and their management of the more familiar aspects of corporate financial structure. The chief conclusion, on the basis of data for 7,828 pension plans sponsored by 1,836 companies and their subsidiaries, is that corporations do not manage the pension plans which they sponsor as if these plans had nothing to do with the corporation. Different responses appear to characterize firms' behavior in different contexts, but the evidence persistently indicates clear relationships between decisions about pension assets and liabilities and decisions about the other assets and liabilities of the firm. At the same time, the pattern of these relation- ships is, more often than not, inconsistent with familiar hypotheses that have emerged thus far in the theoretical literature analyzing pension aspects of corporate finance. Hence the conclusion from the data is also that the connections between pension decisions and corporate financial decisions in the more conventional sense are, at least as yet, not well understood.

This paper investigates the short-run effect of unexpected changes in the weekly money stock on common stock prices. Survey data on money market participants' forecasts of money changes are employed to construct the measure of unanticipated movements in the money stock. The results indicate that an unexpected increase in money depresses stock prices and, consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis, only the unexpected part of the weekly money announcement causes stock price fluctuations. The October 1979 change in Federal Reserve operating procedures appears to have made stock prices somewhat more sensitive to large money surprises.

959,Optimal Currency Diversification for a Class of Risk Averse International Investors,['Jorge Braga de Macedo'],1982-08-01,1982-08-01,,['International Economics'],"['International Trade and Investment', 'International Finance and Macroeconomics']",,,"

In the framework of continuous-time finance theory, this paper derives the optimal consumption and portfolio rules for an international investor with constant expenditure shares [alpha, sub j] and constant relative risk aversion [1-gamma] in a dynamic context. The index of value obtained from the consumption rule is used to obtain real returns on N different currencies in terms of their purchasing power over N goods. The portfolio rule is expressed in terms of the determinants of the purchasing powers, namely exchange rates and prices expressed in the numeraire currency. The optimal portfolio is interpreted as a capital position given by the expenditure shares and hedging zero net-worth portfolios depending on unanticipated inflation and risk aversion. It is shown that the minimum variance portfolio is independent of returns, but depends on expenditure patterns. While the speculative portfolio depends on risk aversion and real return differentials. When the effect of references on real return differentials is made explicit, it is shown that the minimum variance portfolio is affected by risk aversion. In that case, the effect of an increase in [alpha, sub i] on the portfolio proportions [x, sub i] will be positive when relative risk aversion is greater than one, as generally presumed. Actual data from eight major countries is used to compute optimal portfolios based on real return differentials for different weighting schemes, degrees of risk aversion and sample periods when exchange rates and prices are assumed to be Brownian.

Using a continuous-time finance-theoretic framework, this paper presents the optimal portfolio rule of an international investor who consumes N national composite goods and who holds N domestic-currency-denominated assets with known nominal interest rates in an environment where prices of goods, assets and exchange rates follow geometric Brownian motion. It is shown that the currency portfolio rule described in Macedo (1982a) is applicable to the case where there are N assets with a known price and one asset, gold, with a random  rice in terms of the numeraire. Under these assumptions, it is found that the optimal portfolio of an investor consuming goods from all major industrialized countries (according to their weight in total trade) would be dominated in March 1981 by long positions in U.S. dollars (25%), yen  (17%), D. marks (16%), French francs (15%) and pounds sterling (10%). An investor consuming only U.S. goods, by contrast, would hold 96% of his optimal portfolio in U.S. dollars. Because of the covariance of exchange rates and gold, the exclusion of the latter generates substantial reshuffling. The analysis of the evolution of portfolios over time shows that shares changed dramatically at the beginning of the period and did not begin to approach their March 1981 values until the end of 1975. In the case of the yen and the pound there were oscillations throughout the period. With respect to the dollar share in the optimal portfolio of the U.S. and international investor, it is found that, in the period between late 1974 and mid-1976, a period in which the dollar is considered to have been ""strong"", a large decline in its optimal share took place.

A substantial literature exists on the impact of pension schemes, both public and private, on the level of household saving. Yet there is no clear consensus on the impact of pensions on private saving. In this paper we show how beliefs about this displacement effect are modified by prior beliefs both about variables which ntight be relevant in an equation for private savings and about the magnitude of the displacement effect. Using data for 8,279 Canadian households, and estimates of pension wealth (both private and social security) which we construct for each household in the sample, the estimated displacement effects are found to be relatively robust with respect to both types of prior belief.

When the goals of internal and external macroeconomic equilibrium are in conflict, sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market may provide an independent policy instrument through which the central bank can resolve its dilemma in the short run. This paper is concerned with the West German Bundesbank's use of sterilization during the recent years of exchange- rate flexibility. The paper asks whether the Bundesbank pursued sterilization during the years 1995-1981, and whether sterilized foreign exchange intervention exerts a significant influence on the exchange rate in the German case. Estimation of a stylized Bundesbank reaction function suggests an affirmative answer to the first of these questions. To assess the efficacy of sterilized intervention, a structural portfolio balance model of German asset markets and prices is estimated. Dynamic perfect-foresight simulations of the empirical model are used to ascertain whether imperfect substitutability between foreign and domestic bonds is sufficient to allow the Bundesbank to attain independent internal and external goals over the short run of about a month. The model's verdict is that the Bundesbank has little if any power to influence the exchange rate over that time span without altering current or expected future money-market conditions.

967,Tax Policy and Foreign Direct Investment in the United States,['David G. Hartman'],1982-08-01,1982-08-01,,['International Economics'],['Public Economics'],,,"

This paper provides some evidence on one aspect of international investment, the impacts of domestic tax policy on foreign direct investment in the United States. The possible impacts, which are discussed in the first section, are complex. For example, an investment incentive which applies to both domestic and foreign investors would be expected to result in an increased foreign investment in the U.S. On the other hand, a savings incentive, which has no direct impact on foreign investors, would nevertheless tend to increase domestic investors' demand for capital assets, thereby driving down the returns expected by foreign investors and possibly resulting in significant decreases in foreign investment. Because of measurement difficulties, we are only partly successful in obtaining precise estimates of this sort of impact. However, the results we do obtain suggest that foreign investment in the U.S. is strongly affected, in the manner predicted, by changes in domestic tax policy.

Using a multivariate autoregressive framework, we have found a simple causal structure for the variables of interest q, s, r, and i, which is consistent with our data. As expected from the stock market efficiency hypothesis, q, the stock market one period holding rate of return, is exogenous relative to the other three variables (or Granger causes them). As postulated in the traditional accelerator model of investment, the rate of growth of sales, s, can be also treated as exogenous to the rates of growth of R&D and physical. investment, r and i. Moreover, no strong feed- back interaction is detected between the last two (r and i). Within the simple structure of the extended accelerator model, the substantive conclusion is that R&D and physical investment react very similarly to the growth of the sales and to movements in q; the response of R&D is, however, more stable or less irregular than that of physical investment. Expected demand and expected profitability thus both appear to be important determinants for R&D expenditures and physical investment.

This paper presents an intertemporal disequilibrium model with rational expectations, i.e. a model in which agents anticipate the future rationally, but in which prices and wages may not adjust fast enough to maintain continuous market clearing. Therefore, optimizing firms and households base their intertemporal plans on anticipations of both future quantity constraints and future prices. Such a model shows clearly that the effect of a policy depends not only on its current values but its anticipated path, After a presentation of the model and its basic dynamics, we therefore consider the effects of various paths of fiscal policy on the economy.

In Part 1 the dynamics of an open market operation were analyzed for the case of logarithmic utility. Though such a utility function is useful for illustrative purposes, the implication that current prices are independent of current and future monetary injections is unsatisfactory. This implication results from the fact that with logarithmic utility future consumption is independent of the rate of return to savings. In Part 2 the logarithmic utility assumption is replaced by the more general assumption that utility is of the constant elasticity form such that future consumption is an increasing function of the interest rate. Though a closed form solution cannot be derived for this case, it is shown that the basic results of Part 1 still hold: An increase in money causes a sluggish response of the price level and a fall in interest rates.

975,Unemployment with Observable Aggregate Shocks,"['Sanford J. Grossman', 'Oliver D. Hart', 'Eric Maskin']",1982-09-01,1982-09-01,,,['Monetary Economics'],,,"

Consider an economy subject to two kinds of shocks: (a) an observable shock to the relative demand for final goods which causes dispersion in relative prices, and (b) shocks, unobservable by workers, to the technology for transforming intermediate goods into final goods. A worker in a particular intermediate goods industry knows that the unobserved price of his output is determined by (1) the technological shock that determines which final goods industry uses his output intensively and (2) the price of the final good that uses his output intensively. When there is very little relative price dispersion among final goods, then it doesn't matter which final goods industry uses the worker's output. Thus the technological shock is of very little importance in creating uncertainty about the worker's marginal product when there is little dispersion of relative prices. Hence an increase in the dispersion of relative prices amplifies the effect of technological uncertainty on a worker's marginal value product. We consider a model of optimal labor contracts in a situation where the workers have less information than the firm about their marginal value product. A relative price shock of the type described above increases the uncertainty which workers have about their marginal value product. We show that with an optimal asymmetric information employment contract the industries which are adversely affected by the relative price shock will contract more than they would under complete information (i.e., where workers could observe their marginal value product). On the other hand the industry which is favorably affected by the relative price shock will - not expand by more than would be the case under complete information. Hence an observed relative demand shock, which would leave aggregate employment unchanged under complete information, will cause aggregate employment to fall under asymmetric information about the technological shock.

976,Life-Cycle Effects on Consumption and Retirement,['Daniel S. Hamermesh'],1982-09-01,1982-09-01,,"['Labor Economics', 'Public Economics']",['Labor Studies'],,,"

The effects on consumption and retirement of characteristics of the life cycle, especially the length of the horizon, are examined. At any given age people will work more and consume less if they expect to live longer. This and other propositions are tested on several sets of data. The Terman sample of gifted individuals (320 in 1972, 228 in 1977) is used to relate work status to the length of the horizon, as proxied by parents' longevity. The results suggest the expected positive effect on effort, but its magnitude is quite small. The panel from the Retirement History Survey is used, and life-cycle effects on consumption and retirement are estimated jointly for 1973 and 1975. There is a weak small effect of a more distant horizon (proxied by the number of living parents) in increasing work effort and a stronger, but still fairly small effect in reducing consumption; goods and leisure are consumed jointly, suggesting their complementarity in household production; and spending propensities out of Social Security wealth are far below those out of pension wealth. The small effect of changes in the horizon on work effect suggests the rapid secular increase in longevity has produced a disproportionate increase in people's lifetime demand for leisure. The implied small increase in lifetime income and the slight reduction in consumption among persons with longer horizons indicate that increased longevity has not been met with sufficient spending cuts to enable people to maintain real consumption over their longer lifetimes.

It studies both the steady states which result from different rates of monetary expansion and the effects of such non-steady state events as an open market operation. Even though the model features no uncertainty and perfect foresight, open market operations affect aggregate output. In particular, a simultaneous increase in money and governmental holdings of capital temporarily raises aggregate capital and output while it lowers the real rate of interest on capital.

This paper formulates and tests the hypothesis that the categories unemployed and out of the labor force are behaviorally distinct labor force states. Our empirical results indicate that they are. In the empirically relevant range the exit rate from unemployment to employment exceeds the exit rate from out of the labor force to employment. This evidence is shown to be consistent with a simple job search model of productive unemployment with log concave wage offer distributions. We prove that if unemployed workers receive job offers more frequently than workers out of the labor force, and if wage offer distributions are log concave, the exit rate from unemployment to employment exceeds the exit rate from out of the labor force to employment.

This paper examines issues in the current debate over coordination between fiscal and monetary policies. Section I1 uses the traditional targets-instruments approach to assess the potential gains from greater coordination. Since greater coordination is often equated with looser money and tighter fiscal policy, two econometric models of the economy are used to estimate the quantitative importance of the policy mix. Expectational effects that arise from the government budget constraint are also analyzed. Section III shows that our attitudes toward the non- coordination problem may be quite different depending on why policies were not coordinated to begin with, and argues that there are plausible circumstances under which it may be better to have uncoordinated policies. Section IV turns to the design of a coordination system. The game-theoretic aspects of having two independent authorities are stressed, and I offer a general reason to expect that uncoordinated behavior will result in tight money and loose fiscal policy even when both parties would prefer easy money and tight fiscal policy. Finally, Section V considers the old ""rules versus discretion"" debate from the particular perspective of this paper.

A number of macroeconomic models of open economies under flexible exchange rate assume a strong version of perfect capital mobility which implies that currency speculation commands no risk premium. If this assumption is dropped a number of important results no longer obtain. First, the exchange rate and interest rate cannot be in steady state unless both the government deficit and current account equal zero, not simply their sum, as would otherwise be the case. Second, even in steady state the domestic interest rate can deviate from the foreign interest rate by an amount which de ends upon relative domestic asset supplies. Finally, introducing risk aversion on the part of speculators can reduce the response on impact of the exchange rate to changes in domestic asset supplies. In this sense rational speculators, if they are less risk averse than other agents, can destabilize exchange markets.

985,Union Wage Settlements During a Disinflation,['John B. Taylor'],1982-09-01,1982-09-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

This paper examines the role of union wage contracts in the persistence of inflation, and the implication of these contracts for the problem of disinflation in the United States. A quantitative model of overlapping con- tracts explicitly oriented toward the major union sector is developed. The model takes account of expectations of future wage, price, and employment conditions as in more aggregated models that have been used in macroeconomic research. In addition, the distribution of workers according to contract length as well as deferred wage increases and escalator clauses are explicitly used in the model. The main aim of the model is to determine the constraints which these contracts impose on disinflation paths. The model indicates that the maximum speed of disinflation is extremely slow in the early phases -- if a rise in unemployment is to be avoided -- but increases considerably before the new lower rate of inflation is reached. The disinflation path is considerably slower than that observed after hyperinflation periods. However, the existence of a path of inflation reduction raises questions about whether the institution of union wage con- tracts is really the direct cause of costly disinflations, or whether their influence works indirectly by raising credibility problems about a monetary disinflation.

Many provisions of the Social Security Program distort an individual's labor supply incentives. In particular, the payroll tax, the earnings test, the offsetting actuarial adjustment, and the dependence of the size of future benefits on the level of current earnings all affect the net return to extra work. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the size of the net tax rate on labor income in a variety of circumstances, taking into account all these provisions, as well as the personal income tax. We find that the Social Security Program on net in the past has provided a large subsidy to labor supply, which for many people effectively offset the personal income tax. This subsidy rate, however, has been declining steadily over time.

In this paper we use an instrumental variable estimator to exploit sources of independent variation, which allows unbiased estimation of the tax-price elasticity under more general conditions. The estimator is applied to the demand for charitable giving. A charitable giving equation is an appropriate test for this procedure because it represents the purest case of a tax-price coefficient. That is, taxes are the sole source of variance in the price. The deduction is also an important policy issue. In 1982, 1.8 percent of gross income was deducted for this reason, about as much as the capital gains deduction.

The main arguments of this paper can be summarized as follows. (1) The overlapping-generations (OG) structure provides a useful framework for the analysis of macroeconomic issues involving intertemporal allocation. (2) As a ""model of money,"" the basic OG setup -- which excludes cash-in-advance or money-in-the-utility-function (MIUF) features -- is inadequate and misleading because it neglects the medium-of-exchange property that is the distinguishing characteristic of money. (3) That this neglect obtains is verified by noting that, in contrast with an axiomatic ""traditional presumption,"" the same aggregate leisure/consumption bundles are available in equilibria in which ""money"" is valued and valueless. (4) That the model may be misleading is demonstrated by examples in which three of its most striking properties --tenuousness of monetary equilibrium, optimality of zero money growth, and price level invariance to open-market exchanges -- disappear in the presence of modifications designed to reflect the medium-of-exchange property. (5) There is no compelling reason why cash-in-advance, MIUF, or other appendages should not be used in conjunction with the OG framework.

990,"Unionization and Firm Performance: The Impact on Profits, Growth and Productivity",['Kim B. Clark'],1982-09-01,1982-09-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

This paper examines the impact of unionization on profit- ability, growth and productivity using time series data on over 900 product line businesses in the North American manufacturing sector (predominantly U.S.). The first section of the paper develops a simple theoretical framework for studying the effect of the union on firm performance. A key result of this analysis is that information about union wage and productivity effects is not sufficient to permit prediction of the sign (or magnitude) of consequent changes in the rate of return on capital; one must know the parameters of production and demand. Expanding the model to allow for the effects of market structure and alternative bargaining regimes establishes the need to examine several indicators of firm performance in assessing the impact of the union. The empirical analysis reveals sizeable negative union effects on profitability, but growth, productivity and the capital-labor ratio appear to be little affected by unionization in this data. The data are thus consistent with a model of union-firm interaction in which collective bargaining affects the distribution of profits, but leaves real magnitudes unchanged. The evidence suggests, however, that unionization may have longer term implications for efficiency since the impact on profitability appears to fall most heavily on firms with relatively little market power.

The paper examines welfare effects and the trade balance response to changes in the world oil prices and interest rates for a small oil-importing economy. The trade balance is mainly seen as the difference between saving and investment, and these are derived from intertemporal optimization. It is shown that the welfare effects consist of static terms of trade effects, intertemporal terms of trade effects, and employment effects. The trade balance deteriorates for temporary oil price increases, whereas its response is ambiguous for permanent oil price increases. For a fall in the world interest rate, the trade balance deteriorates, if the economy is a net borrower.

The paper makes two points as to how standard international trade theory is modified when an endogenous degree of capital utilization is introduced. The first point is that, if capital utilization during a period is less than full because of an exogenous time-dependent variation in productivity within the period, there is no modification of the standard theory. In particular, there is no need to adjust capital-intensity estimates according to the degree of capital utilization. This is in contrast to what has been argued in the literature. The other point is that, if capital utilization is less than full because of higher wages during part of the period, the night of a day and night, say, the required modification of trade theory is that of introducing several kinds of labor and endogenous labor supply, or, equivalently, of introducing nontraded goods.

The theoretical and empirical results in this paper make a strong prima facie case for the proposition that increases in the after tax rate of return caused by tax policy are likely to bring forth significant increases in saving. Theoretical analysis using a variety of standard models tends to suggest that the aggregate response to savings incentives is likely to be substantial. It is argued that the existing empirical evidence sheds little light on the question. Empirical analyses are then conducted using three alternative approaches. All three confirm the hypothesis of a significant positive response of savings to changes in the rate of return.

We examine the implications of arbitrage in a market with many assets. The absence of arbitrage opportunities implies that the linear functionals that give the mean and cost of a portfolio are continuous; hence there exist unique portfolios that represent these functionals. These portfolios span the mean-variance efficient set. We resolve the question of when a market with many assets permits so much diversification that risk-free investment opportunities are available. Ross 112, 141 showed that if there is a factor structure, then the mean returns are approximately linear functions of factor loadings. We define an approximate factor structure and show that this weaker restriction is sufficient for Ross' result. If the covariance matrix of the asset returns has only K unbounded eigenvalues, then there is an approximate factor structure and it is unique. The corresponding K eigenvectors converge and play the role of factor loadings. Hence only a principal component analysis is needed in empirical work.

Our paper seeks to provide an explanation for why the prevalence of COLA provisions and their characteristics vary widely across U.S. industries.

These include the presence of wage indexation, the degree of wage indexation if it exists, the magnitude of deferred noncontingent (on the price level) wage increases, the duration of labor contracts and the trade-off between temporary layoffs and wage indexation. Preliminary empirical tests of some of the implications of the model are conducted using industry data on both the prevalence of COLA provisions and layoff rates, and using contract level data on the characteristics of COLA provisions and contract duration. One key finding is that the level of unemployment insurance benefits appears to simultaneously influence the level of layoffs and the extent of COLA coverage.

The asymmetry between the effects of differences in endowments of traded and differences in endowments of nontraded factors is emphasized.

1000,Partial Retirement and Wage Profiles of Older Workers,"['Alan L. Gustman', 'Thomas L. Steinmeier']",1982-10-01,1982-10-01,,['Labor Economics'],['Labor Studies'],,,"

Older workers are likely to face different wage offers for work while not retired than for work while partially retired. Conventional analyses of wage profiles pool all waqe observations without distin-guishing among individuals according to retirement status.Our empirical analysis suggests the following conclusions.1)Wages for work while not retired and for work while partially retiredare significantly different from one another.2) wage offers facing older workers may vary considerably between those who do and do not face lower limit constraints requiring full-time work or none at all on their main job. 3) Failing to distinguish between wages paid to the partially retired and to the not retired causes a sizable exaggeration of the decline with experience in the wage offer for work while not retired.

5157,Consumer Product Safety Regulation in the United States and the United Kingdom: The Case of Bicycles,"['Wesley A. Magat', 'Michael J. Moore']",1995-06-01,1995-06-01,,"['Health, Education, and Welfare', 'Health', 'Other', 'Law and Economics']","['Health Care', 'Industrial Organization']",,,"

We study the effects of bicycle safety regulations in both the United States and the United Kingdom on bicycle accident rates for various population age groups.  We find small, statistically significant decreases in the accident rates as the stock of bicycles increases its compliance with the regulations.  This result is independent of country, season, and trend effects and holds across a range of age groups.  The results run counter to those in similar studies.  This appears to reflect our focus on a specific standard, rather than on broad enabling legislation, and the longer time series available.

9884,"Imperfect Knowledge, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy","['Athanasios Orphanides', 'John C. Williams']",2003-08-04,2003-08-04,,"['Macroeconomics', 'Monetary Policy']",['Monetary Economics'],,,"

This paper investigates the role that imperfect knowledge about the structure of the economy plays in the formation of expectations, macroeconomic dynamics, and the efficient formulation of monetary policy. Economic agents rely on an adaptive learning technology to form expectations and to update continuously their beliefs regarding the dynamic structure of the economy based on incoming data. The process of perpetual learning introduces an additional layer of dynamic interaction between monetary policy and economic outcomes. We find that policies that would be efficient under rational expectations can perform poorly when knowledge is imperfect. In particular, policies that fail to maintain tight control over inflation are prone to episodes in which the public's expectations of inflation become uncoupled from the policy objective and stagflation results, in a pattern similar to that experienced in the United States during the 1970s. Our results highlight the value of effective communication of a central bank's inflation objective and of continued vigilance against inflation in anchoring inflation expectations and fostering macroeconomic stability.

11029,Optimal Taxation in an RBC Model: A Linear-Quadratic Approach,"['Pierpaolo Benigno', 'Michael Woodford']",2005-01-10,2005-01-10,,"['Microeconomics', 'Mathematical Tools', 'Public Economics', 'Taxation']","['Economic Fluctuations and Growth', 'Monetary Economics']",,,"

We reconsider the optimal taxation of income from labor and capital in the stochastic growth model analyzed by Chari et al. (1994, 1995), but using a linear-quadratic (LQ) approximation to derive a log-linear approximation to the optimal policy rules. The example illustrates how inaccurate ""naive"" LQ approximation --- in which the quadratic objective is obtained from a simple Taylor expansion of the utility function of the representative household --- can be, but also shows how a correct LQ approximation can be obtained, which will provide a correct local approximation to the optimal policy rules in the case of small enough shocks. We also consider the numerical accuracy of the LQ approximation in the case of shocks of the size assumed in the calibration of Chari et al. We find that the correct LQ approximation yields results that are quite accurate, and similar in most respects to the results obtained by Chari et al. using a more computationally intensive numerical method.

11661,Puzzling Tax Structures in Developing Countries: A Comparison of Two Alternative Explanations,"['Roger Gordon', 'Wei Li']",2005-10-03,2005-10-03,,"['Public Economics', 'Taxation', 'Development and Growth', 'Development', 'International Economics', 'Trade', 'International Factor Mobility']",['Public Economics'],,,"

Observed economic policies in developing countries differ sharply both from those observed among developed countries and from those forecast by existing models of optimal policies. For example, developing countries rely little on broad-based taxes, and make substantial use of tariffs and seignorage as nontax sources of revenue.
The objective of this paper is to contrast the implications of two models designed to explain such anomalous policies. One approach, by Gordon-Li (2005), focuses on the greater difficulties faced in poor countries in monitoring taxable activity, and explores the best available policies given such difficulties. The other, building on Grossman-Helpman (1994), presumes that political-economy problems in developing countries are worse, leading to worse policy choices. The paper compares the contrasting theoretical implications of the two models with the data, and finds that the political-economy approach does poorly in reconciling many aspects of the data with the theory. In contrast, the forecasts from Gordon-Li model are largely consistent with the data currently available.

11871,The Economic Impact of AIDS Treatment: Labor Supply in Western Kenya,"['Harsha Thirumurthy', 'Joshua Graff-Zivin', 'Markus Goldstein']",2005-12-19,2005-12-19,,"['Health, Education, and Welfare', 'Health', 'Poverty and Wellbeing', 'Development and Growth', 'Development']",['Health Care'],,,"

Using longitudinal survey data collected in collaboration with a treatment program, this paper is the first to estimate the economic impacts of antiretroviral treatment in Africa. The responses in two important outcomes are studied: (1) labor supply of adult AIDS patients receiving treatment; and (2) labor supply of children and adults living in the patients' households. We find that within six months after the initiation of treatment, there is a 20 percent increase in the likelihood of the patient participating in the labor force and a 35 percent increase in weekly hours worked. Since patient health would continue to decline without treatment, these labor supply responses are underestimates of the impact of treatment on the treated. The upper bound of the treatment impact, which is based on plausible assumptions about the counterfactual, is considerably larger and also implies that the wage benefit from treatment is roughly equal to the costs of treatment provision. The responses in the labor supply of patients' household members are heterogeneous. Young boys and women work considerably less after initiation of treatment, while girls and men do not change their labor supply. The effects on child labor are particularly important since they suggest potential schooling impacts from treatment.

12859,The Excess Burden of Government Indecision,"['Francisco J. Gomes', 'Laurence J. Kotlikoff', 'Luis M. Viceira']",2007-01-23,2007-01-23,,"['Public Economics', 'Taxation', 'National Fiscal Issues']","['Economics of Aging', 'Asset Pricing', 'Health Care', 'Public Economics', 'Political Economy']",,"['Behavioral Finance', 'Insurance']","

Governments are known for procrastinating when it comes to resolving painful policy problems. Whatever the political motives for waiting to decide, procrastination distorts economic decisions relative to what would arise with early policy resolution. In so doing, it engenders excess burden. This paper posits, calibrates, and simulates a life cycle model with earnings, lifespan, investment return, and future policy uncertainty. It then measures the excess burden from delayed resolution of policy uncertainty. The first uncertain policy we consider concerns the level of future Social Security benefits. Specifically, we examine how an agent would respond to learning in advance whether she will experience a major Social Security benefit cut starting at age 65. We show that having to wait to learn materially affects consumption, saving, and portfolio decisions. It also reduces welfare. Indeed, we show that the excess burden of government indecision can, in this instance, range as high as 0.6 percent of the agent's economic resources. This is a significant distortion in of itself. It's also significant when compared to other distortions measured in the literature. The second uncertain policy we consider concerns marginal tax rates. We obtain similar results once we adjust for the impact of tax rates on income.

13995,The Unequal Geographic Burden of Federal Taxation,['David Y. Albouy'],2008-05-15,2008-05-15,2011-12-05,"['Public Economics', 'Taxation', 'National Fiscal Issues', 'Subnational Fiscal Issues', 'Labor Economics', 'Unemployment and Immigration', 'Regional and Urban Economics', 'Regional Economics']","['Political Economy', 'Public Economics']",,['Urban Economics'],"

In the United States, workers in cities offering above-average wages - cities with high productivity, low quality-of-life, or inefficient housing sectors - pay 30 percent more in federal taxes than otherwise identical workers in cities offering below-average wages. According to simulation results, taxes lower long-run employment levels in high-wage areas by 17 percent and land and housing prices by 28 and 6 percent, causing locational inefficiencies costing 0.33 percent of income, or $40 billion in 2008. Employment is shifted from North to South and from urban to rural areas. Tax deductions index taxes partially to local cost-of-living, improving locational efficiency.

15650,Securitization in the 1920's,"['William N. Goetzmann', 'Frank Newman']",2010-01-14,2010-01-14,,"['Industrial Organization', 'Industry Studies', 'History', 'Financial History']",['Industrial Organization'],,,"

This paper quantifies the scale and scope of the commercial real estate mortgage bond market in the period surrounding the 1920s in an attempt to better understand the role of retail mortgage debt in early urban development.  In particular, this paper quantifies the size of the market, identifies risk factors affecting the coupon yield spread over Treasuries and utilizes a unique data set to construct a commercial mortgage price index over the period 1926-1935.
A substantial retail appetite for real estate securities during this period may have significantly contributed to a real construction boom, but overly optimistic speculation in these securities may have led to overbuilding.  The rapid deterioration of these securities and a near complete drop in issuance show, ex post, that investors were overconfident in building fundamentals during the boom years.  The breakdown in the value of real estate securities as collateral assets preceded the crash of 1929 and may have contributed to the fall of asset prices more generally.

19247,Physician Agency and Competition: Evidence from a Major Change to Medicare Chemotherapy Reimbursement Policy,"['Mireille Jacobson', 'Tom Y. Chang', 'Joseph P. Newhouse', 'Craig C. Earle', 'M.D.']",2013-07-25,2013-07-25,,"['Health, Education, and Welfare', 'Health']",['Health Care'],,,"

We investigate the role of physician agency and competition in determining health care supply and patient outcomes. A 2005 change to Medicare fees had a large, negative impact on physician profit margins for providing chemotherapy treatment. In response to these cuts, physicians increased their provision of chemotherapy and changed the mix of chemotherapy drugs they administered. The increase in treatment improved patient survival. These changes were larger in states that experienced larger decreases in physician profit margins. Finally while physician response was larger in more competitive markets, survival improvements were larger in less competitive markets.
