220,Occupational Licensing and the Inter-State Mobility of Professionals,['B. Peter Pashigian'],1977-12-01,1977-12-01,,,,,,"

This paper attempts to measure the effect of occupational licensing, restrictions on reciprocity, location specific investment in reputation and earnings on the interstate mobility of professionals. While 34 professional occupations are analyzed, special attention is focused on the legal profession. The comparatively low interstate mobility rate of lawyers may be due to state licensing and restrictions on reciprocity or to the investments made by lawyers to develop local reputations or to the investments made by lawyers in state specific law. Tests are conducted to distinguish among these three hypotheses.

249,Education and Self-Selection,"['Robert J. Willis', 'Sherwin Rosen']",1978-06-01,1978-06-01,,,['Labor Studies'],,,"

A structural model of the demand for college attendance is derived from the theory of comparative advantage and recent statistical models of self-selection and unobserved components. Estimates from NBER-Thorndike data strongly support the theory. First, expected lifetime earnings gains influence the decision to attend college. Second, those who did not attend college would have earned less than measurably similar people who did attend, while those who attended college would have earned less as high school graduates than measurably similar people who stopped after high school. Positive selection in both groups implies no ""ability bias in these data.

360,Contributions and Determinants of Research and Development Expenditures in the U.S. Manufacturing Industries,['M. Ishaq Nadiri'],1979-06-01,1979-06-01,,,"['Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship']",,,"

This paper is an attempt to assess the contribution of R&D to growth of output in U.S. manufacturing industries. The important issues to address are: whether the slower growth of R&D expenditures in recent years has been the cause of slowdown in the growth of productivity, and what the factors are in explaining the slower growth of R&D expenditures. After a brief survey of the major issues on this topic, a production function is formulated and estimated using tine series cross-section data for the manufacturing industries. Also, the factors determining the rate of growth of R&D expenditures in the 1958-75 period are identified by formulating a dynamic model of demand for R & D activity. The estimation results indicate that the stock of R & D, as a measure of stock of knowledge, positively and strongly affect growth of output in total manufacturing, total durable, and total nondurable industries. Potential growth of output is affected because of the slowdown of growth of stock of R&D since 1966, but the gross rates of return on stock of R&D have not changed much in the 1966-75 period. Growth of output, changes in relative prices, cyclical fluctuations of the economy, as well as changes in level of employment and capital stocks are the factors affecting R&D expenditures. The effect of government financing of R&D on private decisions regarding R & D expenditures differs among different industries. By and large, the results on this issue are basically inconclusive and require further investigation.

679,Has the Rate of Investment Fallen?,['Martin Feldstein'],1981-05-01,1981-05-01,,['Macroeconomics'],['Economic Fluctuations and Growth'],,,"

Although the ratio of gross fixed nonresidential investment to GNP has decreased very little since the late 1960rs, the corresponding net investment ratio declined by nearly 40 percent between the second half of the 1960's and the second half of the 1970's. Four-fifths of this decline was due to the increased ratio of depreciation to GNP and only one-fifth to the decreased ratio of gross investment to GNP. The increased ratio of depreciation to GNP was in turn due in equal amounts to the higher ratio of capital to GNP and to the higher rate of depreciation. Nearly half of the higher depreciation rate was due to the increased rate of depreciation of equipment and nearly half to the increased share of equipment in the capital stock.

We consider linear predictor definitions of noncausality or strict exogeneity and show that it is restrictive to assert that there exists a time-invariant latent variable c such that x is strictly exogenous conditional on c. A restriction of this sort is necessary to justify standard techniques for controlling for unobserved individual effects. There is a parallel analysis for multivariate probit models, but now the distributional assumption for the individual effects is restrictive. This restriction can be avoided by using a conditional likelihood analysis in a logit model. Some of these ideas are illustrated by estimating union wage effects for a sample of Young Men in the National Longitudinal Survey. The results indicate that the lags and leads could have been generated just by an unobserved individual effect, which gives some support for analysis of covariance-type estimates. These estimates indicate a substantial omitted variable bias. We also present estimates of a model of female labor force participation, focusing on the relationship between participation and fertility. Unlike the wage example, there is evidence against conditional strict exogeneity; if we ignore this evidence, the probit and logit approaches give conflicting results.
