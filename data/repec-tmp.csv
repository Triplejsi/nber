82,5.0,0.0,"[""Various schemes to insure convergence have been found to help: these are all based on the principle that the objective function fTV_lf should not be allowed to increase from one iteration to the next. If the step based on Newton's method would cause an increase, it is not taken, but a step based on some sort of gradient meti-od is taken instead. The specific algorithm that was found to be most effective is a derivative based modification of Powell's (1970) dog-leg, which was suggested by John Dennis. Even with this method, Iwever, we have encountered models where G was not zero, yet H1@ was. This means the algorithm got stuck in a valley or rut, even though a minimum had not been found. The only way out would be to start again with a different initial guess."", 'A further problem for which we have no solution is that not all values of U are allowable. The admissibility condition given by Box and Jenkins (1970, pp. 5+ and 67) is rather messy to compute, so we do not attempt to verify athiissibility of the estimated U. As a consequence we may occasionally return ridiculous estimates. In general, as pointed out by Box and Jenkins, great care should be exercised when fitting this sort of model. â\x80\x94 32 â\x80\x94 Finally a few words on initial guesses. The following seemed to work reasonably well. 1) Fit f( ) by ordinary nonlinear least squares. Let r f( ). 2) Fit the Box-Jenkins model for P(p) only to r. Let these new residuals be r2. 3) Fit the Box-Jenkins model for T() only to r2. 14) Use the estimated , p, as initial values for the full model.', 'RERENCES Box, G.E. P. and Jenkins, G.M.

167,53.0,1.0,"['Whether one or the other side proclaims the truth is largely an empirical matter. A fundamental study of this problem has been done by Cagan in 1965 who, relying on disaggregated U.S. data from 1875â\x80\x941960 and nonparaâ\x80\x94 metric methods, argues convincingly that the longâ\x80\x94run relation between money supply and the price level is largely unidirectional. His analysis of the cyclical relations between money and income fails to yield a firm conclusion, however.', 'Recently Granger (1969) gave an explicit and testable definition of causality and feedback. Sims (1972) used a Hilbert space argument to show that Granger&apos;s definition was equivalent to the existence of a particular representation of the driven process with respect to the driving process and proposed a univariate regression method to test for the direction of causality. Since then, a significant amount of interest in the theory and technique of causality detection has been developed in the economic literature. However, the particular aspect of inference advocated by each individual author fails to yield a consensus on the particular problem being investigated. Take the case of money and income causality. Sims (1972) contended that there existed a unidirectional 2 causality from money to GNP in the U.S. On the other hand, DyReys, Starleaf and Wang (1976)1, Feige and Pearce (1974), etc., based on different methods, contended that money and income were, at most, weakly related.', 'Neither is the pattern uniform f or interâ\x80\x94country comparison. For instance, Wall (1974) found that money was the driving force for income in the U.K., while Williams, Goodhart and Gowland (1976) found the reverse causality to be the case.', 'Section II presents the basic theorem characterizing the causality events and suggests two feedback detection methods which, like the one suggested by Pierce and Haugh (1977), are based on correlation analysis.', 'c&apos;(O)] cA(k) and c.(O), c.(O) and C-(k) are the sample variances and crossâ\x80\x94covariances of u, v. The test statistic calculated would be (7) = (T_p)?(k) In a large sample this statistic is approximately chiâ\x80\x94square distributed with M degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis, because the asymptotic distribution of a finite set of lagged crossâ\x80\x94correlations between two independent linear processes is normal (Hannan [1971, p. 230]).', 'The proof of (k) having the same asymptotic distribution follows straightforwardly from that of Haugh (1976) except for the minor complication here that although v is a white noise process, u is not. However, the independence of u and v implies that c(k) is still of O(T); thus, there is no change in the basic argument. Neither is there a reduction in the degrees of freedom for this test because the constraints placed on the residuals by the fitting process did not play a crucial role as that in the case of Box and Pierce (1970) or Chitturi (1974).', 'If the spectra are sufficiently smooth, they can be divided into M bands between (O,ir ) such that for each band each spectral matrix is constant (see Wahba [1968] for a precise condition). We can then obtain an estimate of (w) by first transforming and &apos; into Vu(Wd) and where w(wd) = (211)2 exp(itwd) w() = (2irn) exp(itwd) d = 1, . . . [n/2] , with n = (Tâ\x80\x942p) and (] the largest integer not greater than the indicated number. Let m satisfy mM = As T- , we can group the Wd into i sets (excluding = 0), the Lth which we call S, containing m adjacent d nearest to . We put W(Wd) w (Wd) W dC S - 1 r = ; 1. w(w) w WdS f (w) uv i in u d v d WdCS where the super asterisk indicates transposition combined with conjugation.', 'Under appropriate conditions, such an estimate is consistent (see Anderson [1971, Ch. 10], Brillinger [1975, Ch. 7]).', 'Test 3 (Sims test): From theorem 1(u), Sims(1972) suggested an F test for causal detection. That is, first regress Y on past and future values of X, taking account by generalized least squares or prefiltering of the serial correlation in the residuals. If there is no feedback from Y to X, future values of X in the regression should have coefficients insignificantly different from zero, as a group. 12 Test 4 (Pierce and Haugh (1976), Wall(1974)): First use separate filters on X and Y to ensure that each is very nearly preâ\x80\x94whitened.', 'Then use crossâ\x80\x94correlation analysis to determine whether the residuals of the two prewhitened series are crossâ\x80\x94correlated. If causality runs from X to Y only, all the crossâ\x80\x94correlations between the residuals of X and lagged residuals of Y should be insignificantly different from zero. Haugh (1976) showed that .mder the null hypothesis these estimated residual cross correlations are asymptotically normally distributed with mean zero and variance 1/n. Thus M (15) f=fl rk k=1 is chiâ\x80\x94square distributed with M degrees of freedom.', 'Test 5: From theorem 1(iii), it is clear that one way to test feedback free is to test the independence between the stochastic regressors x and the disturbances v. Various testing methods have been suggested by Wu (1973). However, the power of these tests depend crucially upon the available instrumental variables. Therefore, except mentioning it as a possible candidate, we shall not elaborate on it here.', 'The probability theory under the null hypothesis is the same whether one uses the correlation analysis or the regression analysis. The distribution of the test criterion when the null hypothesis is not true differs in the two cases (see Anderson (1958)). Thus the power function will be different even though the same test is valid in each case. Whether one prefers the former approach to the latter wiil be largely a matter of judicious choice and individual preference. However, when T-.c , the results are identical in both situations. (Kendall and Stuart (1965, ch. 26)). Test 4 in this case uses the statistic (22) X;AY..1(Y_jYt_1)Y;_1AX = â\x80¢(Tâ\x80\x943) 4', '(Friedman and Schwarz [963, Friedman [1970], Brunner and Meltzer [1964], etc.) Standing on the other side are the new viewers who provide explicit examples of the possibilities for nonâ\x80\x94correspondence between causal ordering and temporal ordering of turning points (Brainard and Tobin [1968], Tobin [1970], etc.) 20 T) The extreme critics even maintain that the money supply has no relevant place in the determination of money income. They attribute the association between money supply and income to the demand for money which contains income as an important argument. The money stock is somehow called forth to meet the demand. For instance, Davis (1968), Gramley and Chase (1965), Kazken (1967), etc., contend that cyclical fluctuations of monetary growth cannot be attriâ\x80\x94 buted to the behavior of the Federal Reserve authorities. These fluctuations are claimed to result primarily from the behavior of commercial banks and the public.', 'The monetarists, on the other hand, although agreeing with the general relevance of money and income, are far from reaching a consensus with regard to the impact of economic activity on money supply. The strong view (e.g., L. Anderson [1968])contends that the behavior of the monetary authorities dominates movements in money income. The weak view (e.g., Cagan [1965], Friedman and Schwartz [1963])does not exclude feedback from income to the money supply, except that the monetary impulses are considered the major factor accounting for variations in money income. Such controversies can only be resolved by empirical studies. In this section we use the concepts of feedback and causality as they apply to stochastic processes to derive a time series interpretation of the direction of cause and effect. Hopefully it will shed some light on this empirically difficult problem.', 'We use seasonally adjusted U.S. quarterly money stock and current dollar measures of GNP from 1947 I to 1976 II, for our analysis. Both N]. and N2 were used as alternative measures of money stock variables.', 'All variables were measured as natural logs. Following Sims (1972), we prefiltered each logged variable using the filter 1 â\x80\x94 1.5L + .5626L2.', 'The results of these tests were reported in Tables 1 and 2.

If the sample size 37 is large, then causal spectral analysis would be a powerful exploratory tool. Of course, parametric estimation should be regarded as the ultimate goal in this kind of work. However, the empirical identification of multivariate autoregressiveâ\x80\x94moving average processes may not be feasible in many occasions. (See Akaike (1974) for some theoretical discussions and Caines and Chan (1975), Wa].1 (1974) for some actual fitting). The main value of causal spectral analysis is in its flexLbility in examining the sources of variations in the data. It can be used to suggest possible models. 38 FOOTNOTES 1.

Johnson, eds., The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976.', '2Darby and Stockman (1980).', '4As is appropriate for a reserve country, the balance of payments was found to have no influence on the U.S. money supply. See Darby (1980a,', '5The equations are solved for exports, relative price of imports, exchange rate, net capital outflows, and the balance of payments.', '6Variables such as real income, prices, and money are measured in logarithms. The interest rates and unemployment rates are decimal frac- tions. Exports, imports, net capital outflows, and the balance of payments are all scaled by dividing by nominal income. Shocks are deviations of actual values from optimal ARIMA predictions of the variables.', '13For example, the strongest simulated effects were for the Netherlands. The peak effects on real income were Â± 1 basis point; on the money supply, price level and interest rate Â± 0.2 basis points; on the exchange rate Â± 0.3 basis point; on the balance of payments Â± 0.1 basis point; and -- the big one -- on exports Â± 8 basis points.', '14The negative coefficients on money shocks were not jointly signifi- cant in the Mark III model, but were retained in the reestimation of the Mark IV model so that this channel was not foreclosed. `5To be precise, the implied increase in U.K. real government spending compared to the base run for the first nine quarters is 100, 56, 44, 63, 59,', '18See, for example, Swoboda (1976), Meiselman and Laffer (1975), and Parkin and Zis (1976a, 1976b).']"

Then this game has a Nash equilibrium (tâ\x88\x97 (G, F), câ\x88\x97 (G, F)).', 'B Method of Identifying Faculty Patents We started with the names of every scientist and engineer in PhD granting departments at Cornell, Georgia Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Purdue, Stanford, Texas A & M, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin reported in the National Research Councilâ\x80\x99s (1995) survey of PhD granting departments in the US. The list is for faculty in residence in 1993. The names were compared to inventor names on US patents granted between 1993 and 1999. Once names had been paired we used a multi-staged name screening process to insure that the faculty member and the inventor are the same. The first step was to check the distance between the zip code of the university and the zip code of the city of residence of the inventor. If the distance was more than 50 miles the patent was removed from the database. The average zip code distance in the final data is less than 7 miles.', 'We then used the surname data from the 1990 Census to evaluate the incidence of each name. At this point we used various filters to eliminate common names. The filter was least dense when we had a match on first, middle and last name for the university faculty listing and the name on the patent. The filter was most dense when we could only match a last name and first initial. About 10% of the matches are eliminated because of common names.', 'From the NRC survey we know that a faculty member is at a respective university in 1993 (the year of the survey). Our procedure for verifying institutional aï¬\x83liation for inventors on applications filed in years other than 1993 was the following. If the assignment was to the inventorâ\x80\x99s 1993 university we assumed the inventor was with the university. If the assignment was not to that university, we used a combination of web searches and the faculty listing in the National Faculty Directory to verify aï¬\x83liation. If we determined that a faculty member was on the faculty in any year after 1993 we assumed she was on the faculty in the intervening years between 1993 and the latter year. If we could not verify faculty aï¬\x83liation for the patent application year the patent was dropped.']"

In all of these cases we keep our original coding. Our algorithm produces a permanent transition to democracy in South Africa during the early 80s based on Freedom House and Polity. However, PS and all secondary sources agree that the official democratization was in 1994, so we use this date. Gambia and Guyana, which we handled on a case-by-case basis. The particular coding of these countries does not affect our results.37 It is important to note that, in contrast to Papaioannou and Siourounis, we do not impose any Ã¢â\x82¬Å\x93stability criteriaÃ¢â\x82¬Â\x9d and also code Ã¢â\x82¬Å\x93temporaryÃ¢â\x82¬Â\x9d transitions. Though some temporary switches in and out of democracy may be driven by measurement error, focusing only on Ã¢â\x82¬Å\x93permanent democratizations Ã¢â\x82¬Â\x9d (or permanent reversals) would create an obvious bias because the democracy index would be a function of future events, thus potentially correlated with future GDP.', 'In column 1 we only include four lags of GDP.

In particular, this specification predicts that democratizations are particularly likely to 37 In particular, we follow most sources and code Cyprus as democratic after 1974.

Columns 6, 7 and 8 present GMM estimators adding these additional Ahn and Schmidt moment conditions to the moment conditions exploited in columns 2, 3 and 4, respectively.41 Comparing the estimates in columns 2-4 with their counterparts in columns 6-8 shows that these additional nonlinear moment conditions improve the fit to GDP dynamics. In particular, GDP persistence in these columns is 0.96, which is closer to our baseline within estimates, but the coefficient of democracy is greater, leading to a larger estimate of the long-run effect on democracy.', 'Columns 1-4 of Table A10 present the results. 43 We compute standard errors using a Sandwich estimator formula similar to the one in Murphy and Topel (1985) and presented in Stefanski and Boos (2002).

Appendices A Data Appendix In this appendix, we describe the construction of firm-level credit spreads and other firm-specific variables used in the empirical analysis. Subsection A.1 describes the bond-level data set used to compute firm-specific credit spreads. Subsection A.2 provides the details surrounding the construction of variables used in the estimation of credit spread regressions, while subsection A.3 describes the construction of the panel data set used to estimate the relationship between investment, uncertainty, and credit spreads. And lastly, subsection A.4 describes the estimation procedureÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dand the associated resultsÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dused to estimate the degree of decreasing return-to-scale in U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector, as well as to construct our proxy for idiosyncratic uncertainty based on firm-level profitability shocks.', 'urkaynak et al. (2007). The resulting price Pf t [k] can then be used to calculate the yieldÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9ddenoted by yf t [k]Ã¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dof a hypothetical Treasury security with identical cashflows as the underlying corporate bond. Consequently, the credit spread Sit[k] = yit[k] Ã¢Ë\x86â\x80\x99 yf t [k], where yit[k] denotes the yield of the corporate bond k, is thus free of the Ã¢â\x82¬Å\x93duration mismatchÃ¢â\x82¬Â\x9d that occurs when the spreads are computed simply by matching the corporate yield to the estimated yield of a zero-coupon Treasury security of the same maturity.', 'To ensure that our results are not driven by a small number of extreme observations, we eliminated from our data set all observations with credit spreads below 5 basis points and greater than 2,000 basis points. We also eliminated very small corporate issues (par value of less than $1 million) and all observations with a remaining term-to-maturity of less than one year or more than 30 years.31 These selection criteria yielded a sample of 6,725 individual securities over the 1973:M1Ã¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9c2012:M9 period. These corporate securities were then matched with their issuerÃ¢â\x82¬â\x84¢s quarterly income and balance sheet data from Compustat and daily data on equity valuations from CRSP, a procedure that yielded a sample of 1,164 U.S. nonfinancial firms.']"

In this Appendix, we report estimates from equation (3) using nonlinear GMM, with moment restrictions corresponding to using past values of predicted mortality and life expectancy in 1900 as instruments Ã\x83Â¢Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82â\x80\x9c as in Arellano and BondÃ\x83Â¢Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82â\x84¢s GMM, reported in Table 1. The results of this estimation are provided in Appendix Table A1.', 'The two columns of this table correspond to alternative moment restrictions, with Panels A and B again showing results for the periods 1940-1980 and 1940-2000 respectively. Column 1 reports results using a sparse set of moments (at most two lags of predicted mortality and GDP per capita). Column 2, in the same spirit as Arellano and BondÃ\x83Â¢Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82â\x84¢s full GMM, uses all lags of predicted mortality and twice or more lagged GDP per capita.', 'The results are very close to the baseline estimates in AJ (2006, 2007). In the first column for 1940-1980 (Panel A), we have Ã\x83â\x80¹Ã\x82â\x80\xa0 Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x80\x9aÃ\x82Â¼ = Ã\x83Â¢Ã\x82Ë\x86Ã\x82â\x80\x991Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82Âº261, with a standard error of 0.801; and for 1940-2000 (Panel B), we have a more precisely estimated Ã\x83â\x80¹Ã\x82â\x80\xa0 Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x80\x9aÃ\x82Â¼ = Ã\x83Â¢Ã\x82Ë\x86Ã\x82â\x80\x991Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82Âº548Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82Â» with a standard error of 0.644. The results in column 2 are similar, with the Panel B results showing larger (i.e., more negative), more precise, and more statistically significant estimates. The similarity of these results to our baseline estimates can be seen by noting that, as pointed out in footnote 6 in the text, Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x80\x9aÃ\x82Â¼ in this specification corresponds precisely to the parameter Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x80\x9aÃ\x82Â¼ in our equation (1), which measures the impact over a 40 or 60 year horizon.', 'This can be verified by setting Ã\x83Â¢Ã\x82Ë\x86Ã\x82â\x80\xa0Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â¹Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â©Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â´ = Ã\x83Â¢Ã\x82Ë\x86Ã\x82â\x80\xa0Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â¸Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â©Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â´ = 0 in equation (3) Ã\x83Â¢Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82â\x80\x9c so that the dynamics have worked themselves out Ã\x83Â¢Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82â\x80\x9c in which case the equation implies Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â¹Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â©Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â´ = Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x80\x9aÃ\x82Â¼Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â¸Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â©Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82Â\x81Ã\x82Â´. Therefore, estimates of Ã\x83Â¯Ã\x82â\x80\x9aÃ\x82Â¼ can be directly compared to the estimates in Table 9 of AJ (2007), which range from-1.21 to-2.70. In short, nonlinear estimation using BCFÃ\x83Â¢Ã\x82â\x82¬Ã\x82â\x84¢s own specification produces estimates within the range of our baseline results.', 'GMM (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Baseline specification Lagged GDP per capita 0.552 0.414 (0.080) (0.296) Life expectancy-1.307-0.100-0.270-0.478-0.171 (0.455) (0.421) (0.522) (0.443) (0.393) Countries 47 47 47 47 47 Periods 5 5 5 5 4 Moments 25 Hansen p-value 0.29 AR2 p-value 0.22 Lagged GDP per capita 0.817 0.821 (0.047) (0.144) Life expectancy-1.394-0.928-1.317-0.965-0.598 (0.362) (0.486) (0.627) (0.425) (0.234) Countries 47 47 47 47 47 Periods 7 7 7 7 6 Moments 44 Hansen p-value 0.31 AR2 p-value 0.43 Effect of life expectancy on GDP per capita, controlling flexibly for the impact of life expectancy in 1900 and convergence dynamics, using panel data']"
