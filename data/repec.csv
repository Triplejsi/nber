82,5.0,0.0,"[""Various schemes to insure convergence have been found to help: these are all based on the principle that the objective function fTV_lf should not be allowed to increase from one iteration to the next. If the step based on Newton's method would cause an increase, it is not taken, but a step based on some sort of gradient meti-od is taken instead. The specific algorithm that was found to be most effective is a derivative based modification of Powell's (1970) dog-leg, which was suggested by John Dennis. Even with this method, Iwever, we have encountered models where G was not zero, yet H1@ was. This means the algorithm got stuck in a valley or rut, even though a minimum had not been found. The only way out would be to start again with a different initial guess."", 'A further problem for which we have no solution is that not all values of U are allowable. The admissibility condition given by Box and Jenkins (1970, pp. 5+ and 67) is rather messy to compute, so we do not attempt to verify athiissibility of the estimated U. As a consequence we may occasionally return ridiculous estimates. In general, as pointed out by Box and Jenkins, great care should be exercised when fitting this sort of model. Ã¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d 32 Ã¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d Finally a few words on initial guesses. The following seemed to work reasonably well. 1) Fit f( ) by ordinary nonlinear least squares. Let r f( ). 2) Fit the Box-Jenkins model for P(p) only to r. Let these new residuals be r2. 3) Fit the Box-Jenkins model for T() only to r2. 14) Use the estimated , p, as initial values for the full model.', 'RERENCES Box, G.E. P. and Jenkins, G.M.

FOOTNOTES This paper has been written while on sabbatical at the National Bureau of Economic Research. It has not undergone the full critical review accorded the NBER studies.', 'Research on this paper was supported by a grant to the National Bureau of Economic Research from the Rockefeller Foundation. The paper was inspired by discussions with Yoram Weiss and Robert J. Willis. I am thankful to Orley Ashenfelter, Gary Becker, Victor Fuchs, Zvi Griliches, Robert Michael, Jacob Mincer and Donald Parsons for their comments on earlier drafts of this paper, and to Kris Chinn and Kyle Johnson for computational assistance. ^One exception is (Perlman, 1969, Ch. 1). After writing the initial draft of this paper, I have become aware of another two exceptions; namely, Bloch (1973) and Sharir (1975). Both suggest models that are in many respects similar to the one suggested here but do not analyze all the implications of this model.', 'Ben Porath (1973) explained this relationship in a somewhat similar fashion, arguing that If the elasticity of substitution between time and goods in the production of children exceeds unity, children may be a time-intensive commodity for low-wage mothers but a goods-intensive commodity for high-wage mothers.', 'Fuchs (1974) reports that the sex differential in hourly earnings of white non-farm employed hardly changed in the last decade (from .61 in 1959 to .64 in 1969). Moreover, the differential for the young (less than 35) married (the group more prone to divorce) has even slightly increased (from .73 to .70). 2 7 One can easily incorporate in the analysis additional proposals (e.g., a subsidy confined to formal source of childcare) and complicate it by introducing additional activities or exchange within the household, but this would not change our basic conclusion.', 'Using Israeli data (the Family Expenditure Survey 1968/9) , I found that, even when one controls for the wife&apos;s education and employment status, the income elasticity of housemaids exceeds unity.', 'One has to qualify somewhat this conclusion because the wage rates used in the imputations may exceed the nonworking wives&apos; expected wages (Gronau, 1973). It may very well be that the observed goods intensity of children can be traced to joint consumption and production. Much of the satisfaction one derives from his children and much of the childcare activity involves just having the children around while doing other things, e.g., cooking, watching TV, etc. Children may not require, therefore, an increase in leisure to allow the enjoyment from them.']"

167,53.0,1.0,"['Whether one or the other side proclaims the truth is largely an empirical matter. A fundamental study of this problem has been done by Cagan in 1965 who, relying on disaggregated U.S. data from 1875Ã¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d1960 and nonparaÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d metric methods, argues convincingly that the longÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9drun relation between money supply and the price level is largely unidirectional. His analysis of the cyclical relations between money and income fails to yield a firm conclusion, however.', 'Recently Granger (1969) gave an explicit and testable definition of causality and feedback. Sims (1972) used a Hilbert space argument to show that Granger&apos;s definition was equivalent to the existence of a particular representation of the driven process with respect to the driving process and proposed a univariate regression method to test for the direction of causality. Since then, a significant amount of interest in the theory and technique of causality detection has been developed in the economic literature. However, the particular aspect of inference advocated by each individual author fails to yield a consensus on the particular problem being investigated. Take the case of money and income causality. Sims (1972) contended that there existed a unidirectional 2 causality from money to GNP in the U.S. On the other hand, DyReys, Starleaf and Wang (1976)1, Feige and Pearce (1974), etc., based on different methods, contended that money and income were, at most, weakly related.', 'Neither is the pattern uniform f or interÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dcountry comparison. For instance, Wall (1974) found that money was the driving force for income in the U.K., while Williams, Goodhart and Gowland (1976) found the reverse causality to be the case.', 'Section II presents the basic theorem characterizing the causality events and suggests two feedback detection methods which, like the one suggested by Pierce and Haugh (1977), are based on correlation analysis.', 'c&apos;(O)] cA(k) and c.(O), c.(O) and C-(k) are the sample variances and crossÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dcovariances of u, v. The test statistic calculated would be (7) = (T_p)?(k) In a large sample this statistic is approximately chiÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dsquare distributed with M degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis, because the asymptotic distribution of a finite set of lagged crossÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dcorrelations between two independent linear processes is normal (Hannan [1971, p. 230]).', 'The proof of (k) having the same asymptotic distribution follows straightforwardly from that of Haugh (1976) except for the minor complication here that although v is a white noise process, u is not. However, the independence of u and v implies that c(k) is still of O(T); thus, there is no change in the basic argument. Neither is there a reduction in the degrees of freedom for this test because the constraints placed on the residuals by the fitting process did not play a crucial role as that in the case of Box and Pierce (1970) or Chitturi (1974).', 'If the spectra are sufficiently smooth, they can be divided into M bands between (O,ir ) such that for each band each spectral matrix is constant (see Wahba [1968] for a precise condition). We can then obtain an estimate of (w) by first transforming and &apos; into Vu(Wd) and where w(wd) = (211)2 exp(itwd) w() = (2irn) exp(itwd) d = 1, . . . [n/2] , with n = (TÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d2p) and (] the largest integer not greater than the indicated number. Let m satisfy mM = As T- , we can group the Wd into i sets (excluding = 0), the Lth which we call S, containing m adjacent d nearest to . We put W(Wd) w (Wd) W dC S - 1 r = ; 1. w(w) w WdS f (w) uv i in u d v d WdCS where the super asterisk indicates transposition combined with conjugation.', 'Under appropriate conditions, such an estimate is consistent (see Anderson [1971, Ch. 10], Brillinger [1975, Ch. 7]).', 'Test 3 (Sims test): From theorem 1(u), Sims(1972) suggested an F test for causal detection. That is, first regress Y on past and future values of X, taking account by generalized least squares or prefiltering of the serial correlation in the residuals. If there is no feedback from Y to X, future values of X in the regression should have coefficients insignificantly different from zero, as a group. 12 Test 4 (Pierce and Haugh (1976), Wall(1974)): First use separate filters on X and Y to ensure that each is very nearly preÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dwhitened.', 'Then use crossÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dcorrelation analysis to determine whether the residuals of the two prewhitened series are crossÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dcorrelated. If causality runs from X to Y only, all the crossÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dcorrelations between the residuals of X and lagged residuals of Y should be insignificantly different from zero. Haugh (1976) showed that .mder the null hypothesis these estimated residual cross correlations are asymptotically normally distributed with mean zero and variance 1/n. Thus M (15) f=fl rk k=1 is chiÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dsquare distributed with M degrees of freedom.', 'Test 5: From theorem 1(iii), it is clear that one way to test feedback free is to test the independence between the stochastic regressors x and the disturbances v. Various testing methods have been suggested by Wu (1973). However, the power of these tests depend crucially upon the available instrumental variables. Therefore, except mentioning it as a possible candidate, we shall not elaborate on it here.', 'The probability theory under the null hypothesis is the same whether one uses the correlation analysis or the regression analysis. The distribution of the test criterion when the null hypothesis is not true differs in the two cases (see Anderson (1958)). Thus the power function will be different even though the same test is valid in each case. Whether one prefers the former approach to the latter wiil be largely a matter of judicious choice and individual preference. However, when T-.c , the results are identical in both situations. (Kendall and Stuart (1965, ch. 26)). Test 4 in this case uses the statistic (22) X;AY..1(Y_jYt_1)Y;_1AX = Ã¢â\x82¬Â¢(TÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d3) 4', '(Friedman and Schwarz [963, Friedman [1970], Brunner and Meltzer [1964], etc.) Standing on the other side are the new viewers who provide explicit examples of the possibilities for nonÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dcorrespondence between causal ordering and temporal ordering of turning points (Brainard and Tobin [1968], Tobin [1970], etc.) 20 T) The extreme critics even maintain that the money supply has no relevant place in the determination of money income. They attribute the association between money supply and income to the demand for money which contains income as an important argument. The money stock is somehow called forth to meet the demand. For instance, Davis (1968), Gramley and Chase (1965), Kazken (1967), etc., contend that cyclical fluctuations of monetary growth cannot be attriÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d buted to the behavior of the Federal Reserve authorities. These fluctuations are claimed to result primarily from the behavior of commercial banks and the public.', 'The monetarists, on the other hand, although agreeing with the general relevance of money and income, are far from reaching a consensus with regard to the impact of economic activity on money supply. The strong view (e.g., L. Anderson [1968])contends that the behavior of the monetary authorities dominates movements in money income. The weak view (e.g., Cagan [1965], Friedman and Schwartz [1963])does not exclude feedback from income to the money supply, except that the monetary impulses are considered the major factor accounting for variations in money income. Such controversies can only be resolved by empirical studies. In this section we use the concepts of feedback and causality as they apply to stochastic processes to derive a time series interpretation of the direction of cause and effect. Hopefully it will shed some light on this empirically difficult problem.', 'We use seasonally adjusted U.S. quarterly money stock and current dollar measures of GNP from 1947 I to 1976 II, for our analysis. Both N]. and N2 were used as alternative measures of money stock variables.', 'All variables were measured as natural logs. Following Sims (1972), we prefiltered each logged variable using the filter 1 Ã¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d 1.5L + .5626L2.', 'The results of these tests were reported in Tables 1 and 2.

If the sample size 37 is large, then causal spectral analysis would be a powerful exploratory tool. Of course, parametric estimation should be regarded as the ultimate goal in this kind of work. However, the empirical identification of multivariate autoregressiveÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dmoving average processes may not be feasible in many occasions. (See Akaike (1974) for some theoretical discussions and Caines and Chan (1975), Wa].1 (1974) for some actual fitting). The main value of causal spectral analysis is in its flexLbility in examining the sources of variations in the data. It can be used to suggest possible models. 38 FOOTNOTES 1.

Ã¢â\x82¬Â¢ For example, the United States may be characterized by nominal wage rigidity and may therefore be more outputÃ¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9dresponsive to monetary policy.', 'During the 1974-75 recession there was clearly a combination of a supply shock with a concomitant demand contraction coining from the cumulative income reduction in all OECD countries. This was compounded by a fall in investment and in some countries (notably the United States) + -13- + by domestic fiscal and monetary restraint as well. For this reason it is easy to fall into the trap of attributing all of the unemployment to a wore conventional demand contraction combined with downward price rigidity. As pointed out by Malinvaud (1977), until recently the experience of the industrial countries has been confined to alternations between situations of Keynesian unemployment or inflation. The developments of 1973-75 mark a departure from this pattern.', 'The three kinds of shift discussed here (import price shock, exchange rate adjustments and demand contraction) go quite a long way in explaining both the deep recession of 1974-75 and the intercountry differences in rates of inflation. But before turning back to these let us consider the + -15- + implications for the labour market, which in many ways mirrors the effects already considered in the commodity market.', 'Figure 4 traces the main average developments for six major OECD countries, excluding the United States2&apos; (Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom). As is well known, the poj.nts followed what looked like a reasonably well-behaved Phillips curve in the 1960s; the plot starts curving back in 1969, with a fairly flat upward drift in both inflation and output deviation. From 1972-73 on one obtains the perverse bell-shaped curve, which is familiar from the experience of so many countries.22 21 The U.S. data, taken by themselves, also.show a very similar general -', 'pattern. The following analysis is based on Bruno (l79). Capacity estimates are based on Artus (1977). 22 A diagram of exactly this kind,averaging the figures of seven major cOuntries, as well as individual country pictures appeared in the McCracken Report (OECD, 1977). It is worth noting that the Report had the figure drawn only up to 1976, with an arrow (and a question mark) pointing in a clear southwest direction signifying the hoped-for move towards price stability and full employment. Subsequent developments in 1977 and 1978 have not exactly fulfilled that promise. 2 0 I.--J z 0 w I I I Figure 4.

First, the model&apos;s parameter values are selected to describe a &apos;representative&apos; OECD economy. The response of this economy to a doubling of oil prices is studied under a variety of assumptions about labour market dynamics. A second economy is then added and we illustrate how multi-country interactions affect our numerical estimates. Throughout this section, we also appeal to the country data to support the general structure of the simulation model (for further empirical results, see Saclis, 1979).', 'The simulations convey a clear message: fuel inputs are sufficiently important in production, and the 1973 oil pricE rise was of such magnitude that a large part of the 1974-75 recession is directly attributable to the change in the relative of oil. While monetary policy was contractionary in most countries in 1974, the simulations suggest that even with accommodative policy the 1974-75 recession would have been severe, with significant classical unemployment.', 'To the extent that wages are indexed, so that real wages adjust slowly while nominal wages are flexible, monetary adjustments lead only to compensating price movements, without affecting real output. Indeed, if real rather than nominal wages are rigid, a sustained period of unemployment might be necessary to restore equilibrium wage levels after a. supply disturbance (see also Bruno, 1978).', 'Many writers have speculated as to whethr actual wage processes are more accurately described by wages following past wages (wage-wage process) or current price expectations (wage-price process). The wage-wage process corresponds to nornina7 rigidity in that the real wage can be affected by anticipated monetary policy. We speculate that the wage-wage process results in large part frbm the existence of overlapping long-term contracts in the labour market.43 Until the mid-1970s, aggregate real wage growth was so constant that the two hypotheses could not be econometrically distinguished.', 'The increased variability in real wages since 1973 allows a partial answer tO the question. Indeed, the evidence suggests that different, countries have significantly different degrees of nominal rigidity.', 'What can we say empirically about the behaviour of wages since the oil price shock of 1973?

However, the estimated coefficients of (p - p) are throughout implausibly high compare them with the 0.08 coefficient in (9)]. Capital-energy complementarity could in part account for the large coefficient. We suspect also that p - p is, to sonic extent, proxying for an aggregate demand variable that might appear in an investment equation in addition to the profit variable. That is, the coefficient of p - p also reflects the effect on I of the 1974-75 world recession. Finally, n - p might proxy for long-run expectations of profitability, affecting I through stock-market prices.', 'from IJNCTAD, Monthly Source: Columns (1) and (2) (April 1978), p. 3.', 'Column (3) from U.N., Statistical Yearbook 1976, p. 58, and U.N., Monthly Bulletin of Statistics (April 1978), p. 162.', 'The 1973 entry is the regression residual.

We have in mind the internal structural implications for. the highly industrialized economies of the rapid growth of manufacturing exports by semi-industrialized LDCs. These have been completely ignored in the present paper although for. some OECD countries, this is gradually becoming a major issue. In at least one respect, however, the analysis of this quesion would fall quite naturally into the general approach that we would like to advocate.

The model is based on Atkinson and Sandmo (1979), but the results and their derivation are somewhat different. 2. Those who prefer to work with the direct utility function will find that the mathematics is only slightly more cumbersome. 3. It can be shown that the second-order conditions for an optimum are satisfied if the revenue from each tax is an increasing function of the tax rate. 4. The only if follows provided all elasticities are finite.', '5. It should be noted that (23) is not equivalent to the condition that the utility function be weakly separable into labour supply and some function of the consumption levels in the two periods except when the function of consumption levels is homothetic; see Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) and Auerbach (1979). 6. This enables us to obtain a result and proof both of which appear to be much simpler than those in the literature.', 'The envelope theorem is discussed in, for example, Dixit (1976). 7. We are assuming here that the incentive to invest depends only on the real rate of interest which will not be true if the corporate tax system is unindexed. 8. To be strictly accurate equation (60) shows that t w and t have oppos i te signs. But from _( 34) it can be shown r that when the tax rates have opposite signs it is the tax on labour income which is positive provided that the share of capital income is less than b/(l+b) where b is the / ratio of the absolute magnitudes of t w to t r Ã¢â\x82¬Â¢ This condition is-satisfied in all of our examples and in all plausible cases. ;']"
