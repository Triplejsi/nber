82,5.0,0.0,"[""Various schemes to insure convergence have been found to help: these are all based on the principle that the objective function fTV_lf should not be allowed to increase from one iteration to the next. If the step based on Newton's method would cause an increase, it is not taken, but a step based on some sort of gradient meti-od is taken instead. The specific algorithm that was found to be most effective is a derivative based modification of Powell's (1970) dog-leg, which was suggested by John Dennis. Even with this method, Iwever, we have encountered models where G was not zero, yet H1@ was. This means the algorithm got stuck in a valley or rut, even though a minimum had not been found. The only way out would be to start again with a different initial guess."", 'A further problem for which we have no solution is that not all values of U are allowable. The admissibility condition given by Box and Jenkins (1970, pp. 5+ and 67) is rather messy to compute, so we do not attempt to verify athiissibility of the estimated U. As a consequence we may occasionally return ridiculous estimates. In general, as pointed out by Box and Jenkins, great care should be exercised when fitting this sort of model. Ã¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d 32 Ã¢â\x82¬â\x80\x9d Finally a few words on initial guesses. The following seemed to work reasonably well. 1) Fit f( ) by ordinary nonlinear least squares. Let r f( ). 2) Fit the Box-Jenkins model for P(p) only to r. Let these new residuals be r2. 3) Fit the Box-Jenkins model for T() only to r2. 14) Use the estimated , p, as initial values for the full model.', 'RERENCES Box, G.E. P. and Jenkins, G.M.
