These changes are important because hospitals do perform useful services,

but at a considerable cost —— a cost which has been growing rapidly.2

of caring for patients in short—term general hospitals averaged $81
in 1970, $92 in 1971 and $105 in 1972. The cost has almost doubled

The number of hospital admissions demanded in a year in a

(and hence a smaller number of admissions) may occur when hospitals
are very crowded.

The analysis of the supply of hospital admissions is based on

what appears to be excess capacity in hospital beds on the average
day of the year, so that it could provide some additional in—hospital

bed care during periods of high demand.1

'This assumes that "at capacity" the marginal cost of admissions
rises steeply. If the marginal cost of providing additional beds
and ancillary services did not rise with the quantity supplied in the

short run, there would be no economic demand for an "excess supply"
on the average day.

A useful measure of "excess capacity" in a community is its

average occupancy rate in a year. The average occupancy rate is
measured by the ratio of the number

A delayed (or denied) admission of a serious case is costly. More
excess capacity on the average reduces the likelihood of the demand for
beds exceeding the number of beds. However, constructing and maintaining

excess capacity are costly. Thus, there is some desired average occupancy rate

that is less than 100 percent. This is represented in

Figure I by a number of admissions equal to q1, which is less than q0.

that are admitted and thus decrease the admission rate and/or the average

length of stay. The variables that are hypothesized to enter into the
process of selecting the community's desired occupancy rate, given a
fixed supply of beds, form the framework for the analysis of the occupancy rate equation.

In summary, the short run includes a fixed supply of

Our long run analysis

relies on a two equation model: the admission

rate is a funétion of the bed rate, and the bed rate is a function of
the admission rate.

This study, therefore, focuses on three inter—related dependent

variables: the admission rate, the occupancy rate and the bed rate.

3. Summary of Finding
This study analyzes SMSA differences in the utilization of short—
•

term general hospitals by explicitly examining three dependent (endogenous)
•

variables: the occupancy rate, admission rate and bed rate.

Our analysis of SNSA differences in occupancy rates is based on

the randcnness of the demand for admissions. Since the demand for admissions fluctuates, the populace and hospital planners in an SMSA
•

are

concerned with maintaining an average occupancy rate sufficiently less
than 100 percent so as to have an optimal probability that someone
desiring an admission will be turned away because the hospitals are at

full capacity. It is estimated that under 1967 utilization levels the
demand
in
•

for beds in an SNSA

would exceed the supply of beds (on average)

only one week out of 12.8 years.

The empirical analysis strongly supports

the predictIons of

the

randomness model for occupancy rates. SMSA''s with higher admission

rates have higher occupancy

rates. More populous SMSAare

better able

to take advantage of their smaller relative fluctuations in demand for
admissions, and maintain a higher occupancy rate. When there are more

hospitals for the same number of beds (and hence the hospitals are smaller))

there is a lower occupancy rate. The larger number of hospitals reduces

the substitutability among hospital beds, because of a poorer "referral"
system between hospitals than within hospitals.
Higher occupancy rates could be obtained by reducing the barriers

between hospitals. These barriers iticlude the limited number of hospital affiliations had by most physicians, the required veteran status
for entry into federal hospitals,

the provision of charity hospitaliza—

whites on admissions may be due to the poorer level of health of nonwhites.

Roemer's Law that an increase in beds results in these beds being filled

with little change in the occupancy rate. It is, however, noteworthy
that a 10 percent increase in admissions increases the number of beds by

9 percent. Thus, the effect of admissions on beds is stronger than the
effect of beds on admissions.
Our model for the randomness of demand for admissions suggests
several other variables as relevant for an analysis of the demand for

hospital beds. Two of these variables, population size and the number
•of hospitals, have no significant effect empirically. Three other
variables, the proportion of beds in federal hospitals, the emergency
death rate and median family income, do have an effect.
Beds

in federal hospitals are found to be imperfect substitutes for

beds in the SNSA by approximately 40 beds.. The more important are
emergencies in an SMSA's case mix, the greater is the expected cost of
a delayed admission because of capacity utilization, and hence the

greater is the SHSA's demand for beds. The positive effect of income

on the bed rate (elasticity at the mean +0.12) is consistent with
the hypothesis that wealthier SMSA"s buy more excess capacity than
poorer SMSA"S through the construction of more beds.
•There is an interesting relation between the relative number of

nonwhites in the population and hospital utilization. SMSAOs

with

relatively more nonwhites have higher admission rates and a longer
average length of stay, but there is no compensating difference in the

CHAPTER II

The Theory

1. Introduction

This chapter presents the theoretical analysis by which we arrive at
the hypotheses and structural equations for the three dependent variables

examined in this study: the admission rate, the occupancy rate and the bed
rate. The equations should not be estimated by ordinary least squares (single

equation) techniques. In our short run model, the

occupancy rate is deter-

mined simultaneously with the admission rate since each affects the other. In
our long run model, the bed rate (beds per thousand population) and the
admission rate are mutually determined.

Part (2) of this chapter presents the development of the hospital

occupancy rate equation. A model based on th randomness of admissis suggests
that .the occupancy rate in an SMSA is related to the admission rate, popu-

lation size and number of hospitals. This forms the basis of the analysis of
occupancy rates,

and

proxy variables are entered in some of the analysis

to control for SMSA differences in length of stay.

The

admissions equation is developed in part (3). The

demand for admissions is assumed to be greater) the lower the price of an

admission, or the easier the non-price rationing by hospitals. Thus, hospital
and surgical insurance, the presence of physicians, the occupancy rate and

the number of hospital beds are shown to enter the admissions equation. Other
variables, mainly to hold constant demographic differences across SMSAs, are
included.

11-2

In

Part (4) the bed rate (beds per thousand population) equation is

presented. The equation is developed under the assumption that it represents
The model for the randomness of admissions

suggests that the admission rate, the demand for emergency care, the size of
the population and the number of hospitals are explanatory variables.

2. Hospital Occupancy Rates:'

'The

occupancy rate of a region is the total •number of patient days
in a period of time (e.g., a year) divided by the product of the average
number of beds and the number of days in the time period. Bed occupancy
rates can be greater than lOO7 if some beds (e.g., temporary beds in
passageways) are not counted in the bed census but their occupants are
counted in the total number of patient days.

A. Introduction:
The average

occupancy rate in short term general hospitals in an

area is neither constant nor purely random. It may be
determined by the economià and institutional characteristics of the community.

The purpose of this section is to develop a structure which will be used to
obtain hypotheses concerning regional differences in

occupancy rates.

The maintenance of a hospital bed and its auxiliary equipment and
personnel is costly. A bed is productive when it is occupied. •This does'

not mean, however, that average occupancy rates of less than 100
percent represent wasted resources. If there were a known constant number
of beds demanded each day for each hospital,

occupancy rates less than

100 percent would indeed represent wasted resources. However, since there are
fluctuating demands for hospital services,

the presence of "excess

capacity" on the average day is efficient. That is, up to a point, vacant
)

beds are a productive resource. The extent to which

occupandy rates do

11—3

in

fact respond to fluctuations in admissions is a major aspect of our

analysis of occupancy rates.'

'Other studies have used the randomness of admissions as a basis
for analyzing hospital occupancy rates. See, for example, Hyman Joseph
and Sherman Folland, "Uncertainty and Hospital Costs," Southern Economic
Journal, October 1972, pp. 367—73; William Shonick, "A Stochastic
Model for Occupancy Related Random Variables in General—Acute Hospitals,"
Journal of the Am*ican Statistical Association, December 1970, pp. 1474—1500;
M. Long and P. Feldstein, 'Economics of Hospital Systems: Peak
Loads and Regional Coordination," American Economic Review, May 1967,
pp. 119—129, and references therein. This study differs from the others
in terms of (1) the specification of the randomness model (including
the effects of population size and number of hospitals), (2) treating
the admissions variable as endogenous rather than exogenous, and (3)
the application of the model to regional differences in hospital utiliza—
tion rather than to hospital differences within an area.

B. Fluctuating Demands
The rate of admission (p) is the number of admissions in a time

period, N, divided by the size of the population (pop). That is, p= N/pop.
Either an individual is a hospital admission or he is not. Using the
binomial theorem, the variance across time periods in the number of hospital
admissions is Var (N) = (pop) p(l-p).

The number of patient days (PD) of hospital care in a time period is
the sum across patients of all of the lengths of stay (LS) within that time

period.&1' Itcan be thought of as the average length of stay (LS) multiplied

time period (N), the length of the time period CD) and the occupancy rate (OR),
{LS = (OR) (D) (J.]
by a simple identity we know the average length of stay.

In

this study length of stay is viewed as the redundant variable, andNthe
analysis focuses on the occupancy rate,the bed rate and the admission rate.
For simplicity of presentation of the randomness model, the average length
of stay is assumed constant across time periods.

Let us assume that the mean

and standard deviation of the number of

patient days that will be demanded in a time .period in a community
were known. If the demand for an admission by one individual were
independent

of that of others, the demand for patient days would be

normally distributed.2 Then, if

effect of an increase in the bed rate on admission and occupancy

is, patients fill the available supply of beds. (For example, see M.I.
Roemer and M. Sham, Hospital

another hospital, the number of hospitals would have no effect on the bed

beds among hospitals.

to both thebetter health of Tnigrants, and the greater attractiveness

not vary systematically over the year. Given an admission, however, climate
may affect the length of stay)-' It seems reasonable to hypothesize that,

the case mix is expected to be more heavily weighted toward more

serious cases in the SMSA with the lower mean January temperature. More
serious cases have longer average lengths of stay. Second, holding case
mix constant, patients are likely to be kept in the hospital longer, the less

amenable is the non-hospital environment to recuperation. Non-hospital care
is presumably less productive than hospital care for recuperative

purposes in a colder winter climate than in a warmer climate. Since longer
lengths of stay increase the occupancy rate, holding the admission and bed
rates constant, the partial effect of mean January temperature on occupancy
rates is hypothesized to be negative.

Summary

Table 11-1 contains the regression equation for the occupancy rate
analysis.

If hypotheses as to the sign of a variable have been presented

above, the sign is indicated.

All but one of the explanatory variables may be viewed in the short

run as being "caused" independently of the dependent variable, LN(OR). The
one exception is the admission rate (p). The admission, rate isjin part, a
function of the occupancy rate. At high levels of. hospital occupancy, the cost
to society of admitting a patient to fill a bed is the sum of the resources

consumed because the bed is occupied plus a measure of the cost because a
potential patient is denied access (or is granted delayed access) to a bed.

This latter cost component does not exist when occupancy rates are low. Thus,
we expect admissions to be more selective when occupancy rates are high}-'

Admission Rate
Economic, demographic and institutional variables are used in

this section to generate a model to explain SMSA differences in the
rate of admission to short term general hospitals.

(A) Hospital Occupancy Rate
Hospitals appear to be more selective in the cases they admit when

beds are scarce

than

when vacant beds are abundant. Medical

conditions for which delay in treatment or alternative treatments are
less costly are put •lower down on the admissions queue during periods

of high occupancy rates. To the extent that higher occupany rates
increase the delay before a desired admission can take place, alternative
sources of medical treatment (including spontaneous cures) or death may

reduce the total number of actual admissions. Alternative sources of
medical treatment include home care, specialized hospitals, nursing

homes, and hospitals outside of the SMSA. Thus, we expect anegative
partial effect of the occupancy rate on the admission rate.

(B) Bed Rate
An alternative hypothesis (Roemer's Law)

is

that communities maintain a constar

occupancy rate and admissions and length of stay are a function of the
number of beds in the SMSA.(1) To test a "beds effect" on admissions,

II — 16

the bed rate is entered as an explanatory variable.
It could be argued that a positive partial correlation between the
admission rate and the bed rate is not due to more beds causing more
admissions, but rather is due to a higher demand for admissions

causing more hospital beds to be constructed. This suggests that the bed
rate should be viewed as an endogenous variable (determined within the
model) not an exogenous variable (determined outside of the model) in our
analysis of hospital utilization.

In,the

short run the bed rate (Beds*)

-

is

viewed as

fixed, and the hospital admission rate and occupancy rate as interacting
simultaneously. In the' long run, the bed rate' is not fixed and the

three variables ——

p,

BEDS* and LnOR—-' are interdependent. As the number

of beds adjusts to long run conditions, the occupancy rate variable may

lose some of its variab!lity. In the next section a model is developed

for predicting the bed rate in an SMSA. The analysis of inter—SMSA
differences in admission rates is performed for both a short run model,
using predicted LnOR and observed BEDS* as explanatory, variables, and

a long run model, using predicted BEDS*.

II-7
(C) Hospital Insurance

It

is often argued that the effect of more extensive hospital and

surgical insurance coverage is to increase the amount of hospital care

and surgery demanded by patients and their physicians. The effect of
insurance is a change from a "fee for service" pricing system to an
annual lump sum payment independent of the amount of services to be

consumed and (usually) a smaller fee for service. By lowering the
direct cost tothe patient of an additional unit of medical services
the patient has an incentive to purchase more medical services than

otherwise. This may be done directly by the patient either through
requesting more services or by searching for a doctor who will prescribe

these services. The increased use of medical services may also occur
if the patient's doctor, seeing the lowered direct price to the patient,

suggests or provides more medical care. The additional medical care may

show up, in part, as a higher rate of hospital admission. Thus, a greater
hospital and surgical insurance coverage is expected to. be associated with

a higher rate of hospital admission.

(D) Physicians
The number of physicians per capita in an SMSA can be associated with

the utilization of their services in several ways. First, the greater the
relative number of physicians, holding the demand for their services constant,
the lower would be the cost, and consequently the greater the use of their

services.' Second, if we hold fixed the supply schedule of physicians
1The cost of physician's services include the direct price (fee),
the waiting room time, and the costs incurred due to a delay in
receiving care.

11—18

services, communities with a higher demand for health care have a larger

number of physicians per capita.2 Finally, it has been alleged that

2ThiS

suggests that the number of physicians.is an endogenous

variable. However, in this study the observed number of physicians is
used in the empirical analysis.

physicians create their own demand:
per capita, the greater

the larger the number Of physicians

the amount of medical care received

per capita because "consumer ignorance" results in patients placing a great
deal of faith in the physician's advice as to the amount and type of
medical care that should be purchased and physicians wish to "fill upt'
their day.

The effect on hospital admissions of an increase in the purchase of
medical care due to the presence of a larger number of
:

physicians

depends

on whether physicians' services are complementarywjth or substitutable

for hospital services. Surgeons' services are hospital using. It is
not clear a priori whether hospital services are substitutes or complements for the medical care provided by non—surgical out—of—hospital

physicians. Thus,

the number of surgeons per thousand

population(SURG*) should have a positive partial effect on

admission

rates, but the partial effect of non—surgical out—of—hospital physicians
per thousand population (GENMD*) is not clear.
It might be asked, "Does the effect of the presence of a larger
nuinler of physicians depend on the extent of hospital insurance coverage?"

11—19

This question is answered

by ihcluding two linear interaction

variables for hospital insurance and physicians per thousand population.1

'These variables are (a) (HI)(GENND*) and (b) (HI)(SURG*).

(E) Income
The variable median family income serves several inter—related

functions. First, income may be a proxy variable for health status.2

•

2There is evidence that income and good health are negatively

correlated among whites but positively correlated among norihites. See
Michael Grossman, The !)emand for Health

(BER,

Occasional Paper 119, 1972)

and Morris Silver, "An Econometric Analysis of Spatial Variations in
Mortality Rates by Age and Sex," V.R. Fuchs, ed., Essays in the Economics
of Health and Medical Care (NBER, 1972) pp. 161—227.

Second, it is not clear a priori whether, ceteris paribus, hospital
admissions increase or decrease with income, holding an initial Level

of health constant.3 Thus, no prediction is offered as to the effect

3For a given initial level of health, if preventive or early curative
care are less hospital using than cure at later stages, those with higher

incomes may have a lower admission rate. On the other hand, there may
be a positive income elasticity of demand for hospital using curative
medicine.

of median family income on the demand for admissions across SMSAs.

11—20

F. Climate
Hospital admission rates appear to be'seasonal; they tend to be
higher in the fall and winter than in the spring and summer.1 Thus, if

'For example, see Helen Hershfield Avnet, jsician Service Patterns
and Illness Rates (Group Health Insurance, Inc. 1967) Table 42, p. 110.

all other variables that influence hospital admissions were held constant,
communities wiLh more severe winters would tend to have higher

admission rates. Nean January temperature is used as a measure of the
severity, of the winter.

(G) The SNSA as a Nedical Center

.

The dependent variable, the admission rate,, is defined as the number
of admissions in the short term general hospitals located in the SMSA

in 1967 divided by the population of the SMSA in 1966. An admission rate
obtained in this manner is a biased estimate 'of the hospital admission

rate of the population of the SNSA. To obtain the populationt s admission
rate, the admissions of non—residents who used the SMSA"s hospitals

.

should be subtracted from the data, while the admissions of residents who
entered short term general hozpita1s outside of the SMSA should be
included in the data. Unfortunately, it is' not possible to make these
.

adjustments.

.

An alternative procedure is to obtain a proxy for the net in—migration
of patients. The net in—migration would be greater, the greater. the ex-

tent to which the SMSA serves as a health center. An SNSA is more likely
to serve as a health center if it has a medical school, and, if a medical

school exists, the larger its size. The number of medical school students

per hundred thousand population is entered for this purpose.'

'The variable is defined to be zero for SMSA s without medical
schools.

(II) Demographic Variables

The probability of a hospitalization in a year is related to the

person's age, sex and race. Thus, admission rates by SMSA will vary
with the age, sex and race composition of the population. Seven
variables are included to capture the effects of sex and age

differences.2 The live birth rate (LBR) is included to control for

hypothesized to have a positive effect on the admission rate

since nonwhites have a lower level of health than whites.
It would be desirable to hold constant a measure of the "healthi—

ness" of the SNSA's environment. The mean January temperature captures
some of this effect. Holding constant the median family income and the
sex, age, and race distributions of the SMSA, the health status of the

environment may be highly correlate4 with the mortality rate. The number

4. Bed Rates
A. Introduction
Although -—------- the number of hospital beds in an SMSA
on January 1 comes prior in time sequence to the number of admissions
in that year, this is not a sufficient reason for treating the bed rate

as exogenous (determined outside of the model). The number of hospital
future
expectations of/demandS
beds is a function of past demands and
for these beds, and there is a strong time series correlation in the

for hospital care. The larger the demand tor hospital care,

demand

the greater are the economic and political incentives for the government,
andreligious, other not—for—profit and for—profit organizations to increase
the

number of hospital beds. This section develops a theoretical model

to explain SMSA differences in the bed rate.

B.

Admission Rate and the Randomness Model

If we divide both sides of equation 11—15 by the
population (in terms

)

]

The mean predicted demand in our simplified

model is proportional to the admission rate and the length of stay.

II —25

The

"stochastic demand" is proportional to length of stay, inversely

proportional to the square root of the population size, proportional
to the square root of the number of hospitals, and positively

related to the admission rate (for p < .5).

We can test the effect of density on the substitutability of

hospital beds. If a greater density increases the substitutability
among hospital beds, an SHSA with a smaller land area (holding

constant population, admissions and number of hospitals) will have

a smaller bed rate.

C. Hospital

Administration

If beds under different administrative control (government, voluntary,
proprietary) were equally, good substitutes for each other, the fraction

of beds under a given administration should have no effect on the SMSA's

overall bed rate. However, if only veterans can use federal short—term
general hospitals, tfie addition of federal hospital beds has a smaller

and indirect effect on bed availability for non—veterans than for
veterans. This is expected to increase the number of beds (but by
less than the increase in fedral beds) and the proportion of beds in
federal hospitals. It seems reasonable to assume that state and local
government short—term general hospital beds are

good

substitutes for beds in voluntary hospitals. Although proprietary
hospitals charge higher fees than non—profit non—federal hospitals, there

are no other special barriers to patient entry. The proportion of
proprietary beds in the total bed census is so small)it is unlikely that
SMSA variations in proprietary hospital beds have a statistically

The parameter Z

the proportion of occurrences (a) for which, the demand for beds exceeds

the available supply. There are no direct measures of Z

postulate that it is a function of two variables, the relative importance
of emergencies in the SMSA's case mix and, median family income.

past (and perhaps also current) discrimination in the provision of hospital

services. In addition, since non—profit hospitals are financed to a
large extent by voluntary contributions from wealthy individuals and
foundations, discrimination by these sources against nonwhites implies
that SNSAs with a larger fraction of the population nonwhite have a smaller

bed rate. To test these hypotheses, a variable for the proportion of
noni.thites in the SMSA's population is added to the bed rate analysis.

11—28

F. Other Variables
ilbiding the admission rate and number of hospitals constant, SMSAs

which serve as medical education centers are likely to have a larger bed

rate. This can be due to both a longer average length of stay and a larger
Z

(to reduce the probability of rejecting an "interesting't case) in hospitals

affiliated with medical schools.

number of medical students per hundred thousand population (MST*C)
is used to capture the medical center effect on the bed rate.

The bed rate in an area is a function of the way its denominator,

population, changes. If hospital construction lags behind population
growth, the greater the increase in population, the smaller the bed rate.
If the community anticipates future demands on the basis of current

population growth rates, a positive partial relation would exist between

the bed rate and the rate of growth of population (%CHPOP). In terms of
equation (19), holding the admission rate constant, the population growth
rate effect would appear as short—rurL variations in Z-.

G. Summary
Table 11—3 presents a listing of the variables which enter the

bed rate analysis and the hypothesized effects of these variables. The
empirical analysts uses a predicted admission rate (rather than the
observed admission rate) since the admission rate and the bed rate are
simultaneously determined in the long run.

The findings confirm the predictions of the randomness model. There

size and maintain a higher occupancy rate. A larger number of hospitals
ciecre2ses the occupancy rate, presumably because of a poorer referral
:

system between than within hospitals. Cormunication does occur
across hospitals, as shcwn by the higher occupancy rate whenpopula—
tion siza and nuuiber of hospitals are increased proportionately.

Hoidng the admission rate constant, a higher bed rate implies

a lower occupancy rate (the elasticity is —0.2). Thus, an nerease
in beds is associated with both an increase in length of stay
(elasticity is +0.3.9) and a decrease in the occupancy rate. This
is only partial support for Roemerts law that when more beds are
available they tend to be
-

filled.

Longer lengths of stay explain the findings that occupancy rates

are higher in SNSAs in colder wintef climates and with a larger fraction
of the population nonwhite.

The empirical analysis
indicates that occupancy rates vary across SNSAs and that this
variation can be related systematically to the characteristics of
the SMSA.

'The data are f or 192 SMSAS.

See Appendix A.

The regression equation developed in Chapter II for explaining
SMSA differences in the hospital admission rate is estimated simultaneously

with the occupancy rate in our "short run" model (Table III—), and simul—
:

taneously with the bed rate in our "long run" model (Table iii—4)--".

ILz-/3

hospitals

(higher bed occupancy rate), for a fixed number of beds,

the more likely it is that accepting an admission precludes (or delays)
accepting another patient with a more "urgent" demand for hospital care.
As expected, the predicted natural.log of the occupancy rate

has a significant negative effect on the admission rate. A one percentage point increase in

occupancy rates, ceteris paribus, decreases

the admission rate by over four admissions per thousand .population per year):!

Thus, a one percentage point increase in the occupancy rate (OR = 0.01)',
in the neighborhood of the mean OR, results in a decrease in admissions
per thousand population by 4.44.

Holding the predicted occupancy rate constant, a larger bed rate (Beds*)

implies a larger absolute number of vacant beds per capita. A larger absolute

number of vcant beds per capita implies a lower probability that an admission
will preclude or delay the admissiun of a patient with a more serious illness.
The variable Beds* does indeed have the expected significant positive partial

effect on the admission rate (Table III—). An increase of one bed per
thousand population is associated with an 11.2 per thousand population

increase in the admission rate.'

'The

mean and standard deviation of bed rate are 5.22 and l.44,respectively.

A one bed per thousand increase represents nearly a 20 percent increase in the
stock of beds.

It is argued in Chapter II that it is not clear a priori whether more non—

cost of medical care is cheaper and more of all medical care is purchased) or
decreases the use of hospitals (since hospital care and

and the insurance—surgeon interaction variable has a significant

negative effect on the admission rate. The number of non—surgical M.D.s
has no effect on hospital admissions. The significant negative slope for
the insurance—surgeon interaction variable says that the effect on the
admission rate of an extra surgeon:per thousand population is smaller

the greater the amount of insurance. That is, the more insurance benefits
the SMSA receivcs the greater the amount of hospitalization; but this

-J'Recall from Part2 of this chapter that the elasticity of admissions
with respect to beds was 0.41 in the long run model.

The model of the randomness of demand for hospital admissions
predicts positive partial effects on tha bed rate of our measure of

population size,V , and pur measure of the number of hospitals,
In spite of the significance of these variables for explaining
SMSA differences in occupancy rates, they play no role in determinthg the
bed rate.

The randomness model of admissions also hypothesizes that the
number of beds in a community is a function of the probability that patients

will have to be granted a delayed or denied admission. The greater the
cost of a de1ayed'admissionthe greater the demand for beds, ceteris paribus.
The cost of a delayed admission is greater, the more important are

The three explanatory variables for administrative control
(the proportion of beds in federal, state and local, and proprietary
hospitals) would have insignificant effects on the bed rate if beds

in these hospitals were perfect substitutes for beds in voluntary hospitals. Explicit barriers to admission or imperfect referral systems would
result in positive effects. The effects are insignificant for state and
local and

proprietary hospitals,

but positive and highly significant for

federal hospitals. This presumably reflects the required veteran status

we reject the hypothesis that a bed in a federal hospital is a

perfect substitute for a bed in a non—federal hospital.
The proportion of nonwhites in the population has no effect on
the bed rate. Recall, however, that SMSAs with more nonwhites have higher

admission rates and occupancy rates. The higher occupancy rate in SMSAs with
more nonwhites (holding the admission rate and bed rate èonstant) appears

to be due to a longer length of stay of nonwhites. The two remaining
variables, the rate of growth of the population and the area of the SMSAJ
appear to play no role in explaining SMSA differences in the bed rate.

The empirical analysis indicates that the bed rate varies

systematically across SMSAs. The (predicted) hospital admission rate,
the importance of emergencies in the SMSA's case.mix and the proportion
•

of beds in federal hospitals are the most important variables and have

positive effects on the bed rate. SMSAs which are wealthier or serve
as medical centers tend to have larger bed rates, but these variables
are of lesser overall importance.
