Human

Capital Life Cycle of Earnings Models: A Specific Solution, and Estimation

By L. A. Lillard

Introduction and SIary
The purpos. of this chapter*is to consider bian capital models of

earnings behavior over an individual lifetimee A general class of life
cycle models relating to individual earnings behavior ii developed by
considering alternative formul*ticns of the basic Ben-Porath type model.

An explicit solution to a specific formulation within this general class

is considered in soe detail. An irica1. development of this explicit
earnings function is estimtd using data on a cohort of individuals sur-

veyed at several points during their lifetime. The empirical estimates are discussed in detail. The estimated earnings function is then used
to predict an individual's discounted present valum of lifetime earnings.
This essay is one of three to be included in a proposed NER volume entitled Economic Decision Mak1n, in a Life Cycle Context. The other two essays are written by James P. Smith and James Heckman. The volume is expected to be in draft form by Septenber 1973.

A General Class of Life Cycle Models Relating to Earnings Behavior Based on the Human Capital Concept

This

section provides a set of alternative specifications of life

cycle models relating to earnings behavior

based on the human capital

concept and couched in the calculus of variations optimization framework. The common element is that the models are concerned

with earnings behavior

over

the

life cyclö

and are logical extensions of

the basic Ben--Porath (1967)

model.

The various formulations differ in their emphasis and the particular

type of behavior question being studied. Some of the forms differ consi
derably in their qualitative predictions while others merely provide the ground for indicate

theoretical completeness. Some of the

The life cycle of earnings model is developed by assuming the individual invests in himself with the objective of maximizing lifetime utility
represented by an intertemporal utility function.

Specifications concerning homogeneity of direct inputs and loan market imperfections and subsidies within the separable case are qualitatively similar even though they may be important factors in individual decisions. That is, the former affect basic decision rules while the latter affect leva]s of state variables or nhanoe the completeness of the model while not changing the basic qualitative predictions.

The case presented in the original Ben-Porath (1967) model is that the

interest rates in both markets are equal. In this formulation the markets
are undistinguishable and need not be separable to allow the consumption

and investment decisions to be separable. Again utility is maximized by
selecting among the expanded permissible paths of I(a) and D(a) for those
which maximize the present value of net earnings discounted at the market

rate.' There exists of course many intermediate cases of imperfect loan
markets.

This basic model may be extinded by relaxing or altering the assumptions

about the utility function, the opportunity set, or the external constraints
faced by the individual. Different constructions may be used to concentrate

analysis on particular issues.
For example, a simpler and clearer presentation of investment behavior

and the resulting earnings function are permitted if analysis is restricted
to the cases in which investment and consumption decisions are separable.

This is the case when activities involving time (or leisure) and the stock of human capital do not enter the utility function. The lean markets for
consumption and investment are separable
and

the individual can borrow

and lend unlimited sums for the purpose of consumption at a constant rate

"Other possibilities include separable loan markets with differing rates. The optimal decision paths may be different but the same basic optimizing principles apply.

as discussed above. Many interesting extensions may be considered even

within this special case ·

The

nodel may be formulated to allow parameters

to vary with time in a known way. For example the rate of depreciation

of the capital stock may increase with age or the rental rate for human
capital R and the price of the aggregate input P may vary exogenously in a
known way. Secondly, these parameters may vary over time in an unknown way

or may simply be unknown to the individual but randomly attained from some

known distribution. For example, the end of working life N, the production
parameter, or the prices R and P may be uncertain. Models of decision-making

under uncertainty or risk can be developed to ascertain the effect of such
considerations.

The model may be extended to include an initial physical asset .ndov.est and a timed stream of payments or debts. The individual decision functions

would then include investments in physical assets. As long as the loan
markets for investment are separable from the loan markets for consumption

and a perfect loan market for consumption, is available, the optimal consumption

and investment decisions will be separable. The individual will maximise
the present value of the stream of income frám both physical and human

capital.2' The loan markets for physical and human capital may or may not

be separable but the existence of returns from physical capital to finance
human capital investment and vice-versa will effect the patterns of investment
and the resulting earnings. A timed stream of payments of debts may include

such things as anticipated gifts, inheritance, subsidies and doles. An

schooling, he may receive a percent subsidyon all human capital investments or on direct expenditures (excluding foregone earnings) through a reduced
P during fulitime schooling. These subsidies may or may not be accompanied

by a coimitment to pay a percent of earnings in the future (as in the Yale
plan).

A rather severe asstion is that human capital is homogeneous in

the sense that all units are perfect substitutes in the labor market both
between individuals and over units held

by an individual and thus rent at

the

same rate, R, per unit. Becker (l967.. p. 3) says:

birth or even before birth in the form of prenatal care during his mother' s
pregnancy. However, investment decisions are not made by the individual

himself during the early part of his life. The investment decisions made for him by his parents or guardian are surely influenced by parents' attitudes
toward education, income and financial position, number of other children

and dependents in the family, educational attainmeflt and health of the parents, and other socioeconomic va±iables. During some period the indi-

A

Particular Solution
of earnings

The particular specification of the general life cycle

model used depends
empirical

upon the questions to be studied, the degree of

complexity desired, and the

data available. The particular

specification

presented here was chosen because it allows analysis of

individual investment and earnings behavior while abstracting front con-

sumption and leisure considerations, is capable of being fully solved

analytically which illustrates the simultaneity of schooling and earnings while providing an exact functional form for earnings, and has a

fairly straightforward empirical interpretation. The solution presented in this paper is based upon the assumption
of separable loan markets allowing unlimited borrowing and lending at

a constant rate r for consumption but no loan market for human capital
investment
purposes. Direct educational expenditures must be purchased

with current market earnings. Neither the
activities

stock of human capital nor

involving time enter the utility function. Consumption and

investment decisions are separable and the individual acts to maximize the
present value of net earnings.

In the early period

the

individual specializes in the production

of new human

capital,

using all of his earning capacity for investment.

The period of specialization is

0

a a*

.

-- 15 --

where a* denotes the age at which the individual stops specializing and
begins investing only a fraction of his earning capacity. Specialization
ends when earning capacity ceases to be an effective constraint on

investment. One implication of assuming no loan market for educational
expenditures, and the only qualitative difference from the Ben--Porath perfect loan market case, is the prediction of positive labor force

participation during the period of specialization. The individual
supplies a constant fraction of his human capital to the market to finance expenditures for direct educational expenditures, i.e.,

RK(a)

P.D(a).

For the rest of the life cycle, after the period of specialization
ends, a* < a < N, the individual invests some fraction of his earning

capacity in producing more human capital. Neither foregone earnings nor
direct educational expenditures is a function of the initial stock of

human capital E0. Gross investment declines with age after the period of specialization reaching zero at the end of working life N. Earning
capacity, observed earnings, and net earnings at any age after a* depend

upon the stock of human capital and the investments at that age. The

equations underlying these statements are given in Appendix A. See
Figure 1 for a geometric representation.

The length of the period of specialization is endogenous to the
model. It is determined by the characteristics of the individual and the optimization criteria. The optimum age to stop specilaizing in
production and begin positive net earning is that point where the

investment paths of the two regions cross. That is, the individual
will invest according to the rule K(a) and D(a) for non--specialization

except when he is constrained by his earning capacity during which
period he will invest all of his earnings capacity. The solution f or

a* as a function of the parameters and initial endowment of human
capital, but not age, is contained in an expression which cannot in

general be solved in closed form for a*. This expression is presented
in Appendix A. The expression containing the solution for a* must be
considered simultaneously with either the observed or net earnings

function to make any inferences about earnings. The expression allows
inferences about the direction of effect of each characteristic on the

length of the period of specialization. The length of the specialization
period varies directly with N, R, and

and inversely with E, P, and r.

(3)

for a given vector of characteristics.12 The effects of characteristics
are in terms of their effect on these paths.

The Initial Stock of Human Capital

The effect of E is clearly to increase investment during the period
of specialization and thus raise potential earnings Y*(a), foregone

earnings R.K(a) and direct educational expenditures PD(a). Since the
investment paths after the period of specialization, a* < a < N, are not

a function of E, their paths are unchanged. The result is that desired
investment for a* < a < N intersects the maximum amount available, earning

capacity, at an earlier point and the individual ends his period of specialization sooner but he has a larger earning capacity when he does

end his specialization. His entire set of earnings functions are thus

raised over the entire life cycle. The net result is that an individual
with all other characteristics the same but a larger initial stock of human capital will have higher earnings over his lifetime and begin

getting them sooner (see Figure 2). The individual's human wealth is clearly increased by an increase in E.

period

of specialization investment the fixed maximum investment is

more productive and earning capacity rises more sharply than before

from E. Each type of investment increases correspondingly. After
the end of specialization investment is still more productive and an individual invests more in both foregone earnings and direct expenditures. The investment path shifts up but still must decline monotonically to
zero at A = N.

The increased productivity in the earlier period tends

to shorten the period of specialization while the increase in productivity

in the later period tends to lengthen the period, but, as was mentioned
earlier, the net effect is to lengthen the period of specialization.

Both effects raise the earning capacity of the individual. In the
period after specialization both earning capacity and investments are
increased and the net effect on observed earnings and net earnings is

less clear. Net earnings always begin from zero and with a larger

begin later and so must be lower for some initial period. After a
"catch--up" period, net earnings are larger for a larger .

A similar

statement is true for observed earnings. Therefore, the effect on
earnings of more efficient: production in this sense depends on the age

of the individual, but the effect is to increase earnings after some

"catch--up" period (see Figure 3). This "catch--up" period is very similar to the year of "overtaking" discussed by Mincer. Mincer describes this
as the time it takes for a trained person to overtake an untrained one

and speculates that it is rather short. This model supports this concept
but restricts it to comparisons of persons with all characteristics
except

the same. In this case a larger efficiency or ability parameter

explains both the length of training or specialization and the higher
earnings after the catch--up period.

Age

enters the earning function as an exponential function interacting

with all other characteristics to determine the "shape" of investment
and earnings
paths over the life cycle. The earnings functions are the

sum the exponential functions of age each weighted by functions of the

parameters. Whether earnings rise or fall as age increases depends on
which functions "dominate." Initially, earnings rise tnonotonically while
the positive terms dominate and then decline monotonically for a period
at the end of the working life. 13

Rate of Depreciation, Deterioration or Obsolescence

The rate of depreciation, deterioration or obsolescence of the stock of human capital affects investment ·in both periods. In the period

of specialization less human capital is available to invest since it

depreciates at the rate S. Earning capacity grows more slowly the higher the depreciation rate. After the period of specialization a
higher rate of depreciation continues to have a negative effect on both foregone earnings and educational expenditure investments which decline

to zero at some age and becomes a positive effect after that age. That
is, a higher depreciation rate makes an individual place more importance on earnings and less on investment early in his planning horizon and

more importance on investment later to keep earnings up. This might be
termed a "leveling" effect on investment since a high depreciation rate shifts investment from early to later periods in the life cycle.

13The existence of this decreasing portion is dependent upon the = values of the characteristics especially the depreciation rate. If the earnings functions rise monotonically over the entire life cycle.

-- 23 --

The Rate of Interest
Thç effect of the marketrate of interest is to reflect the value of net earnings depending on how soon or late they appear. The importance
of r is reflected iii the dbjective function, to maximize the present

value of net earnings over the life cycle. A higher rate of interest
more heavily discounts future earnings and thus lowers investment after
the period of specialization and shortens the period of specialization.

The Length of Working Life
Finally, the effect of the length of the working life or investment. period is to shift horizontally the entire investment curves P'D(a) and R'lC(a) left if N falls and right If N rises. Therefore, if the working life increases, both the length of the specialization period and investment after that period Increase since the individual has longer
to reap the benefits of his investments.

Factor Prices and Production Coefficients Consider the effect of the factor prices R, P and the production
coefficients

where R is also the rental rate of human capital.

there will be a substitution of foregone earnings for educational

expenditures. Overall investment will fall after the end of the
specialization period since the price of -a factor of production has

risen. If the rental rate and the price of human capital allocated to
production, R, goes up, there will be a shift of investment from foregone

earnings to educational expenditures. Both types of investment as well
as overall investment will rise over the entire life cycle 8iflce invest-

ment becomes more profitable. If both P and R are increased in proportion,
then relative amounts of inputs to investment will be unchanged but more of each type will be undertaken and thus total investment increased by

Empirical
The

Application Of The Model

purpose of this section is to present and interpret
to use the model to

an

empirical

approximation to the earnings function, to discuss empirical counterparts

to
and

theoretical entities and

study the effect of ability

schooling in determining the age-income profile. First, the model is interpreted in the context of a particular research problem and of data limitations. The data are discussed and model simplifications necessary
for estimation are made. The model is estimated and results presented.
The research areas to which the model is applied depends not only

upon the interests of the research but also upon available data. The
model requires observation of several points
earnings

along each individual's

profile for individuals with a wide range of parameters. Many

of the parameters are not directly observable and must be approximated

by variables available in the data set used. Other parameters must be
assumed constant over all individuals for estimation purposes.

An ara of research which is of current interest and to which the
model
applies particularly well is the study of the effect of ability

and schooling upon the age--earning profile. The IRSS--Eckland and NBER--
Thorndike samples contain information on ability measured by a test score,

years of schooling, earnings on Initial full--time job, earnings at the time
of the survey or surveys, recalled earnings for other years and in one case, estimated earnings ten years in the future.

Interpretation of the Mode]. for irical Purposes

The Efficiency Parameter as Ability

The meaning and effect of ability have been subjects of concern
for many years and by many authors.14 Definitions have ranged from the
power to do something and the natural equipment to accomplish some small

part of the meaner ambitions to such technical definitions as the

"height" of marginal rates of return schedules. Clearly ability takes

meaning only in the context of the task or objective to be p.rfod.
For the purpose of studying earnings fstctioe.a ability may be defined in

terms of producing earning capacity more or less efficiently.
A common use of the term ability is the ability to produce earnings. Does this mean observed earnings, net earnings or earning

capacity? Clearly observed and net earnings are directly affected by
current investment. One person may have more earning capacity than

another at the same age but lover observed and net earnings due to
larger investment. Even rankings by observed and net earnings may not

be the same due to different relative productivities of hwaan capita].

conception of ability is the rate at which an individual can or

at which an individual does accumulate earning capacity. The

E(a) the actual

rate of accumulation of human capital. The former concept is the rate
at which the individual could accumulate human capital if he used all

of his human resources to do so, i.e., specialized in production. Both
of these concepts depend upon the stock of human capital held in the

individual at the time ability is measured and the rate of accumulation

in either case is influenced by such factors as loan markets and sub-

sidies which should not influence a "pure" definition of ability.

factors as manual dexterity, general health, mental ability in several

dimensions such as logic, comprehension, and speed of thinking, and such

constraints as blindness.

If ability is interpreted as suggested above then it will be
influenced by early family decisions and environment to the mtent

that these determine the fixed factors of human capital production

represented in equation (4). Parents and society can influence the
efficiency with which an individual can produce human capital,15 and

this is correspondingly reflected in the effect of family and socioeconomic characteristics on measured ability. If these early decisions affect factors which are not later under the individuals influence by

decision they affect his ability. If they affect factors which become
the individuals decision functions later, PD or RXa, then their in-

fluence is reflected in the initial stock of human capital.
Initial Endowment as Early Family and Environmental Bac)çground

Early family and environmental background of the individual have

been a part of studies of earnings function but usually are a ccntrolR
in the form of dumey intercept variables or separate analysis entirely.
Some of the important factors in recent empirical works36 are race,

country, region of country, father's education, religion, and socioeconomic class. The objective is often to control for these factors

15These decisions can be considered as early as pre-natal care. This certainly has an effect on later physical and mental well. being.

in Specialization as Schooling
Time in full--time schoolinq or training has been the primary subject

of many authors. These models take the length of training as the basic
source of heterogeniety of labor incomes. The models are formulated in
terms of training periods which are completed before earnings begin and

apply therefore strictly to schooling rather than to all occupational
training. The length of time in schooling is the primary decision variable. When post-schooling investments are accounted for in the model,

they are taken as given in each period. In terms of the model presented
in this research, time in specialization in producing new human capital,

An Approximate The

Form Of the Earnings Function

earnings function must be put in a form which is amenable to

estimation. Since the earnings repOrted in the survey questionnaires
described in the next section correspond more closely to observed earn-

ings than net earnings only the observed earnings function will be
presented.

To reach an empirically viable form for the observed earnings func-

tion linear Taylor's series approximations for exponential functions of
age and schooling are used.17 Applying these approximations to the ob-

served earnings function results in the empirical form

The

pirica1 Specification
Several points should be noted on the relationship between empirical

quantities and theoretical entities. First, what earnings are we speaking
about? Earnings net of direct educational expenditures is the most obvious choice. Rowever, the earnings appropriate for empirica]. analysis

based on current data sets is observed earnings. We will concentrate on and study the estimating equation for observed earnings. Obviously any

present value or rate of return calculations *ust be considered as upper
bounds. Secondly, what are the appropriate tine units of measurement for earnings? Should we use hourly, daily, weekly, yearly earnings? Any of

the latter three units would meem propriat., the smaller the tins

To consider the implications for hourly earnings we need more in-

formation. An individual is predicted, after the period of specialization,
to invest a certain fraction of his human capital in producing more and

to use the rest for obtaining observed market earnings. There are two

situation is the one in which the wage rate is a measure of the stock of
human capital up to a scaler multiple R.

An alternative interpretation is that individuals work a standard

carry out their investment activity on-the--job. The individual carries

leaving the last year of full-time formal training. This definition does not allow calculation of the rate of return to completion of another year of schooling in the usual sense and has questionable interpretation since many individuals interrupted schooling to enter military service and received different subsidies before and after service. The results are not surprisingly different.

22This definition makes comparisons and predictions relating to the 1960 Census of Population possible. An alternative definition considered was that adjusted schooling is the age of the individual when

Since the omitted terms are obviously positively correlated with the included variables, to the extent that the variance in B is mnall, the estimated coefficients C. are biased upward. Also ignoring the interaction of ability with the included terms will make the variance of the calculated error term positively correlated with predicted income. For example, measured ability has the effect of increasing the rate of increase of earnings over the life cycle at any schooling level, thus causing the predicted variance of earnings to increase with the age class. If the effect of ability in this respect is not accounted for the larger variance will show up in the error variance.

points observed over the life cycle and supplementary data available.

Casider the effect on earnings of age, schooling,

their

interaction. The effect of schooling on the age--earnings

profile is illustrated in Figure 5 for the average ability individual. The profile for schooling level S0 is included for completeness, but it is a
pure extrapolation since all pers.ns in the sample were at least high school
graduates.

The initial earnings upon entering the labor force are scarcly

affected by schooling while the rate of increase in earnings is enhanced.
Individuals with more schooling initially have lower earnings than individuals who have less schooling but have been in the labor force longer. The

earning of the more schooled person rise faster to overtake the less schooled
-'The weighted estimates were attempted for both the Cubic and Quadratic age equations, but were not obtained because the weighted cross product matrix was to close to singular to be inverted accurately.

Even the Unweighted equations are highly collinear due to the correlations

CORR(A,A ) = .983, COIR(A,A3) .945, COORR(B,B2) =.986 , C0RR(B,B3) ='.951

beween the polynomial age and schooling terms, for example
CORR(A2,A'3)
,

=.989, CORR(S,S2) = .974, and CORR(B2,B3) =.989 . Weighted

estimated equations were obtained for lower degree polynomials in ability using the weight implied by the cubic age equation. Both weighted equations linear in ability and omitting ability entirely had larger calculated R2, .47 and .46 respectively, than the R2 for the unweighted equations cubic in age with R2 = .276 or quadratic in age with R2 = .270. However, these are weighted R2's. Comparisons based on the squared simple correlation between predicted and observed values, unweighted R2, indicates that the weighted

estimates are clearly poorer. p2 for the weighted equations linear in
ability and omitting ability ability are .240 and .247 respectively. Similar comparisons can be made for alternative estimating equations.

other is one suggested by Heckaan and Polachek (1972). Beckman and I'olactteck estimate ysuch the Y"Y is the appropriate dependent variable. They find that y is approximately .33. Equations with both in'! and Y33 as the dependent variables were estimated as linear functions of age, schooling,
and
the
ability and their interactions resulting in calculated R2 of .44 and .39 respectively. Since R2 in these cases represents the squared simple correlation between predicted and observed mY and Y.33 values respectively, they are not strictly comparable with the estimate based on linear Y. The resulting squared simple correlation between predicted and observed earnins are .260 and .256 respectively as compared with .269 for the corresponding estimate linear in Y.

alternatives are compared here, both involve simple transformation of dependent variable. One is the widely used log--linear earnings function

results can be couched in terms of experience rather than age

where experience is defined simply as years of work beyond schooling.-' Experience--earnings profiles for individuals of average ability are presented

in Figures 5c and d. Clear'y increased schooling enhances the effect of
experience even for a given ability level. Differences in earnings are even
more pronounced within experience groups than within age groups.
The effect of an additional year of schooling obviously depends on the
individuals

position in the life cycle. Whether expressed in terms of age

or experience. This is illustrated in terms of age for average individuals in Figure 6.a. Early in the life cycle, for example, schooling has little
or even a small negative effect

on earnings.V The earnings schooling relaover the life cycle increasing In

should be noted that the effect of additional schooling is con-

strained to be a smooth quadratic by the functional form. Previous empirical work indicates that highschool, college and graduate degree, graduates may earn slightly ure and the corresponding dropouts may earn slightly less than the
smooth prediction.

'This simple definition ignores the problem of schooling completed before military service and assunes that military service counts fully toward

experience. A much nre complete consideration of experience rather than age
for working women is attempted by Mincer and Polachek (1973).

consider the relationship between earnings and ability. The

effect of ability is less pronounced over the life cycle than that of schooling and depends on the level of schooling itself.
Figure 7
illustrates

the

effect

of ability on the age--earnings profile

for high school and college graduates. At high levels of schooling, college
graduates and above, ability increases earnings at every point in the observed life cycle, and its effect is to increase the rate of growth of earnings,
but

not the initial level of earnings. However, for levels of schooling

below the college graduate, there appears an initial period in which earnings

are actually lower for higher ability persons. The length and magnitude of
this period diminishes with increased schooling. The period seems to lower

earnings most for high ability people. After this initial period, ability increases the level of earnings and the rate of growth of earnings. This
finding is
schooling

consistent with the predictions of the udel, since for a given
predicted to invest more

level, higher ability persons are points in the life cycle while the absolute

difference in investment diminishes,

The
level

earnings ability relationship is very much dependent on

both the

of schooling and the level of expexience or age as illustrated in
8. The earnings--ability relationship for high school graduates is

Figures

negative at A = 10,

constant at A -- 20,

and positive in the range B >

.7

at

age A = 30.

The relationship is negative even

at

A

30 for very low

ability people
at A 10 and

as illustrated in Figure 8.a. For college graduates in

Figure 3.b, the earnings--ability relationship begin approximately constant

becomes increaseingly positive with age.
37/

By the Ph.D. and

professional level, S = 10

illuatrated,in Figure 8.c.,the relationship

is strongly and increasingly

positive at all ages.-- These

relation-

ships are illustrated in a slightly different way in Figures 8.d, e, and f with the earnings ability relationship for different levels of schooling
in the same figure.

Figures 9 illustratesthe comparison of age--earnings profiles when
ability

and schooling are positively and then negatively coirelated over

individuals. Since the two interact positlvely,all effects are exagerated
when the two are positively correlated,and are dampened when they
netatively correlated. A point to note is that
are

the age at

which the earn-

ings of the more schooled individual overtake the earnings of the less
schooled
individual is negatively related to the level of schooling,if

schooling and ability are positively correlated,and is positively related

to schooling,if schooling and ability are negatively correlated. Since
ability and schooling are usually observed to be positively correlated
(.24 in this sample).,the age of overtaking is less Important and the

interaction of ability and schooling is accentuated.

--'Again,

37'

the prediction at A 40 is unclear.

A

comparison of the cubic and quadratic age-earnings profile .sti--

mates

are

presented in Figure 10.

S

The

life cycle of earninps

model

as we have developed it, assumes
as

that the individual behaves in such a way of net

to maximize the present value

earnings, then maximizes an intertemporal utility function subject

to that human wealth constraint. Clearly we need to consider the human
wealth or present value of the observed earnings function we have estimaed. Clearly the present value of observed

earnings

represents an upper bound on

the present value of earnings net of direct

investment expenditures. The

present value and internal rate of return calculations presented here are
based on the quadratic rather than the cubic estimates of the earnings
function,since
the cubic estimates yield unreasonable predictions beyond 50 or chrono--

adjusted age 36.-'The end of working life is taken to be N
logic age sixty--six.

The resulting internal rates of return which equate
for a given schooling level with the present

the present value of earnings
value
is

of earnings for one year less schooling for various ability levels

presented in Table 8. The internal rate tends to rise to a peak then

fall off slowly as the schooling level increases at all levels of ability,
except
average ability where it rises continuously. The internal rate
of return appears to be a minimum at the average ability level at low levels
of schooling, below S

4, to rise monotonically with ability

in the middle schooling range, S = 4 to S --

6,

and to peak at the average

ability level at high levels of schooling. The internal rate of return to
a college degree over a highschool degree is 5,40 percent for those persons one--standard deviation below mean ability, 5.89 % at the mean, and 6.83

example of an unreasonable prediction is to predict negative earnings at the level of minus ten thousand dollars or more for all high schooling levels. The resulting rates of return are all quite negative. Estimates of rates of return and present values using the cubic equation

and assuming earniug presented in Appendix .

Even

though ability appears to have a sash effect on earnings rela-

present value of observed earnings is greater and positive over a wider

range of discount rates. This is largely due to the period of foregone
earnings with increased schooling.

RESULTS BASED ON ThE IRRSS-ECKLAND DATA

In Springl955, the Educational Testing Service conducted a survey

of

some 40,000 students in the nation's public schools called "A National

Study of High School Students and Their Plans." Sponsored by the National

Science Foundation, the main purpose of the survey was to access certain
aspects of the American Educational System related to the encouragement
and development
of human resources in the sciences. Aptitude tests and

questionnaires
two

were administered to a national representative sample of

cohorts

of students, comprising all the seniors in 516 schools and

the

sophomores in 97 schools, the latter representing roughly 0.5 percent of the tenth graders in public high schools listed in the U.S. Office of

Education's 1951--52 Biennial Survey.'
The aptitude test was and

constructed

to give equal weight to vocabulary

arithmetic

reasoning. The test consisted of 20 items chosen for

proven

validity and reliability in measuring these attributes.
In Spring 1970, the sophomores were sent a questionnaire entitled

"A Fifteen Year Follow--up Survey" by Bruce K. Eckland through the Institute

for Research in Social Sciences,2/ supported by the National Science

Foundation. Rather than trying to locate the entire group included in the
1955 study, a stratified sample of 42 schools was selected in order to
provide a proportionate representation of schools from all regions of the country, with variations in school size, social class composition, mean

test scores, and school

dropout rates. About 84

percent of the students

data from the original survey were reported in two ETS monographs (Stice at al., 1956 and Educational Testing Service, 1957).

in the sample eventually were found. Four mailings were administered between
Spring and Fall of 1970. Members of the final sample received a 36--page

questionnaire asking about their families, educational and career histories,
and
the events that had most affected their lives.

The basic sample used for this analysis contained 951 males who sophomores in 1955 of which

were

689 were included for analysis$-' Sophomores

were selected as the primary population because (according to Eckland) (a)

due to attrition between the 10th and 12th grades, they were more epre--
sentative of their total age cohort than were the seniors, and (b) after
an inventory of the 1955 ETS records,

the original answer sheets for the

sophomores were found

to

be more complete; and the data for them were im--

mediately available. All respondents were approximately fifteen years old
in 1955 and thus thirty years old in 1970. The survey questionnaire Included

information on 1969 earnings,' earnings for the first job after schooling
(before 1969), and an estimate or guess of what earnings will be in 1979. Therefore, either two or three points on the Individual earning profile

are observed. Estimates are made with the 1979 estimated earnings Included.
This income value is the response to "What

would

you guess

you personally
23.

will be

earning ten years from

now?"-'

The corresponding age is a

about his schooling or if the answer about his schooling was unreasonable. Unreasonable is interpreted as leaving school before 1955 when the first survey was taken or after 1969 when the questionnaire it-

questions

An observation was omitted If the respondent failed to answer

self was completed. A specific year observation for an Individual was omitted if the individual failed to report that year's income or had zero
income.

!±VA11 income data are mid--points of income classes used on the questionnaire. Class Intervals are length ($1,000 upto $20,000 and are $4,000 between $20,000 and $36000). For analysis these income figures are deflated by the published United States Consumer Price Index with base period 1957--59. Estimated income in 1979 is deflated by assuming a constant 4 percent, rate of increase in the Index from 1969 to 1979.
non--response rate for this question is 17.7 percent, double th 8.6 and 9.5 percent non--response rate of the other two income variables.

Ability
based

is defined as the aptitude test score obtained in 1955 trans--

formad to have mean one

and standard

deviation one--fourth. This test score,

on twenty items divided equally between vocabulary and arithmetic

reasoning,ls a fairly rough and general ability measure,and is much less

likely to represent the theoretical notion of production efficiency. The overall distribution of ability and the distribution of ability by schooling
class are presented in Table A.lO.
presented mean

The mean ability by schooling class is

in Table

A.ll. There does not appear to be any relation between

ability and

adjusted schooling as there was in the NBER--Thorndike

Adjusted schooling is defined as the number of years the individual
remained in school beyond 1956, when he would have been age sixteen. This
definition

is a little different from the "equivalent" years of schooling

used with the NBER--Thorndike sample. The distribution of adjusted years

of schooling is presented in Table A.12.
The earnings function is estimated from the IRSS--Eckland data using

Earnings are predicted to peak before adjusted age twenty--three and to decline

quadratically to large negative earnings toward the end of the life
cycle. The prediction that earnings peak between ages thirteen and twenty--

three

is ill founded,

since no observations are available in that interval$'

The most reasonable implication is that earnings rise more sharply early
in the life cycle and taper off before age twenty three.

The effect of schooling on the age earnings profile is illustrated in Figure
the

12 for the average ability indivdidual. Initial earnings upon entering

labor force are fairly constant,while more schooled individuals have
which

earnings

rise more rapidly. The effect of schooling is to increase

earnings

after some age of overtaking which increases with the level of

schooling. The level of earnings increases with schooling after the age of
overtaking, but at a decreasing rate so that adjacent

schooling profiles

are

progressively closer together at higher schooling levels.

Earnings--experience profiles are presented in Figure 13. The positive
effect of experience on earnings Increases with the level of schooling. Measured ability in this sample has a negative effect on earnings.

This is illustrated in Figures 14 for

individuals with adjusted years of
earnings.

but then appears to retard the rate of growth of

The predicted relationships and profiles resulting from the weighted
regression are almost identical. The weighted and unweighted profiles are
not distinguishable when plotted on the same

figure.

Since there are no observations in the interval 13 < A < 23 no contribution to error variance is accumulated there. The same basic negative effect of ability is found when the predicted earnings at age A -- 23 are omit-

ted and a linear age--earnings profile is obtained.
