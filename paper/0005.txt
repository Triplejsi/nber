Introduction

In the last two decades, economists have contributed major
insights that have enriched our understanding of the labor supply

decisions of individuals. The theoretical structure of the traditional
labor-leisure choice model was generalized in a seminal article by Gary

Becker,1

His household production model

permitted

one to enter time

in varying intensities in all the connnodities produced by individuals.

Jacob Mincer argued persuasively that an individual's decision
about the amount of hours to exchange for market dollars is often made

in a family context.2 Hence, the hours of work of any family member

depend

not only on his wage and other variables specific_to him, but

also on /imilar variables of other

members and

on those variables conunon

to the family unit. The household production model provides a useful
theoretical framework in which one may analyze family labor supply issues.

In this model, the family is viewed as if it were a small firm producing

its ultimate wants within the household. In order to satisfy these wants,
the family (firm) combines purchased market goods and services with the

time of various family members. This approach differs from the traditional treatment of the labor-leisure choice decision since the price of
activity now has two components -

the

goods price and the time price

of each family member. The relative empirical importance of the two
components depends, of course, on their respective shares in the cost of
producing an activity.

—2—

A

number of statistical studies have demonstrated that many

empirical regularities were consistent with an economic explanation
of the allocation of tinie.3 Yet, it was apparent that serious defi-

ciencies remained in the theory. In the one-period framework in which
the model is placed, the variables that determine the levels of market
participation are long-run or permanent measures of wage rates and

wealth. Since the reference period is some concept of life time, the
model is best suited to predict average lifetime participation rates.
But individuals are also confronted with temporal variations in wage
rates and other variables that could elicit timing responses about

the long-run levels desired. A complete model of labor supply should
incorporate the impact of this variation on the timing of market

responses. In recent papers, Ghez and Becker4 extended Becker's original
one period model to a lifetime context, and thus they were able to
place in sharp focus the previously neglected influence of cyclical,
seasonal, and life cycle movements in wage rates and other variables.
This paper builds on their work by treating explicitly the family context
in which these decisions are made and two related issues are investigated.

First, for each family member, how is the available life—time stock of
c

-

-

time

distributed over time between market and non—market activities

Secondly, within the family unit, what potential exists for substituting
—

the time of one member for that of another?

In

family

deciding

on

the

number of hours

each

member should supply, the

is actually confronted with two problems. Given the long run or

permanent values of family wealth and the wages of the individual members,

the family determines the lifetime levels of market time of each of

its members. In addition, since the family is faced with temporal

—3-.

variations in wages and other variables, a decision must be made

concerning the optimal timing of hours of the individual members. At
any moment in time, let the family combine market goods and time in
such a way that the cost of obtaining the desired bundle of conmiodities

is minimized. But the consuming unit also must allocate its consumption
over time in a manner consistent with its taste for commodities in
the future and the expected prices of the future commodities relative
to present prices. Combining this intertempora]. utility maximization
problem with that of the least cost combination of inputs of time and
goods to use in each period yields some interesting and testable
predictions concerning the market hours behavior of individual members
over time.5
Assume for simplicity that the intertemporal utility function of
a family that has an horizon of n periods (equal to its life span) is of
the CES variety, so that it may be written

____

where U is family utility, Z represents the level of consumption of
"commodities" in period t, the a is the time preferece parameter, and a

is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption. The Z's
are produced within the household by employing as resources purchased
market

goods (Xt) and the time inputs of the husband (Mt) and wife (Ft)

where f is homogeneous of degree one, and

is a technical parameter

that permits the efficiency of production to vary with age. The family
is faced with both time and money constraints that can be written

The time constraint (3a) indicates that the total amount of time
available to each family member (T, a given) in every period is absorbed

either in the household production process or in hours at work (Nt and
Nft). Equation (3b) states that the discounted value of money expenditures on goods is equal to discounted market earnings of both the

husband and wife and initial property wealth (A0). The two constraints
combine easily into one as follows:

it is independent of Z, and therefore is the marginal cost or shadow

price of Z.

Equations

(1), (2) and (4) constitute the complete structure of

the model. It is assumed that the family desires to maximize lifetime
utility (1) subject to the production function (2) and the wealth

constraint (4). This problem is easily solved with a two-stage opti-

mization procedure. First maximize utility (1) subject to the budget

restraint (4) with prices w taken as given. The result of this maximization is the demand function (or consumption function) for the basic

(t),

commodity at each age

(5)

as follows:

c1—%

where P is the lifetime "price index" of the basic commodity.
Solving

for the percentage change in consumption from one period

to the next, we have

Note that the full wealth term (RIP) droswhen we consider changes

in the levels of consumption over time. If individuals do not have
unbiased expectations about future earnings, then the level of full

wealth does not change. Therefore, with these assumptions, an individual's
full wealth will not affect the change in consumption from one period to
the next.

The second step in maximizing lifetime utility involves minimizing
the price

at each age t. At cost minimization, the following holds

Equations (8) and (9) indicate that the hours of work of each
family member, given the parameters of the utility and production function,

are determined by variations in the price of time of both members, the rate
of interest, and time preference,7 and any changes in the technology of
household production in the course of the aging process.

To illustrate: as the real wage of the wife increases over the life
cycle, the amount of her time spent in the household will decline for

two reasons. Because the price of one of the inputs is rising, the relative
price of future commodities has risen. The resulting decline in future

.

—7—

consunption will, on this "scale" effect, reduce the demand for wife's
home time. The magnitude of this effect (represented by SFOc) depends
on the possibilities for intertemporal substitution (i.e., the larger
the more elastic is the demand curve for commodities) and the share

in total costs of the wife's time. In addition to this intertemporal
substitution between commodities, there exists the possibility of substi-

in the production process. As Wft increases, the wife's time will be

substituted against by the other two inputs. This effect (SMOMF +
will also lead to a decline in the use of wife's time as her real wage

rises.8 It follows that in those periods when the real wage of the wife
is high, the model predicts, ceteris paribus, that her hours of market

work will also be high. Note that in contrast to the traditional one—
period labor-leisure choice, the sign of this effect is unambiguous. Since
full wealth is fixed in this analysis, there are no income effects. It
is, of course, the existence of income effects in the static theory which
gives rise to the possibility of a negatively sloped supply curve of hours.
As the real wage of the husband varies over his lifetime, the
effect on hours worked by his wife is again determined by the two avenues

of substitution. Increases in the price of his time will also raise the
price of future commodities and induce a fall in the use of all inputs

including the time of his wife. However, in the production process, the
relative price of wife's time is declining, and F per unit of output will

t

increase if the two time inputs are substitutes (c, > 0). Thus, the
behavior of hours of work of the wife is ambiguous with respect to the waqe

of the husband. If commodity substitution swamps substitution in production

her market hours will increase as her husband's real wage

rises. The roles of a positive interest rate and the degree of time
preference are the standard Fisherian ones. A positive interest rate

Life Cycle Patterns
Because the available data on the actual age patterns of market
work for married men and women was limited in its detail and quality, I
constructed

a new set of profiles from a subsample of the 1967 Survey of

Economic Opportunity.

These age profiles turned out to be quite

fasci-

nating and illustrate, in a way not possible with multivariate regression
techniques, the richness of the life cycle approach.

The subsample consisted of those black and white families with

both spouses present. It was further restricted to nan-farm families
whose husbands' age was between 18 and 65 inclusive. The husbands were
required to have worked at least one week in 1966

At each husband's age,

—9

arithmetic

means of the labor supply and wage variables were

calculated.

To smooth the data, three year moving averages of the means were taken.
In order to observe racial and educational differences, the total sample
was stratified by race and into three education classes of the husband.
The education groups were elementary grades 1—8; high school grades 9-12;
and college grades 13 or higher.

Since these profiles are derived from cross-sectional data, we are
not, as we move along any profile, following a single cohort through its

life
one

cycle experience. Each

observation

/

represents a separate cohort at

point in its life cycle path. The entire profile captures both movements

along life cycle paths and across profiles of different cohorts. If the
between cohort effects are important, these profiles should be adjusted
before

one has

a "pure" life cycle profile. The large secular increases in

labor force participation rates for married women suggest

that, for this

group

at least, the across cohort changes are not negligible.9 Since these

rates

have incrased over time, an adjusted profile for those of cohort

age 19 in 1967 would be above the profiles presented here. This qualification should be kept in mind in the discussion that

follows.

In Appendix

C, these profiles obtained from 1967 SEO data are compared to ones obtained
from the 1960 U.S. Census.

Table 1 lists the average lifetime market participation levels of
married men and women in different education and racial groups. Not

surprisingly,

market participation of married white women is well below

that of married white men. This difference is reflected in all dimensions

of market work. In an average year, over 40 percent of white women specialize
exclusively in activities that occur in the non-market sector. Those women

who are participants work fewer weeks in any year, and a smaller number

of hours in any week. The spread in male/female market productivity--as
measured by hourly wage rates of $3.44 and $2.16——no doubt accounts for

much of the gap in market hours per year. After the schooling period,
annual market hours quite clearly increase as we move toward the more

educated white classes. This rise in annual hours takes place in both
dimensions of labor supply——weeks worked and hours per week—-a phenomenon
readily explained in the one—period model by the rising level of male

market wages by education class. Within every education class, men spend
approximately four times as many hours in the market sector as women do.

Relative to their wives, men's lifetime market participation and hourly
wage both increase as we move up the education scale.

The lifetime levels of market participation are, in all dimensions,

lower for black males than for white males. These lower levels are
paralled by a smaller hourly return for black males from market activity.

In fact, the intrafamily wage structure differs by race. Relative male/female
wages are lower in blaek families, offering them market incentives to be

less wife—time—intensive in home work. Black women indeed perform more
market work, both absolutely and relative to their husbands, than white

women. Racial comparisons for women must be made carefully, for the
magnitude of the differences by race depends critically on the dimension of

labor supply used. Most studies of female labor supply have compared racial
groups by their weekly labor force participation rates. These rates are
50 percent higher for black women, but this grossly overstates the true

racial differences. Although a smaller fraction of white women than black

— 12 —

women are labor

force

members, those white women

in

the labor force

work more hours per year than black women participants. Therefore, when
measures of working time include zero valñes for non—workers, black

women work less than 20 percent (100 hours) a year more than white won.

More intriguing than the levels are the fluctuations between different
stages of the life cycle. Life cycle variations in market work of married

white males are illustrated in Fig. la. The

overall

pattern of annual

working hours with its inverted U shape conforms quite well to implications
derived from

with

the

life cycle model.

10

The age profile of wage rates combined

a positive interest rate renders intelligible both the

inverted

U

shape and the peaking aspects of these graphs of hours worked. Since wages
are relatively low for the younger cohorts, they have an incentive to

concentrate their time in non—market pursuits. A positive interest rate is
consistent with the falling hours during the older ages and the peaking
)

of

hours before wage rates.

The resulting lower discounted prices of

future consumption increase the derived demand

for

home time at the older

ages. A positive interest rate also implies that discounted commodity
prices will decline before real wage rates and that annual working hours

will lead wages in their respective peaks)2 Since the peak in hours precedes
that in hourly wages, earnings will decline before hourly wage rates.13

Wages begin to fall in the late fifties (Fig. ib), while earnings profiles

are known to peak in the late forties or early fifties. Although the
existing literature has emphasized such factors as human physical depreciation with age, i.e., deterioration in health or disinvestments in human
capital, apparently a substantial fraction of the decline in earnings for
older people is due to individuals optimally allocating their time towards
home activities.14

The profiles generated for black males add additional support to
the life cycle model. Their annual hours prOfile (Fig. 5a) also has the
inverted U form--the expected shape in view of the age variation in

their hourly wages and positive interest rates. Hours

worked peak at a

younger age, which reflects in our model the earlier maximum

value

of

black hourly wages (Fig. 5b). The latter fact implies that, compared to
white males, commodity prices achieve their extreme values at a younger
age for Negroes, which in turn leads to the confirmed prediction on the

earlier peaking of their market time. Compared to white males, both the
working time and wage profiles are somewhat

flatter

for blacks. In the

life cycle model, the degree of curvature in the hours profile is directly
related to the amount

of

curvature in the wage profile.

Interpretation of the differences among male white education groups
is more difficult because of fluctuations evidently caused by the smaller

cell sizes for these groups)5 Still, the age pattern of male annual
hours within each education class (Fig. 2c) is on the whole similar to
that of the complete white sample although the presence of an initial period

of rising hours in the elementary profile is questionable. The small cell
sizes make the pre-thirty-year-old section of the elementary profile so

erratic that no clear trend is discernible. The tendency for the annual
hours profiles to flatten oUt for the less educated groups is consistent

with the flattening of the wage profiles. Because wages peak later for the
more educated (Fig. 2a), the empirical finding that annual

market

hours

peak at an older age the more educated the group also is a confirmation of
one implication of the life cycle model.
Economists have used a number of operational definitions of women's
labor supply, weeks worked, weekly or annual hours of working women, and

weekly labor-force-participation rates. In recent papers, Reuben Gronau
and H. Gregg Lewis16 have argued that, from a theoretical perspective,
these supply definitions should not be viewed as alternative empirical

measures of an identical theoretical concept. The hours profiles of
married white women are a strong empirical confirmation to their argntent.

It is clear in Fig. 3 that any single definitiOn if considered in isolation
from

the

others, would yield a misleading description of the life cycle

pattern of female labor supply. The best single descriptive statistic
combines the labor-force-participation dimension with the annual working

hours of working wives. Average time at home (Fig. lc) at any age is defined
to be a weighted average of the time

spent

at home of working and non-

working women with the weights being the fraction of women working and not

working)7 At the beginning of the cycle, average market hours of all
married white women (Fig. lc) are relatively high with a substantial
fraction of women working at some time during the year (Fig. 3d), but on
an irregular and short term basis as indicated by the low number of weeks

worked (Fig. 3a). Then time at home increases continuously into the
middle thirties as many white women leave the labor force completely. This
incrase in home time is mainly a consequence of the declining weekly and

yearly labor-force-participation rates. The small increase in hours worked
of working women could be either a true increase in the work year of the
remaining labor force members or merely a compositional effect resulting
from the labor market withdrawal of women whose working time was well

below the average. Following the home time peak in the thirties, these
women spend an increasing amount of their time in the market sector until

age fifty. This expansion in market activity appears in all four supply

One should recognize, however, that many aspects of the women's
profiles are also consistent with life—cycle variations in the relative

wages of the marriage partners. Compared to their husbands, white
female hourly wages are relatively age invariant (Fig. id) and also peak

at an earlier age. One prediction of human capital theory is that wage
profiles will rise more rapidly and peak later, the greater the amount

a worker invests in himself)9 Because of the smaller fraction of future
time they will spend in the market, women have less incentive to invest

in market forms of human capital. The profile of the relative wage of
husbands to wives (Fig. lf) has a concave shape with the largest increases

in male relative wages occurring at the youngest ages.2° Relative to
his

wife, both a husband's wage and market time are lowest at the youngest

ages.

The

most rapid increases in his relative market time (Fig. le)

before the mid—thirties occur simultaneously with the sharpest increases in

his relative wages. Therefore, these profiles are not in
a

model allowing inter-family substitution of

conflict with

time as the value of time

of one of the members changes. Of course, the movement in relative wages
and the family formation

process jointly contribute to the observed allo-

If white wives are classified by their husband's education level
(Fig. 4), the principal differences are the following: (1) before age thirty,

wives' non-market hours are negatively related to their husbands' educational attainment; (2) between age thirty and fifty, women in the college
group engage in home activities to a much greater extent than women in either
of the other two groups; (3) after age thirty, the difference in levels
between the college group and the other two is much larger than the difference

between high school and elementary groups; (4) the peak level of home
time occurs at an older age, the more educated the group; and (5) there
is a tendency for women's hours profiles (particularly in relative terms
(Fig. 4b)) to flatten out, the lower the education level of the husband.

All five dissimilarities are consistent with differences among
education groups in age—related variations within family units in market

and non-market productivities. The positive correlation at the youngest
ages between female market participation and educational attainment
presumably results from the larger expected levels of relative male wages

in future periods for the more educated. This supplies the more educated
women with incentives to concentrate their market activity at those ages
in which the husbands' comparative advantage in market activities is not

as strong. The more rapid withdrawal of educated women from the market
sector into the mid—thirties coincides with a steeply rising relative male

wage.21 Between ages thirty and fifty, relative male wages and market
hours increases with education level, and the largest differences in both
relative hours and relative wages is between the high school and college

groups. The peak levels of both female relative home time and male relative
wage are achieved at an older age the more educated the group.22 Finally,
as predicted by the model, corresponding to less curvature in the relative
wage profiles for the less educated is the decline in the curvature of
the relative hours profiles.

Note that for all whites and for each education subsample, variations
in relative market productivities of spouses become less important as

the family unit ages. The profiles of relative husband/wife market time
begin increasingly to mirror life cycle movements in the relative non-market

productivities of spouses. The decline in relative male market time

— 21 —

between ages thirty and fifty is caused by changes in female non-market

productivity

S

flowing from the declining fraction of women with young

children at home. After age fifty, this variation in non-market produc-

tivity is also less important as children leave home. The lack of
variation in either relative market or non—market productivity is matched
by a generally constant relative hours profile during this period.
The profiles for black married women (Fig. Sc) are more similar to
the observed male profiles than they are to those of white females.23
Both

black

married men and women have inverted U shaped market hours

profiles. This translates into a very erratic black husband—wife relative
hours profile (Fig. Se) with no clear trend discernible. The sharpest
contrast between the hours behavior of black and white married females

occurs before age thirty-five. During this period, black women are specializing more in market pursuits while their white female counterparts are
approaching their peak level of home participation.
A number of factors could account for this striking difference betwee

white and black married women. The relative male/female wage structure
for blacks exhibits less variation over the cycle (Fig. Sf) than that of

whites. This would imply that the relative hours variation for blacks should
also be smaller. The patterns of child spacing and timing also offers a
partial explanation for the hours behavior of black women. Black women do
not generally concentrate their childbearing in a relatively short time

interval. Because of this, they have less incentive to respond to the
presence of young children by lowering their market participation. Another
factor is the higher rates of marital instability facing black women. This

increases the cost of complete home specialization for blacks. Finally,
the black wage profiles might be dominated by secular increases in black

wage levels. The observed decline in black female wages with age (Fig. 5f)
is surely not a life cycle phenomenon but an indication of the improving

status of the younger cohorts. In the empirical sections that follow, the
evidence on these hypotheses is investigated.

Empirical

Tests

The ideal data to use to test a life cycle theory would be

observations on the same individuals over a number of years. But the
absence of extensive panel data forces a researcher to attempt to

simulate it with the more available cross sectional surveys. Fortunately,
Ghez

24

has developed techniques that, under appropriate assumptions,

enable one to use cross sectional information. First, the sample is
stratified by the age of the husband. Within every age group, mean values
of all variables are calculated. In the absence of secular growth, the
observed variation between these age cells will correspond to the expected
life cycle variation for any cohort if a cohort's expectations are unbiased

on average.25 Using equations (8) and (9) and aggregating over all
families at each age Ct) of husbands, we have, neglecting changes in home

be negative, since increasing the price of a factor induces two substitution effects both lowering the amount

of

time at home. No a priori

predictions can be made on the signs of C2 and d2 because altering the
wage of one spouse produces conflicting incentives for the use of time

of the other spouse. c3 and d3 are the age coefficients that capture
the interplay of interest rates and time preference. If families have
neutral time preferences and face positive interest rates,

03 and d3

will be positive.

In this empirical strategy, one is implicitly assuming that families
at age j in 1967 would in i years be in a situation identical to families
of age i +

j

in 1967. Yet, we know that real wages have grown over time

so that younger cohorts have a higher expected real wealth. As long as
real wages grow at a constant rate secularly, the estimated wage coeff i—

dent will be unbiased, but the age coefficient will be a biased estimate
of the interest rate effect.27 Intuitively, if real wealth grows at a
constant rate over time, wealth becomes perfectly negatively correlated

with age and all wealth effects are picked up in the age variable.

The empirical results are based on the subsample of the 1967 SEO

described above. Although all the variables used are listed and defined in
Table

1

,

a few deserve additional comments. Hours spent in home

production is a difficult variable to measure precisely. One simple solution
for husbands is to treat all non-working hours as time spent at home. This
approach uses CI-JR1M which is simply the difference between total number

of hours per year (8760) and the number of working hours. This method has
several shortcomings since many non-working hours are spent neither producing

— 26 —

nor

consuming but in investments in Human Capital, both through formal

schooling and on-the-job investments, in job search and in poor health.
Moreover, we know that the number of hours engaged in these activities
varies considerably with age (i.e., investments generally occur at the

youngest ages while sick days are more numerous for the elderly). To
reduce the biases caused by time spent at school, regressions were run
including persons in each schooling class who are at least several years

older than those typically completing that class. Thus the college
sample was run over the age intervals 26—64 and the elementary sample for

ages 18-64. The SEO allowed me to obtain a measure of the time spent
looking for work and a crude measure of annual hours ill.28 The second
definition of male home time subtracted from total yearly hours, the time
spent working, looking for work and ill.

Defining home time for married women

is

even more difficult. It

would be misleading to consider only the behavior of participating women
for this ignores completely the home specialization of non-workers.
Therefore, all women were divided into three categories: (1) women who did
not work at all; (2) women who worked both in the survey week and the
previous year; and (3) women who worked during the previous year but not

in the survey week. Average home time for women (CHR1F) was then defined
as a weighted average of the home time of women in each category with the

weights being the proportion of women in each category.29 The second
definition of female home time (CHR2F) excluded from home time time working,
looking for work, and time ill.

To reduce the effect of measurement error, three year moving
averages of all variables were calculated. Since the number of observations in an age cell, varied with age, heteroscedasticity in the error

term was expected. The conventional remedy was applied by weighting
each observation (age cell) by its cell size.3°

For both the white and black male samples, the own wage elasticity

(male hourly wages) has the predicted negative sign. The persistence
of this finding is encouraging for this wage coefficient is likely to be

strongly biased towards positive values. Hourly wages are computed by
dividing weekly wages by hours worked last week. Thus any positive errors
present in hours will reappear as negative ones in hourly wages introducing
a spurious positive correlation between home time and hourly wage rates.
Secondly, true wage rates are underestimated at the younger ages because

of self-financing of on-the-job—training. Time spend in job training
activities is expected to decline with age so that this source of bias will

be a declining function of age. Therefore, the observed wage variation
with age exceeds the true one biasing the wage elasticities in Table 2

towards zero values. Using the male survey week weekly wage in place of
male hourly wages provides some control over the measurement error biases
since the weekly wages and home time are separate questions in the SEO

survey.

As expected, the coefficient on the male weekly wage variable is

more negative than male hourly wages. The extent of the bias present with
the

computed hourly wage should be negatively related to the average number

of observations in each age cell. Apparently, this was the case for the
difference in magnitude of the weekly and hourly wage coefficients were
larger in those samples with the smaller cell sizes——the black and education

— 29

specific

—

white samples. In all five samples of Table 2, the sizes of

the male weekly wage coefficients was similar and all had the predicted
negative sign.

An additional test of the errors in variables problem was performed.
A second weekly wage measure was available from the SEO by dividing last

year's earnings by last year's weeks worked. With the weekly wage variable
in the text, the dependent hours variable and independent wage variable
are

constructed

independently of each other. This is not true for this

second weekly wage definition so that regressions with this wage variable
still contain the spurious negative correlation between market time and

wages. If one compares the coefficients of the two weekly wage variables,
one would expect based on the errors in variables problem, that the
coefficient for the second weekly wage is less negative than those reported

in the text. Also the difference between with the two wages should be
negatively related to the average cell size. Both these propositions were
supported when the second weekly wage concept was used.
I anticipated difficulty in estimating an independent effect for

female wages. First, the true life cycle variation in female wages is
small compared to that of male wages so that it should play a smaller role

is explaining the timing of market participation of family members. Secondly,
during any week approximately sixty percent of married women are not

working. Therefore, each mean female wage is based on fewer observations
than the mean male wage, and on this account, the mean female wage is
probably a less reliable statistic describing the true wage of working

individuals. The third problem is that the value of time (shadow home wage)
of non—working women is not necessarily equal to the observed wage of

rkers.

which

are not working, the observed wage distribution

represents only one section of the total wage offer distribution.1 The
unobserved section of the wage offer distribution has been rejected by
job

seekers as unacceptable. As Gronau also demonstrates, the observed

wage may change without any

to

alterations

in the wages offered by firms

due

what he calls a selectivity bias. For example, in time periods when

young children are present, the implicit home wage increases and many women

will leave the labor force. Indeed, it is only the women receiving the
highest wage offers in the distribution who will remain in the labor force.
Only part of the observed life cycle variation in female wages reflects

a real change in their market opportunities. In spite of these considerations, the female own wage effect in the female equations (Table 3) is

consistent with the model. When female weekly wages are used, the coefficient is negative and significant in all but the high school sample. As
expected, a less significant and smaller negative effect is obtained with

female hourly wages. Thus, the negative sign of the own wage coefficient
in

both the male and female regressions support the predictions of the

model. Nevertheless, because of the biases mentioned above, a little
skepticism is in order for the female wage even though the estimated sign
is

"correct".

As long as the time inputs of spouses are sufficiently
substitutes,2 the sign of

the cross substitution wage

term will be positive.

In almost every male sample, an increase in the female wage increased the
amount of male home time although this effect is not always significant.
Also, the male wage has a positive sign in the all white, high school white

and college white female home time regressions. The only troublesome
results are the negative signs of male wages in the white elementary and

black female regressions. Some idea of the extent of substi-

When this number is positive, market goods

better substitute for male time than they are for female time. For

the total white sample, this appears to be the case. In the education
specific samples, goods are a better substitute for male home time than

for female time only in the college and high school samples. In the all
black and elementary white sample, this relation switches and goods appear
to substitute more easily against female time.

One test of consistency suggested by consumer demand theory is that

Theoret-

ically, one cannot predict the effect of excluding time looking for work on

the home time wage elasticity. On one hand, this elasticity evaluated at
any wage will be greater (in absolute value) since mean home hours are

lower. But the slope component of the elasticity expression (aM/aW) should

— 34 —

decline

so that the net impact of excluding search time depends on

which effect is stronger.3 Although the results do not differ substantially from those with the first definition of home time,34 there is a
tendency for the own wage elasticity to decline for all male groups
suggesting that the demand curve slopes have decreased sufficiently to

offset the lower mean home hours.35 The other definition of home time,
LCHR2, subtracted

generally

the effect of reducing the observed wage elasticities so that any

negative relation between wages and ill time was not strong enough to offset
the reduction in mean home hours.

The age variable gave the least satisfactory results. If a family
faced a positive interest rate, home time of both men and women was predicted

to be positively correlated with age. When home time includes all nor
working hours, the only male sample in which age has a significant positive

sign is the elementary. The age variable is positive in most of the

the strong positive correlation of sick time with age.37 When the

definition of home time is used which excludes time searching for work
and time ill (CHR2), the positive age effect in the elementary male and

white female samples is eliminated. In fact, a significant negative sign
appears in the all white male and black female samples.

The low values of the Durbin-Watson statistics indicate that positive

serial correlation exists in these regressions. Since each observation
is a three—year moving average, errors tend to perpetuate themselves and

autocorrelated residuals were expected8 In this situation, OLS will not

generate

biased coefficients, but the calculated standard errors are too

low. In evaluating the t values, a degree of caution is in order.
The serial correlation that plagued the male regressions is present

in the female ones as well. The use of three—year moving averages is
not sufficient to explain all the autocorrelation. Female home time is

shows that it is also a factor in white male supply functions--having
the opposite effect of increasing male working hours. One hypothesis

consistent with this evidence is that children and those comeodities comple-

mentary to children are less husband time intensive than a vector of all
other home produced goods. When young children are present, the structure

of household consumption is altered in favor of the former set of comeo-

dities enabling husbands to work additional hours. Another plausible
rationale is that units of time typically produce many household coimnodities

jointly. As the wife leaves the market to care for children, her time will
simultaneously be employed in other home activities as well thus freeing
some of her husband's time for market work.
tn every white sample, female home time increases when young children

are present. Since the abeolute size of the coefficient of I(USV is
greater for wives than husbands, both the percentage and absolute number
of female hours withdrawn from the market exceeds the percentage and

absolute increase in market hours of their husbands.

Evaluated at the

mean levels, an increase in one young child less than seven would lead
to a net reduction of approximately $263 in family earnings.40 The number

of young children has no significant effect on the working time of black

wives or husbands. Indeed, this lack of response to the presence of
children is a mjor behavioral difference between the two racial groups.

My work does offer two explanations--the racial.

of child spacing and timing and the higher rates of marital

instability among blacks. According to Table 4, the fraction of the life

cycle

when young children are present is longer for blacks

than for whites.

Because the childbearing period is less concentrated for blacks,
there is less incentive for black women to time their market participation

at those ages when young children are not present. With a higher expected
probability of a dissolution of the marriage partnership, each black spouse
should avoid being too specialized in either the market or non-market

sectors. The costs in terms of lost job seniority and the depreciation in
market skills of leaving the market sector for even a short period decreases
with the expected duration

much of the racial differences in the female hours behavior is

is a substantial decline in the white female participation rates. Black

market hours were overestimated in the age intervals twenty—eight to
forty—one and fifty—five to sixty—five while positive residuals were

present in the supply equations during the other ages. The extent of the
labor market response of married women could depend on their children's
ages and sex, and on their aspirations for educating their children

(child quality). Also the interaction of these characteristics among

siblings, including the spacing of children, might be important. To
separate some of these factors, I defined a group of variables measuring
the fraction of women at each age with children present in a set of
mutually exclusive child age categories.
In Table 5 which suimnarizes the results obtained with these variables,

it is evident that the allocation of female time varies considerably with

the ages of her children. Since young, pre—school children are notoriously
high denianders of their mother's time, it is not surprising that in almost

all samples4l an increase in the fraction of families with only pre—school

children reduces the working hours of wives. An interesting interaction
occurs when the pre—school children have siblings who are all over thirteen.
The amount of market work performed by mothers in such families either
differs little from the annual hours worked of childless wives, or as is

the case for black wives, the mothers actually work more. It appears
that the tendency to withdraw market hours when young children are present
is offset to some degree by substituting the time of older children in
some child—care activities.

But the most interesting finding is the positive effect on female
market time of children six to thirteen or children older than thirteen.
The common denominator of most economic models of fertility is that children
are assumed to be relatively wife time intensive conunodities. Yet, this

supply evidence indicates that the factor intensity of children might

well switch as a child proceeds through his aging process. Although parents
with pre—school children are consuming a relatively (wife) time intensive
commodity, these children become less time intensive as they age so that
there are stages in the life cycle when the presence of an older child
makes household consumption more goods intensive than consumption in child-

less families. Some additional evidence supports this notion of factor
reversals during the cycle. In every sample except elementary whites,
the presence of children over thirteen induces adre additional female market

time than the presence of children aix to thirteen. Some of the older
children are attending college —

a

quite goods intensive commodity from a

parent's point of view. Because a larger fraction of the college whites
have children attending college, It is also consistent with this hypothesis
that the additional hours wives work with children over thirteen increases
with the education level of white families.

The lesson for economists in their modelling of family behavior is

that children should not be treated as a homogenous commodity. A variety
of children's characteristics determine the relative input intensities
of home production and the ability of families to substitute market time

for household time. Many characteristics (school attendance, age) are by
their nature, intimately associated with specific stages of the cycle.

To measure the rate at which hours are withdrawn from the market due
to a "pure" income change, economists generally used an aggregate of all

current period nonearnings income. This income measure often contained
income receipts that did not correspond to the theoretical construct.

For example, the unemployment compensation, disability insurance, and
pension income is usually contingent upon the absence of market work and if
these receipts were included In the income measure, a spurious negative

— 41 —

correlation

between work and income would be introduced. Because of this,

I divided all current period nonearnings income into three categories;
the first (WKY) consisted of income received because one did not work (i.e.,

unemployment insurance, workmen's compensation); the second (OADI) included
income from various private and public pension plans and was also directly

related to the amount of an individual's market work; the Unal category
was wealth income (WTHY) which included interest and dividends. It was
hoped that this last category was independent of the work-leisure choice,
and thus was the appropriate one to use when estimating an income effect.

The necessity of separating income in this manner receives empirical

backing in Tables 2 and 3. In the all white male sample, WKY has the
2

expected negative impact on working hours4

Because this income is received

only when one does not work, this is at best a confirmation that it is

reasonably well reported. The second income variable, OADI, had no detectible
influence on working hours. If w'rHY is viewed as the appropriate non-labor
wealth statistic, the sign of WTHY should be positive as long as this income

had not been previously capitalized.43 But non-market time and WTHY tend
to be negatively related raising the real possibility that even these income
flows are the consequence of present and past labor supply choices of the

family. This income is largely the return on the accumulated saving of
the family unit. The magnitude of these savings is determined by current,
past, and future expected levels of market work. Individuals with large past
and current levels of market work have generated the assets that produce
this income making the positive correlation between WTHY and market time
understandable.

One advantage of placing the labor supply decision in a life cycle
context is that one can develop a unified theory of asset accumulation,

— 42

savings, and labor supply.

44

—

Too often, individuals have attempted to

force assets and non-labor income into the confines of a single period
model, but it is only when we consider the life cycle dimension that

motivations for savings and asset accumulation become sensible. The life
cycle

approach clearly demonstrates that any observed relation

assets

between

(or non-labor income) and working hours should not be interpreted

as evidence of a causal sequence from assets to market work reflecting a
wealth

effect. Both are simultaneously determined by similar economic forces

and the observed relation may reflect only one's position in the life cycle.

These ideas may be illustrated by a simple example. Equations 8 - 9
describe the life cycle paths of market goods consumption and hours of

market work. If an exogenous wage path is assumed, the life cycle pattern
of earnings is also given. These earnings and consumption profiles in
turn define the savings behavior of the individual at each age, and by
appropriately accumulating savings, the asset position at each point of the

life cycle is given.45 In a purely Fisherian world, the only factor determining the time path of consumption is a divergence between the interest

rate and rate of time preference.46 Consumption and earnings are equal and
age-invariant when the interest rate equals the rate of time preference.
Of course, savings and net assets are equal

to

zero at every point in the

life cycle. But consider another individual (diagram * 6) who does not
discount the future so severely. Consumption will rise throughout the cycle
while market earnings decline. Since earnings exceed consumption at the
early stages of the cycle, the savings generated will become positive net

assets. Net assets continue to grow until the consumption and income profiles
cross and savings are equal to zero. From this point onward, this individual

relation

between non-earnings income and market work remains positive, the

size of an estimated income elasticity is a negative function of age. Thus,
we see that economic theory does not predict an unambiguous sign for the

The Supply Side

The supply of market hours is the mirror image of the demand for

home time. Labor economists have concentrated on the former and, for
comparative purposes, Tables 6 and 7 report results using annual market

hours as the dependent variable. As expected, the coefficients on annual
hours for males have the opposite sign and are approximately three times

larger than the coefficients on home time.48 Cross section studies have
usually found negatively sloped male supply functions. The positive slopes
I estimate are partly due to the degree of aggregation used in this study.

This presumably eliminated some of the spurious negative correlation between

hours and wage rates caused by imperfect measurement. Moreover, the purpose
of the type of aggregation employed was to attenuate the wealth effects
which produce the negative relation between hours and wages.

Three distinct male wage variables were tried——male hourly wage,

weekly wage, and earnings. Becker in his study suggested using annual earnings
to indirectly calculate a Less biased wage elasticity. He argues that earnings
have the advantage of eliminating the spurious negative correlation between

computed hourly wage and annual working hours. If b is the estimated coefficient of earnings, the implied coefficient for hourly wages is b/i—b.

However, although this transformation is algebraically correct, b will be
biased upwards since hours enter on both sides of the regression.49

As expected, the direct estimates using earnings are higher than those

obtained using hourly wage rates. The difference in the estimates are largest
for the college and elementary groups. It is in these groups with the

or weeks worked of

(2) the annual hours or weeks

worked of all women including the zero values for non-workers, and the

estimated coefficients differ substantially. The most striking contrast is

-46--

the age variable which changes sign. Age has a positive effect when we

consider life cycle variation in the extent or intensity of market work
of labor force members. But this should not be viewed as a refutation
of the life cycle model because the rising age trend of weeks worked of
participating women is one measure of the declining turnover in the female

labor force over the cyele. among the older cohorts, there is a larger
percentage of full, time workers. Because of their stronger labor market
cosunitment, these older women in the labor force will increase the return
on their market oriented human capital by working more hours in any week.

Only when the zero values are included is it permissible to interpret age
in the manner suggested by the life cycle model -

a

measure of the influ-

ence of interest rates or cohort wealth.
The decline in market hours due to the presence of young children is

much smaller when the zero values are not included. The bulk of the labor

market adjustment to the presence of children is through a total market

withdrawal (a fall in participation rates) rather than a decline in the
amount of work by those who remain in the labor force. In fact, the
addition of a young child has no effect on the number of weekly hours.
The wage elasticities are

for the annual hours and weeks worked dimensions are similar and consistent

There are theoretical and statistical distinctions that must be made
between those labor supply definitions that measure variation in hours
and weeks among labor force members and those that simply indicate whether

one is a labor force participant.5 2 Labor Force Participation Rates (LFPR)
are the most comeon example of the latter definitions •

On

the theoretical

side, we are confronting the corner solution problem. A woman' s decision

to participate in the labor force involves a comparison between her potential market wage (w) and the value placed on her leisbme (TMhome wage"l))

at the zero work position.5

LFPR measure te proportion of women for

whom the market wage exceeds the home wage at zero hours of work and can

be interpretated as a point in the cumulative die tributLon function of
home wages. 54( When IZPR are used as the dependent variable ma supply —

As

we know from the theory of the fkrm. supply elasticities are deter-

mined by two distinct factors: 1) The supply elastLoity fo each firm,
and 2) the distribution around any price (wage rate) of the entxy points
for firms. For LFPR the magnitude of the wage coefficients depend only

on the density of the distribution of entry points for women. The denser
the distribution the larger the estimated wage response.55 Clearly, wage

responsiveness is partly a function of the level of participation with the
largest responses expected as we move towards the mean and the smallest at

the two extremes of very low or high participation. Unfortunately, economists have tended to equate results obtained for LFPR with these for hours
and weeks worked, and also to compare groups with quite different average

Nor are these difficulties eliminated when the individual data are grouped

To deal with these problems, several transformations have been pro-

posed to eliminate the 0-1 range of the dependent variable. The simplest
computionally is the logit Transformation which defines the dependent

variable as the natural log of the odds of working. Therefore the following

the predictions of the model. At the present time, only the life cycle

(1) the dominance of the cross-section profiles by the inter-cohort effects;

observed wages will be below the true oPportunity cost. of time. Since these
investments take place with greater frequency during the younger ages and
for males, the relative wages of females to males are being overestimated
at the early ages.
2.

Jacob Mincer and 7rleen Leibowitz have offered an alternative hypo-

thesis to explain this phenomenon. They interpret the more rapid decline
in market work of college educated women as a differential response across
education groups to the presence of young, especially pre-school age,

children. In their hypothesis, colleQe women have a comparative advantage
in investing in the human capital of their children.

22The dating of the peak in female home time also reflects the
fact that younger children are present at an older husband age, for the
more educated.

28Each interviewed individual was asked the length of his latest i.llness.

The codes for this question were 0, 1—3 months, 4—6 months, 7-12 months, and

then in number of years. The month intervals were given the class midpoints.
I then calculated the average number of years that persons in any age cell

were ill. Finally, this was converted to a yearly hours equivalent.

f's
29Por women who vorkd only last year, no direct information exists
on the number of hours they work in a week. Their weekly hours were
computed by assiming that their weekly hours were in the same proportion
to category (2) women as their weeks worked were to weeks worked of women
in category (2) (WKSWK4F/W1CSWK3P).

3O motivation behind such a weighting procedure ii straightforward.
To achieve the most efficient estimate, one should assign a lower weight to

those observations that are least reliable. (have the highest variance).
However, a cost is incurred with this weighting procedure. The observa-

tions that receive the smallest weight occur at the youngest and oldest

age groups. Yet, these are the observations that possess the largest
relative variation in hours and wages.

It is reasonable to assume that hours searching for work are larger at
lower wages. In the diagram below two 4eaiid curves for home time are
drawn. Demand curve BB differs from AA in that BB excludes search time.

interesting to note that the measured elasticity of the supply curve of

market hours must fall when search time is counted as part of total mar-

ket hours. Total market hours are larger, and the increase in market
hours per dollar increase in wage is smaller.
34Many recent studies have asserted that the correct labor supply
function should include searching time. None of these have confronte.d the
conceptional problems involved. For example, if unemployment ks part'y
(a seasonal phenomenen) seasonal workers would be compeniated for their

low hours by higher wages. It would be unappropriate at their ourrent wage
rates to add to thetr working time this "unemployment."

However,

390f course this approach is open to many criticisms, one of the most

important being that it ignores the endogenous character of children in an
economic model. My weak defense is that single equation estimation has a

long tradition in labor supply studies. Also, I am attempting to ke a
somewhat different criticism of the conventional approach--that there

exists a life cycle dimension to the effect family size has on the labor
market behavior of males and females.

401n the two groups in which this effect is not strong - the all
black and elementary school white suple — the coefficient on the variable

for children less than six years old has th. expected sign, but its value

is less than unity.
41According to the first equation in Tables 2 aad 3, an increase in
one pre-schoo]. child would decreasemale home time by :0178 per cent and

increase female home time by .0359 per cent. Evaluated at the mean home

time of 6612 hours for males and 8196 for females, this implies an increase

of 107 market hours for males and a reduction of 294 for tbk.irwives. Using
the mean male and female wages of 3.44 and 2.16, this further implies an increase of $371.52 in male earnings and decrease of $635 in female earnings.

APPENDIX B
THE SURVEY OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

The empirical

results presented are based on 1967 Survey of

Economic Opportunity (SEO) sample. In the spring of that year this
survey was conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Office of Economic
Opportunity to supplement information regularly collected in the Current
Population Surveys (CPS) for February

and March of each year. The survey

comprising 30,000 households (90,000 individuals) consists of two

samples:

1. A national self—weighting sample of 18,000 households conducted

in

the same manner as the monthly CPS survey.1-"

2. In an attempt to increase the reliability of information on blacks,
a supplemental sample of 12,000 households was taken in areas with rela-

tively large concentrations of non—whites)'
For

each family interviewed, information is provided on geographical location,

assets, liabilities, and income other than earnings. Age, sex, race, educational

attainment and family relationship data exists for every individual

1-1For a technical discussion of the sampling techniques used and the
biases that might be present in the SEO sample, see "1966 and 1967 SEO Sample
Design and Weighting," and "The Current Population Survey - A Report on Methodology," Technical Paper No. 7, Washington, D.C., 1963.
-"Basically the method used was to impose a cut-off for sample inclusion
based on the percentage of non—whites in an area. This percentage varied by
region and SMSA size. For those sampling districts above the cut-off, the
standard CPS methods were used to select households.

in

the family. Finally, adult members were additionally questioned on

their work experience, earnings, last week's salary, personal health, marital
status, and women on their childbearing history.
Since the life cycle model I desired to test is set in a family

context, I created a new tape by matching individuals by their marital status.
This new tape, consisting of 17,874 families in which both spouses are
present, has on one record the asset, debt and income levels of the family
unit; personal and labor force characteristics of both the husband and

wife and some limited information on any children present. A number of
additional

restrictions were imposed before a family was used in the final

aggregations. The final sample was limited to non-farm' Negro arid white
families

the

whose husband's age was between 18

and 65 inclusive,

and in

which

husband worked in 1966. I excluded families in which one member worked

in the survey week, but did not work at all during the previous year.-'
Finally, those families in which the husband was under 25 years old and in

the military were exc1uded." The remaining families were divided into 36
cells; two race cells (black and white) each subdivided into three education
cells (1-8, 9-12, and greater than 12 grades of husband's schooling completed)

and finally further subdivided into 6 labor force cells (one division

determined

L'The farm families were eliminated both because of the difficulty of
separating their labor income from the return on physical capital and because
the division between market and home activities is not clear cut.
'There were relatively few families with this characteristic. They
were not included due to absence of yearly income data.
-'These military families were not included because their reported wage
rates are not a reflection of their opportunity costs as a consequence of the
coercion present in the draft system.

by

whether the husband worked in the survey week and three possible labor

force categories for wives: no work at all, worked in previous year, and
worked in previous year and survey week). For each cell, arithmetic means
of variables were calculated by aggregating over the age of the husband.
Since the probability of being incisded in the original tape was not
identical across families, these means were constructed using the probab-

ility of sample inclusion as the weight for the family. Instead of
recording the actual number of working weeks, the SEC coded an individual

in a class interval. Since these intervals were not of equal size, it was
necessary to recode by giving an individual the midpoint of his class.

Selection of the midpoint is arbitrary but a re precise estimate would
require knowledge about the shape of the distribution in each class)' By
SEC definitions, only civilians were considered working so I assumed that

men over 25 in the armed forces worked fifty-one weeks. I have resisted
the temptation to refer to LFPWK and LFPYR as labor force participation

rates. Unlike my measure, the official definition of LFPR includes as participants, individuals who were not gainfully employed A'

Table B-i reports

the means and standard deviations for the variables used in this study.

'The intervals used were 1-13, 14—26, 27—39, 40—47, 48—49, 50—52 weeks
respectively. If, as seems plausible, the distribution of weeks in each
interval is negatively skewed, my weeks worked variable is biased downwards.
This will also introduce a spurious negative correlation between annual hours
worked and hourly wage.
official definition counts as members of the labor force those
individuals who claim to be looking for work.

Male Home Specialization
For this study, the final sample was limited to households in

which the husbands performed some market work in 1966. For a number

of

reasons, this restriction was--not expected to seriously impair the relia—

bility of the results presented. First, the overwhelming majority of
married males were in the sample since only a relatively minor fraction

of husbands are not members of the labor force. Moreover, if non—workers
were included, one would again encounter

the

problem (as we did for females)

of the absence for these observations of the necessary wage data. A
second consideration is the hypothesis that complete male home specialization
is due primarily to factors such as ill health and participation in schooling

and military activities. In particular, it is not generally the consequence
of the family relative wage structure. Hence, eliminating the nonparti—
cipants allows one to concentrate on those families where the "economic"

model is more applicable. To check these suppositions a pass was made
through

the SEO

tape not only to count the number of non-working marriód males

in 1966 but also to find the reason given by them for their non-participation.

Tables B-2 and B-3 summarize the results of that run for white and black

males respectively. If we included these men, our
imately 18,000 would increase only by around

sample

size of approx-

600 observations. More

importantly, only 18 white and 13 black males were not working because of an

inability to find work. For both races approximately ninety per cent of the
male workers gave retirement or poor health as the reason they did not work.
It seems clear then that very little was lost because of the decisions to
exclude these families from this study.

APPENDIX C

A single cross—section provides an inadequate representation of

life cycle behavior. Hopefully, longitudinal data will soon render the
use of cross-sections for this purpose unnecessary. To some degree, one
can disentangle the cohort and life cycle influences by pooling a series

of cross-sectional samples of different calender years)1 Depending on
the number of such samples available, we can identify individuals of the

same age who are members of different cohorts.a" Profiles similar to
those obtained from the 1967 SEO were derived from the 1960 U.S. Census,
and in this appendix the two sets of profiles are compared to determine the
extent of the bias present due to the use of a simple cross-section.

Male Profiles
Figures Cl and C2 compare the 1960 and 1967 annual hours profiles for

males. For both years these profiles have a similar inverted U shape.
Apparently, this profile has shifted upward between these years except at

used this technique to study the returns to schooling. See
his "Black—White Differences in the Return to Schooling," Unpublished, Jan. 1972.
'For example, if a 1960 cross—sectional sample is used, the individuals
who are forty- years old, are members of he 1920 cohort. Each age will correspond to a distinct cohort, and there would be no way of separating the cohort
and age effects. If we used a 1970 survey in addition to the 1960 one, people
aged forty would be members of the 1920 and 1930 cohorts and a separate estimate would then be possible.

the youngest ages. With only two calender years represented, it is
impossible to determine whether this upward shift represents a secular
trend or is produced by cyclical factors.

Compared to 1960, 1959 was a

year of relatively high unemployment and the procyclical behavior of

hours worked could conceivably account for the different levels. Since
low skilled workers are more sensitive to cyclical fluctuations, this may

also explain the larger upward shift for blacks)1 The absence of an
increase in the levels at the youngest ages partly reflects the secular

increases in education level. The main conclusion from this comparison is
that for males at least the use of cross—sectional data does not give that
misleading a picture of their true life cycle profiles.

Female Profiles

The stability of the cross-sectional profiles between calender years
that characterized the male profiles does not hold for the female profiles.

quite similar with an increase in average market work at all ages. The
striking racial difference in the life cycle profiles that was observed in

1967 also appears in 1960. For the education specific profiles for white
married women, the general shapes are preserved, but there apparently has

been little shift in the college profiles. The most striking comparison
between the two years takes place for the various supply dimensions for

women. It is well established and gives support to the rapid secular increases
in the fraction of women who participate in the labor force. This increase
in participation rates for whites is especially pronounced at the younger

ages. But this rapid increase in market participation among married females
does not appear in the other labor supply dimensions--annual or weekly hours.
Indeed, weekly hours for white females was generally higher in 1960 than

in 1967. Also we see from Table C-i that the annual hours worked for women
who did participate was 25 hours higher in 1960 than in 1967. Thus, concexitrating on the LFPR dimension of labor supply exaggerates the secular

increase in female market participation. On average, all married women in
1967 worked 85 hours more in 1967 than in 1960. This is a smaller average
increase than occurred for black males between those two years (104 hours).
For black married women there has been a tendency for the market work of

participants to rise between 60 and 67. There is also a larger increase in
average market work for black women than for white women. Thus, for women
the potential advantages of longitudinal data over a simple cross—section
seems more clear cut.

A Comparison With Becker's 1960 Census Study
Gary Becker, in his empirical work with the 1960 U.S. Census, produced

regressions quite similar to those suarized in this chapter. The consis—

that of the SEO survey.

the all white, high school, and elementary group. In my work, the estimated
coefficient on male hourly wages is better (more negative and significant)

than Becker's in the college and all Black runs. Since I had a more appropriately defined wage variable for wives, the increase in the size of the

cross wage elasticity is encouraging)-' The sign of the age variable appears
to be as inconsistent across the studies as it is among the groups in either

study. The number

of children under seven seems a better variable than

family size. On the whole the similarity in the results of these two

separate works is a rather rare affirmative test of a theory.

Becker's variable was deficient for three reasons: (1) it includes
income other than earnings; (2) it is reported income for all other family
members not simply the wife; and (3)
is a yearly and not hourly (price of
time) concept.
