Before turning

to

the outline and some particulars of the new project,

I shall offer a few comments on the comparative strengths and limitations

of indicators, anticipatory data, and some other tools of current business
analysis and macroeconomic forecasting.

1. Some General Observations on Indicators
and Anticipations Data
Economic change has the different but interrelated dimensions of size,
frequency, duration, timing, and scope--which receive different emphasis
and treatment in time series of (a) levels of economic aggregates and
indexes; (b) the corresponding rates of change; and (c) measures of pre-

vailing directional movement. These types of series also reflect differentially the various (but again interrelated) components of economic
change--the secular and intermediate trends, cyclical, seasonal, and short

irregular

movements. In general, uses of the indicators and diffusion

focus on the cyclical aspects of economic developments, treat the

cyclical fluctuations as largely systematic, and seek

to

isolate, measure,

and ultimately predict the repetitive elements that typified the broad

movements of the economy in the past.2 In this task, cyclical indicators

approach implies that business cycles are not th be viewed as
essentially random fluctuations (say, resulting from a summation of random
shocks a la Slutzky). Indeed, the presence in virtually
tain recurrent patterns and relationships is seen as evidence against that
extreme version of the random shock hypothesis. However, methods of
cyclical analysis do not imply endorsement of the other polar concept
either, namely, that business cycles are purely endogenous movements. All
studies of the economy in movement that are not entirely divorced from
empirical observations must deal with the effects and interaction of two

and diffusion series are complementary rather

than competing inputs into

the process of analysis and forecasting.
Diffusion indexes may, of eourse, be derived from actual (ex post)
data as well as from expected (ex

ante) data.3 Diffusion series which

correspond to recorded economic aggregates tend to lead the latter at

peaks and troughs associated with major changes in business conditions,
but their cyclical movements

are often obscured by short, irregular fluc-

tuations. In these respects, the diffusion indexes resemble the series
of changes in, rather than levels of, the corresponding aggregatesJ

show the percentage of series in a given set that
in each successive time period. The set may represent a
single economic process or a number of related processes and the type and
degree of disaggregation
may vary greatly (the component series may refer
to individual firms or industries
or regions, etc.). In the United States,
for example, d1ffusjo indexes
are available, among others, for new orders
(36 industries), profits (about 1,000 corporations), industrial materials
prices (13 materials), and sales of retail stores (23 types of stores).

coincident, and

indexes are, of course, much smoother than the uricurnulated ones, but
they

also lead the corresponding aggregates by much shorter intervals,

if they lead them at all.

Leading indicators- -highly cyclical series with early timing

characteristics-_are

typically also very

sensitive

to frequent distur-

bances of all kinds, so that their month-to-month changes (after elirnination of seasonal movements) tend to reflect the short erratic fluctuations
much more than

their

longer cyclical movements. For the cycle-trend

components to begin to "dominate" the irregular components, such series
must be compared over intervals ranging from 2 to 6 months (or, equivalently,

must be smoothed with 2- to 6-month moving averages). Other

sources

of "noise" in

current observations, notably the errors in pro-

visional estimates as indicated by data revisions, may add, from 1 to 3
months to the total delay in recognizing the "true" cyclical movements

in the series.5
In practice, then, such effective leads as can be gained from these
data tend to be short; they help to speed up the recognition of major
cyclical changes in progress, but do not generally enable the user to

anticipate such changes early and reliably. However, without the aid
of series with historical lead-time

characteristics, recognition appears

to be considerably more sluggish still.

This means that the data, when

also that there is a high premium on any approach that promises to

advantageous if the leading series themselves could be reasonably well
predicted, whether by means of "causal" factors suggested by testable
economic theories or by means of "symptomatic" factors representing
aggregated microdata on economic anticipations and

the preceding section.

draw strongly upon the information contained in advance orders, and they
are

generally

much more accurate than sales anticipations in industries

that produce largely to stock, where such information is not available

or very limited. Company forecasts of new orders for nonelectrical
machinery, a category of products made largely to order, are on the
average quite poor (indeed, on balance less accurate than simple last-

level extrapolations for the quarterly series of corresponding aggregate
realizations).

2. Estimates of agegate investment commitments (oc), obtained
by adding the value of new orders received by industries producing
machinery and equipment to the value of new contracts for industrial
and commercial construction, have considerable predictive power with

to business expenditures for plant and equipment (i). The relation involves distributed 1as of I behind OC, which average two to three

Simple mechanical predictions of GNTP based on regressions with

average performance of economic forecasters, according to some experi-

mental calculations desied to match the annual end-of-year forecasts.1Â°

Such predictions, however, are to be viewed merely as additional standards against which to appraise the results

of

true ex ante forecasting

and not at all as optimal applications of the indicators to macroeconomic

forecasting. For best results, the indicators must not be used mechanically but rather their evidence must be interpreted with the aid of

juduent based on professional training and experience.11 (The same
applies as well to other forecasting approaches including the uses of

anticipation surveys and econometric models. Thus there is considerable
evidence that ex ante forecasts with econometric models, which involve
various types of judgmental adjustments, are on the whole more accurate
than forecasts from unadjusted models, even when these are made ex post

with correct values of exogenous variables. )

because they do not allow properly for the characteristics of these series and the original criteria of their selection (notably
for the sensitivity and the consequent short-term variability of the
leaders as well as the fact that they were chosen for the consistency of
their cyclical timing, not for the correlation with such series as real
private GNP or the like). As an example, consider the treatment of the

practice

they are generally less

from surveys of consumer anticipations are regarded by many actual and
potential users as having substantially less predictive value than data

from surveys of business investment anticipations. However, evidence
has been presented lately that, in recent periods for which improved
anticipations data are available, both consumer attitudes and purchase

expectations did have definitely a good net predictive record with regard

to consumer outlays for durable goods, particularly automobiles.1

3. It is a simple and reasonable proposition that expectations should
prove more accurate for variables over which the survey respondents have
substantial control than for variables over which they have little or

no control. This is probably a major reason why business anticipations
of plant and equipment have been mu.ch more useful to economic forecasters

than business sales and inventory anticipations. Comparisons of the
predictive performance of data from the Commerce surveys show clearly
the weakness of sales, and to a smaller extent of inventory, anticipations as

It should be noted,though, that the strong positive results are limited
to a short period 1960-67 for which the expectational data (an "Index of
Consumer Sentiment" and buying intentions series, from the University of
Michigan Survey Research Center and the Census Bureau) appear to be much
better than they were before. For a rather critical summary view of

deviations between these series and the corresponding actual indexes are
much smaller for the number of employees than for new orders, net sales,
net profits, and the level of inventories in manufacturing and trade.
Moreover, the errors for employment are much less systematic than the
errors for the other variables (for sales and profits, the series are

very similar and the anticipated indexes consistently exceed the actual

indexes; for inventories, the opposite bias prevails). Finally, for
selling prices, the indexes show appreciably smaller discrepancies between
the anticipations and the realizations in manufacturing than in wholesale
and retail trade.

C. On indirect evidence from aggregative
forecasts and related inferences
1. Series that tend to coincide or lag at business cycle turns may
have more recognizable prior signals than series that move early, and may

therefore be on the whole easier to predict. It is consistent with this
expectation, for exairrple, that forecasts of business irwestment in plant

and equipment generally have smaller relative errors than forecasts of

inventory investment.17 The former relate to a rather late stage of a
process which is, as a rule, time-consuming, and they are helped by indications from the earlier stages (new capital appropriations and commit-

ments). Of course, the relative timing is not the sole relevant factor.
Inventory investment not only requires much less time than business fixed

investment, it also is much more volatile. But in general these and

the "autonomous" forecast components have some net predictive powers.
Underestimation, while very frequent, is by no means ubiquitous; it

prevails for series dominated by growth trends, but declines are just
as often missed or overestimated and forecasts of highly variable series
show smaller proportions of underpredicted changes. Also, in some business
tendency surveys such as the Dun and Bradstreet anticipated diffusion
indexes, there is evidence of regressiveness (trend reversion) as well
as underestimation. See V. Zarnowitz, An Appraisal of Short-Term Economic

measures of changes in business and consumer expectations;

(d) analytical measures such as those of diffusion, rates of change,
etc.

All these types of data, and some additional ones, are found in the monthly
report of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of

Economic Analysis (BEA),

entitled Business Conditions Digest (fon-nerly Business Cycle Developments,

in short BCD). Section A includes all major series from the expenditure
and income sides of the GNP accounts, for the

personal, business, govern-

ment, and rest-of-the-world sectors, in nominal and real terms.

Section B

presents about 80 cyclical indicators, classified by economic process
and by timing (leading, roughly coincident, lagging), as well as ten com-

posite indexes based on groups of series produced by this dual classifi-

cation. Section C shows several aggregate series and a number of diffusion
indexes derived from surveys of anticipations and intentions of businessmen

and households. Section D contains series relating to foreigu trade, the
balance of payments, federal government activities, changes in prices,
wages, productivity, and the size and composition of the labor force--

series

that are important for the overall view of the economy but do not

qualify as indicators of expansions and contractions in aggregate econanic
activity because their behavior during business cycles is not sufficiently

regular or consistent. Section E consists of various analytical measures:
actual and potential GNP, ratios (e.g., of output to capacity, inventories

and unemployment; production, income, consumption, and trade; fixed capital investment; inventories and inventory investment; prices, costs, and

diffusion indexes

based

on selected leading and coincident indicators, and rates of percentage

changes in a few key aggregates and indexes. Finally, section F provides
some international comparisons for consumer prices, industrial production, and stock price indexes.

In sum, BCD assembles approximately 600 monthly and quarterly time

series. Atpresent, most of the charts begin in 1952.

26

ccept for sec-

tion F, the charts contain shading which indicates periods of recession in
general business activity, according to the NBER cyclical chronology for

the U.S. All data for the current and the last 2-3 years are also regularly presented in tabular form. There is an introductory part explaining the adopted methods of presentation. Appendixes provide descriptions
of series, historical data, seasonal adjustment factors, cyclical behavior
patterns, specific peak and trough dates, arid average variability measures
for the principal indicators.

It would seem that the general content and format of BCD are very
well suited to the needs of those who are engaged in analyzing and forecasting the course of the U.S. economy, and the good sales record of the

publication is consistent with this claim. However, this merely confirms
that business economists and other professionals in this field recognize
the need to be au cou.rant on the changing

expectations, signals, and

developments that find their expression in the large collection of series

26me main cyclical indicators which appear on the NBER "short list"

review of these materials and techniques. Such a comprehensive review

of economic data. The period witnessed strong and persistent inflationary
tendencies and major policy efforts to counter them; a "credit crunch"

in 1966 and a brief but pervasive business s1owdon in 1967; a mild recession in 1970, with some particular features attributable to the force
of continuing inflation; the subsequent recovery and institution of

general price and wage controls; great changes in international monetary
and political relations and military activities affecting the U.S. economy
and, most recently (after the abandonment of the post-World War II systern of fixed exchange rates, two devaluations and a downward "float" of

the dollar), another round of a boom and inflation and renewed price

controls. Such developments test anew the ability of indicators and
anticipations data to help in the diagnosis and prognosis of economic
conditions.

At the same time, work on improvements and. extensions of time series

representing all types of economic processes continued at a high rate.
Thus, there is need to appraise the indicator qualities of new and
revised data as well as to reassess those of many "old" series taking

Into account their behavior since 1966. The broad objectives here are
(1) to review BCD and other pertinent materials so as to complement and.

update the record and the cyclical analysis and scoring for a large
collection of the series concerned; (2) to reconmiend, on a documented
basis, such changes in form and substance of BCD as appear best calculated to enhance the informational value of that report.
The data base for the study is quite

broad, consisting of approxi-

mately 250 time series, about 150 of which are currently in in BCD.29
Recent developments in macroeconomic research, especially on business
cycles and prograimned approaches to their study, forecasting, and econo-

metric models, offer some new ideas and techniques for the task of

evaluating these data.3Â° In particular, the Bry-Boschan computer
programs for cyclical analysis are being used extensively in our project, with very satisfactory results.

Several serious problems must be confronted by this analysis.

Those

considered but not resolved in the preceding studies include:

(a) Systematic differences in timing at peaks and troughs.

Earlier

research has established that they exist for many series that show good
indicator characteristics.3

However, these distinctions are ignored

in the present classification of indicators (based on measures of timing

at all turns), mainly to simplify the presentation of the data and to
avoid additional difficulties in evaluating the evidence.

(b) Differences in length of the leads or lags that are characteristic
of the various indicators. These too are often pronounced and significant
(mainly for the leaders).32 But the indicators are now grouped into three

30Some of the recent publications that are important in this context
are: Gerhard Bry and Charlotte Boschan, Cyclical Analysis of Time Series:
Selected Procedures and Computer Programs, NBER, New York, 1971; Victor
Zarnowitz, ed., The Business Cycle Today, as cited, especially the contributions by use Mintz, Solomon Fabricant, and G. H. Moore; Frank E. Morris,
"The Leading Indicators Revisited," Business EconomicS, September, 1970,
pp. 11_19; Julius Shiskin, "Economic Policy Indicators and Cyclical Turning Points," ibid., pp. 20-28; and the items referred to in footnotes 5
and 10 above.

31Thus, of the 72 series classified by timing in the 1966 review by
Moore and Shiskin, 38 have been found to fall in the same timing class at
peaks and troughs and 314 in different classes. See Indicators of Business
Expansions and Contractions (as cited in fn. 28), pp. 314 and 914-101. These
classifications are based, for each individual series, on the median lead
or lag plus a probability test applied to the number of leads, rough coincidences, or lags relative to the number of business cycle turns covered.
32Edgar R. Fiedler, "Long-Lead and Short-Lead Indexes of Business
Indicators," Proceedings of the Business and Economic Statistics Section,
American Statistical Association, 19G2.

19

timing categories only: leading, lagging, and roughly coincident.33 In
addition to reopening these questions, some new ones must be asked:

(c) How should the series representing government activities and

policies be treated? Some fiscal and defense indicators are now grouped
separately in BCD (section D3), while the monetary policy indicators in
the form of change-in-money-supply series are included in the section for

leading indicators, money and credit ().

But tbis does not do justice

to the importance of the economic policy indicators and their relations
with each other and with the private sector indicators.31I

It must be

recognized that some activities of the federal government in the U.S.
result in time series that do have cyclical regularities and that they
both influence the private sector and contain endogenous elements in
the sense of being responsive to earlier developments in the economy.35

(d) Should more attention be paid to the distinction between the

real and the nominal indicators?6 In 1969-70, inflation persisted

33A series is roughly coincident if it exhibits a significant number
of timing observations that lie within the range of lags (+) or leads (-)
of 3 months or less (i.e., in the range of 3 months). Thus, this category overlaps the other two, since a series may simultaneously qualify as
roughly coincident and as leading (or lagging) by short intervals. However, dual classifications are avoided in the final designations of the
indicators according to timjn (which occasionally differ from those obtained
by application of the rules noted in fn. 31; see Moore and Shiskin, op. cit.,
pp. 3I_t5).
the papers by Morris and Shiskin cited in footnote 30 above.
35For some recent discussions of these matters, see The Business
Cycle Today (ref. in fn. 2), particularly V. Zarnowitz, "The Business
Cycle Today: An Introduction," and "Econometric Model Simulations and the
Cyclical Characteristics of the U.S. Economy," and Yoel Haitovsky and
Neil Wallace, "A Study of Discretionary and Nondiscretionary Monetary and
Fiscal Policies in the Context of Stochastic Macroeccnometric Models."

The real indicators are series in physical units, quantity indexes,
and agreates in constant dollars (deflated). The other indicators are
nominal series--aggregates in current dollars--and price indexes and
interest rates.

amidst a decline In production and

a

rise in unemployment more strongly

than was previously recorded. In the United States, this episode is
definitely identifiable as a recession, i.e., cyclical contraction according to real aggregates, but it would seem

to

be only a retardation in

terms of the nominal aggregates. This suggested to some observers that
it may be instructive to reconsider the criteria of severity of recessions
in

terms of the relative siiificance of real vs. pecuniary measures of

economic activity.37 This raises some major theoretical Issues which
need

not be fully resolved in this study; but we decided to give the

real indicators much greater weight than they received in the previous
reviews.

(e)

Some indicators are expressed in absolute or relative changes

rather than levels (e.g., changes in inventories and In money supply),

and the form in which the series are cast tends to affect decisively
their cyclical timing and sometimes also their cyclical conformity.

Comprehensive price Indexes, for example, have never conformed very well
to business cycles and in recent years have conformed poorly if at all;
but the broad fluctuations in their rates of change show a rather close
correspondence with economic fluctuations since 1911.7 when both recessions

370n this subject opinions differ, as illustrated in use Mintz,
American Growth Cycles," Solomon Fabricant, "The 1Recession'
of 1969-70," and comments by Moore and Mintz (pp. 176-82) in The Business
Cycle Today.
ttJ)jflg

38Qf course, it is the fluctuations in the real measures that are
primarily important in the context of the problem of cyclical unemploy-

ment. Furthermore, for the latter to become severe it is not necessary
that the demand for output and employment decline absolutely, only that
they grow appreciably slower than the labor force and productive capacity
over some sufficiently long stretches of time.

21

and slowdowns are recognized.39 This matter deserves further

study as

does the more general problem of the form in which some indicators are
used and the degree and type of smoothing applied to them.

(f) Related to (d) and (e) is the important distinction between the
"classical" business cycles--sequences of generalized expansions and contractions--and the "growth cycles," an object of much recent attention.
Economic fluctuations have definitely become milder in the post-World
War II period, in the U.S. and, even more, in other highly developed
market economies (Western Europe, Japan), where slowdowns in the rate of
growth of total spending and income have largely replaced sustained de-

dines in the levels of these aggregates.

However, many features of

the historical cycles in which such declines were incorporated apparently
reappear in those recent cycles that show up only in the rates of growth

or in the levels of trend-adjusted series. Thus, downturns in the leading indicators generally predict either a decline--recession--or a marked
retardation in aggregate economic activity, and upturns in these sensi-

tive series predict either a recovery or a pronounced acceleration.
This suggests that the system of economic intelligence represented by

the data and analytical measures covered in BD would continue to prove

39See G. H. Moore, "The Cyclical Behavior of Prices," in The Business
Cycle Lbday, pp. 137-66.

lOThese developments are variously attributed to changes in (a) the
structure and institutions of the economy; (b) economic knowledge and its
policy applications; and (c) public attitudes and expectations. Some
of these changes, however, seem to have at the same ti.me strengthened the
forces of inflation, which makes them partly destabilizing.

useful

in a world

in

which the probability of growth cycles greatly ex-

ceeded that of business cycles (of the kind recorded by NBER). But surely
that system, having been devised to observe the latter type of economic

fluctuations, is not as well adapted to observe the former. What is
required, in the broadest sense, is that the methods of cyclical analysis

and

forecasting be reexamined and elaborated with a view to making them

more

adequate for dealing with the recently prevalent patterns of instability, namely the major fluctuations in the rates of economic growth
and

inflation.

Some of these problems are rather difficult, especially the last

cycles. These movements can

be measured as

from trends, alternating phases of high and low growth rates

called "step cycles," or rates of change (which usually must be smoothed

with moving averages).2 Thend estimates can hardly be avoided here,
yet they are often notoriously arbitrary and of uncertain value, par-

ticularly in this context where they must be brought up-to-date. Until
recently, no reference chronolor for the U.S. growth cycles existed,

although it was increasingly needed. The pioneering work by use Mintz,

just a few years ago, goes far towards filling this need, but
some of her results are based on limited evidence from an analysis that

additional work will be required to date the growth cycle phases with

adequate precision on a current basis!

1It should also be noted that a growth-cycle reference chronolor
of the type developed by Mintz cannot be simply combined with the businesscycle reference chronolor of the type developed by NBER and used in
BCD: the former is based on major fluctuations in series of deviations
from trend or of properly measured rates of change, while the latter
is based on major fluctuations in the levels of the series concerned.
Useful chronologies that integrate the two dichotomies (expansion-contraction, speedup-showdown) can perhaps be devised by dividing the cycles
into stages which might resemble somewhat the stages used in the NTBER
reference cycle analysis (Arthur F. Burns and Wesley C. Mitchell, Measuring
Business cycles, NBER, New York, 1911!7, Chapters 2 and 5). But the division
would probably have to be much more flexible, with variable-length stages
not all of which will necessarily be found in each cycle. A closely
related problem is that of combining such a chronolor with a system of
dating the major changes in the rate (and perhaps type) of price-level
inflation; see G. H. Moore, "The Cyclical Behavior of Prices," as cited
in footnote 39, and John R. Meyer, "On Classifying the 'New ReRlities'
of the Business Cycle," to appear in the 1973 Annual Report of the National
Bureau.

1. Some Preliminary Results

At the time of this writing (June, 1973), the Bry-&schan computer
program for dating cyclical turning points has been applied to more than
200 time series and the results have been reviewed by the senior staff

of the project. The collection includes the following broad groups:

The program is a stepwise approach designed to identify first the
major cyclical swings in the series, then the neighborhoods of their maxima
arid minima, and finally the monthly dates of the specific peaks and troughs.

It uses seasonally adjusted data and searches for the turns sequentially

in: a 12-month moving average; a weighted 15-month moving average (Spencer
curve); a 3-to 6-month moving average (according to the number of months

The first five categories below refer, respectively, to the D
sections B; C and D; A; E; and C2 and E3 (see text above for a brief description of the major parts of BCD). The new indicators (not presently included
in BCD) relate to aspects or components of employment, unemployment, and
labor turnover and productivity; of GNP; of industrial production; and of
manufacturers' new orders and shipments. A complete list of the 211series

proper.6 The basic output of this computer program starts with tabulations of the unsmoothed data and the various moving averages and ends
with several tentative lists and one "final" list of the selected turning
points.

Given this information, large computer charts were then produced, one
for each series, showing the seasonally adjusted data marked to locate
their cyclical peaks and troughs and the corresponding moving averages.
Each chart was inspected so as to determine the correctness of the mechan-

ically selected turns. Wherever judnent dictated deviations from the latter,
the charts were appropriately revised to show only the finally approved

turning dates. Although the process resulted in many changes, by far most
of the computer-chosen turning points were accepted and we consider the

program

as

having performed quite well.

A few of these charts may

serve to illustrate

the cyclical behavior

of

selected individual indicators (Chart 1) and composite indexes (Chart 2).17

Consider some of the comprehensive "coinciders." The quarterly GNP aggregates have, of course, nearly coincident timing, but note that their
specific peaks and troughs deviate occasionally from the dates of business
cycle peaks and troughs (shown at the top of each chart to mark the beginning and end of each of the shaded areas representing the NBER-designated

recessions). One should recall that the NBER "reference" dates of business

these series refer to the so-called short list of NBER indicators
(see footnote 26 above). The numbers of the series are those used in BCD
for identification purposes only; they do not reflect the relationships
between the series or the order in which the series are presented. The

cycle turns are monthly and based on the evidence of other series as well

as GNP. Moreover, in the 1970 recession nominal GNP continued to rise,
though at reduced rates, while real GNP declined mildly. Industrial production shows fluctuations that resemble broadly those in real GNP but

the greater sensitivity and much smaller coverage of this

monthly index, which covers manufacturing, mining, and public utilities!8
The rate of unemployment, for which an inverted scale is used to convert
the countercyclical movements of this series into procyclical movements,

is classed as a coincident indicator in BCD. As the chart shows clearly,
however, unemployment tends to lag at troughs and lead at peaks. This is
so because employment usually rises slowly in both the initial and the

late stages of a business expansion, whereas the labor force continues
to grow at a fairly steady rate.1L9

8These industries have grown less than the U.S. economy as a whole
in recent times as the proportion accounted for by service industries of
all types has increased. Presumably this worked to reduce instability.
Cyclical declines in manufacturing apparentlyno longer drag down the rest
of the economy as promptly as they used to.
relatively slow increase in employment during the recovery
phase (which starts from low rates of caPacity utilization) reflects the
typically large rise in both the productivity of labor (output per man-hour)
and the average workweek. The retardation in employment growth late in
expansion is due largely to the spread of cost increases and shortages in
seents of the labor market. Unemployment and related aggregate measures
of unused capacity such as the ttGN? gapT' (potential, i.e., full employment,
GNP minus actual GNP) thus provide some of the most important examples
of systematic differences in timing at peaks and troughs.

The change in consumer installment debt is subject to sizable erratic
variations--a frequent characteristic of monthly first difference series-but these short movements do not obscure the longer cyclical fluctuations

their large amplitudes and long leads at peaks (short leads or coincidences at troughs). In addition to the declines associated with
with

business recessions (shaded areas), the change in consumer installment
debt shows about equally large "extrat' declines in 1950-51 and 1965-66.

Such movements, which signalize the much less visible retardations in

the growth of the comprehensive coincident aggregates in 1951-52 and 1966
(see, e.g., the GI'W charts), appear in many sensitive leading indicators.

The composite indexes shown in Chart 2 combine indicators that have
similar timing but differ greatly in other respects (economic process,

coverage, frequency of observation, smoothness, etc.). The indexes are
constructed by standardizing the per-month percentage changes in each
series so that all are expressed. in comparable units.50 Also, the index

of leading indicators has been "reverse trend adjusted" to increase its

trend so as to make

parallel to that of the index of coincident indicators. This tends to shorten (lengthen) the leads of the former

The composite index of leading indicators52 has led at every peak and
(though lately by very short intervals) at every trough in the U.S. business

cycles of the post-World War II period. The only other cyclical contractions
in this series occurred in 1951 and 1966, matching the retardations in economic growth that somewhat later showed up in GNP and other coincident

aggregates. The leading index has shown no major downturns and upturns at any

other

time,53 andin this sense has givennofalse signals, i.e., unconfirmed

anticipations of a serious weakening or strengthening of the economy.

This statistical construct, then, is remarkably sensitive to business
recessions and recoveries, as well as to pervasive slowdowns and speedups;
yet it is also relatively smooth and capable of being rather efficiently
updated.

The composite index of coincident indicators had exact coincidences
or short leads at business cycle peaks and exact coincidences only at

troughs. It lagged behind the leading index on each of these occasions,
although often by very short intervals. No major declines are recorded
in this index at any

times

other than the T1BER-designated recessions.55

52The twelve series included in this index are listed in Table 1,
lines 1-12.
53The much shorter and smaller declines in mid-1952, mid-1956, and

the

second half of 1959 are all connected with the main strikes of this

era (centering on the steel industry). Such strikes (the last of which
occurred

late in 1970) sometimes make the recognition of cyclical turns
in the economy's course particularly difficult.

The five series included in this index are listed in Table 1, lines
13, lIt, 15,

17,

and 19.

The composite index of lagging indicators coincided at two and
laggea at three of the peaks, while lagging at each of the troughs in

aggregate economic activity. Thus, at turning points, this index tends
to move for a time in a direction opposite to the leading and then to the
coincident index, which can help verifying the occurrence of a recession

or recovery. Like the coinciders and unlike the leaders, the lagging
series tend merely to undergo slowdowns, not absolute declines, during
periods of retarded growth, and this is clearly reflected in the corresponding composite indexes.

Since most of the indicators were selected and classified many years
ago, and the underlying data undergo various revisions and sometimes
conceptual changes, the recent behavior of these series provides a fair

test of their usefulness. The charts, especially those for the composite
indexes, suggest that the indicators contirued to perform reasonably well
during the expansion preceding the 1970 recession and also during the

last contraction and the following recovery and upswing. That is, the
series that had been expected to lead did so, and the series that had been
expected to lag did so too, relative to the movements of the group of the
"roughly coincident" indicators representing the main aspects of aggregate
economic activity (employment, production, and income).

However, such graphical analyses permit only broad and rather impression-

istic inferences. The evaluation of indicators will require a numerical
and. detailed record of how the many

time

series in question have performed.

6The six series included in this index are listed in Table 1, lines
21-26.

Table

tendency and dispersion of cyclical timing for all indicators on the NBER

composite

indexes currently in use.57 The individual

are cross-classified according to the overall timing categories

presently adopted in BCD and according to the distinction between the

real and nominal indicators that was drawn up for this study.8 New
summary timing measures and classifications are provided for the
observations at business cycle peaks and troughs separately.

In the 1966 evaluation by Moore and Shiskin, an indicator was
classed as leading if its median timing at all business cycle turns
covered was two months or more and if the probability that the observed

proportion of leads could be attributed to chance was sufficiently low.59
The twelve series listed in the first section of Thble 1 all pass this
double test when the observations at peaks and troughs are combined for

each indicator. The overall mean leads vary from 7.2 to l2.1- months for

See footnote 26 above.

8See footnote 36 above.

59The probability test was first devised by Moore in his 1950
study (as cited in footnote 28). It is based on the assumptions that
the probability that a series will produce a timing comparison of a
given type at a reference turn is one-half and that the results in
successive cycles are independent. These assumptions can be questioned
but they permit application of the binomial and this simple method appears
to be adequate as a rough screening device. The maximum acceptance level
Corresponds as nearly as possible to the probability p = o.25o (e.g.,
the probability is 0.223 that four or more leads will occur when a leading
indicator covers six turns). The longer the series (the more turns it
covers), the lower the probability for a given proportion of successes
(say, leads for a leading indicator).
Thus, the maximum acceptable
percentage of failuresis directly related to the length of the series.
An exact coincidence is counted as a half-lead and a half-lag; so that
for leads the successes are represented by leads and half the ntunber of
exact Coiflcideices (the other 50 percent of the observations are, of course,
fai1ires; while for lags the reverse applies). See also Moore and Shiskin
(a8 cited in footnote 28), pp. 18-19 and 91.

real series in this group and cluster narrowly between 6.1. and 7.6

months for the nominal and price series (col. 9).

The median leads are

in most cases smaller than the mean leads but the differences are not
large. The tinting comparisons show a great deal of dispersion (col. 10),

but leads prevail heavily over lags. At business cycle peaks, the timing
characteristics of these series are entirely unaibiguous (cols. i-1-.).

Here the average leads are 9-12 months or even longer and each of the

twelre series qualifies as "leading (L) under the probability test. At
troughs (cols. 5-8)

the

leads are much shorter than at peaks, with

most

of the averagesfafling in the 1-li. months range. One of the series is

accepted for rough coincidences rather than leads and two others are

rather difficult to classify under the adopted rules.6Â° However, these
seem to be marginal cases. I conclude that the selection of these 12
series as leading indicators, made in earlier NBER studies on the strength
of the then available historical evidence, is generafly confirmed by the
new measures here presented, for both peaks and troughs and also for both
the real and the nominal data subsets.

The findings for the roughly coincident indicators in Section II

of Table 1 leave much more room for doubt. The overafl timing averages
fall in a narrow range close to 0, but they are all short leads (varying

See Table 1, col. 8, lines 2, 3, and 7, and footnotes c and e.
The probability test for the significance of rough coincidences treats all
leads and lags that are longer than three months as failures. Success in
this test does not preclude a series from also passing the test as a leader
(if short leads prevail strongly in the record) or as a lagger (if short
lags prevail). However, such double classifications (c/L and C/Lg) are
eliminated when the median tinting rule is added to the probability test
rule, since the former makes a clear distinction between the three timing

categories in terms of

the

observed median leads or lags (see Table 1,

".3

from 0.5

to

1.8 months, c1. 9). At peaks, the real series have longer

leads, with medians of 2-6 months, and they qualify as leaders rather than

coinciders.61 Of the nominal series, two (personal income and retail sales)
fail to pass the probability tests, one (manufacturing and trade sales)

passes but as a leader, and only one (GNP) qualifies as a coincider. At
troughs, the unemployment rate is better described as a short lagger than

a coincider, and the median timing of GP is again a short lead (see footnote 6i); also, personal income and retail sales fail the tests here as well
as at peaks and must be designated "U" (unclassified by timing).

The indicators grouped as lagging in the NBER short list (section
III of the table) have sufficiently long average lags at all turns, except
for business expenditures on plant and equipment, which qualifies as coincider
at peaks (line 22). Also, the series on commercial arid industrial bank loans

fails the test at peaks (line 26). All six indicators in this group are
accepted for lags (Lg) at troughs.
The

composite indexes conform well to the expected timing patterns,

as shown in the last section of ble 1. The index of 12 leading indicators
has variable but on the average long leads at

on page 32 above. These indexes cover the leading series from the NBER short

they include the 12 leading indicators i'rom the NBER short list and 7 other
series (see notes to Table 1).

coincident indicators, particularly the deflated one, have slight tendencies

toward short leads at peaks, but there is no doubt about their basic timing

characteristicS.6 Finally, lags dc*ninate the timing record of the composite
index of lagging indicators, but more decidely so at troughs than at peaks.6
Table 2 presents a different type of suimnary for a larger collection

of time series,66 namely the group timing averages at each successive peak
and trough of U.S. business cycles since 191!-8. These measures confirm that

the real indicators tend to have longer leads at peaks than the nominal
indicators, which reflects inflation in the advanced stages of economic

expansions. The series classified as leading and laggirg in D show the
expected timing (mean leads and lags, respectively) at each of the turns

covered (cols. 1-3 and 7-8). The series classified as roughly coincident in

D do occupy the middle ground between the leaders and the laggers, but they
show a preponderance of leads, particularly the real indicators at peaks
(cols. 1i_6).

The leads are on the whole considerably longer at peaks than

at troughs, and the lags are conversely shorter at peaks than at troughs
(lines 6 and 12).

61The coincident index includes 5 of the 8 series classed as
roughly coincident in the NBER short list (omitting the quarterly indicators
and one monthly series on account of overlapping coverage; see Table 1, footnote o). The deflated index uses constant-dollar rather than current-dollar
series for personal income and manufacturing and trade sales (footnote p).

index includes the six lagging indicators from the NB
short list. It may be added that its lags were considerably longer at the
last two business cycle turns (relating to the 1969-70 recession) than
generally on earlier occasions (see Chart 2).

Closer reading of Table 2 suggests that the behavior of the
indicators generally may vary in systematic ways

at

the different business

cycle recessions and revivals. For example, the leads at peaks

were

on the

average relatively short in 1953 and long in 1957; the leads at troughs were
relatively long in l951- and short in 1970; the lags were much longer in 1961

than at any other revival; etc. This is consistent with more detailed evidence on the corresponding specific turning points and is associated with
the fact that strong positive correlations are common among indicators within

the same timing category. But the particular cyclical episodes covered would
have to be closely examined to explain the observed differences between them.

Further

Considerations

What do we learn from these results? As ever so often, in answering this question some others must be raised:

1. at revisions, if any, are to be made in the dates of the business
cycle peaks and troughs?
One might read Tables 1 arid 2 as saying that at least some of .the

recent

peaks in the NB reference chronology are dated too late, because

too many average leads, which are not always small enough, are recorded
at these turns for the "roughly coincident" indicators. A review of the
reference dates is indeed needed and is now in progress. It requires more
and different measures than I was able to present in this paper. There is
no way to derive

an acceptable chronology mechanically from one or a few

selected series; rather, the procedure must involve a combination of judgment
and working rules of cyclical analysis.6'?' Since both the structure of the

economy and the relevant statistical information are changing, reappraisals
of the evidence are necessary in matters

of selecting the proper indicators

"aggregate economic activity" and their turning points, the methods and
weights to be used in combining these indicators, etc. It is convenient
of

to

have monthly reference dates,

approximations

but of course,

these can only be workable

and should not be taken to be highly precise (claims of close

reasons are discussed

in V. Zarnowitz, "On the Dating
Business Cycles," Journal of Business, April 1963, pp. 119-99.

of

The decisions must often consider a wide range of problems,
e.g., the adequacy of seasonal adjustments, the effects of strikes and
other "random events," the consequences of using some quarterly series
in addition to the monthly ones, and so on.

accuracy in this context would necessarily be spurious).6 Where

points

turning

in the major indicators of macroeconomic activity are closely

clustered, the approximations are better than where these turns are

widely

scattered. In the latter cases of relatively flat turning zones, the NEER
practice is to place the reference date toward the close of the transition
period, unless economic or statistical considerations indicate otherwise.7Â°
Some of the propensity to lead in the timing of the roughly coincident
indicators is attributable to this

rule

of late dating.

We are reviewing the NBER business cycle chronology for the United
States since l91.8 by a close analysis of a set of 19 important indicators

relating to aggregate employment, income, expenditures, and sales. Historically these series tended to have the overall properties of roughly coincident

indicators. As many as 12 of them are real aggregates or indexes. Distributions of specific cycle turns, diffusion indexes and their ctmiulative

versions, and composite (amplitude-adjusted) indexes--all these methods of
distilling the relevant evidence are applied to this selection of series

as a whole and to its real and nominal subsets. This work is not yet
completed but the drift of the results is already emerging. Briefly, the
shifts in the present reference dates that may be indicated are small and

mainly limited

to a few peaks.

is

Some of them are well supported by the

therefore fortunate that "the consequences of errors and

shifts in reference dates for the analysis of timing relations among interdependent economic processes are not very troublesome. A common reference
point [date 1 offers a convenient short-cut device for measuring these relations, but the latter are independent of it" (Zarnowitz, "On the Dating
of Business Cycles," as cited, pp. 181i._185). This is so because obviously
the sequence of turning points in specific series is not affected by the
selection of a reference date.

T0There are some arguments against this rule, but those for it are
believed to have been stronger in the past (see ibid., p. 19-i-).

evidence,

others are stifl doubtful.71

2. How should we interpret and

use

the differences between (a) the

timing patterns at peaks and troughs; (b) the cyclical changes in real and
in nominal and price series?
There are important systematic elements in each of these distinctions.
They would not be significantly affected by any changes that might realistically be made in the U.S. business cycle chronology.

There is need to

place more emphasis in cyclical analysis on this double dichotomy and less
on overafl measures that cut across these divisions and conceal the systematic differences involved.

There are several reasons for the well-observed

peak-trough timing

differences. In late stages of expansion, production in many industries is
supported at high

and

even rising levels by the backlog of unfilled orders

accumulated earlier during the business upswing; hence, output and shipments
can continue increasing for some time after the downturn in demand (i.e.,

in currently received orders). In contrast, at the end of a contraction,
orders backlogs are depleted and capacity reserves plentiful, so that
when current orders turn up so does output with little delay.72 In general,
forces of growth help to prolong the expansion in aggregate economic activity
in its late, faltering phase even though declines had already occurred in
many partial indicators (economic processes and sectors); but the same forces

the former are: a change of the November 1911.8 peak to

1911.8 and a change of the May 1960 peak to April 1960 (perhaps also

the shift of the July 1957 peak date to August 1957). The two
larger and more uncertain changes would be: a shift of the Julysomewhat

also

help to shorten the contraction and hasten the transition to recovery.

The real indicators are being given a large total weight in our
study, particularly in determining the time-reference framework of the

analysis. There are special reasons for this emphasis in the present era
of sustained inflation, but these variables always deserved and attracted
much attention in business cycle studies, including those of the National

Bureau. However, nominal and price series must continue to be included
in these studies as well. Separate chronologies and other summary measures
for the sets of real and nominal indicators should be useful and will be
prepared in the course of this research project, but there is no good reason
to base the concept and the analysis of business cycles on the real indicators
only.

How is the current list of the main cyclical indicators to be assessed

in the light of this review?
The leading indicators on the NBER short list performed in recent

years (including the 1967 slowdown, the 1968-70 sequence of inflationary
boom and recession, and the recovery and expansion since 1971) about as well

as in the past.73 Of the roughly coincident indicators, one or two seem to

poorly. In particular,

personal income did not decline during either

(1970) or the previous (l9&)) recession. The series, wages and salaries

cident indicator is very good.1

Finally, the selection of the main lagging

indicators retains its validity on grounds of both the economic theory of
cyclical processes and the usefulness of statistical

applications, but it is

important to bear in mind that as many as three of the six series in this
group failed to show cyclical declines throughout this period.75
To sum up, most of the series now identified as the principal -indicators continue to meet the required standards, but in some cases substitutions

of different series within

the

same economic-process and timing categories

may well prove desirable. Since the ongoing review extends to many other
indicators (including, but not limited to, those presently published in BCD),

there will be many moDe additions and deletions to be considered.
Much further work is needed in several areas to which I already referred, notably on the concept, dating, and

indicators

of growth cycles, on

the relations between the ?tobjectivett indicators and the "subjective" anti-

cipations data, and on the economic policy indicators. These are promising
-

as well as important subjects to which
we hope to make some contributions,
but their exploration in depth will

obviously

require far more research than

can be undertaken within the scope of this project.

drastic reduction in the fluctuations of personal income reflects
the increased weight of
relatively stable or even countercyclical types of income (including the effects of fiscal and other
ttautomatic stabilizers"). However, inflation is also a factor: real (deflated) personal income did decline
during each of the five U.S. recessions of the post-World War
period.
Similarly, sales of retail stores, measured in current dollars, show no cyclical
decline that can be matched with the
1970 recession, but the corresponding series
in constant dollars does show such a decline.
