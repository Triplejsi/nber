Introduction
Many people have opinions on which colleges are

of good

quality and

which are poor; the bases of these judgments can range from the number of
Nobel

Laureates on the

faculty to the national ranking of the football

team. A more systematic analysis

features

of quality would

try to

identify the

of colleges which enable those whom the colleges are serving

(students, alumni, taxpayers or society as a whole) to best achieve their

goals. Here we are concerned with the characteristics of colleges which
serve to increase subsequent monetary incomes of those who attend.
Usually,

lifetime earnings are explained by variables such as innate

ability, experience in the

labor

force,

and years of education, although

other socio-economic, demographic and occupational

paper attempts to

add a new dimension to the earnings function analysis by hypothesizing the
features of colleges which might yield financial payoffS in later life,

and then testing to see which of these traits actually do add most to the

explanatory power of the traditional earnings function. Several methods
of identifying the mechanism by which these quality traits affect income
will be tested, including rates of return to quality estimates and tests

for the interaction of school quality with individual ability and with years
of schooling, and also interactions among the various quality traits.

There is a particular timeliness to this study. Several years ago in
his classic study, James Coleman argued that for elementary school students
differences in the characteristics of the schools that they attended were
unimportant compared to differences in other variables, in particular,
family background, in determining differential achievement rates among

students) More recently, Christopher Jencks has minimized the effects of
schooling in reducing cognitive and economic inequality.2 Samuel Bowles,3
an economist, and Alexander Astin,4 a psychologist, have come to similar
conclusions that differences in schools at various levels ranging from
elementary to higher education have only small effects on student changes

be they economic or cognitive. However, Astin5 does find that college

students demonstrate differential changes in affective behavior depending

upon the quality of the colleges they attended. Moreover, Spaeth and
Greeley found that their measures of quality had effects on occupational
prestige even after the addition of a number of other variables, which
seemed to have reduced quality to insignificance in the studies previously
referred to.6

Eric Hanushek found for a sample of elementary schools that even
though differences in expenditures did not seem to affect the learning
rates of children, there were certain measurable characteristics of

teachers which did have an impact. In particular, Hanushek found that
differences in teachers' verbal aptitudes, the newness of their training,
and racial differences, which he interprets as differences in quality of
the training of teachers, did significantly influence children's facility

in learning.7 An implication of this result is that expenditures don't
matter because school monies are spent on the wrong things. If school
expenditures are for seniority primarily rather than for verbal aptitudes,
quality of training, and recentness of training, then we would expect
little relationship between expenditures and other quantifiable measures
of quality to the effectiveness of the school.

To jump ahead to the major conclusion of this study, we find that at
the college level, differences in quality have highly significant effects

on differences in lifetime earnings patterns of students. These results
hold even after controlling for a wide array of other factors, including

individual student ability. It might be that expenditures at the college
level are more likely to purchase those inputs that will be effective.

During the period of our study, institutions of higher education were less
restricted by unions, teacher associations, and school boards in regard to

the types of inputs that they were able to purchase. Hence, even if the
same model were applicable to all levels of education, the input-output
relationships predictably should have been more effective at the college

level. It is a moot point whether the superior effectiveness of higher
education will be able to continue as unionism and other restrictions
grow at the college level.

Our enthusiasm for the relevance to policy of the current study

must be tempered somewhat because of the nature of the sample. It is
usually the case in social science research on micro data sets that
certain desirable characteristics of a sample to be studied will have to

be sacrificed in order to get other desirable characteristics. Some
samples that have attempted to follow groups of individuals over a number
of years have found drop—off rates in responses that result in terrible

biases. Other groups studied have had high response rates at the expense
of reducing the representativeness by selecting individuals from a par-

ticular state or group of high schools, for example. Other data sets

.

—5—

have of necessity lacked a rnmiber of particularly crucial variables, as

is the case when survey research is unable to acquire aptitude test

scores of the individuals being studied. Our sample has been characterized by statistically acceptable response rates and also by the availability of virtually all of the vital variables required for the models

to be specified below. However, the representativeness of the sample
has had to suffer.

The data used is now known as the NBER-Thorndike sample, and although
it has been described in detail in several other places,8 we might summarize

its imrta. characteristics here. The respondents were white World War
II veterans, all of whom took a battery of aptitude tests in 1942 to deter-

mine if they were qualified to be pilots. To take the test one had to have
above-average 1Q9 and be in good health. Those willing were surveyed by
Robert Thorndike in 1955 and by the National Bureau of Economic Research

again in 1969. They provided much information on earnings history, socioeconomic situation, and educational experience, including the names of

colleges attended as well as aptitude test scores)°

8For example, Taubman, P., and Wales, T. Education as an Investment and
Screening Device. New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, forthcoming.

9me IQ variable used is a combination constructed by factor analysis of
several of the AFQT tests and has a mean of .30 and a standard deviation
of 1.86.

0Ten thousand of these World War II veterans were surveyed by Thorndike,
and his work resulted in a book, Ten Thousand Careers. The same 10,000
people were sought by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 1969, and
approximately 6,000 of these people provided usable information to us.

—6—

This particular sample precludes us from generalizing some of our
results so that they might be most relevant for current policy debates.

In the first place, no blacks are included in the sample, and also there

are no people from the lower half of the 19 distribution. Hence, we
must continually keep in mind that our results apply primarily to white,

high-ability members of our population. We must constantly be cautious
of the temptation to apply our results to blacks, other minorities,

women (who are also not represented in our sample), and the less able

members of our society. If one argues that the models developed in the
work reported here apply directly to these groups, then inferences about

them might be made. However, if we feel that the factors determining
the earnings functions for these groups are different from those determining the earnings functions for the ones in our sample, or if we feel
the relationships between the factors and earnings would differ between
these groups, then we will have to restrict our conclusions to the group

studied. Rather than waiting for the perfect data set, we shall present
the results for the data that we have developed. The caveats just stated
must be kept in mind. However, the basic result——the significance of
quality of college attended on lifetime earnings patterns--is important
enough to justify what follows.

Two general types of attributes of colleges can be isolated and

measured (if imperfectly). They are as follows:

1. Student QualitI. The argument is that a student benefits more
from college, and hence acquires more of whatever colleges give that enhances future earning power, when surrounded by high quality fellow

.

—7—

students. This has been

called

the peer effect. Intuitively, it does seem

that the opportunity to interact with intelligent and motivated peers should

enrich the college experience. We have several measures of average student
quality by schools: the average Scholastic Aptitude Test (S.A.T.) scores
of entering freshmen,11 and an index of intellectuality of students obtained
by Alexander Astin through factor analysis.

12

Another variable which has

been developed by Astin, an index of selectivity based upon average level
of S.A.T. scores is also used as a dimension of quality.

2. Instructional Quality. The second aspect of college quality is
the excellence of faculty. The hypothesis here is that better faculty
instill in students traits which will be beneficial in subsequent years.
13

One measure of faculty quality is average faculty salary.

The assump-

tion is that higher paid faculty have either more experience (and higher
rank), better teaching ability, more professional prestige from research,

or greater opportunities to earn elsewhere; all of these being indicators

course an individual's IQ will be highly correlated with his S.A.T.
scores. However, here we are looking at the effect of average S.A.T.'s
of all students at a college on an individual's subsequent income, controling for the individual's IQ.

of greater productivity in their professorial roles)4 Another measure of
school quality is school expenditure for instruction, research and library

per full-time equivalent student. Here, the argument is that high quality
faculty are attracted by expenditures beyond those on salaries alone.

Also, holding these expenditures per faculty member constant, a larger
expenditure per student implies a greater teacher/student ratio.15 Thus,
this measure is a test of the influence of teacher/student ratios as well.

The hypothesis is that both expenditures per faculty member
and faculty per student are aspects of quality.16 Unfortunately,
data of this kind ignore differing definitions of "full-time faculty" at

different colleges. Teaching loads range from one course to four or more
per semester at different colleges and these differences may alter teacher

effectiveness. Other problems with this proxy for quality arise since it
allows for no nonpecuniary attractiveness of particular colleges for par-

ticular faculty members. Schools located in undesirable areas (urban
ghettos with high crime rates or isolated rural areas with no cultural
life) may be forced to pay high salaries for even mediocre quality faculty.

140ne might ask about the relationship between these traits and academic
salaries; and also which of these have more important affects on students'

16Quality can be thought of as attributes of colleges which increase
learning which, in turn, makes students able to earn larger incomes in
later life.

—9—

Schools with attractive surroundings (scenery, a few top scholars, cultural

life or exceptionally good research and teaching equipment and plant) may

be able to attract high quality faculty for low salaries. Low salaries
may be paid to top quality faculty where opportunities for lucrative out-

side consulting jobs abound. Of course, students may or may not get
benefit from "good" faculty who are away consulting much of the time. In
any case, the hypothesis we will test is that schools which pay large
salaries to faculty members who meet relatively small groups of students

are more beneficial to students' subsequent earning power than those
which pay low salaries or have large classes.

A related quality measure refers to the total incomes or expendi-

tures per student of the colleges. It might be argued that schools
which spend (or receive) larger amounts per enrollee provide a higher
quality education, an educational experience more beneficial in post—
school years.

As an additional test of school quality we have a subjective measure

made by Gourman. These ratings propose to be a "consensus of reliable
opinion and judgment obtained from many and various sources deemed to be

dependable and accurate.17 The study evaluates individual departments as
well as administration, faculty, student services and other general areas

such as library facilities. An average of all items is calculated,

17Gourman, 1. The Gourman Report. Phoenix: The Continuing Education
Institute, 1967.

— 10 —

resulting

in an overall Gourman Index between 200 and 800. The interpretation

of these ratings depends upon the weights given to the various criteria.

Unfortunately, these weights are not published. However, the index is one of
the few quantitative ratings of a large number of colleges.

There is aquestion of whether or not all the measures of quality are
really standing for the same thing. Table 1 presents correlations between
pairs of college attributes. In qeneral these exceed .5.
Table 2 presents regressions with individual colleges as units of ob-

servation. These enable us to consider the relationships between the nonmonetary quality measures and the expenditure data and school size. It is
obvious that the non—dollar quality measures are significantly influenced
by expenditures as a whole, faculty salaries, and size of student body.

Size is negatively related to average SA.T. scores and the Astin measures;
that is, better peer group influences apparently are found in smaller

schools. Gourman ratings are positively influenced by size. Interestingly,
we explain about 50 per cent of the variance in the peer group measures by
our model, but 70 per cent of the Gourman ratings are explained.
It is interesting to compare these relationships with those discussed

by Charles Elton in a recent paper)8 Elton finds that in quality ratings of grad-

uate departments de by people engaged in academic careers, there is a
very strong relationship between size of department and its quality rating.

correlated the quality measures obtained by Allan Cartter19 and by
20

ose and Anderson with the number of areas of specialization within a
department, number of faculty, number of Ph.D. degrees awarded, number of
full-time students, number of first—year students, and ratio of part-time

to full-time students. He found that tests of statistical significance
indicated that these variables differentiated the departmental ratings

beyond chance expectations. He concludes that in the ratings obtained
from opinion-poll type surveys, the prime determinant of the probability

of a department having a high-quality rating is its size, as measured by

the variables noted. The Gourman ratings that we use resemble the
Cartter-type ratings in that they are derived from opinions of an in-

dividual. It is for this quality variable that undergraduate enrollment is significantly and positively related to the institutional rating.

On the other hand, enrollment or institutional size is negatively or insignificantly related to measures of average SAT scores of entering

freshmen, either those obtained from Case and Birnbaum21 or those derived

The implication is that we might want to focus on

quality measures, at least in part, which are based on more or less objective data rather than exclusively on quality variables derived by
surveying opinions.

It should be noted that quality variables used below are based either

on undergraduate evidence, like the SAT-score data, or on university—wide
characteristics, such as expenditure data and the Gourman

ratings.

In

other words, a school is evaluated equally regardless of whether an individ-

ual attended it as a graduate or an undergraduate student. An implicit
assumption in these cases is that the quality rankings of an institution
in its undergraduate schools do not differ from the quality rankings based
on its graduate programs.

We do have ratings of graduate schools that have been prepared by

specific departments. We were less anxious to make use of these graduate
ratings for a number of reasons. If we could specify not only the institution attended for graduate training by the individual in our sample but
also the department, then the departmental ratings by graduate schools would

be optimal. However, since we do not know what departments were attended by
our respondents, we would be forced to weight the ratings of the different
departments and combine them into one rating of the graduate institution as

a whole. Secondly, most of the departmental ratings of graduate schools
are provided for only a certain number of schools, particularly the best

22Astin, A.W. Who Goes to Collee? Chicago: Science Research Associates, 1965.

.

— 15 —

schools.

Although the Roose—Anderson ratings have been expanded to cover

well over 100 graduate schools, many of those graduate schools attended

by our respondents were not included. In our sample only 775 people
attended graduate schools that had Roose—Anderson ratings. One thousand
and ninety-two people attended graduate schools that had our Gourman ratings.

However, we did want to make sure that using university—wide
ratings (Gourman)

was not a significantly inferior strategy than that

of using the Roose—Anderson ratings for those who attended graduate

school. Table 3 makes the appropriate comparisons. In our earnings
function, which is developed below, we insert in the first column the
quality of the undergraduate
by Gourman,

and

graduate schools attended, as measured

and in the second column, the quality of the undergraduate

school as measured by Gourman

and

of the graduate school as measured by

Roose and

Anderson. The explanatory power of the

model is virtually

decimal places. Moreover, this significance of the

graduate quality variable is almost identical as well. Other variables
have similar effects also. Comparing Column 1 and Column 4 reveals that
the results using Gourman

and graduate institution do not vary too much depending upon the size of

when the two graduate-quality variables enter together, the high degree of
correlation between them reduces their individual coefficients to statistical insignificance.
Given these results, it was decided that the work of this study would

III.

The Empirical Estimates

This study only considers those with at least some college. For purposes of some of the work reported below, individual's were included in
the regressions only if they attended colleges for which all the quality

measures were available. This was done so that comparisons between different quality measures in the regressions would not be clouded by varying

degrees of freedom. (We would have to eliminate individuals in particular
regressions when the quality measure was not available for their schools,
or the computer would assign a value of zero to quality which is wrong.)
There were 1,511 people in this sample.

The question arises whether this biases the study due to the par-

ticular

types of schools remaining for which all the quality data are

available. Biases would exist if one particular quality of school refused information. At first glance, one might predict that schools of
low quality would be the ones reluctant to
generally

report.

However this is not

true. Many schools provide the services of granting college

educations and degrees to high school graduates who are not qualified
to enter schools generally considered to be high quality institutions.

It is in the interest of these low quality schools to become known by

less qualified college aspirants. On the other hand, a number of
schools with "good reputations" may
for fear

be

reluctant to report statistics

of revealing quantitative evidence that their reputations may

not be fully justified. Hence there appear to be reasons why both
high and low quality schools would not report. Some schools may have

reasons, unrelated to quality, for not reporting. For example, some

A potentially more serious problem with the quality data is that

the

27The colleges remaining in our sample range from the very top to the

Some implications of this and comparisons with less restricted samples
will be described below.

It will

be shown below that the quality measures for later periods

is

were obtainable, these would reveal an oven stronger relationship with
earnings. However, the
important

question of effects of college quality are too

to put aside on the grounds that current data are imperfect.3°

Eymonerie of the American Association of University Professors, Washington,
D.C. The thirty—six schools were not identified specifically but represent
a cross section of American colleges.

30it has been suggested that if graduates from certain colleges earned
high incomes for reasons unrelated to our quality measures, they might
have subsequently donated large sums to their Alma Mater• This would
have enabled colleges to then obtain high marks in our quality measures.
In this case high incomes supported high quality. Moreover high current
incomes might be due to current prestige of ones Alma Mater regardless
of the quality during the time attended.

For

graduate departments there have been periodic ratings of quality

since 1925. We 8elected studies made in 1925, 1957, and 1969. We then
aggregated department rankings to give each of the schools that appeared

in all three rankings an overall institutional ranking for each year. We
than took rank correlations of the school standings over time. It appears
that the correlations between rankings in 1969 and 1957 and the correlation

between rankings in 1957 and 1925 both were approximately .7. The correlation between rankings in 1969 and 1925 was .54. Hence, it appears that

even

over long periods of time institutional quality has bean roughly con-

stant.

These rankings of graduate schools over time appear in Table 5.

ent quality measures. It appears that regardless of how quality is
measured,

of

one's school significantly

affect the log of

earnings (i.e., log of 1969 earnings). These affects are

after controlling for the individual's IQ, years of education and experi-

ence. The t-values on quality (ten measures) range from 3.744 to 6.049
with 1,506 degrees of freedom. Here we use a single variable——the quality
of last college attended (graduate or undergraduate where appropriate).
We should pause at this point to note that the coefficient on years
of schooling is only slightly over .03 in all the earnings functions of

and received subsistence payments as well. As an approximation we assume
that, as students, our sample members received $100 per month plus tuition

In order to estimate rates of return to years in college, we should

multiply the years coefficient by 2.85. The rates of return appear to be
roughly 9.7 per cent. Gary Becker estimated the returns to a white male
college graduate to be 13 per cent in 1949.

34

There are several reasons why the present estimates are below those

of others. First, our sample includes only people who have at least some
college education; and so, our coefficients reflect the return to an extra
year of college not the return to college training compared to the return

to high school attendance. The second reason for the low rates of return
to higher education (relative to previous studies) is the preponderance of

teachers in our sample. Teachers have high education and relatively low

annual earnings. This

exception

is noted explicitly in some of the later

it has

—30—

regression estimates. Finally, an examination of the drop outs in our sample
indicates that they were usually pulled out of school by good earnings
opportunities, not pushed out due to poor achievement.
Another reason for the apparent low pay of f to extra "raw years" in

school is that we are controlling for college quality. It is probably the
case that those with more years also attended higher quality institutions.35
Thus part of the return to extra years is reflected in returns to quality

rather than returns to years. The coefficient on years rises to slightly
over .04 when quality variables are omitted from the earnings functions;

and this would imply a rate of return to years not controlling for quality

of about 12 per cent. Of course, the ability variable also detracts from
the coefficient on years, since there is a positive relationship between
innate ability and educational attainment.36
After establishing that quality is important, however measured, the
task of inferring which aspect of quality is most important is more diffi-

cult. The question we are raising here is not the rate of return to different types of college quality, but, more simply, the effect of certain
aspects

of quality on

income. Mere we are looking at the significance

of

35

The correlation between years and quality of the last school attended

is about 25.

on years when the IQ is omitted of about 30 per cent. This depends on the
specification of their model and on the particular measure of IQ used.

closely followed by the average S.A.T. scores of entering freshmen and

Astin's measures of intellectuality and selectivity. One is tempted to
conclude that faculty quality and peer group effects are the most important
(in terms of subsequent earnings) features of college quality.

The peer

group effects are in line with the conclusions of James Coleman in the
study of lower levels of education.37

be a better proxy for the innate ability of the particular student than

captured by our individpicking up ability traits of the individual not

The relative weakness of the expenditure data might be explained by
the

fact that they are deflated by the number of full-time equivalent

students. Indeed, average faculty salary, a prime component of expendi-

tures, is the most powerful measure of quality. Welch has argued that

for state elementary and high school systems, size is a factor having a

significant positive effect on earnings; that is, an important aspect of

quality as we

define quality.39 If colleges enrolling a large

enrolling fewer

expenditures per

student are high because expenditures are high, holding constant size of

college, we would expect a strong positive relationship with later earn-

ings. On the other hand, if the variable is large because the number of
students is small, holding expenditures constant, we would expect a
n.gative relationship between the ratio and income • In a large sample of

schools, the expenditures per student probably vary for both reasons and

so the over all effect is blurred. Another reason to suspect that the

projects

which makes students more productive (i.e. what value is there

to earning ability of gardening expenses for the college greenery). Of
course, a happier student may learn more and hence earn more.

We can calculate a quality elasticity of income--the percentage

change in income for a percentage change in quality. However, these

elasticities

cannot be used to compare impacts of quality. A 1 per

cent change in average S.A.T. level is not comparable to a 1 per cent

change in average salary. These elasticities are presented in Table 6
(second line from the bottom). If we could calculate the cost of a 1
per cent change in each of the quality measures, only then could we see

the returns to each. This will be attempted later in this paper.
Table 7 presents two specifications of the earnings equation which

include more than one quality variable. In the first, it is evident
that average salary and S.A.T. scores have separate and statistically

significant influences on income. The second version shows that when
additional types of quality measures are added, the importance of faculty
salaries and average S.A.T. scores still stand out, but the other vari-

ables add nothing extra statistically. It appears that two separate and
important aspects of quality can be identified, namely, faculty quality
and peer group (student) effects.4°

40A8 stated earlier, the significance of the average S.A.T. scores might
be measuring the effects of students' own abilities not captured by IQ.
However, there seems to be no reason why 1963 S.A.T. scores would better
represent ability than would the ability measures taken in the Air Force
usually before college attendance. Other variables used to measure
quality apparently relate to income only as proxies for the same effects
measured by faculty salaries and average S.A.T. scores. Of course, it

might be that other aspects of quality are important but are omitted from
our model or are merely poorly measured.

IV. The Interaction Between Years of Schooling and College Quality
To measure college quality's impact by the characteristics of the
last college attended by an individual is a useful technique to provide
answers to questions about the relative importance of various college
attributes and changes in these intportances over an individual's life

cycle. However, it appears that quality does indeed have a differential
effect depending upon the number of years of schooling obtained. Since
this is the case, we must give more attention to the particular specification of the earnings functions which include measure of college
quality.

Table 8 reestimates the earnings functions for six of the cases

reported earlier. The earnings function in this case inserts a measure
of undergraduate quality for those with sixteen or fewer years of schooling and a measure of graduate quality for those who attended graduate

school. In this case, the results are similar to the earlier ones except it appears that undergraduate quality is more important for those
with sixteen or less years of schooling than is graduate quality for

those who go on.41 The coefficients on Q were higher and the t-tests

positive correlation between 2UG and

for those with more than

sixteen years implies the coefficient on graduate quality is higher than
it would be if Q were entered for those with more than sixteen years.

When this was done the Q variable was not significant for those with
more than sixteen years. On the other hand, several individuals attended
graduate schools for which average faculty salary and average S.A.T. scores
were not available. Hence, in those cases the GRAD appears as 0 and this
tends to lower the slope of the graduate quality coefficients in these two
cases.

in all cases compared to GRAD Since quality appears to

affect differently those who did and those who did not go on to graduate

school, we are led to subdivide the sample further.42 Since the quality
effects differed by years of attainment, it is logical to run separate
earnings functions for those with sixteen or less years of schooling and for

those with seventeen or more years. This was done in Table
one

case reported in Table 4 (Gourman-—larger, less exclusive sample) was

undergraduate

quality statistically significant for those who went on to

graduate school. However, in almost all cases, impact of the last quality
was greater (or equal) for those with more years; clearly the effects of
quality appear greater for this group if we combine effects of undergraduate

and graduate quality. These results are at odds with

Table

those presented in

8, where the impact of quality was greater for those with sixteen

or less years. However, in the specification used in Table 9 we are no

if they attended. Columns 7 through 10 contain a larger sample, omitting
only those without Gourman and expenditure data. The larger sample had a

lower mean IQ and lower average "Gourman" quality schools. It is interesting to note that the lower quality sample revealed smaller impacts of

college quality than did the more exclusive groups. This will lead us into
our study of the interaction between ability and quality in the next
section.

longer constraining the coefficients on other variables to be the same

regardless of years attained, since we estimate different functions by
years

of schooling. We can also note that those with seventeen or more

years probably were of the highest ability and so the interaction between IQ and quality is suggested.

It might be the case that the differences which are observed by
comparing coefficients on most variables in Table 8 with those in
Table

9 are

not

statistically significant. The question arises whether

it is necessary to separate individuals by schooling attainment in order
to estimate earnings functions--whether or not there are statistically
significant differences in the functional forms according to the number

of

years obtained. Moreover, it is possible that structures might

differ according

to attainment of individuals separated more finely than

merely between those with sixteen or fewer and seventeen or more years

schooling. In particular,
for those who have received a

of

we might suspect that the

earnings function

bachelor's degree differs from those who

attended college but withdrew before obtaining the degree. To answer
this type of question, CHOW tests were performed on the earnings func-

tions presented in Table 10. Here we have earnings functions for those
with fewer than sixteen years of schooling, exactly sixteen years of
schooling, and more than sixteen years of schooling, along with an earnings

function for the total sample.

CHOW tests were performed by com-

paring the earnings functions structure of those with less than sixteen
years with those people having sixteen years, and also by comparing

those with sixteen or fewer years with those with more than sixteen years.

In each case the null hypothesis is that the two functions being compared

do not have statistically different structures, Comparing the function of
those with fewer than sixteen years to those with exactly sixteen years
we cannot reject the null hypothesis and so conclude that these two func-

tions have the same structures in a statistical sense. However, when
comparing those with sixteen or fewer years with those with more than
sixteen years, the F value exceeds its critical level and, hence, we are

led to reject the hypothesis that the structures are the same. This
suggests that the two earnings functions estimated for those with six-

teen or fewer years and those with more than sixteen years do indeed
differ statistically
The important conclusion from this section is that the effects of
quality and the other variables introduced in our earnings function
differ according to whether or not post-graduate education is obtained.

However, there is no need to separate individuals with no graduate work
into groups depending on whether or not they obtained the bachelors

degree. This leads us to accept the conclusion suggested by Table 9,
namely, that the impacts of quality are greater for those with postgraduate training compared to those with sixteen or fewer years of
schooling.

44When comparing those with less than sixteen years to those with exactly
sixteen years the calculated F was .3576 and the critical F was 1.84 at the
5 per cent level. Hence we cannot reject the null hypothesis and conclude
that the two cases have the same structure. When comparing those with sixteen or fewer years to those with seventeen or more the calculated F is
3.790 and the critical F is 2.25 at the 1 per cent level. Hence we reject
H and include the two structures are different.

However, in a few of our tests, we continue to estimate one earnings
function for those with only undergraduate, and those with graduate train-

ing combined. In these cases, we see effects of quality when other variables are constrained to have the same (average) influence regardless of
years attained.

V. Results at Different Points on the

Life

Cycle

College quality, no matter how defined, does affect earnings twenty

years after attending. It is also interesting to ask whether or not
quality of college has an increasing or decreasing effect on earnings over

time. To this end, we estimated earnings functions which include two

quality arjables_undergraduate college quality for those with sixteen
or fewer years of schooling, and quality of graduate school for those

Table 11 four occupational dummies are inserted to account for exceptional

income-schooling relationships. Pilots generally had high earnings considering their education. Teachers usually have much schooling and low
incomes due to fewer hours and alleged non—pecuniary rewards. Doctors
have high incomes, partially due to monopoly elements in their profession;

however, the reason for high pay for lawyers is less clear. The average
of coefficients on

and

is not much different than the comparable

coefficients in Table 8.

It should be noted, however, that in terms of significance of the
quality variables (t-tests or addition to a2), the 1969 and 1955 results

are rather similar. Moreover, IQ has roughly the same effects on earnings
in both years, and for some reason the coefficient on experience is

greater

in 1955.

noted

Another difference is that the coefficient on years of

variable is smaller when using 1955 education. It should be

that in 1955 respondents averaged about 6.6 years of experience.

46lndividuals were eliminated unless all three appropriate quality
measures were available for them. When the regression for Gourman was
rerun not eliminating for absent S.A.T. or salary data, the sample was
larger, of slightly lower IQ, and had slightly lower average college
and
quality. In that case, for all three years both the
had

smaller (but significant)coefficients. This indicates a positive interaction betieén IQ and school quality.

There

is

evidence that there is a positive relationship between

education

and

years of

investment in on-the-job training. It is likely that those

with more years of schooling had been foregoing more earnings while in-

vesting on the job in the first few years of employment. However, by six
years out, returns to all human capital acquired appear, and so differences

in income by education are clouded. On the one hand more earnings are
foregone by the more highly educated as they obtain more training. On
the other hand, this group begins to reap returns to their human capital.

The less educated group invests less in OJT (less income is foregone), but
their earnings are lower.

Table 11 also shows earnings functions explaining income in the
initial year of employment (when experience for each respondent was

zero). Years of education still has a significantly positive effect with
coefficients of over .045. If the argument concerning the 1955 regressions were true, we would expect a negative relationship between income
and years of schooling in the first year in the labor force.

The argu-

ment is that the more educated person is investing further by giving up

income to acquire on—the-job training. Here it appears the more educated
earn more in the first year.
The IQ variable now becomes significantly negative, perhaps indi-

cating a tendency for those more able to invest more on—the—job training in initial years in the

labor

force. If the relationship between

ability and investment in on-the-job training is stronger than that between years

of

education and OJT, this might explain why the coefficient

—47—

on

years remains significantly positive in the initial year earnings func-

tions. Moreover, to the extent that years of schooling serves as a credential, or screening device, to allocate those with more years into
better paying first jobs (which still might provide on-the-job training),
we would also expect a positive coefficient on years.
Another

points

problem in

comparing the earnings functions at different

in the life cycle is the differences in data reliability. The

1969 income data were obtained in a 1970 survey and the 1955 income was

learned from a survey in 1955. However, the initial year's income was

obtained by asking a "recall" question in 1969. The implication is that
the initial year earnings figures are far inferior to those from the
other two years studied.
Schooling quality

is never statistically significant in the initial

year earnings functions for either those with sixteen or fewer years or

those with graduate training. It is apparent that the importance of
college quality grows with experience in

in better colleges are better prepared to benefit

Tables 12 and 13 reestimate the earnings functions for different

points

in the life cycle separately for individuals who attended sixteen

or fewer years and for individuals who attended graduate school. More—
over, in these estimates education is defined as that education possessed

by

the individuals in 1955, and the occupational categories are also

based on 1955 responses rather than responses obtained in 1969. Despite

these revisions in the estimates, the results are virtually identical with

the previous table. Education is significant throughout the period, as is
IQ generally. However, college and graduate school quality is not significant for either group in their first year in the labor force, but it
becomes statistically significant by 1955 for both groups and becomes
even more significant with a larger coefficient in the 1969 earnings func-

tion. It is also interesting to note that about 6 per cent of the variance
for those who had sixteen or fewer years of education can be explained in

each of the years. However, for those with some graduate education the
R2 rises from roughly .06 in the initial year of earnings to .12 in 1955

and to .19 in 1969. It appears that the variables in our earnings function become progressively more important determinants of earnings over
time for those with the highest levels of education, whereas the factors

not included play a larger and constant role over time for those with
sixteen or fewer years of schooling.47

large amount of variance in individearnings not explainable by traditional variables to the fact that
luck and random forces predominate and are the main influences on individual income
47Christopher Jencks attributes the

ual

differences. Certainly there are random elements involved in
lifetime earnings streams. We would like to stress the things we do know
about income determination rather than the things we don't know. However,
it does appear from these regressions at different points in the life
cycle that random elements are a weaker force for those people who attend

graduate school, and this luck or randomness seems to decline over time
for those who have attended graduate school. On the other hand, the unexplainable portion of income differences among individuals is the same
for those

with sixteen or fewer and those with more than sixteen years of
schooling when they initially enter the labor force. However, the role
of these random forces does not seem to decline over time for those who
do not go to graduate school, contrary to what happens for those who do
go on.

.

—51—

The strong results we get when we attempt to explain differences in
individual incomes at different points in the life cycle lead us to see

whether a similar model explains the growth rate of income for individ-

uals between the years 1955 and 1969. It appears

once

again in Table 14 that we

can only explain a small amount of the difference in growth rates among
individuals for those who had sixteen or fewer years of education.
Moreover, none of the variables in the model that were significant in
explaining income differences in any one year had a t-value greater
than 2 when used to explain the growth rate of income between the two

dates specified. For those with more than sixteen years of schooling
the R2 is almost . 15, more than four times greater than the R2 for the
undergraduates.

and

quality

It appears that differences in years of education, IQ,

of at least undergraduate school have statistically sig-

nificant effects in explaining the growth rate of income. These results are even more difficult to interpret because of the small sample
sizes. The samples are small because the income growth figure was calculated only for those who had incomes in both 1955 and 1969.

VI. How Quality Makes Its Impact

Earlier in the paper we noted that institutional variables relating
to student quality and some relating to faculty salaries were separate

and significant determinants of college quality. Since then, we have
reverted to using the Gourman

ratings

as our measure of quality.

These are highly correlated with the S.A.T. and salary data but are avail-

able for a larger number of institutions. This enables our sample sizes

to

be larger, a fact that is particularly important when we start sub-

dividing the samples. This section will continue to employ

ratings

the

Gourman

for these reasons.

The assumption so far

has been

that quality has its impact as a

Continuous variable. The assumption is that not only do good schools
mean more in terms of lifetime earnings than do bad schools, but also
that schools better by a certain number of points are worth a certain

amount more in terms of lifetime income. That is, there is some transformation coefficient that can tell us how much more in terms of, say,
dollars in 1969 it was worth to our respondents to have attended a

school better than another by a certain number of quality points. It
is now time to ask whether quality does function as a continuous variable or whether the significance of quality when used as a continuous
variable resulted merely because gross differences in schools are important but fine gradations of differences are not.

To this end, we separated our sample into those with sixteen or
fewer years and those with seventeen or more years, and within each of

those two subgroups we looked at individuals who had attended schools

in each of four quality quartile rankings. These results appear as
Tables 15 and 16. For those without any graduate training, the coefficients on undergraduate quality within each quality quartile was

virtually always insignificant. In several quality quartiles the coefficient on quality was negative also. Variations on quality within
a quartile appear to be significant only for those who attended schools
in the top quality quartile.*
*The significant quality variable was the expenditure per student - a
different criteria than the one used to divide individuals into "quality
quartiles."

For

the undergraduates it should be noted that the effect of years

attended rose continually from the lowest to the highest quartile. This
is a sign of a positive interaction between years attended and college

quality in affecting lifetime earnings. More about this will come later.
It also appears that the impact of IQ rises continually from the lowest
to the second—highest quality quartile, but IQ becomes statistically insignificant for those attending schools ranked in the top-quality quartile.

The results for those students who had at least some graduate

training are quite similar. For students attending schools in the
lower two quality quartiles, the quality of their undergraduate or
graduate school attended was insignificant and at times negative.

surprisingly, those who attended graduate schools ranked in the third
(next to highest) quartile revealed significant effects of quality of

graduate schools on 1969 earnings, and those in the fourth quartile, or
the highest quality schools, revealed a somewhat weaker effect than was
revealed in the third quartile,

but

one nearer to significance compared

to those in the lower half of the quality distribution. It also appears
that the effect of years attended on income falls between the lowest and
next—to-highest quality quartile but is highest and significant in the

top—quality quartile also. Differential impacts of IQ across quality
quartiles also appears U—shaped, with IQ being most significant in the
lowest quartile, declining through the third quartile, and being relatively high again in the top-quality quartile.

.

— 57

The results for both

—

undergraduate

and graduate students appear to

imply that although large differences in college quality matter, once

we have subdivided individuals according to gross differences in the
types of college attended, small differences within these categories

don't much matter. As a test, we developed a set of dummy variables
that for any individual equaled zero in three cases and one for the

variable representing that quality quartile in which the school he

attended fell. We then estimated an earnings function for all those
with sixteen or fewer years and then for all those with more than sixteen years, inserting dummy variables representing three of the four

quality quartiles. This estimate appears as Table 17. It appears
that to be in the top—quality quartile of schools

implies a higher in-

come, and to be in the bottom quartile implies a smaller income than
average, but the two middle quartiles basically yield average coeffi-

cients. We then

divided

quality distribution of schools into
eighths rather than quarters and inserted seven of the
eight dummies as
independent variables in the earnings function. This is presented in
Table 18. Once

higher—than_average income. Moreover, it also appeared that those who
attended schools of the lowest quality had

lower-than-average incomes.

In conclusion, it appears that it matters whether you are attending a

good or a bad school. It is better to go to a good school. However, within
any set of, say, good schools, it does not matter much about small differences in quality.
Another way to look at sante type of question is to see the significance

of quality, as measured by the Gourman ratings, for schools within a par-

ticular categorization of institutions. The categorization we select is that
of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. They place institutions into
categories such as "leading" and "other research" institutions (codes 10 and
20), "large" and "small doctoral—granting" institutions (codes 30 and 40),
four-year
60),

and

colleges with "large" and "small program selections" (codes 50 and

and "liberal arts" colleges,

"highly selective," and "others"

(codes 70

80). We have combined certain of these categories and looked at the

effects of Gourman quality on earnings of individuals who attended particular
categories of institutions.

Table 19 reveals that for those without graduate training, differences
in expenditures per student, as well as differences in Gourman ratings, were

significant factors in income determination, even when students were initially
categorized into those who attended one of the four university types and those

who attended one of the four types of college. However, quality differences
set to matter more (according to the t-test) for those attending universities
than it did for those attending colleges. For those who had some graduate
training, it appeared that differences in Gourman rating or expenditures

per

student were significant for those who attended graduate school at leading

research or doctoral-granting institutions (codes 10 through 40). Apparently,

134 people who went to graduate school went to institutions with codes between 50 and 80. Presumably, these were people who got only a master's
degree, and for them differences in Gourman or expenditures were not significant factors in the earnings function.
It should be noted that when individuals were further separated into

finer classifications, as determined by Carnegie (that is, research universities, doctoral-granting universities, four-year colleges, and liberal
arts colleges), it appeared that quality became progressively less inipor—

tant as the Carnegie codes

increased

for undergraduates as well as for

graduates.48 However, it should be noted that for both those with less
than

seventeen

and with seventeen or more years of schooling, differences

in quality were most

significant

for those at research institutions and

for those at doctoral-granting institutions. When the average S.A.T.
scores of entering freshmen and average faculty salary variables were
used as measures of quality within Carnegie classes, they were signif i—

cant primarily at the leading research universities and doctoral institu-

tions as we1l. These results are not presented.
We have established that small differences in quality of institutions attended do not explain income differences among individuals

categorized according to the quartile rating of the university they

attended.

-

However, quality does explain income differences among people

categorized according to the type

of

institution attended. This implies

that the variation in quality of institutions categorized into combined
Carnegie classifications is greater than is the variance in quality

among institutions classified by quality quartiles. When we look at
smaller combinations of Carnegie classes or at individual Carnegie
classes, it appears that college quality is not as important an explanatory variable in explaining income differences of people attending
a particular type of college.

VII. The Trade-Off Between Quantity and Quality of Education
So far we have determined that quality coefficients increase in
size and significance with years of school attended (the coefficients
are higher for those with graduate school training compared to those

with only undergraduate training). Moreover, the years's coefficient
rises as the quality of colleges attended by undergraduates rises (the
evidence is from comparing quality quartiles into which those attend-

ing sixteen or fewer years have been divided). The year's coefficient
is U-shaped when comparing graduate quality quartiles for those with

seventeen or more years. That is, the year's coefficient is high in
the lowest quartile, falls in the second quality quartile, but continues to rise, with the highest quality quartile demonstrating the

largest year's coefficient. These results imply that the payoff to
going to a good school is higher if you go to school for more years.

— 64

However, this does not answer the question of whether we can say that two
years at Harvard are better than more years at a lower quality institution.

Rather, these results imply that more years at Harvard are worth more than

years at Harvard.

fewer

years according

those people who attended school for seventeen or

to the

quality of their undergraduate

institution.

The

purpose here is to see whether the quality of a graduate school and

the

impact of more years attended varied according to the undergraduate

institution attended. It does appear that the year's coefficient is
significantly greater for those who attended undergraduate schools ranked

in the lowest two quality quartiles. The year's coefficient is not even
statistically significant according to the t-test for those in the top

half of the undergraduate quality distribution. Hence, it appears that
extra years are more important for those who went to a bad undergraduate

school than for those who went to a good one. Moreover, it appears that
the payoff to quality of graduate school rises continuously as we move
from individuals who attended the lowest quality undergraduate schools

to those who attended the next-to-highest quality. However, for those
who attended the highest quality undergraduate schools the payoff to

quality of graduate school is almost as low as that in any quartile. It
appears that there is a complementarity between the quality of undergraduate

school and the quality of graduate school. Once again even though you can
partially compensate for going to a bad sähool by attending for more years,

the payoff to going to a good school is higher for those whose earlier experience was also at a good school.

VIII.The

Differences in Effects of Quality in
Public and in Private Institutions
There

are a number of reasons for looking at the effects of quality

of institutions attended broken down according

to those who attended pri-

vate institutions and those who attended public ones. In the first place,
the question might be raised of whether or not a private institution can

allocate

its expenditures more effectively and, hence, make a given ex-

penditure per full-time equivalent student more effective in terms of

lifetime benefits for the student. Here I refer to the multitude of
constituencies that, by necessity, are served by a public institution.
If one looks at athletic programs, for example, it seems that in general

it is the public schools that engage in these most extensively.* It might
be that a public institution has a greater diversity of objectives than

does private institutions, regardless of its quality. This does appear
to be the case. Tables 21 and 22 show that basic expenditures per
student and expenditures on faculty, research, and library facilities
both affect those with sixteen or fewer and seventeen or more years of
schooling more when they attend a private school than when they attend a

public school. This implies to me that any level of expenditures will be
directed towards activities which are more beneficial in terms of future

lifetime

earnings by a private school.

Moreover, it appears that
the Gourman Index,

the

returns to quality,

are higher for those attending private than for those

attending public schools. The Gourman

of characteristics,

as measured by

Index

is a composite of a number

including size of the institution. Hence, it appears

*For example, in Playboy Magazine's predictions of the 1973 top
twenty college football teams in the nation, they anticipate that 17 of the
top twenty teams will be from public institutions. See Playboy, September,
1973. p. 172.

that

one might obtain a high Gourman

rating

for many different reasons,

including size of institution, effectiveness of instruction, interest

might

of alumni, quality of students, etc. One
effectiveness of Gourman

quality

explain the greater

in the private schools by the fact

that a private school with a high Gourman rating might have obtained
that high rating because of different characteristics than those pos-

sessed by a public school with high ratings. For example, a private
school might be rated high because of the effectiveness of its instructional

proqram, whereas a public school might be rated high be-

cause of its size. However, it is useful to note that whether quality
is

measured in terms of expenditures per student or in terms of this

subjective evaluation, the payoff to quality is higher at private in-

stitutions. This probably

says something about the meaning of the

quality variables and implies that a high rating on a quality index of

one kind or another might mean a number of things. Probably the privatepublic differentiation is a significant way of subdividing the quality

measures. This does not say that private schools are more effective for
obtaining higher lifelong earnings than are public institutions. Rather
the results imply that if one had to choose between two schools with the
same quality ratings, the private school would be the more effective one.

IX. The Interaction Between School Quality and
Ability of the Individuals Who Attend

the

So far we are able to conclude that an individual's lifetime earnings pattern will vary depending upon the nature of the institutions of

— 70 —

higher

education he attends. The traits of universities we observe to be

important include subjective evaluations, objective data on institutional
differences, college type as defined by the Carnegie Commission, and

whether or not the institution is under private or public control. Although we have controlled for certain characteristics of the individuals

our sample, the focus so far

in

of different

has been

to determine

the average

impacts

aspects of institutional quality on incomes of all members

of our sample considered

together.

It is possible that

the

impacts of college quality differ depending

upon the nature of the individuals attending. That is, college quality
differences might be more important,

or

less important, in a sample of

individuals with exceptionally high, or exceptionally low, ability. If
the

relationship between

quality

of college

attended and subsequent earn-

ings of an individual depends upon the level of the individual's ability
than there is said to be
school

an interaction between individual ability and

quality in the earnings

relationship.49

It is the purpose of

49The relationship which includes interaction between ability and college

quality

may be written
ln Y

a + bQ + cA + gQ.A,

(1)

where in Y is log of income, Q is college quality and A is the individual's
ability. Hence

dY_b+gA.

(2)

If g is greater than zero, than the effect of any level of school quality
greater, the higher the ability of the individual concerned. A negative
g implies an inverse relationship. This specification assumes a linear
interaction between the two continuous dependent variables. Another type
of test can be suggested which does not constrain the interaction to be
linear. The method involves grouping the sample by similar IQ levels (e.g.
IQ quartiles) and estimating earnings functions separately for each IQ
quartile. Comparisons can be made of quality coefficients across groups.

sepaate regressions similar

to

those presented in Table 6

(i.e., including IQ, YRSED, £XP, and EXPSQD along with quality of the
last institution attended) were estimated for individuals in our sample
with

IQs above the sample mean (700

observations) and

below the mean

differed according to the ability of those who attend. Table 23 presents

is significantly greater

for all definitions

for the higher ability sub-

elasticities were not significantly different.) These regressions from
which Table 23 is derived reveal that coefficients on IQ were generally
nafler for the high-ability group; the coefficients on years in school
and experience were generally larger for the high-ability group. The
model explains 9 to 10 per cent of the variance in 1969 income for those

ability above the mean, but only 4 to 5 per cent
income of the lower-ability group was explained.51

the high IQ half of the sample.

These strong results led us to subdivide the sample further into IQ
quartiles, separately for those with sixteen or fewer years of schooling

and for those with seventeen or more years of schooling. These regressions appear as Table 24. For the first group the Gourman measure of the
quality of the undergraduate institution attended was used, and for those
with some graduate training the measure of both undergraduate and graduate

institutional quality were inserted. For the undergraduate group the effect of college quality was greatest for the lowest IQ quartile. However
from the second lowest to highest IQ quartile college quality appeared

to have an increasing effect. For those with some graduate training,
this

"U-shaped" effect of quality was evident in regard to the measure of

graduate institution attended. The lowest IQ quartile had a large and
statistically the

most significant effect on 1969 earnings. However,

from the second lowest to the highest IQ quartile the effects rose,
starting with an impact below

that

that of the lowest quartile but rising so

the highest IQ quartile reveals the largest impact of graduate

quality on earnings. It should also be noted that undergraduate quality
was not statistically significant except in the top IQ quartile for those
who had graduate training.
It is interesting that most of the other variables which are used

in the earnings functions appearing in Table 24 do not reveal systematic

patterns

across IQ quartiles for either educational attainment group.

Moreover we are never able to

explain much more than 10 per cent of the

in income for those with no graduate training but we always

explained

over 26 per cent of the variance in income of those with graduate

training.

It appears then that regardless of whether or not one went to graduate
school the effect of going to a good school was greater for those with
greater ability compared

to most

of those with lesser ability. However, it

is also true that those in the lowest ability group were significantly
affected by the quality of the institutions they attended, probably as much
as those in the highest ability group.
It should be stressed again that no matter what one's ability is, he
will be better of f attending a good school compared to one of lower quality.

However it appears that if one falls into either the top or bottom extreme
of the IQ distribution, the impact of going to a good school or to a bad
school would be greater than if one falls in the average range of ability.

We should also remember that the sample beinq studied contains individuals
falling in the upper half of the IQ distribution for the nation as a whole.

This implies that our top IQ quartile resembles the top eighth in the
nation and our bottom IQ quartile probably contains people with IQ's
slightly above the national norm.

We must also keep in mind the fact that the range of qualities of
institutions attended by those in our top quartile probably includes
better institutions than are included in the range of institutions

attended by those in the lowest IQ quartile. If our estimations had revealed a continuously positive interaction between ability and college
quality, this might have been due to the fact that the effect of

— 76 —

differences

in institutional quality were somewhat greater among individ-

uals who attended better quality institutions. However Tables 5 and 6
revealed earlier that the impacts of quality according to relative

quality of institutions attended was somewhat tenuous. Hence the "Ushaped" interaction between ability and college quality appears consistent with earlier results.

So far within IQ quartiles we have inserted college quality as a

separate variable. The question arises whether the explanatory power
of the model would be increased significantly if we insert the measure
of quality explicitly as
end

an

interactive variable with ability. To this

we have estimated the four equations which appear in Table 25.

Equation 1 attempts to explain earnings differences among all those
with less seventeen years
ables

of schooling

by our traditional set of vari-

including a measure of the quality of the undergraduate institu-

tion attended. Equation 3 replaces the single variable measure of

undergraduate quality by a set of four variables. First we create
four dummy variables. The first being one if an individual falls in
the lowest IQ quartile and zero otherwise, the second being one if the
individual falls in the second lowest IQ quartile and zero otherwise,

etc. For any one individual three of the dummies will be zero and only
one will equal one. Each of the four dummies are then multiplied by the
quality of the individual's institution. Hence for each individual we
have four variables one being the quality of the college the individual

attended and the other three being zero. This is a way of seeing

.

quartile the individual falls in. Similarly equation 2 estimates the
generalized earnings function for those with some graduate work, and

column 4 is the same equation but with quality measures for the graduate institutions attended being sorted into four IQ groups.

In equations 3 and 4 we are basically asking the same type

question

of

as were asked when the sample was subdivided and equations

estimated

separately for individuals falling into different IQ quar-

tiles. However in the equations currently being considered we coflstrain coefficients on years of schooling, experience, IQ, and the
occupational effects to be the same for all individuals within a

schooling attainment category. Hence in one respect these latest es-

timates are less general

On the other hand the quality coefficients for those

with some graduate work rise continually from the lowest to the high-

est IQ quartile. Since there is no reason to constrain the model such
that other variables have the same effect regardless of the individual's
IQ category, more reliability should be placed on the equations in
Table 24.

.

The latest table was prepared to see if the total power of the model
has increased when interaction is explicitly introduced. The

in equ-

ation 1 when quality was introduced as a single variable for undergraduates
was .0729 and the R2 in equation 3 when quality was interacting with four

IQ dunmies was .0732. An F-test to determine whether or not there was a
significant difference in R2's between the two

equations

revealed very

clearly that there was no significant difference. Similarly when comparing equation 2 and equation 4 there was no significant difference in

R2,s of .3047 and .3054.

We can conclude that institutional quality is a significant factor

in determining an individual's lifetime earnings. Moreover most tests
reveal that the impact of quality is somewhat greater for individuals

with more ability compared to individuals with less. However it does
appear

that the

least

able in our sample

(who resemble the average in-

dividual in the society as a whole) are affected by the quality of the
institution they attended by roughly the same amount as are the top

people in terms of ability in our sample. Moreover, it seems

that any

tests of interaction between institutional quality and individual ability
should be based on estimates of earnings functions which allow other
variables therein to take different values for individuals of different

levels of ability. That is, inconsistencies in results develop when the

cent

was

2.60 and the

— 80 —

model is constrained such that all, individuals in the sample are similarly
influenced by years attended, experience, occupational choice, and the
like. However, the differences in impacts of institutional quality, on
individuals of different levels of ability do not appear to be major.

Our model's explanatory power is not strengthened when we introduce

college quality as a variable explicitly interacting with ability. If
there is an interaction, the joint influence of quality and ability does
not add much to the separate influences of the two factors on income.

It probably is sufficient to assert that both institutional quality
and individual ability are significant factors in the earnings function

and stop there. A policy implication is that each individual should seek
the best quality schools possible regardless of ability. If the question
for the broader society is whom to encourage to attend the institutions of

highest quality the problems become confounded and very difficult. It
appears that the most able students should be encouraged to attend the
best schools because their income from so doing will increase by the

largest percentage as revealed by the coefficients on quality. However,
the policy question involves much more than efficiency since even the
least able students will get extra income from going to a better school.

One

further attempt to get at the relationship between individual

ability and institutional quality was made. Separately for those with
sixteen or fewer and seventeen or more years of schooling, the sample
was divided into those with IQ's above the mean and those with IQ's

below

the

mean. Within each of these IQ halves the sample was divided

.

— 81 -

into

those who attended schools of above mean quality and those who attended

schools of below mean quality. For each attainment level four samples of
individuals were obtained: those with below average ability at below average institutions, those with below average ability at above average quality
institutions, those with above average ability at above average institutions,

and those with above average ability at below average institutions. These
resulta are presented in Table 26. Once again when comparing the eight
separate earnings functions estimated, the results are more or less system-

atic but the reasons for them are somewhat unclear. Within only one of the
eight estimates were differences in individual abilities significant in ex-

plaining 1969 income. Ability differences among individuals with some graduate training, below average IQ, attending below average quality institutions

had a significant effect. But thia was the only case. On the other hand
in seven of the eight estimates differences in years attended had a signifi-

cantly positive effect on later income. For undergraduates the coefficient
on years was most important in the high IQ, high college quality group. We
must remember that the years coefficient in this case is constrained to being
no greater than sixteen and so this result might be interpreted that among
all those with a B.A. or less who attended college, the payoff to attending

would

be

greatest if you graduated and if you graduated from a better-than-

average quality school and had above average IQ. It should be pointed out
that the coefficient on years in this case was lower than that coefficient
in virtually all of the cases of people attending for more than sixteen

years. For some reason, those doing graduate work with lower than average

attending high quality institutions did not have a significant pay-

those with lower than

average

ability doing graduate work at lower than

average quality institutions found the largest rewards to attending for

extra years: in this cases getting the graduate degree probably had
special value in detracting from the individual's ability and institutional
quality.

The coefficients on the relevant quality measures appear more system-

atic and quite interesting. For both attainment categories individuals
attending the high quality institutions were revealed to have a significantly
positive relationship between quality of institution and subsequent earnings.
This result applied to individuals in both the high and low IQ halves of the

sample. On the other hand, individuals who attended institutions of below

average

quality revealed that differences in quality of institutions attended

did not significantly affect income regardless of attainment and of whether

or not they were above or below average in IQ. For undergraduates it
appeared that the returns to quality of their institution attended were
greater and more significant for those with below average 1Q, implying some-

those in the higher IQ higher quality subset although the difference between
this coefficient and the coefficient on quality for those

be noted that the coefficient on years attended and on quality

those without graduate training who fell in both the below average

ability and below average college quality categories. The explained
variance was the lowest in this case as well. As usual, we can explain
substantially more of the variance for those with more than sixteen
years of schooling.

Once again when we subdivide the sample into such fine detail, we

get results which differ depending upon the category studied. However
it does appear that there are positive interactions in a number of the

cases. Differences in individual abilities, years of schooling obtained,
and quality of institutions attended have generally significant effects

on lifetime earnings patterns. The magnitude of the relationship be-

father's income (rather than education or occupational status)

Our data set has measures of father's educational attainment and
father's occupational status. The latter is composed of three dummies
(indicating high, medium, and low). We also have a measure of wife's
father's education. Each of these has been used to stand for SES and
are probably correlated with father's income which we do

not

have.

Table 27 introduces the SES variables available in our sample into
our standard earnings functions separated by those with and without grad-

uate training. Several facts stand out. The introduction of SES measures
reduces the size and statistical significance of the quality variables

In

this case the differences in proportion of

Unless our SES measures are grossly

inadequate, which is doubtful,

it appears that college quality has impacts above those which might

quality

proxy for other factors.

comparison see the 1969 regressions in Table 12.

XI. Implications

We have found that quality of institutions of higher education
has

an important impact on lifetime earnings of those who attend.

A subjective evaluation of institutions (the Gourinan index) was

used to measure quality in many of the estimated equations, but

it appears that certain objective traits which contribute to these
evaluations can be isolated. In particular, average student
quality as measured by the average SAT scores of entering freshmen,
and

faculty

Quality

seems to be more important for students with

more years

of higher education and also for more able students. It affects
later incomes more than it influences incomes immediately upon entering

the labor force. Differences
colleges

in institutional quality among private

are more important than

those among public schools. These results

hold even after controlling for certain occupational choices, individual
ability, and socio-econoiuic background.

There are certain limitations on the usefulness of the results

as presented so far. Although we have made statements about the statistical relationship between school quality and later earnings, we have
been unable to do much cost-benefit or rate of return analyses.

That is, although the average SAT scores of entering freshmen is a
significant factor in later earnings of individuals who attend, we do
not know (1) how a school might go about improving the average SAT's,

—89—

(2) how much it would cost to raise average SAT's by any

amount or

percentage, and hence, (3) the rate of return to students (and presumably the school) of the school successfully raising the average SAT
scores

of its students. Almost all our measures of quality cannot

easily

be considered in cost terms, and so

aspects

rates of return to these

of quality are impossible to estimate.

However, we do have data on average expenditures per student
for faculty, research and library which we have used to measure

college quality at times throughout this study. It is possible to
get something like an estimate of the rate of return to these expenditures, by considering the percentage change in 1969 income of a student
for a given percentage change in per student expenditures roughly 20

years earlier. For the following calculations we use the 1969
earnings functions in Table 13 where quality is measured by per
student expenditures.

By multiplying the mean expenditures per student times the
coefficient
change

on the expenditure variable we can get the percentage

in an individual's

1969

income for a percentage change in

expenditure per student at the institution he attended earlier.
57

.
The coefficient on expenditures

and

d Exp/Exp
for a one percent change in expenditures.

-90—

For those with 16 or fewer years, a one percent change in per studente

expenditures at their undergraduate college resulted in a .147 percent
increase in 1969 income; and for those with graduate attendance, a
one percent increase in per student expenditures by the graduate
schools resulted in a .180 percent increase in 1969 income.

Using

per

student

sample means for

1969 incomes of our sample members and

expenditures by the institutions, it can be shown that

a one dollar per student increase in spending by an institution would

result in an increase in income twenty years later of $2.51 for those
with 16 or fewer years and of $2.82 for those with

17 or more years.58

When evaluating this investment by the schools (or the govern-

ment

or alumni who finance institutions) in

spending,

we must recognize that the

increasing per student

payoff we have reported comes

years after the fact. Hence we must ask what is the

twenty
today

of $2.51 tweny-one years later in one case, and of

years

later in

value

$2.82 nineteen

the other. This, of course, requires knowledge about

discount rates applied by those to whom the benefits will accrue.

58The relevant means are as follows:
UG
$16,500
1969 income
966
Per Student Expenditures
21 yrs.
Job Experience in 1969

GRAD
$18,200
1,160
19 yrs.

For example a 1% increase in spending per undergraduate (i.e. $9.66)
would result in a $24.26 increase in 1969 income (.00147 times $16,500).
Hence, a $1 increase in spending would imply a 1969 salary increment of
other variables in the earnings
$2.51. These results are holding constant
functions.
