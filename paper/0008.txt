Our thinking about the operation of the international economy is

dominated by two sets of theories, one relating to commodity trade and

one relating to factor (particularly capital) movements. Factor proportions theories explain the location of production and the movement of
commodities by differences among commodities in relative factor
and

requirements

differences among countries in relative factor abundance, and therefore

price, under the assumption that resources are immovable across national

borders. Theories of capital movement explain the flow of capital from

one country to another by differences in rateC of return.

skills may be unobtainable or extremely expensive for the Ruritanian
National Oil Company but readily available to a large international oil

company. And while there may be large returns to the investment of
technology and skills in the production of electronic equipment in
Ruritania, the cost of these factors may be very high for the Electronics
Company of Ruritania but quite low for a large American electronics

company. The existence of multinational firms may make possible a flow

introduces some new elements into the situation beyond the familiar ones

of resource endowment and rates of return. Hence, in seeking to explain the

location of production, the level of technology used at each location, the
use

of

productive factors, and the flow of trade and of resources, we must

take into account the effects of the ownership of productive facilities.

—3—

Why should the existence of the multinational firm have this effect?
Why would

the

technology,

factors not move, as portfolio capital or licensing of

in the absence of such firms? In the case of capital, the

reason is probably that the multinational' s cost for use anywhere in the

world is the cost to the parent corporation, to which the firm will add an
appropriate allowance for any special risks involved in investment in the

recipient country, rather than the higher usual cost to a native firm in
that country. The risk premium added by the multinational firm in its
internal calculations may be lower than that added by developed country

capital markets to the cost of borrowing by a native firm. The multinational
firm may face a lower risk of failure because it possesses complementary

technological factors of production, or because its affiliate has no liquidity
problems, or because it is in a stronger bargaining position vis-a-vis both

host country governments and buyers of its products. In the case of technology, acquisition in the form of equity capital inflow through the multinational
firm ay be a much lower—risk form of purchase for a recipient country than
licensing or purchase or other nonequity arrangements in which the purchaser

bears most of the risk. In acquiring

technology through

the multinational

firm the host country reduces risk by not taking on any fixed expenses of

purchase or rental, at the cost of losing the possibility of exceptional
gains. Similarly, other factors scarce in the receiving country's
economy might be cheaper for the multinational firm than for the native firm-for example, knowledge about new technology, about sources of material inputs,

and market conditions around the world. If the crucial cost difference
is that between the expense of transferring resources within a firm and
the expense of transferring them between firms, the advantage of the

multinational firm is much like that of any large firm operating within a

—4—
single market.1

For discussions of the nature of the multinational firm's advan-

tages see, for example, Caves [1971] and Kind].eberger 969]. The issue
is related to those raised in Coase L1937J.

broadly, we can think of factor abundance and factor prices as

being characteristics not only of countries, as is customary in trade theory,
but also of companies. To the extent that inter-company differences in the
abundance and cost of resources outweigh inter—country differences in

determining the location of production we should expect capital-intensive
products to be manufactured not necessarily in capital—rich countries but

by capital-rich companies, and products requiring intricate technology or
high marketing skills by companies rich in those resources.
What does this

view

of multinational firms imply for the location of

production? If we focus first on capital and labor and ignore, for the
moment, the role of natural resources and other factors of production, and

if we assume that labor (or, in some versions, unskilled labor) is the
expensive factor relative to capital in the United States, we would expect

that labor-intensive industries would locate outside the United States.

American multinational firms reflected only their access to U.S. capital
on terms no more favorable than those available to American firms in general--

let us call that Assumption 1--we would expect that the most capital-intensive

country but lower labor costs or cheaper access to markets.

For resource-orjnted industries, the location of which is dependent
on the discovery and development of natural resources, we cannot expect to

predict

location but only ownership given location. The more capital-

intensive of these industries, wherever located, will tend to be owned by
U.S. (or other) multinational firms.

To the extent that this analysis is valid, it helps to explain the high

capital intensity of U.S. imports found by Leontief and others. We would expect
to find that this high capital intensity was to some extent accounted for by

imports into the United States from foreign affiliates of U.S. firms,

for

which the price of capital was not the high price of the countries in which
they are located but the low U.S. price or the still lower multinational
firm price.

this analysis in terms of the

factor proportions character-

izing individual industries, as most authors have done, setting aside the
question of the extent to which firms

production,

capital and labor, but we have divided the former into physical

capital and

There are a

that

number of possible variants of the capital—labor ratio

can be used. We have followed mainly the approach taken by Lary

l968, chapter 2] who used value added per worker as his measure of total
(physical and human) capital per worker, interpreting the wage component
as a measure

of

returns to human

capital

and the nonwage component as a

measure of returns to physical capital. Lary's measures have some defects

property-type income, as calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see
Walderhaug C19731) for the wage

and nonwage value added used by Lary.

Several attempts have been made to measure human

capital

intensity

directly from information on the composition of the labor force in each

industry: age, sex, education, skill level, etc. We have included some
calculations based on one of the most recent measures of this type as a
check on conclusions from data on employee compensation per worker.4

4

See A.E. Fareed C19723.

The first calculation of human

capital

intensity along these lines was by Kenen C1965].

The original approach to the measurement of factor proportions was,

of course, that of Leontief C1956], who calculated capital per manyear,

defining capital as fixed, physical capital. These ratios were derived from

—8—
the 1947 input-output table, and we have used the same ratios in our own

calculations

for that and later years. Leontief's article was based on

the sum of direct and indirect input requirements, but since we wish to
focus on the characteristics of each industry, we have made use of only
the direct coefficients.

It should be noted that both the Lary and the Leontief factor ratios,
and those we are using, are

computed from U.S. data, and are applied to

both U.S. exports and U.S. imports.
If

form

one thinks of research and development expenditures as a separate

of capital input, particularly for the United States or for American

multinational companies, we can add, to the measures of human and physical

capital intensity, a measure of R&D intensity. We have calculated that
characteristic as the amount

of

R&D expenditure per

worker.

If our suppositions about the role of multinational firms

are

correct,

should expect that U.S. imports from American—owned affiliates are more

alone,

excluding petroleum refining, imports from U.S. affiliates appear to

be only about 10 per cent more capital—intensive than imports from others,
and most of the difference is in the employee compensation part of value
added, which we interpret as reflecting human

embodiment. The direct

measure of human capital shows only a 4 per cent margin, close to that for
property—type income per worker. However, the research intensity of imports
from affiliates exceeds that of other imports by a larger margin in manufac-

turing

alone than in manufacturing and mining.

If we use Leontief's measure of capital

intensity, physical capital

per manyear (Table 2), we find that imports from affiliates were twice as
capital intensive as other imports in 1951 and 1965, and almost twice in 1947.

from

Apparently, U.S. imports produced by American affiliates were distinguished
from imports produced by others mainly in being considerably more capital-

intensive and far more research—intensive. That higher physical capital
intensity

of imports from affiliates was clearest in mining and petroleum,

products for which the location

of

of production was determined by the location

resources. In manufacturing the outstanding difference between the two

sets of imports was the high R&D content of the imports from affiliates.
These results suggest that some substantial part of the high capital
intensity of u.s. imports might be attributed to those imports that are produced abroad by U.S. firms facing U.S. rather than foreign capital costs.
We can, then, compare the factor content of imports

from non—U.S. companies

with that of U.S. exports, to ask whether our imports from non-affiliated
companies involve economizing on labor, capital, or research investment.

produced with U.S. capital were from industries with lower physical and

to these results the relatively high capital-intensity of U.S. imports as a

wbole is accounted for by imports from U.S. affiliates, for whom foreign

capital or research costs are not the relevant ones. On the other hand, the

physical

capital intensities do characterize imports from non-affiliates,

even if these are not quite as capital intensive as imports from affiliates.
If we accept the results based on value added per worker we are still
left with the question raised earlier of whether the capital or research
costs

of the U.S . -based multinational firms are those of the U.S.

economy as a whole or are peculiar to these firms. Are the MNC' s
conduit

only a

for cheap U.S. capital and R&D or do they have their own low capital

and R&D costs which they wish to exploit both in the United States and abroad?

A test of that propositbn can be performed by comparing the characteristics

of exports by parent firms with those of U.S. exports by other firms.

As Table 5 indicates, the parent firms are in industries with higher
capital and R&D intensities than other U.S. exporters. The difference
between

and others is larger for physical capital than for
human capital, although it is substantial for both. It is still larger
for

parent firms

R&D than for either type of capital. Thus the evidence suggests that

the lower capital and R&D costs of these firms with foreign affiliates are
characteristics of the firms themselves rather than of the U.S. economy as
a whole.

In fact, as can be seen in Table 6, the capital and R&D intensities
of exports by U.S. parent firms resemble those of imports from the foreign

affiliates of these same firms more closely than they do those of exports

by other U.S. firms and the characteristics of imports from non-affiliated
foreign firma resemble those of U •S. exports by non-parents more than they

do those of U.S. imports from affiliates. Thus, these data point to
the distinctiveness of the multinational firms, in both their U.S. and their
foreign operations, from other firms in the U.S. and abroad.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that U.S. imports from American-owned affiliates
abroad are more capital—intensive, and particularly more research—intensive

than U.S. imports from others. These imports from affiliates account for much

from non—affiliated companies embody, on the average, less capital and more

labor than U.S.

exports.

The capital—intensive

and

research—intensive charac

ter of U.S. imports from affiliates appears to reflect mainly the low costs of
capital, research, and possibly other factors of the parent companies, rather
than only the costs to American firms in general. We make that judgment on

the basis of the fact that exports from the United States by these parent
companies are more capital— and research—intensive than exports by other U.S.
companies.

There appear then to be several roles of American—based multinational

investment) for the production of research—intensive manufactured products

in foreign countries. In both of these cases the multinational firms appear
to produce using factor proportions far different from those of other
American firms. Presumably, they do so because they enjoy comparatively

low costs for these resources. The evidence also indicates, but not as
strongly, that multinational firms act as a conduit for low-cost human capital
flows to foreign countries.

All of these calculations are derived from data on the capital- and
research-intensity of whole industries, on the assumption that firms are
identical within an industry and the assumption that an industry is
characterized by the same capital—intensity in each country. Both of these

assumptions are open to question and we plan to investigate the validity of
each in further studies. We will compare multinational parent firms with

others in the same industries in the United States, compare affiliates with
other firms in tfle same industries in the countries in which they operate,
and compare

Sources: U.S. Direct Investments Abroad, 1966, Part II. Investment

Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis), PP. 50—54, 70—76.

a

For petroleum, we have assumed that all imports are from U.S. affiliates
abroad, although the published data suggest a considerably lower fraction. The
published data for this industry on imports from affiliates seem extremely
unreliable. One evidence of this unreliability is the fact that exports
to the U.S. reported by affiliates in several areas are substantially higher than
total U.S. imports from these areas. For Canada, on the other hand, reported
exports to the U.S. by affiliates were only 40 per cent of U.S. imports. This
rado seems absurdly low in view of the fact that, according to Canadian data,
U.S. subsidiaries accounted for 72 per cent of Canadian exports of gas and oil
to all countries, and one might expect the proportion in exports to the U.S.
to be higher than that. Furthermore, that proportion is understated because
Trans-Canada Pipe Lines, a Canadian'owned company, takes title to gas it transmits
even though the gas may originate with a U.S.-controlled subsidiary (see Foreign
Direct Investment in Canada, Information Canada, 1972, p. 159.
b

Figure in source was reduced because it was greater than total U.S. imports.
The lower figure used is comparable with the 1970 figure in The Reconciliation of
U.S.-Canada Trade Statistics, 1970 (U.S. Department of Commerce), p. 57.

Exports and imports for each industry in 1947 and 1951 and direct
labor and capital input coefficients for each industry in 1947 are from
Wassily Leontief, "Factor Proportions and the Structure of American
Trade: Further Theoretical and Empirical Analysis," Review of Economics
and Statistics, Nov. 1956, reprinted in Leontief, Input-Output Economics
(Oxford University Press, 1966), pp. 129—133. These 1947 coefficients
were used in all our estimates of capital per manyear. Data cover manufacturing and mining, including petroleum.
Estimates of the proportion of imports coming from U.S. overseas
affiliates in 1947 and 1951 are from U.S. Business Investment in Foreign
Countries (U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Business Economics,
1960), and apply to the year 1957.
We have removed natural rubber from Leontief's Chemicals category
on the ground that it is essentially an agricultural product and that
the capital per worker ratio for the U.S. synthetic rubber industry is

not an appropriate one for natural rubber.

Proportions for 1965 are from 1966 data, as in Table A—3.
