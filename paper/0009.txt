From Age-Earnings Profiles to the
Distribution of Earnings and Human Wealth
by L. A. Lillard*

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

Economists have long been interested in individual earnings differ-

ences and in the dispersion of earnings within populations. Recent
development of explicit theoretical and empirical earnings functions from
life cycle human capital investment models increases the potential to ex-

plain existing earnings distributions and to predict changes in it. The
purpose of this paper is to suggest how these earnings functions can be
used more directly to derive predicted earnings and human wealth distributions for populations and sub-populations, with an empirical illus-

tration. This is accomplished by an application of statistical distribution

theory as a link between the

distribution.

The appropriate

earnings function and the earnings

statistical distribution theory

is first

presented in very general terms. The means of translating the joint

distribution of a population's characteristics into earnings distribution
through the earnings function is presented. When an explicit relationship

between earnings or human wealth and the characteristics of an individual which determine it is specified and when the joint density of those
characteristics in a population is known the distribution of that population can be deduced.

The empirical illustration entails application of the general framework to a particular set of data, the 1960 Census of Population, using an

estimated earnings function. Both distributions of earnings and human

wealth are predicted. The predicted distributions are then compared with
actual distributions when possible.

Earnings as a cubic function of age, schooling, ability and their
interactions are estimated using results from the NBER—Thorndike sample.

This earnings function is used to predict earnings and human wealth distributions for the 1960 Census population based on the joint distribution
of age, schooling, and ability based on age and schooling data from the
1960 Census of Population and ability data within schooling classes from

the NBER—Thorndike sample. Predicted earnings distributions are derived
for the overall population, for schooling classes, for age groups, and

for ability classes. Both the distribution of expected or mean earnings
arid the distribution of earnings corrected for variation not explained by

age, schooling, and ability are presented for each along with selected
summary statistics and Lorenz curves.

The distribution of human wealth of the 1960 Census population is

then predicted. Human wealth is defined as the present value of the
earnings stream from the end of schooling until age sixty-six. Human
wealth is then a function of schooling, ability, and the rate of

—3—

discount. It is assiimed that everyone has the same rate of discount but

rates from 3 to 7 per cent are considered. Human wealth distributions are
predicted for the overall population, for schooling classes and ability
classes.
The

is

most striking result of the empirical estimation is that there

clearly a great deal more

Also

inequality in earnings than in human wealth.

an interesting result is that at a discount rate above 5 per cent an

increased schooling level of the population does not necessarily increase
the expected value of human wealth and that at 6 per cent and above it
actually declines monotonica]].y. Detailed comparisons of age groups,
schooling groups and ability groups are discussed.

FRAIIEWORI( FOR TRANSLATING THE JOINT DISTRIBUTION
OF POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS INTO EARNINGS DISTRIBUTIONS

Life cycle
form

earnings models allow the specification of a functional

for the earnings of

an individual over his life cycle. Earnings at

any point in the life cycle are determined by both formal schooling

and past schooling investment behavior. Earnings are a function of,
for example, the initial stock of human capital at the beginning of the
life cycle, the human capital production parameters including the eff i—

ciency parameter 8 and the input coefficients

and 82, the rate of

depreciation of the capital stock, the length of working life, the
market interest rate, the rental rate of human capital, the price of

direct educational imputs and of course, age. The characteristics may
be summarized by the vector
C

(8,

E,

8i 82, 6, ii,

N, P, R)

C].)

The purpose of this section is to show how the overall earnings
distribution of a population and earnings distributions of various
subpopulations can be derived from the joint distribution of characteris-

tics of that population. The joint distribution of characteristics can
be transformed through the functional form f or earnings into the

various earnings distributions.
Any individual takes his characteristics as given, and not under

his control, and invests in an optimal fashion accordingly. For any
individual, earnings are thus a function of age with his characteristics

acting

as parameters. For a given population the individuals in it will

differ in characteristics as well as age. The characteristics are then

—5—

variable across individuals in the population as is age and the joint
density function of age and the vector of characteristics.
Variation in earnings within the population can be considered as
coming from two sources, variation in age and variation in characteristics.
Individuals with different parameters and epdowments are constrained to

select different optimum age profiles. Individuals with the same
parameters and endowments are constrained to select different optimum
age profiles while individuals with the same parameters and endowments

select the same investment patterns but still differ in age. These
sources of variation are considered separately, then combined.

Variation in Earnings due to Age Only
Variation of earnings due to variation in age in the population is
an important source of income Inequality and can be analyzed by means

of the life—cycle earnings function. The specification by means of the
life cycle model of an earnings function allows the age profile of
earnings for an individual to be identified and thus allows a much more
refined analysis of the population income density function because the
age distribution of the population can be explicitly accounted for.
First, consider the effect of the age distribution on the income of

identical persons. That Is, consider the population of all persons who
have exactly the same Initial endowment, production parameters, depreciation

—6—

rate, working life, input price and rental rate. Let these persons
differ in age. Since the individuals are identical in all characteristics
except age, they all have the same age profile but are at different points

along that profile. For each age there is a unique income, Y. Let
Y(a,C) be the earnings function, where a is age1 and C is a vector of
parameters and initial endowments.

Consider the density of persons with respect to age. The density
function g1(a), where a stands for age, is given by

1Note that age is different from work experience. Age begins at
the time when the individual makes a decision by selecting an investment
pattern, or begins to make his own investment decisions. Work experience
begins when the individual enters the labor force, but a year of labor
force participation does not necessarily imply a full year of experience
especially if the work is not full time.

2Life cycle theories indicate age profiles demonstrating these
tharacteristics. The monotonicity need not be limited to two regions,
but this assumption simplifies the analysis. The shapes of the curves
are assumed but are consistent with the empirical findings.

In the region a* to a
the individual is investing only a fraction of

potential earning and is realizing positive earnings and those earnings
are rising monotonically. In the region a to N, the individual's

his

earnings

are declining monotonically due to low investment and a dominating

depreciation of existing human capital. This last region need not exist if
there is no depreciation.3

In the region 0 to a*, the individual is

investing all of his potential earning in producing more human capital and
is realizing no income.4

Individuals in this age category will not be

included in the discussion since earnings while in full—time schooling
are not generally reported and the data used in a later section will be

for persons reporting earnings from employment. Therefore, all earnings
distributions are for persons reporting positive earnings and those
persons still in full—tim& schooling are not included.
The objective is to transform the density of persons with respect
to age into the density. of persons with respect to income via the earnings

function Y(a,C).. (See Figurel)

To.accoznpiish this, first solve for

the inverse functional relationship mapping income into age. This can
be done only for monotonically increasing or decreasing regions. We

However, for any income in the range Y(N,C) < Y <

there are two ages corresponding to that income.6

Y(a,C)

These considerations

must be dealt with in the transformation to obtain the income density
function.

Given the foregoing specifications, the conditional probability

density function for income is g3(Y/C). The probability density element
for any age interval IS transformed through the earnings function into
the probability density element of the corresponding income interval.
Age density is transformed uniquely from the age interval a* < a < ad
into the income interval Y(a*, C) < Y <

Y(ad,C).

However, in the age

interval ad < a < N two age intervals map Into each income interval, one

A doublecounting of income occurs then at higher levels of income, while
a single. counting occurs at lower levels of income with a discrete jump

point at the income Y(ad, C). These statements are presented in statistical terms in Appendix A.

For a given density function of age a downturn in earnings at later

yearsin the life cycle adds a doublecounting effect which introduces a

5

The point aA is the age at which income during the life cycle
equals income at the end of the working life. Thus, all incomes above
Y(N) occur twice, once while rising and once while declining.

6Again the slopes of the curves are assumed. It is possible to
consider the case where Y(N,C) < Y(a,C) but the above case was chosen
for expositional purposes.

source of negative skewness or at least less positive skewness that is
not present if the earnings function increases monotonically.
A second source of a tendency toward negative skewness can be noted

at this point. If the earnings function rises at a decreasing rate and
falls at an increasing rate as is drawn in Figure 6, then as the age

interval moves toward aax from a*, or from N, it maps into increasingly
smaller income intervals thus transforming probability density from equal

age intervals into increasingly smaller income intervals. This tends to
increase the density of high income levels relative to low income levels
for a given earnings function and a given age density function relative to

what it would otherwise be. These sources of a tendency toward negative
skewness have not been noted in the income distribution literature.
The moments of this conditional income distribution are functions

of the moments of age distribution. The relationships are specified
through the earnings function. The moments of the income distribution of
persons with the same parameters and initial endowments are conditional

upon and thus functions of those characteristics. It should also be
noted that the moments of income for an entire population are functions
of the moments of these conditional moments over- characteristic space.

See Appendix B for a more precise statement.

with

different characteristics has a different income profile but is the

same distance a into his profile. The distribution of income will derive
from the distribution of persons by characteristics at that age (see

.Figures 2 and 3). There is a different density function for each age
a, but there is a continuous array of density functions over all ages

between 0 and N.8
The objective is to transform the joint density function of persons

with respect to parameters and initial endowments into the density of

persons with respect to income via the earnings function. The 4istri—
bution of these characteristics is assumed independent of age. Density
is transformed from an interval in n—dimensional characteristic space

into a corresponding income interval through the earnings function. The
moments of this conditional income distribution are functions of the

moments of the characteristics. The relationship is specified through
the earnings function. The moments of the income distribution of persons
the same age is conditional upon and thus a function of age. For example,
the, popular belief that the variance of income increases with age as

summarized by Mincer (1970) can be considered in this context. An
empirical consideration of such matters appears in a later section. For
a fuller exposition, see Appendix A.

Overall Variation in Earnings
Consider the combined effect of the variation of the population with
respect to both age and parameters and initial endowments on the distri-

bution of personal income. Probability density is transformed from

in (n+l) dimensional age—characteristic spaoe into income inter-

vals through the earnings function. This is considered as an extension
of the previous framework.

In an earlier part of this section the density function of income

at each age was derived (see Figure3). Now combine these density
functions to form the joint density function of income and age, g6(Y,a)

in Figure 4. The conditional densities g4(Ya) are in effect scaled
down by the marginal density of age g1(a) through the relationship

g6(Y,a) =

g4(Ya)

•

g1(a).

(5)

The overall earnings distribution represented by the marginal density
function of income Y is obtained by integrating the joint density function

g6('1,a) over the age dimension. As is illustrated in Figure 5, this sums
all of the density from two dimensions into one. The contour of density

is effectively flattened against the income density plane. Again the
moments of the personal income distribution are functions of the moments

of age and of the moments of the parameters and initial endowments. These
relationships are estimated in a later section. For a more complete
statement of these concepts see Appendix A.
Another way to view this same process is to reconsider Figure 2.
Graphing the density functions g4(YIa) each weighted by g1(a) in income—
probability space results in a continuum of curves such that when the
heights or functions are added overall a density function of income is

obtained as is illustrated in Figure 6
Thus, the density function for income

is

derived from the density

functions of age and of parameters and initial endowments. The analysis
proceeded through several stages, each of which yields useful information
about the personal income distribution.

Differences in wealth between individuals occur because of differences

in their characteristics. If we know the joint density function of C, we

the density element of W(C) in a manner similar to that of

Income.

The implications of this general framework are as follows. Whether
we are interested in studying the distribution of earnings or the
distribution of human wealth, the life cycle income theories tell us that

the distribution of the population by characteristics is Important. These
characteristics determine the optimal time spent In formal schooling, and
after schooling investment decisions as well as the flow of actual earning
and maximum human wealth.

See T. W. Schultz (1971, P. 23) and an unpublished paper, the
NBER Approach to Human Resource Problems, by Finis Welch, Research
Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1970, p. 6,

AN EMPIRICAL ILLUSTRATION

This section will provide an illustration of the empirical use of the

more general framework. An estimated earnings—age relationship dependent
upon level of schooling and

ability is

described and earnings distributions

as well as human wealth distributions are predicted from it. The estimated
earnings

function is based on the NBER—Thorndike sample of Air Force

pilot

and

navigator

for

employed males in 1960. This section may be characterized as answer-

schooling present
in the 1960 Census?" or "What would be the distribution of earnings of
of age and

employed men in 1960 if they were like the men in the NBER-Thorndike

sample?"

Several caveats are in order to use one group to predict the

other. Predicted and actual 1960 distributions are compared when
possible.

A Specific Earnings Function and Estimates
It

is well founded theoretically and empirically that earnings

depend upon schooling, ability, and age or experience)0 The earnings
function estimated and used here results from a life cycle of earnings

model which is discussed elsewhere in detail along with the empirical

estimates.11 The estimated earnings function is cubic in age, quadratic
in schooling, and cubic in ability, including
all interactions. This is the "best" equation in the sense that the age,
schooling, and ability polynomials were determined by error variance

criteria,12 The estimated earnings function is

The resulting age—earnings profiles are presented in Figures 7 for various

at every age in the life cycle after some Initial period.14 Earnings

there are no individuals in the sample beyond that age. The resulting
estimates of human wealth defined as the present value of predicted earnings are presented in Figures 8 for discount rates of 4 and 6 percent.15

The data includes five separate approximately equally spaced points16
on the age-income profile as well as the year of initial job, year of last
full—time schooling, years of schooling and seventeen separate measures of

ability. The age—income points are approximately initial job, 1955, 1960,
1964, and 1968. The individuals in the Thorndike sample differ from the
U.S. male population as a whole in several ways.17 First the sample includes a high ability group. All of the men completed high school of
high school equivalency examinations, and passed the initial screening

for the Air Force flight program. Their general health was better than
the general population18 in 1969. They were more homogenous in height

and weight due to military qualifications. They seem to have a high
degree of self confidence, self reliance and risk preference. They tend

to be entrepreneurs, an unusual 20 per cent work longer hours. Some of
these factors may however be related to the high ability. The observed
age range is nineteen to fifty-seven years but with less than 1 per cent

outside the range nineteen to fifty—five. The cubic earnings equation is

16Any observation which might cause special problems is omitted. These
include those individuals disabled, unemployed, in the military, or who
is a pilot at his major occupation. Particular year observations for an
individual are omitted if for example the year of initial job was questionable.

'7Many of these comments originated with T. F. Juster who directed the
data collection for the NBER.

good, 3 per cent fair, and less than 1 per cent each were poor or non—

quite a poor prediction

above this range since predicted earnings drop

rapidly to large negative values; therefore, earnings are

assumed

con-

stant at their peak level after the peak occurs)9

19When mean earnings predicted distributions are derived without this
assumption (and negative earnings are not counted in relative frequencies)
about 10 per cent of total frequency is lost primarily from high schooling,
low ability, and late age groups. Three, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty—
seven per cent are lost within schooling classes 12, 13—15, 16, and 17+,
respectively. Four, eight, twenty, and thirty-eight per cent are lost
within age groups 30—34, 35—44, 45-54, and 55—64, respectively. Thirtythree and fourteen per cent are lost within the lowest and second lowest
(both below average) ability groups, respectively.

Deriving

Earnings Distributions from the Estimated Earnings Function

The distribution of earnings derives from the distribution of the
population with respect to age, ability, and

time

in schooling. The

purpose of this section is to apply the principles of the general frame-

work using the estimated earnings. Use of the framework is illustrated
by using 1960 United States Census of Population data on the distribution
of the United States population of males eighteen years old and over by
labor force status, years of school completed, and age to predict earnings

distributions based on
Since

the

the estimated earnings function.2°

earnings function predicts earnings only after the end

of full-time schooling, the distribution of the population by age and
schooling is taken only for persons employed and in the civilian labor

force. The joint and marginal distributions of age and schooling are
presented in Table 1. Since the earnings function is estimated based
on a sample reporting earnings only from ages nineteen to fifty—five,

all distributions are for that age group only. Since all persons in
the NBER-Thorndike sample have at least a high school education, pre-

dictions are restricted to that population. That is, the distribution
of yearly earnings is predicted for persons who are between the ages
of eighteen and sixty—four, have at least a high school education and

are

employed.21 The distribution of the population with respect to ability

is assumed

to be the

same as the NBER—Thorndike sample on which the earn-

ing function was estimated since no ability data are reported

in the

1960

Census of Population. The distribution of ability by schooling class used
is presented in Table 2. For calculation of predicted yearly income, it
is assumed that all individuals in an age or schooling class are at the
midpoint of that class.22
Yearly earnings are calculated for each age, schooling, ability
combination corresponding to

lated

midpoints of class intervals.

Each calcu-

yearly income assumes the relative frequency of the corresponding

age, schooling, ability combination. The relative frequency of any
(A, B, S) combination is calculated as the joint relative frequency of
the age, schooling combination reported by the Census of Population

relative frequency of the ability level within that schooling
class.23 These relative frequencies are then sued into relative
times

the

because it corresponds to the
Census of Population age classification 35—64 years old. The
distributions do include persons employed while going to school full
time and are correspondingly incorrectly estimated.
21The age is extended to forty-four

closest

22Any assumption

about how observations are

distributions

within

reported class intervals is arbitrary. This assumption facilitates
calculation

of earnings but adds a source of error in the predicted
distribution of earnings. The predicted relative frequencies are
created in a discrete rather than a continuous manner.
23Assuming this distribution of ability is a source of error in the
predicted distribution to the extent that the distribution of ability
of Air Force pilot and navigator school candidates in 1943 is different from the distribution of ability of employed males in 1960.

of yearly earnings for intervals of a thousand dollars.24

The resulting predicted overall distribution of earnings and the
predicted distribution for various subpopulations effectively represent

distributions of mean earnings. However, only about 28 per cent of the
variation is earnings is explained by variation in age, schooling, and
ability.

Consider the problem of the distribution of earnings after correcting for variation not accounted for by variation in age, schooling,

and ability. A very simple approximate estimating procedure is used
here. The error variance of the estimating equation is 36593472.
(standard error =

6049.25).

It is assumed that the errors are

identically and independently25 distributed with mean zero and standard

deviation 6049.25. The probability density for any individual age,
schooling, ability combination is calculated as before but the density
is allocated to earnings intervals according to the above normal distribution

centered on the midpoint of the interval in which the pre-

dicted value falls. The interval in which the predicted earnings value

24The equal intervals of $1,000 is used to allow the greatest perspective and skewness since the discrete and widely spaced midpoints
of the age and schooling intervals distort the continuity of the predicted distribution. The predicted distributions with unequal interval
lengths for higher incomes used in Census of Population tabulations are
presented later for comparisons with the actual distributions calculated
from Census of Population data.

25Each individual observations error is distributed independently of
age, schooling, ability and the error in any other observation.

The

major caveats may be suiarized

as

follows. The NBER-

Thorndike sample and the population of employed males in 1960 differ

in several ways the most important of which is the high Level
ability

of

present in the NBER-Thorndike sample. Even though ability

distributions

by schooling class are used,

the

distribution of

ability especially in lower schooling classes will overstate ability

relative to the actual distribution in the 1960 population. The 1960

26lnterval length is $1,000. All intervals probabilities are corrected according to the truncated normal so that only positive earnings are counted and the total relative frequency of all positive
earnings is unity.

is heavily concentrated at lower levels of schooling especially

high school which is at the lower end of the range of observation for the

Thorndike sample and thus subject to less confidence in estimation. Interval midpoints with respect to schooling are used for schooling classes

13-15 (14) and 17+ (18). More precise information about the distribution
within these intervals would sharpen the prediction.

Predictions beyond age fifty-six are made assuming earnings constant

after peak earnings. This is necessary due to the data limitations in
the NBER-Thorndike sample. The age distribution used from the 1960 Census

individuals are at the midpoint

assumes

length

from

of age intervals that increase in

two years at early ages to ten at late ages. Approximately

10 per cent of the 1960 population falls in the least reliable age
interval 55—64.

The unequal intervals also cause problems in comparing predicted and

actual earnings distributions. Predicted distributions can be made for
any interval groups and are made for equal $1,000 intervals here. The
Census of Population earnings distributions are unequal beyond $7,000.
Statistics are computed using interval midpoints and will vary with differ-

ent groupings. The interval midpoint 25,000 is used for the interval
>

15 in the Census of Population while equal 1,000 intervals up to 50,000

are used for predicted distributions.

Several important differences remain. The 1960 Census figures are
for total income while the predicted figures are for earnings in the

labor market. There may be important differences in weeks worked during

— 37 —

the

year,

and hours worked during the week between the sample and the

population.

There are indications that the men in the NBER-Thorndike

sample tend to work longer hours and to spend less time unemployed.

Another very important difference is that the 1960 Census figures
include

employed students while these persona are

estimating

the

earnings

function. This

excluded

in

contributes largely to the

large relative frequency of very low income at early ages. For
example, 84 per cent of sixteen and seventeen year olds earned less

than $1,000 as did 53 per cent of eighteen and nineteen year olds.
These

are likely to be mostly

employed students.

Predicted Earnings Distributions Corrected for Unexplained Variation

These earnings distributions are mean earnings distributions cor-

rected for

variation in earning, not explained by age, schooling, and

ability. Instead of transforming density

space

from (age, schooling, ability)-

into a single earnings point it is spread over the positive real

line in a manner proportional to the normal probability density with its

center

at the predicted mean value

and

standard deviation equal to the

estimated standard error of the regression.

Selected statistics are presented in Table 5. Relative frequency

distributions

are

presented

are plotted in Figure 11.

in Figure 11 and

slightly before age twenty-four in the predicted distributions then rises

continuously as it does throughout in the actual distribution. The
standard dip then rises as ability increases. The coefficient of variation,
or standard deviation relative to the mean, moves in a less stable way.

in the ability group average to one standard deviation above average and

fairly constant outside that interval. It is interesting to note here that
the variance of overall earnings is the sum of the average of the variances
of the subgroups and the variance of average earnings of subgroups.28

Another characteristic of earnings distributions widely discussed in

the literature is concentration represented by the Lorsnz curve and its

sury statistic the Gini coefficient. 29 The Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient are unambiguous measures of concentration only if the Lorenz

curves do not cross. An infinite number of Lorenz curves may have the

same Gini concentration coefficient if they cross. If two Lorenz

The actual distribution of income may be said to be unambiguously

less concentrated than the corrected predicted distribution. The predicted mean distribution Lorenz curve crosses both the others from above,

Even though the actual distribution has only one-

approximately the same variance and close to the same concentration,

within six one—hundreths, the distribution with the largest skew intersects the other from above. These same basic relationships hold within
subgroup

distributions.

Within schooling groups the largest range in concentration is noted
in the mean distributions with a range from .81 in the lowest schooling
class to •4730 in the highest schooling class, declining monotonically.

30The Gini coefficient is overstated for both the highest schooling
and highest ability groups in the predicted distributions due to the
open-ended earnings interval > 49,000. The actual distribution Lorenz
curve and Gini coefficient are also approximaate due to the wide unequal
intervals for high income levels.

31Again higher and lower are relative with a distribution and are
not comparable, with Lorenz curves, between distributions.

The most striking result is that there is much less inequality in

human wealth than in earnings. The overall coefficient of variation
drops from above 80 per cent to less than 10 per cent and the overall
Gini coefficient rises from less than 65 per cent to at least 90 per

cent

for the interest rates considered.

-'The statistics for the highest ability class are calculated as if the highest open ended in—
come interal 246,000+ were of length 2000 as the lower intervals are. This is however clearly not
true.
For r = .03, for example, this last interval for the highest ability class contains 53.8 percent of the operations. This is important only for the statistics relating to r = .03. At all other
discount rates the percent in this final interval is less than 8 percent.
