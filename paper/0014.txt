THE EFFECTS ON INCOME OF TYPE OF COLLEGE ATTENDED #

I. Introduction
The effects of particular attributes of colleges on the subsequent earnings
of

individuals who attend are much discussed but rarely studied systematically.

Here we seek to compare the earnings patterns of people attending different

types of colleges. The classification of colleges used in this study is the
scheme developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education based on the
sense of commitments to research, types of programs offered, and selectivity
of admission of students.'
Much of the recent research on the effects of schooling and school quality
has placed little emphasis on the importance of schooling. It is widely felt
that differences among schools are less likely o effect ultimate educational
outcomes (such as earnings) than do differences in innate ability, family

background or luck. For example, in a classic study James Coleman (1966)
argued that differences in characteristics of elementary schools attended were
unimportant when compared to other variables, in determining differentials in

student achievements. Eric Hanushek (1972) found that differences in expenditures
do not affect the learning of children, although there are characteristics of

teachers which do have an impact. In particular, Hanushek found that teachers'
verbal aptitudes, the newness of their training and racial differences, which
he interprets as differences in the quality of teacher training, significantly

influence children's learning facility. An implication of this study is that
school expenditures differences are unimportant because monies are spent on
the wrong things (e.g., teacher seniority).

2

r

Other studies have drawn similar conclusions for the whole educational

system.

Christopher Jencks (1972) has minimized the effects of schooling in

:

reducing cognitive and economic inequality. Samuel Bowles (1972), an economist,
and Alexander Astin (1968), a psychologist, have concluded that differences in
schools at various levels ranging from elementary to higher education have only
small effects on student characteristics, be they economic or cognitive.
However, Astin does find that college students demonstrate differential
changes in affective behavior depending upon the quality of the colleges they

attended. Moreover, Spaeth and Greeley (1970) found that their measures of
quality had effects on occupational prestige even after the addition of a

number of other variables, which seemed to have reduced quality to insignificance
in the studies previously referred to.

To jump ahead to the major conclusion of this study, we find that at the
college level, differences in type of institution attended have highly
significant effects on differences in lifetime earnings patterns of students.
These results hold even after controlling for a wide array of other factors,

including individual student ability. Our study differs from the recent
literature in several ways. We focus on differences in individual earnings

according to broad type of higher educational institution attended. Although
we describe the significant differences among types of institutions we do not
specify what it is about particular types of schools which causes the differences

in earnings patterns. It might be the more efficient use of resources, it
might be differences in some ummeasurable aspects of the learning environment.
Our study stresses that institutional differences matter-—an issue not
previously well-documented and one certainly not universally acknowledged.

Of course, institutional differences do not explain all of the variance in

• individuals earnings. However, the fact that much remains to be explained
does not undermine the policy importance of the results.

3

We are fortunate to have a rather unique sample of individuals whom we

can study

in

order to see the relationship between college type and life

cycle income. The economic and social history of over 5,000 male World
War II veterans who volunteered for pilot or navigator training is available
through data from Air Force tests and follow-up surveys by Thorn'ike and the

NBER.2 About 75 per cent of the sample attended college and the Carnegie
class could be determined for almost 3,700 respondents. Most of the
respondents attended college in the early postwar period and received G. I.

Bill subsidies. Although the Carnegie classifications are based on more
recent descriptions of the colleges, the scheme probably does not vary greatly

over time.3 The type of institutions, the number of schools of each type
and the proportion of respondents in eachCarnegie class are as follows:

II.

Characteristics of Colleges and Attributes of Students
To get a sense of the differences among colleges of different Carnegie

types, data on sone attributes of colleges were gathered and the means are

presented in Table 1. Each of these might be considered a dimension of
college quality, and their effects on earnings of those who attended will

4

be studied elsewhere (cf. Solmon, 1972). Table I summarizes measures of faculty
compensation, total expenditures of institutions per full-time equivalent
(Table 1 here)

student, S.A.T. scores of entering freshmen, Astin's indexes of intellectuality,

selectivity, and the overall Gourman rating of school quality. According to

these measures, the leading research universities consistently rank fir.
Next highest come other research universities and highly selective liberal

arts schools. The third range of these quality variables are found in the
two classes of other doctoral granting institutions, followed by all other

colleges. The calculated F statistics for the null hypothesis that the means
are equal across Carnegie codes are also shown in Table I. The hypothesis
is rejected at the 1 per cent level in every case; that is, there are indeed

statistically significant differences in quality of colleges as we measure

it. The question posed below is whether this typing of colleges affects the
returns to education.

Table 2 provides data on mean incomes of former students according to

type of undergraduate college attended and years completed. The rankings of
incomes by type of college attended vary depending upon years completed, but

in general, do not match strongly the rankings of colleges according to their

quality attributes. For example, the highest "quality" group is the leading
research institutions, but for students not obtaining more than sixteen years
of schooling the graduates of highly selective liberal arts colleges had the
highest mean incomes in 1969.
(Table 2 here)

III. The Earnings Model
The human capital literature provides a simple framework for analyzing

the effects of school type and quality on income. Mincer (1970) suggests an

5

income generating function of the form:

a + rs. + biji + b2j +

lnY
where
5.

(1)

is earnings, j experience in the labor force at year t, and

years of schooling of the 1th individual, whose coefficient, r,

is

the

rate of return to schooling. Variables are added to the income generating
function as shift factors to account for specific influences. In this
manner, the regression equation is expanded to include a measure of
intelligence and dummy variables for occupation groups with large nonpecuniary income.

To the model (1) plus the already mentioned shift variables, we add
the type of college attended, designated by Q.

It

is suggested here that

the original specification shifts systematically with Q.

However, school

type may not enter the income generating function as a shift factor, but
through changes in the rate of return to schooling.. That is, the effect
of higher quality education will be a higher observed rate of return.

This is not inconsistent with Mincer's derivation of the income generating
function which assumes that the cost of a year of school is the same for

any school. The modified income generating function is in this case:

lnY. = a

+ r(Q1) s. + b1

+ b2

+ U

(2)

where r(Q.) is a linear function of the school type variable. In summary,
if college type is considered a shift 'factor, it enters as a separate

independent variable; whereas if it is thought to enter by affecting the
return to years in school, it enters the regression as an interaction with

years of schooling. Both specifications of the model are tested below.
Regressions explaining 1969 earnings of the NBER—TH respondents are found

6

in Table 3. The regressions include a standard collection of variables:
years of schooling, IQ,4 years of experience and experience squared, and
dummy variables with a value of one if the respondent is a teacher, doctor,

lawyer or airplane pilot. The college type, denoted by Q, is entered as a
series of dummy variables, one for each Carnegie class. Each observation
will have a value of one for the dummy variable representing the last
undergraduate college attended by the respondent and a zero otherwise.
(Table 3 here)

The standard earnings function appears in column 1 of Table 3. Coefficients
are as expected, except perhaps, for the relatively low schooling coefficient.5
When IQ is added (Column 2).,, its coefficient is significant and the schooling

coefficient is reduced. The interesting questions arise when the set of
dummy variables representing the Carnegie class of the respondents under-

graduate college are introduced. The specification shown in Columns 3 and 4
assumes i-hat the earnings function has the same shape for all students and

any differences due to a "college type effect" are manifested in different

intercepts. The coefficients on the other variables do not change noticeably
when the dummy variables are added. The coefficients on the dummy variables
are differences from the intercept for the omitted group (comprehensive colleges

with a substantial selection of programs, type 5). The coefficients can be
adjusted (cf. Sweeney and Ulveling, 1972) to show the percentage deviation
from the sample mean income for students who attended each type of college.

With experience, years of college, IQ and occupational structure held constant
(Column 4), the college type effects are:

uigher than

average earnings are predicted for those who attended leading

research universities (type 1)
(type

or

large doctoral granting institutions

3) and lower earnings are predicted for smaller doctoral granting

institutions, comprehensive colleges with a limited selection of programs

and other liberal arts colleges. The ranking of schools by the predicted
incomes of students is closely related to the attributes of the schools

themselves shown in Table 1. For example, the rankings of school types
by predicted income and by total expenditures per student have a correlation
of .79.

F tests were used to see whether the addition of the college type dummies
add significantly to the explanatory power of the original earnings functions

of Columns I and 2.6 The critical value of the F statistic at the 1 per cent
significance level is roughly 2.75. If the calculated F exceeds this
critical value, the implication is that the additional variables (the
Carnegie type dummies) add significantly to the explanatory power of the

model. When we compare Columns 2 and 4, the F obtained is 6.15; when we

compare Columns I and 3, the F value is 8.38. We conclude that the type
of college does indeed affect the income, in later life, of those who

attended. If the type of college attended was merely a proxy for one's
own innate abilities, we might have expected that college typing would add
significantly when IQ was not entered in the earnings function, but would

not be significant after controlling for individual abilities. This is
clearly not the case, and it appears that college type has a significant
influence independent of the individual's IQ.
Columns 5 and 6 interact college type with years of schooling. This

is the specification of the model that suggests that college type affects

the rate of return coefficient. If a particular dummy multiplied by the

8

number of years attended is significant, we cannot attribute the significance

explicitly to college type but rather to the interaction. Because the years
variable is highly significant, we would predict significance on all the

interacted dummy variables. This is indeed the case. The interesting
question is whether the explanatory power of the model is significantly
improved by the interaction dummies, which separate the rate of return
coefficient into rates for each Carnegie class, as compared to the

standard model of Columns 1 and 2. The F test comparing Column 2 with
Column 6 (the latter omits years as a separate independent variable but
includes the dummies which stand for college types multiplied by years)
indicates that the categorization of the rate of return by Carnegie class

is significant. The F value in this case was 5.40. A comparison of Column 5
with Column I indicates that this result holds when IQ is not included in

the equation as well. When slope interactions are added to the equation
with schooling coefficient interactions, it also adds significantly to the

explanatory power of the model. However, the addition of the years of
schooling interaction variables to the equation with slope interactions was

not significant. These results indicate that the average earnings differences
may be more important than differences in rates of return among Carnegie
classes.

The rate of returnto schooling for the whole sample is 5.11 per cent
(years coefficient in Column 1, Table 3). When separate return of return
are estimated for each college type (Column 5), the rates vary from 2.87

per cent for type 8 colleges to 6.61 per cent for type 1 colleges. The
rates of return are significantly different from the average rate for all

schools except types 2, 5, and 8. The schooling coefficients can,
alternatively, be interpreted as the net percentage increase in income from

an additional year of schooling. It should be noted that the ranking of

9

school

types by rate of return coefficients (the marginal increase in earnings

per year of schooling) is not identically the same as the ranking by the

average net deviation from the sample mean (shown above). The rank
correlation of the two procedures is .67. For example, students from
highly selective liberal arts colleges (type 7) rank higher on the average

than at the margin relative to the other school types. This result is
consistent with the expectation of decreasing marginal returns to schooling
as the mean number of years and the observation that respondents from type 7
colleges have the highest mean number of years of college (4.43).
The last regression in Table 3 excludes IQ as a separate variable, but

includes a set of dummies which interact college type with IQ. The F
value for the comparison of Column 7 and Column 2 is 6.21, which implies

that the interaction between IQ and school type is also significant. We
conclude then that not only are college type, years attended, and IQ
significant in themselves., but that college type and IQ in conjunction with

the number of years attended make significant contributions. That is, if
we know the college type attended, we can improve the predictive power of

our earnings function. But if we know the college type attended according
to the number of years attained or IQ, we can do even better.
The

results in Table 3 ignore the possible influence on earnings of the•

type of graduate school attended. For this reason the tests were also made
for regressions including only people with sixteen or fewer years of
schooling (69.7 per cent of all those who attended college). For the
subgroup not attending graduate school, the coefficient on the years
variable is about one-third larger, indicating that there are differences

in the returns to graduate and undergraduate study. The effects of college
type in the truncated sample are substantially the same as those in Table 1.

10

As in Table I, the addition of the Carnegie class dummies to the basic
arnings function, adds significantly to the explanatory power of the

model. It is interesting, however, that when we allow the Carnegie
classification to interact with IQ, we do not add significantly to the

explanatory power of the model. The implication is that the interaction
between college type and ability does not matter for those who did not
go beyond college.

The aggregate earnings functions in Table 3 demonstrate conclusively
that the type of college attended increases the explanatory power of the

earnings model. It is, however, possible that these observed differences
are due to the innate differences of the students themselves rather than

the differences among colleges. The process by hich colleges increase
the earnings potential of students is complex and may be fundamentally

ifferent for different types of students. Thus, the results have not
categorically shown that there are productivity differences among

different types of colleges. To explore the question further, the sample
was divided into groups based on pre-college differences among respondents.

We examine whether the basic earnings function (Table 3, Column 2) and the
basic function augmented by the college type dummies (Table 3, Column 4)

differ according to the socio-economic status and ability of the
respondents.7

Estimates of the earnings function including dummy variables for the
type of college attended for each of three SES and three ability groups are

shown in Table 4. Chow tests (cf. Chow, 1960) are used to test whether
the vector of coefficients in each of the subgroups differed in a
statistically significant way from the corresponding regression for the
whole sample in Table 3.

There is no structural difference in the
(Table 4 here)

11

equations divided into low, medium, and high ability groups compared to the
aggregate equation including the Carnegie types which appears in Table 3,

Column 4. On the other hand, there are significant differences in the
structure of the earnings function depending upon socio-economic status
compared to the function for the pooled sample.

The predicted mean earnings, cet. par., are consistently higher for
respondents from type 1 schools and consistently lower for respondents
from type 4, 6, and 8 schools compared to the mean for each ability and

socio-economic status group. Thus, the within group patterns of college
type effects reproduce the major effects observed for the whole sample.

The range of thepredicted percentage differences from the sample mean
due to college type are larger for the SES and ability groups than for
the whole sample in all but one case.

For the sample as a whole, the F tests among equations in Table 3
indicated a definite effect of college type on the explanatory power of

the earnings function. The same question is posed within ability and
socio-economic status group. The tests comparing each equation in Table 4
to a corresponding equation without college type dummies are not as

conclusive. The dummy shift variables for Carnegie college type increase
the explanatory power of the model at the 1 per cent level of significance
for the low and high ability groups and the medium and high SES groups only.

These results indicate that socio-economic status, if not ability, does

alter the process by which schooling affects earnings. The question remains
whether college type affects earnings when the function explaining earnings

is allowed to vary fully for each group. That is, does allowing for
differences in the structure of the educational process in each type of

school (by estimating separate earnings functions for each college type),
improve the predictive ability of the model. These results are not shown;
because the sample sizes are very small for some college types, estimates

12

of the basic earnings function for each college type are difficult to

interpret. A summary of the results are presented in Table 5. The
schooling coefficient and summary statistics are presented from an earnings

function for each college type. The specification corresponds to the overall
equation in Table 4, Column 2. A Chow test across the eight sets of
coefficients rejects the null hypothesis that the vectors of coefficients

are equal across college types (F =

12.32).

The structure of the earnings

functions do differ and the categorization by college type increases the
predictive power of the model.
(Table 5 here)

It appears that the extra income associated with more years of higher
education is statistically significant for all types of colleges attended,

except types 4 and 7. However, this payoff is largest at the research
institutions (leading and other) and at the highly selective liberal arts

colleges. On the other hand, controlling for years attended, the payoff
to IQ seems largest at the large doctoral granting institutions and at

liberal arts colleges. Since college quality probably varies widely among
these types of schools, the importance of IQ may stand for the impact of

colleges of higher quality. The research universities may be more
homogeneous in terms of student quality and other measures.
The effects of entering particular occupations (which are not shown in

Table 5) vary widely depending upon the type of undergraduate college

attended. However, the patterns are not systematic. For example, MD's who
went to highly selective liberal arts colleges had the largest increment
in earnings, whereas lawyers who attended comprehensive colleges with

substantial programs did best. Yet lawyers graduating from the former
type of school were only the third highest earning group, and doctors
graduating from the latter type ranked fourth in earnings among doctors.

13

These results might reflect sorting patterns of undergraduates into types
of colleges according to traits important for particular careers but not

reflected in IQ. Perhaps those who go from highly selective liberal arts
colleges to medical schools are more creative or innovative, harder working,
or motivated than are those entering medicine from other types of colleges.
Perhaps in order to make this particular move, one needs these superior

traits. On the other hand, it might be that a particular type of college
better prepares graduates for particular careers.
More detailed studies of the educational process and differences therein

depending upon type of college are necessary. Perhaps there is something
about highly selective liberal arts colleges which leads their brightest
students to earn more than bright students from other types of schools, or

which results in those graduates who become doctors earning more than other

doctors. Speculation could be unending, but the major lesson so far is
that different types of colleges do have different effects on earnings.

IV. Conclusion
The question we set out to study was whether the type of college
attended has an influence on the subsequent earnings of those who attend.
It is quite apparent that the earnings function, or the relationship
between income and its determinants, do differ depending upon college type.
There are different returns to extra years, different rewards to IQ,
different rewards to occupational choice.

The initial tests of the impact of college type as an additional
explanatory set of explanatory variables in an earnings function suggested

that college type is a significant determinant of earnings. When the tests
are made within ability and socio-economic status groups, the results were

less conclusive. These results suggest that the effectiveness of different

14

types of school may vary with different types of students. A final test of
whether the earnings function has the same shape for people attending different

types of colleges, also indicated that college types differ. The importance
of college type is demonstrated conclusively, although differences among
students may be of equal importance.

Differences among students and in the educational process of colleges
prevents us from making any statements about which college types should be

preferred. Although the earnings model suggests that college type is not
the overwhelming determinant of earnings, the relationships do differ

according to this factor. These results indicate, therefore, that the
educational production process varies with college type and the nature of
these differences should be explored in future xesearch.

3. Time series information for one measure of quality, average faculty
salaries, is available for a group of thirty-six schools. The
Spearman rank correlations for all parts of 1939-40, 1953-54, 1959-60,
1969-70 data are between .55 and .88.

4. The IQ variable was constructed by Albert Beaton of the Educational
Testing Service from a factor analysis of the battery of Air Force

tests taken by respondents. it has a mean for all respondents of 100
and standard deviation of 10. The variable is a combined measure of
innate ability and pre—test (pre-college for almost all respondents)

achievement. The experience variable is measured as the number of
years from the respondents initial job.

It is

expected that the

respondents'

college education would be low because they attended

college at a relatively advanced age under G.I. Bill subsidies.

6. The test of a general linear hypothesis is found inF. Graybill
(1961: 135). Throughout the paper the term significance will be
used to refer to significance at the one per cent level.

7. The SES classification is based on a ranking of the occupation of the

respondent's father. The scheme used is: high (SESH): managerial,
proprietor, professional or technical; medium (SESM): officer worker,
salesman, foreman, skilled blue collar; low (SESL): service worker,
semi- or unskilled and others. Of the respondents who attended college,
49.8 per cent are from high and 14.0 per cent from low socio-economic
backgrounds.
