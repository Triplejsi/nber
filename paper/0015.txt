Abstract

The prediction accuracy of six estimators of econometric rrodels

are compared. Two of the estimators are ordinary least squares (OLS)

and full-infonratjon iiaxiiam likelihood (FIML). The other four
estimators are robust estimators in the sense that they give less

to large

residuals. One

of

weight

the four estimators is approximately

equivalent to the least-absolute-residual (LAR) estirrator, one is a

combination
one

of OLS for smell residuals and LAR for

large residuals,

is an estimator proposed by John W. Thkey, and one

is a combination

of FIML and LAR. All of the estimators account for first-order serial

correlation of the error terms.
The rrain conclusion is that robust estimators appear quite
promising for the estimation of econometric rnDdels. Of the robust
estimators considered in the paper, the one based on minimizing the
sum of the absolute values of the residuals perfond the best. The
FIML

estimator

appear

and the combination of the FIML and LAR estimators also

promising.

Outside-Sample Prediction Errors for Fifteen Variables 24

I. Introduction
Many recent studies of robust estimation techniques have been
Monte Carlo studies and have been concerned with estimating a small

number of parameters.' The purpose of this paper is to examine the
usefulness of such techniques for the estimation of econometric models.

Six

estimators

are compared. Each estimator is first used to estimate

the stochastic equations of the model described in Fair L1. Then for
each set of estimates, within-sample predictions (both static and
dynamic)

of

the endogenous variables are generated. The estimators are

of

compared in terms

the accuracy of the within-sample predictions. Some

outside-sample predictions are also analyzed.

The

Fair L61,

methodology of this paper is similar to the methodology in

where

ten estimators were compared. The study [61 dealt only

with the eight-equation linear subset of the model in LU], however,
while this paper considers the nonlinear part of the model as well.

The

in L61 indicate that accounting for first-order serial
correlation of the error terms is quite important, and so all six
results

L 11, and Hughes L 9].

et al. [2], Aridrews

-2-

estimators in this paper have been modified to account for first-order
serial correlation.2

Two of the six estimators are ordinary least squares (OLS) and

full-information maximum likelihood (FINL). The other four estimators
can be considered to be robust estimators in the sense that they give

less weight to large residuals. One of the four estimators is approximately
equivalent to the least-absolute-residual (LAR) estimator, one is a
combination of OLS for small residuals and LAR for large residuals, one
is an estimator proposed by John W. Tukey, and one is a combination of
FINL and LAR.

The present model is both nonlinear in coefficients (after

adjusting for serial correlation) and nonlinear in variables. Consequently,
the standard way of obtaining LAR estimates of a linear model by converting
the problem to a linear programming problem could not be used in this
study, and the available programs f or obtaining FIML estimates of a

linear model could not be used. The procedures that were employed
to obtain these estimates are described in Sections III and IV.

II. The Model
The model is described in [L1 and will not be discussed in any
detail here. For present purposes, the monthly housing starts sector has
not been used, and housing starts have been taken to be exogenous. The

be consistent with the notation in [61, "AUTO1" should be
added to the name of each estimator, but since all estimators in this
paper are "AUTOf estimators, this will not be done.

equations of the model are listed in Table 1. There are a few
differences between the equations in Table 1 and the equations in Table

11-4 in L41, and these differences are discussed at the end of Table 1.

added to the

auto

strikes. These four equations were the ones most affected by the

equation to account for the effects of the two

strikes. The sample period used for the estimation and simulation was
1960 II - 1973 I, a total of 52 observations.
Each stochastic equation of the model except the price equation
is assumed to have a first-order serially correlated error term. For
each of the six estimation techniques, first-order serial correlation
was handled by transforming each equation into one with a non-serially
correlated error term and then treating the resulting equation as

nonlinear in the coefficients. If, for example, the equation to be
estimated is:
(1)

b1 +

b2xt

+

b3y1 + ut,

where

(2) u = Put_i +

not

being serially correlated, the equation can be 'written:
(3)

Pyt_i

+

b1(l-P) + b2(xt-Pxti) + b3(y 1-Py 2 +

which is a standard nonlinear equation in the coefficients.

There are a number of approaches that can be tried to maximize L.

The results in Fair L5] indicate that quite large unconstrained maximization problems can be solved using algorithms that either do not require

derivatives or for which derivatives are obtained numerically. The

approach in Lsl is the approach taken in this paper. Three algorithms

were used: the 1964 algorithm of Powell [iii, which does not require
any derivatives; a member of the class of gradient algorithms considered

by Huang [81, which requires first derivatives; and the quadratic
hill-climbing algorithm of Goldfeld, Quandt, and Trotter L71, which

requires both first and second derivatives. All

derivatives

were obtained

numerically. See Lsl for more discussion of these algorithms and for
a discussion of the computation of numeric derivatives.

3See, for example, Chow L31.

—9—

The model in Table 1 decomposes naturally into two blocks: a
linear, simultaneous block and a nonlinear, recursive block. FflVIL

estimates were first obtained for the two blocks separately, using the
ordinary least squares estimates as starting points, which required

estimating 38 and 23 coefficients, respectively. FI estimates of all
61 coefficients were then obtained, using the FI estimates of the two
blocks as starting points. In contrast to the work in L51, no systematic
attempt was made in this study to compare the various algorithms, and so

no results using alternative algorithms will be presented here. Powell's
no-derivative algorithm was usually used first to obtain an answer, and
then this answer was checked by starting the gradient and quadratic-hillclimbing algorithms from the answer to see if a larger value of the

likelihood function could be found. In some cases a larger value was
found using the other two algorithms, and in some cases the quadratichill-climbing algorithm found a larger value than did the gradient

algorithm. In general it appeared that the FI computational problem
here was not as well behaved nor as robust to the use of different
algorithms as was the optimal control problem in [51.

The present approach to obtaining the FI estimates has the
advantage of requiring little human effort. Given that algorithm
and numeric-derivative programs are available, one needs only to write
a simple program to compute the value of L for a given vector of

coefficients. In the present case

can be factored into two parts:

one that is a function of some of the coefficients but not of time and

one that is a function of time but not of any coefficients. Consequently,

the determinant of J has to be computed only on per evaluation of L

—10--

rather

than the T times

required

.
for the more general case. The more

general case can be handled by the present approach, however, since all
the more general case does is increase the computer time required per
evaluation of L. The extra prograimning effort required for the more
general case is quite small.

IV. The Computation of the Robust Estimates
Least-absolute-residual (LAR) estimates of equation (Lij) are
obtained by mi.nimizing

(7)

Q

ut!
g

with respect to the unknown parameters. Since in the present case

is

Ugt
a nonlinear function of the unknown parameters because of the serial

correlation assumption, Q cannot be minimized through the solution of a

linear programming problem. An attempt was made in this study to minimize
Q by using the approach and algorithms discussed in Section III, but this

attempt failed. The algorithms were not in general successful in finding
global optima. Often they converged to different answers for different
starting points, and many times different algorithms converged to different
answers from the same starting point.

LAR estimates can, however, be obtained, at least approdmately,
by converting the problem to a weighted-least-squares problem. Rewrite
Q as:

(8)

T (uj
g
Q= L
tl Ugt

.

—11—

The problem of minimizing Q in (8) is merely a weighted-least-squares

problem if the denominator is known. An iterative procedure can thus
be used to minimize Q. Initial estimates of the residuals are first
obtained, say by ordinary least squares, and are then used as weights to
obtain new estimates of the parameters and residuals by weighted least

squares. These new residual estimates are then used as new weights to
obtain new parameter and residual estimates, and so on. In the present
case, unweighted ordinary-least-squares estimates were used to begin
the iteration, and the program was allowed to iterate four times thereafter.

The estimates usually changed only slightly after the first or second
weighted-least-squares estimates (the first or second iteration following

the initial ordinary-least-squares estimates). The problem of zero
residual estimates (making weighted-least-squares estimates on the next
iteration impossible to obtain) was avoided by setting residual estimates
less than a small number

For present

was taken to be .00001.

Both the unweighted- and weighted-least-squares problems in the
present case are nonlinear problems, and the estimates had to be obtained

by a nonlinear technique. The degree of nonlinearity, however, is not
great, being due only to the presence of the serial correlation parameter,

and hence the problems could be easily solved using standard algorithrns!
Because the program was allowed only four iterations and because of
the c treatment of very small residuals, the estimates obtained by the

The algorithm used in this case is the algorithm prograrimied into
TROLL at the Computer Research Center of the National Bureau of Economic
Research. This same algorithm was also used in the computation of the
WLS-II and WLS-III estimates described below.

.

they should be quite close. This estimator will be called WLS-I.
The second weighted-least-squares estimator considered is a

combination of OLS for small residuals and LAR for large residuals. For
this estimator the denominator in (8) was still taken to be IUgt if

k, but was taken to be k if I u

gt

< k. The value of k was

taken to be a robust estimate of the standard error of the regression,

namely m/.67L'5, where i is the median of the absolute value of the
estimated residuals.5 The WLS-I estimates were used as starting
points, and the program was allowed to run for four iterations. The
median of the absolute value of the residual estimates was reestimated
at each iteration, and the value of k was changed from iteration to

iteration. This estimator will be called WLS-II.

This estimator is attributed to John W. Tukey by Andrews Lii. Values
for k1 of both 6 and 9 have been proposed, and the value of 6 was used
for this study. The value of k2 was taken to be m/.67LI5, where again

m is the median of the absolute value of the residuals. The WLS-I
estimates were used as starting points, and the program was allowed to

run for four iterations. The value of k2 was changed from iteration to
iteration. This estimator will be called WLS-III.
All three of the weighted-least-squares estimators in this section
are single-equation estimators and do not take into account the problems
associated with estimating systems of equations.

V. The Combination of the FI}a.. and Robust Estimators

Considering robust estimators as weighted-least-squares estimators,
it is quite straightforward to combine the FI1fl and robust estimators.

Consider, for example, the WLS-I estimator, which in the single-equation
case weights each residual by 1/ J

is the same as in (6). Given an initial set of residual

estimates to be used as weights, L* can be maximized with respect to

the unknown parameters. In the maximization process each residual
is weighted by one over the square root of the absolute value of the initial

residual
could

estimate.

Weighting schemes other than the one used for 14LS-I

also be proposed, which would merely change the computation of

S*gh in (10).

For purposes here only the WLS-I weighting scheme was combined

with FIML. The weights were taken from the WLS-I residual estimates,
with residual estimates of less than .00001 being set equal to .00001.
Given the weights, L* was maximized using the same algorithms that were
used to maximize

L.

The experience maximizing L* using the algorithms

was similar to the experience maximizing L, although the problem of

maximizing L* seemed slightly more difficult. Because of cost considerations,
no iterations on the weights were performed. In other words, L* was
only maximized once, and the new residual estimates from this solution
were not used to construct new weights to be used for a second maximization,

and so on. This estimator will be called FINLWLS-I.

VI. Within-Sample Comparison of the Six Sets of Estimates
In Table 2 the six sets of estimates are presented for each of

the eleven stochastic equations. The two sets of FI estimates tend to
differ more from the other four sets of estimates than the other four

sets of estimates differ from each other. In particular, this is true
for the coefficient estimates of the inventory equation and for the

estimate of the constant term, 7l' in the price equation. There were
no important cases of sign reversals among the different estimates

of the same parameter. The only sign reversals occurred for P3
and for two duimny-variable coefficients,

and 89

The root mean square errors and mean absolute errors for six

variables are presented in Table 3

for

each of the six estimators. The

six variables are GNP in current dollars (GNPt), the private output
deflator

GNP in constant dollars (GNPRt), private nonfarm employ-

ment (Mt), the difference between establishment employment data and
household survey employment data (Dt), and the level of the secondary

labor force (LF2). The errors for the six variables are not independent
of one another in the sense that, for example, large errors in predicting
GNPt are likely to lead to large errors in predicting the other variables.

is determined in the linear, simultaneous-equations block of the
model, and the other variables are determined in the nonlinear, recursive

block. The five variables presented in Table 3 from the recursive block
are the five most important variables in the block. The estimates of
the serial correlation coefficients were used in the generation of the
predictions from the model.
The results in Table 3 are fairly self-explanatory. Consider

GNPt first. OLS is obviously the worst, being last on all grounds except
the one- and two-quarter-ahead predictions, where it is better than

FIMLWLS-I. WLS-I

is

better than WLS-II and WLS-III for the three-quarter-

ahead predictions and beyond, beating them on all counts, although not

by much for the three-quarter-ahead prediction. For the one- and two-

quarter-ahead predictions, the results are close. FI does well for all
but the simulation over the entire period, where it falls down somewhat.

FIWLS-I is the best for the simulation over the entire period, but is
not particularly good for the other predictions.
Consider

next. The two FINL estimators are the worst, which

is caused in large part by the different estimates of the constant term

the PD equation. The results for the other four estimators are

quite close except for the simulation over the entire period, where the

ranking is WLS-I, WLS—II, WLS-III, and OLS. This ranking is the same
as that for GNPt for the simulation over the entire period, which is
explained by the fact that for the simulation over the entire period the
perdictions of GNPt have an important effect on the predictions of
PDt.

For GNPRt, OLS is again the worst, being last on all grounds.

WLS-I is better than WLS—II and WLS-III on all grounds. FIML does better
than WLS—I for the one—and two—quarter—ahead predictions, even considering
the poorer FIML predictions of PDiwhich are used in the computation of
the predictions of GNPRtI but the opposite is true for the three-quarter-

ahead predictions and beyond. FIMLWLS-I is the best for the two-through
five-quarter-ahead predictions, but falls down slightly for the other two.

For Mt the results are fairly close except for the simulation
over the entire period, where the RMSE ranking is WLS-I, WLS-II, WLS-III,
OLS, FIMLWLS-I, and FIML, and the MAE ranking is WLS-I, WLS-II, FILMWLS-I,
FIML, WLS-III, and OLS.

For Dt.

does consistently well, but the

results are again fairly close except for the simulation over the entire

period. For LF2t. the FIML estimators get worse as the period ahead
lengthens. For the simulation over the entire period, OLS is best by a
slight amount.

The following is a tentative list of conclusions drawn from
the results in Table 3.

1. WLS—I appears better than WLS-II

and

WLS-III, and all three

appear better than OLS. In this regard it is interesting to note that
it is not just the treatment of large residuals that appears important,
since WLS—II, which is a combination of OLS for small residuals and WLS-I

-22-

for large residuals, does not do as well as WLS-I. The different treatment
of small residuals by WLS-I compared with OLS appears also to be of importance.

2. For the predictions of GNPtF FIML is obviously better than
OLS, which is the same conclusion reached in { 6] .

For the other variables,

which are not determined simultaneously, FIML is not always better. In
other words, more gain appears likely from using FIML over OLS when the
model is simultaneous than when it is recursive.

3. Among WLS-I, FIML, and FIMLWLS-I there is no obvious winner
since the rankings differ depending on the variable predicted and the number

of periods ahead for which the prediction is made. Overall, however, WLS-I
probably has an edge, especially if emphasis is put on the results for the
variables in the recursive block, where FIML and FIMLWLS-I do not in general

do particularly well, Given the success of WLS-I, it may be of interest in
future work to examine the performance of the combination of two—stage
least squares and WLS-I.7

4. For the one-quarter-ahead (static) predictions, the results
are all fairly close, which means that if one is only interested in static
predictions, the choice of an estimator is not too important (assuming
the estimator accounts for first-order serial correlation) .

For dynamic

predictions the choice is important, and a conclusion reached in [

6]

7One obvious way to combine two—stage least squares and WLS—I
is simply to run first—stage regressions in the usual way and use the
fitted values of the endogenous variables from these regressions in
place of the actual values of the right-hand-side endogenous variables
in the present procedure of obtaining WLS-I estimates.

—23—

is also relevant here, namely that more work ought to be done on
developing estimators that take into account the fact that values of

lagged endogenous variables are not known after the one-period-ahead
predictions.

the

It should finally be noted that predictions were also generated
based

on WLS-I estimates obtained after the first iteration from ordinary

least squares (rather than after the fourth iteration as above). The
results were better than the OLS results, but not as good as the WLS-I

results based on four iterations. Iterating more than once clearly
improved the prediction accuracy of the estimator.

VII. Outside-Sample Comparisons of OLS and WLS-I Estimates
In order to see if the superiority of WLS-I over OLS also held

up

for outside-sample predictions, the model was reestimated by

WLS-I and OLS only through 1968 IV. Predictions for the 1969 I - 1973 I
period were then generated based on these two sets of estimates. In
Table L, error measures for the simulation over the entire prediction

period (17 observations) are presented for fifteen variables. For

GNPt, WLS_I outperforms OLS. Of the six components of GNPt, W'-I is
better for three. Of the other eight variables, which are determined
in the recursive block, WLS-I is better for all but two

(Mt and UR).

Overall, WLS-I appears to outperform OLS,8 although the superiority
of 1LS-I here does not appear as pronounced as it was for the within-

conclusion is consistent with the results of Meyer and
Glauber [101, who found the LA.R estimator to be an improvement over
ordinary least squares in terms of outside-sample, single-equation
prediction accuracy.

sample comparisons. This same conclusion also emerged from examining
the predictions for the 1969 I - 1973 I period in more detail (e.g., by

the number of periods ahead predicted) and from examining predictions
for the 1970 III - 1973 I period based on estimates through 1970 II.
All of the outside-sample comparisons are, of course, based on only a
small number of different periods predicted and so must be
interpreted with some caution.

VIII. Conclusion
The main conclusion of this paper is that robust estimators

appear quite promising for the estimation of econometric models. Of
the robust estimators considered in this paper, the one based on minimizing
the sum of the absolute values of the residuals performed the best.

The FI estimator and the combination of the ETML and least-absoluteresidual estimators also appear promising, at least for simultaneous
equations models.

The same caveats discussed in [61 regarding the methodology of
that study are also relevant here. The comparisons in this paper are
based only on the criterion of prediction accuracy, and the model used
for the comparisons has some special features that are not characteristic

of other models. 4hether the conclusions reached in L611 and in this

paper hold for other models is an open question and the conclusions are
merely put forth as indicating what might be the case for such models.
