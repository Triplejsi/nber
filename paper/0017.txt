I. Introduction
All

individuals

or families do not receive the same income or earn-

ings. This inequality, the most indisputable fact about the distribution
of income, has been found in capitalist and socialist economies, in democratic and dictatorial countries, and in Biblical through modern times.
There are other characteristics of the income distribution that are

nearly as well documented for modern countries. For example, the
distribution is not symmetrical but has a longer right—hand tail

,

and

both average income and its variance generally increase with education and age.1
Why inequality occurs and why the distribution has its particular

characteristics is a matter of concern to many people. Certainly society
and government have expressed a desire to establish a minimum floor for
members of society — though the level of the floor and the means of achieving

it are matters of debate. Besides a direct interest in the questions of
the sources of inequality, how to achieve income redistribution thd the
efficacy of various policy tools, economists are also concerned with establishing

how various labor markets operated how rational individuals are, and how
important are individual effort, chance, and predestination.2

Spurred on by these questions economists have constructed various
theories that purport to explain the ncorne distribution. Some aspects

of these theories have been tested against empirical observations.3 This
study will extend the range of such tests. In addition, we will generate
some new facts that a complete theory

should

be able to explain.

The Personal Distribution of Earnings

Personal income is equal to the sum of labor earnings, returns to

capital, and transfer payments. Transfer payments are determined by
political and societal forces and will not concern us in this study. While
the distribution of income from capital is partly determined by economic
forces, it will not be the primary focus of this study —

partly

because of

the paucity of data in our sample. Earnings from work, to which the
Introductory statments on inequality also apply and which will be the
primary focus of our study, currently constitute about two—thirds to
three fourths of national income.

Most theoretical and related empirical work on the distribution of earnings

fall into the "human capital" or"stochastic" theory categories or a blend
thereof. The human capital model assumes that people are paid a wage equal
to their (

real)

marginal product which varies over individuals because

of differences in inherited or acquired skill levels. The stochastic- theories

assume that an individual's earnings over time depend on the cumulative

history

of

random events.

II. Supply and Demand for Labor
A traditional method of analyzing labor markets is via supply and demand

curves. Suppose for the moment that all people are homogeneous with respect
to skills that determine earnings. Assume that with a given quantity of
capital and other factors of production, the marginal product of labor decreases

as the number of employees increases. In a competitive labor market (

with

no

on the job training) employers will hire that number of workers at which the

marginal product is equal to the real wage rate, W/P(for convenience we

il1 set P at 1 and henceforth speak of wages only). This demand curve is

—3—
given at DD in Figure 1.

In Figure 1, the supply curve for the population is SS which is
assumed to slope upwards because it takes higher wage rates to induce

people to forego leisure. The equilibrium wage rate of W will clear the
market and everyone who works the same hours will earn the same amount. This
conclusion, which is, of course, contrary to fact depends crucially on

the assumption that each person has the same skills but this study is
to
a large extent based on the proposition that
and acquired —

many different skills —

inherited

help determine earnings. It is fairly easy, however, to

incorporate many types and levels of skills into the above analysis if what

the quantity of acquired skills consistent with the amount economiStS

will examine briefly a model in which relative capacity, C/C1,is

but varies.

The world of work is subdivided into many different occupations which
are associated with different tasks and levels of responsibilitY. For example
the Dictionary of Occupational Titles differentiates thousands of occupations.
Some occupations and tasks require physical strength, some mental ability,
etc., and some require combinations of particular skills. A person's
relative capacity may

remain

constant within an occupation but vary over

occupations.4 Thus a person's observed or effective relative capacity

would depend on

coefficients may not be stable over tiie. For example suppoe there Is
a big increase in the supply of any X. In the efficiency units model,
this will lead to shifts in the supply curve (in efficiency units) and a
decrease in the standard wage rate which in turn would decrease all

coefficients proportionately. In mor complex models, the effect on the

not seem necessary to summarize it. It is worth noting, however, that
the relative importance of nature and nurture can vary over time as the
distribution of genetic endowments and of environment changes. In particular new environments such as better schooling, day care centers, and
prenatal diet could have large effects even if nurture was not important

Human Capital Theory
The economic definition of capital is any thing that will yield

the economic literature on hunan

has relegated this "conceived

stock" to a secondary role and concentrated on schooling, health expenditures and other means by which a person can acquire or maintain skills.

In part this emphasis occurs because if a person must invest to acquire

a rising age—earnings profile, which vary by education level, if people
invest rationally in "general" on-the-job training (QJT).

By defini-

tion, general training is that which is as useful to other eitployers as

the one giving the training. But since training is embedded in the
worker, after being trained he can offer his services to any employer

(in the absence of enforceable long-term employment contracts). There—
fore in a competitive labor market the enployee would receive wages
equal to his new, higher marginal product, or in other words all the
benefits of the training.
The xodel, at this point, is indistinguishable from a learning by

doing model. Nincer, however, takes the analysis one very important
step further. Specifically Mincer argues that a person will choose that
occupation which offers him the largest amount of lifetime earnings, dis-

counted to the present. Suppose therefore that occupation A involved
training and occupation B did not. Also assume that initial wages were
the same in both occupations, hence, occupation B would offer the larger
22

discounted stream.

In this case workers would leave B for A and new

entrants would choose A. As the supply of workers for A increased and B

21

His model can also explain a changing age profile of the variance of
earnings.

—15--

decreased, the starting wages in A would drop and those in B rise. This
adjustment would occur till the discounted value of the lifetime earnings

stream would the same. Note that as a result of the adjustment process,
wages in A initially will be below those in B and later above. The
(unobserved) drop in wages in the first year of work is the investment
in on—the--job training In that year.23'24

Denote Y as the individual's earnings with no learning by doing and

as the percentage of earnings invested in any year. Mincer generally
assumes that X declines with years of work. One form he often uses is:

(4)

where A is a scalar that varies iver persons, b is the decay rate that is
the same for all persons, and t is the time since beginning work.

23
The rational investment in human capital concept can be applied to
any portion of the environment which produces or maintains skills. For
example one interpretation of the observed effect of family SES on earnings (education, wntal ability, etc. constant) is that more and better
training that augments earning related skills occurs in families with a
high2r SES. But the rational investor model would suggest that parents
allocate their time so that at

where Wi is marginal utility, X is the (discounted value) of the child's
extra earnings from a unit of parent's time, while Y is any other use of
time, and I' and P are the respective prices.
calculating the investment costs in other years, an adjustment
would have to be made for returns on prior investments.

—. 6—

Depending on the investment function, Mincer derives a human capital

•

earning function such as:

1nYlnY+eS+ft

(5)

where S is years of schooling, e is the rate of return on S, f is the rate
of return on OJT and Y is determined by genetic endowments and the other
elements of the environment that affect skills and earnings.
Another way to view Mincer's model is that earnings only change over
time because of continued investment in the on—the—job training.25 His
earnings model, therefore, can be rewritten as:

Y

(6)

t

(l+r E At n
n'l

A)

where A is defined above andY is the constant stream, determined by
genetic endowments and all aspects of environmet except OJT. As long as
A decreases over time, earnings will increase with age. Mincer, moreover,

demonstrates that in his model the variance of Y and of log Y need not
be constant over time but may increase or decrease inonotonically or even
-26

follow non-inonotonic paths.

25

This is not quite true in the sense that Mincer allows for transitory
events in any year and for maturation and senescence. But these can be
ignored at this point.
See [

—17--

Mincer's

theory is in the tradition of much of economic analysis

of competitive markets and has the attractive feature of being consistent
with such observed regularities as rising

arr

age

age earnings profile and with nearly

profile of the variance of earnings. Moreover as Mincer has noted

it is possible to obtain estimates of e and f, the two rates of return,

within a decade of individuals entering the labor market.

M1e the model has all these advantages, it has several particular
disadvantages. First of all, the model assumes that because of individual
actions tie market always generates the type of equilibiu he makes use of.
But consider for a moment the informational requirements

necessary for

this market to function. On the schooling side the individual must estimate
the expected increase in his earnings for each year of his working life. 27
This is a formidable task--especially if education interacts with characteristics

such as drive or particular types of innate ability in producing earnings
capacity.

For the OJT investment model, the worker has to be able to calculate
the increase In skills or the general learning by doing contained in any

occupation. In addition in both instances the worker will have to estimate
if the current information that he can obtain, say from Census data, is
applicable to the future or if an equilibiurn situation is about to become

disequilibrium or vice versa. These are severe

2If the person is not risk neutral, he will also have to examine the
variance (or other measures of dispersion) of the extra earnings. If Mincer's
model is correct only the constant earnings difference, ,need be estimated

act as predicted.

Even if the information requirements are met, equation (5) may not
hold nor be interpreted as above because of nonpecuniary returns to edu..

cation. That is, evidence at least as reliable as that on earnings
indicates that education has nonpecuniary rewards. Similarly, the OJT

model should allow for such nonmonetary returns as pride and status as,
e.g., in the professorial labor market. Yet the rational investor model
requires these nonpecuniary returns be included in the r that is to be

equalized to n. Thus the coefficients on S or t in an earnings equation
need not equal the rate of return on investment.

Finally the models assume that a unit of schooling or OJT always
emits the same capacity as a person

ages and that variations in earnings,

with wage rates fixed, must reflect changes in capacity from maturation,
illness, or OJT, etc. As explained below such an assumption seems invalid
for some labor market situations.

It is difficult to construct a definitive test of the schooling
model because nonpecuniary returns and the individual's cost of financial

capital cre seldom known. It is possible, however, to test Mincer's OJT
theory

since

as expressed in (6) his model predicts that those below average

In earnings early will be above average later and will have a faster growth
rate in earnings.

Below we will expound on this in greater detail

and perform the indicated tests.

Sorting and Signalin1 fodels
There are some occupations such as fruit picker and commissioned
salesman) in which it is possible to determine

quickly and cheaply the

Inareinal product of an individual worker and in which the success or

failure of one worker does not determine the marginal product of other

workers in the firm. In these occupations, a firm should be willing
to set a piece rate and hire anyone who applies for a job. There are
other jobs such as a position on an assembly line in which it may be
possible to determine the number of bolts tightened and not tightened

by a worker but where the failure of any one worker on the line will
reduce or destroy the output of other workers.

In this interdependent

situation, the firm would be able to mcasurea person's

marginal pro-

duct, but as long as it can not collect for the destroyed units the firm
Eiay find it profitable to try to minimize the number of people with less

than the necessary skill level needed for the job. Finally there are
some jobs such as manager in which it is difficult to measure both the
actual and potential productivity of any worker and in which there are

interdependencies. Here again the firm may want to sort people into
groups which have more or less of the skills associated with success on
the job.

Within most firms there are a number of "career leaders" within the
semi—skilled, skilled, and

categories with some

possibility of going from one ladder to another. When the firm does not
know a person's productivity and when a complex and difficult to measure

related to position in the firm, which is dependent on signalling.

The

models, which can be based on profit

maximizing behavior, would still imply that earnings depend on inherited
and acquired skills but the coefficients would have different interprettioflS

than in the Becker-Mincer model. The models also have different Implications
for the relationship between annual and life-time earnings since those who
are more skilled will always have above average earnings.
Taste for Risk and Nonpecuniary Rewards
The models we have been examining explain earnings by differences in
skills. It is possible, hoever, to explain some features of the distribution
by differences in tastes towards work or nonpectiniary returns from work.

sense the sorting model is implicit in some Markov schemes, but Wise has
explicitly made use of such a sorting model to explain how earnings may vary

we observe some of these who oucceed and

eventually
over time the average earnings of

the Winners grows ore than those who were risk averse. There is no
corresponding group of people with large losses
because, as Lebergett (')
points out, the inept (risk lover) generally can't raise enough financial
capital as the succesful ore. Lebergett, in
fact, presents some evidence
that for the nonselfemployed the
earnings distribution is nearly symmetric-though of course this needì not follow from the above model since there are
some risky salaried occupations such as stock broker.
Friedman's model is closely aligned with that of von Neumann Morgenste]
in which a person bases his decisions on the expected value of the utility of a
set of outcomes, defined asP u(Aj) where
is the probability of the
event occurring and U(Aj) is its utility. Consider two alternatives A and B

where A has only one possible outcome A1 and B a whole set but an average
outcome . Suppose A1 equals . Then
it can be shown that if person has
diminishing marCinal utility he will attach more utility to and choose A. In
other words he is averse to risk.
Alternatively if his marginal utility
exhibited increasing returns, he would be a risk lover and choose B in the
above example.

While

in principle it is possible to Conduct controlled experi-ents
in which people choose between various alternatives to try to determine a

person's

utility function and degree of risk aversion, we do not have that
option. Instead we v-ill use a question dealing with preferences for employment
versus self-employment and desire for job security. Certain problems inherent
in the use of these questions will be discussed
later, but one is important
enough to merit attention now. Most peoDle imPlicitly assume that an individual

who is risk averse in one activity such as managing his financial portfolio
will be risk averse in all activities (Friedman need not assume this since he
has the same individual as risk

averse and risk loving depending on the span
of the outcome). This is a very restrictive assumption that one suspects is
not true. The word"susoects" is used because most examples that come to mind
of apparent contradictions, e.g., college professors with conservative financial
portfolios engaged in risky research on the frontiers of knowledge, incorporate
opportunities as well as taste. In other words the exoected navoff from

III. The NBER Sample
In this study our empirical work will be based primarily on the 5,100

men in the NBER—Th sample. In this chapter and associated appendices,
we will discuss the main features of the sample and give an overview of
the distribution of earnings in several years.34
The sample was drawn from a group of some 75,000 men who during 1943
volunteered to enter the army air force's pilot, bombadier and navigator

training progam. The people in this group obviously had to meet the health
and physical requirements to be in the Army. Also according to Thorndike
and }lagen (TM) to enter this program, "a man first had to be single, be

—24—

This examination was primarily a scholastic

aptitude test, though perhaps

with a slightly technical and mechanical slant. The qualifying score
on
the screening test was set at a level that could be reached by approximately
half the high school graduates, the country over'.'35 The men who qualified
and volunteered for the

program were then given a battery of some seventeen

tests which measure various types of mental and physical skills. These
test scores as well as certain biographical

information on hobbies and

family background determined which of the men were accepted for the Air
Cadet program.

Thorndike and Hagen deáided in 1955 to undertake a study of the usefulness of the seventeen tests in predic ting vocational success with the

hope of being able to aid the vocational

counseling and choice of high

school students. They drew a sample of 17,000 men who had taken a given
battery of tests between July and December 1943.

nd throughout

Beginning in late 1955

1956, TH received responses from some 10,000 civilians

and 2,000 men still in the military. The

questionnajr they used, which

is reproduced in Appendix B, contains among other things an earnings occupation
history from World War II to the date of the questionnaire. It is impor—
tant to note that because of their vocational

emphasis, much care and

attention was paid to assigning occupation codes.36
In 1968 Taubman and Wales(TW) contacted

Professor Thorndjke and

learned that he had retained a printout of the test scores, earnings and
a few other items for 9,700 people who were civilians in 1955 and the

—25—

completed questionnaires for about 8,600 of these men. With the concurrence

of the air force, Professor Thorndike kindly agreed to make available
all this Information as well as the address list as of 1956.

It was recognized almost immediately thatit was possible to update
addresses via army serial numbers and the V.A.'s life insurance and claims

file.37'38 Thus John Meyer an Thomas Juster of the NBER quickly agreed
to conduct another interview using Bureau funds. This questionnaire, which
is reproduced in

Appendix B, was eventually answered in 1969 and early

1970 by some 5,100 out of about 7,500 people for whom good addresses were

available.39 TW initially used the detailed information on education,
ability, family background, and personal characteristics from the two
surveys (

for

about 80 percent of. the men) to examine the rate of return

to education and the use of education as a screening (

signalling)

device.

The respondents had been promised summaries of the results of

the questionnaire. When mailing these summaries in 1971, the NBER included
a short questionnaire to try to resolve some of the puzzles raised by TW

and others. Some 3,000 people responded to this one mailing. When funding
was received from the NSF for this project, another large questionnaire
dealing with more aspects of family background and other matters was sent

Out and was returned by 4,474 people.4° These last two questionnaires are
also given in Appendix B.
37

The V.A. graciously provided new addresses at no charge.

38Additional updated were obtained by checking phone books of the city
of the last known address.

39Initially we had felt that 2,500 responses would have qualified this
survey as a success.
40
The N.S.F. funds also enabled the NBER to extract more information from
the TI! questionnaire including the details on the job and earnings history.

—26—

In a moment the sample will be compared with the U.S. population of

the same cohort. But first we wish to note that TH found little in the
way of response bias in 1955 — perhaps because they employed expensive

means such as the Retail Credit Corporation —

to

locate men. Taubman

and Wales have shown that in 1969 the mentally more able and educated

were more likely to respond. However, TW also showed that there was
no significant difference in the 1955 earnings equations between those
who did and did not respond in 1969; thus, the data can be used for
structural analysis.

Sample Characteristics
The qualifications needed to be a potential member of this sample
quarantee that the NBER—TH sample, will not be representative of the U.S.

male population of the same age. About one quarter of the men fall
into each of the categories of high school graduate, some college,

bachelors degree, and at least some graduate work.42 Also a person
had to be in the top one half of the I.Q. distribution to enter this
program and the average ability level has been heightened by the af ore—

mentioned response bias.
The average age in 1943 was 21 with three quarters of the men aged

19—22. At least in 1943, the programs' qualifications assure us there
men were, on average, in better mental and physical health than the U.S.

41For the post 1969 questionnaires we have adopted the practice of in—
cluding a "no response" dummy variable. Since this tends to be significant
over time the more successful are continusing to respond more.
42
This is a much better level of education than among World War II
veterans — even if we restrict ourselves to high school graduates. See
Miller [3L/

male population aged 18 to 26. Given that these men volunteered to train
for flight duty, it seems likely that they areless risk wverse than the
population as a whole, which may be a partial explanation of the high
percentage of people who are self employed in l969. We do not know
how many nonwhites if any are in the sample though the education and
test aptitude qualifications suggests to us that whites probably make
up 99 percent of the group.44
In her dissertation B. Wolfe has compared this sample and the
corresponding U.S. age cohort of white males on a number of characteristics.

She finds a higher percentage of ews and smaller percentage of Catholics
in this sample. The aen in this sample have fathers with above average
education ( and occupational status) and father—in—laws with even higher

educational attainment. Also the people in this sample have above eaverage
earnings in each year studied , even if the comparison is made with white
males of the same education and age with the differentials greater at
a later age and at lower levels of education C where the sample is less

representative of the population. See below, or T.W., chapter 4).
It is of some interest to compare the earnings inequality in this
sample with that of the random sample of white males aged 45—59 (in 1966)

43The high percentage may also be due to the availability of V.A.
guaranteed loans, better financial position of parents and in—laws, or
business competence.
44However, several of the highest ranking black Air Force generals in
1972 were in the Air Cadet program in World War II.

IV. A Summary of the Determinants of Earnings at Various Points of Time
This section is designed to summarize the results of earnings equations
for 1955 and 1969, presented in the appendix, by comparing the relative
importance of various variables both at a point of time and over time.
It is important to realize that we are discussing partial regression

coefficients in which all other variables in the equations in the
appendix

have been held castant.

In examining these results he reader is reminded that our underlying
theoretical model is that pecuniary and nonpecuniary rewards depend on

productivity as well as tastes towards risk

rewards are partly inherited and partly

and nonpecuniary

acquired from schools, friends,

family, etc. We would like to determine both the skills or processes that

determine earnings and their relative importance. We also wish to
quantity the trade of fs between monetary and nonmonetary earnings.

Several measures of importance can be used. In this section we
will be primarily concerned with those related to the range and the

variance in earnings. Later we will consider issues connected with
skewness and kurtosis. An obvious measure of importance is the R2

—30—
or the amount of the varianceexplained

by the set of variables.46 Of

course the R2 in our sample may not generalize to the U.S. population
because our sample is truncated in

educati arid ability and is drawn more

heavily from some strata than others. S1.nc we do not know all respects
in which this sample differs from the U.S. Population nor how to
extrapolate
the results to the truncated
portion of the population, we will not try

to calculate a weighted R2. Many of these problems are less severe
when we compare total or partial R2's for the same people but in different
years.

The variance explained by a set of independent variables combines
two elements —

the

predicted value of the dependent

compared to the mean of Y, and the number of

variables, Y1, as

times each Y1 occurs. An

alternative measure of importance is the .difference In the average leyel
of earnings, Y1—?2, caused by a set of variables. This range measure is

related to the Y—Y portion of the variance but does not indicate how
many
people are at each y1

and 1969 resulti

otherwise noted, these results are

is well known that it is difficult to measure the contribution of
one variable versus another to the total R2 when the independent variables
are not orthogonal.
47However, the range and variance only indicates the direct effect
of a variable. There can also be indirect

The variables which have been held constant include: education, mathematical
ability, various measures of socioeconomic background of the respondent
and of his wife, information on self employment and on teaching, a crude
measure of risk preference, age, and work experience, health, hours worked
marital status, and attitudes towards noripecuniary rewards. We never

explain more than 45% of the variance in earnings. Some of the unexplained
variance must be due to unmeasured but systematic variables. The coefficients
of any included variables will be biased if it is correlated with any
omitted variable which determines earnings.

48

Because of computer capacity limitations, we were forced to drop

some variables which were consistently nonsignificant in preliminary
runs. In the equations presented,, therefore, all the variables are

either significant in one or more years or were significant in either
the next to the last runs or in the Taubman—Wales (TW) equations from

which this analysis commenced. When we cite coefficients for variables
not in the last equation, the numbers are taken from the most complete
versions of the final equations in which the variable appeared.

and affective skills.49 It would greatly increase our understandinL of

how and schooling does if we would identify the particular skills that
affect earnings and measure the change in all skills produced by schooling.

But since we do not have such measures nor even knowall skills which
should be measured, we will have to be satisfied with crude measures
of quantity and quality of schooling.

We represent quantity by level of education obtained. We use dummy
variables for various responses. Earnings in 1969 generally increase with
education. But despite our having included variables to hold constant
nonpecuniary rewards including those associated with pre college teaching,
risk preference, and self employment, those with just a bachelors degree

earn more than those with some graduate work. As shown in table 1 the
increase in earnings from education for the average high school graduate

ranges from 8 percent for some college to 82 percent for non self employed
M.D.'s with bachelors degree holders receiving 20 percent more.50'51 (We
have standardized by the average non self employed high school graduate's
earnings of $10,300).

Essentially the same percentage increases are obtained from equations

using the log of earnings. If we adopt Mincer's model [(

511f self employment variables were not included the increases would
be: 14 percent for some college; 28 percent for bachelors; 80 percent for
L.L.B., and 110 percent for M.D.'s. These increases are less than those
given in TW primarily because of the introduction of self employment variables
though the graduate level coefficients were much smaller before we introduced
some variables related to nonpecuniary returns.

is less than 6 percent at all education levels.

for

example, obtaining a bachelors

degree or some college would add 11 and 5 percent more to the $6,000

and not always statistically significant.

However, our self employment

variables are onlymeasured in 1969. The resulting measurement error has
probably caused us to overstate the relative

returns to education of the

not self employed in 1955.52
The total effect of education may be understated if one of the mechanisms
by which education alters earnings is measured after the completion of
education and is also included in our equations. One such route would
be the Occupation the person was in.

The variables on occupation we have

used in these equations are teacher, self

employed businessman, and professional,

and business assets. The teacher variable is included because we felt
that teachers reteive more nonpecuniary rewards as a substitute for
earnings
than is received in other occupations.53 The various self employment
measures are designed to eliminate all of the return on financial capital
included in the earnings estimate; rewards

for bearing the extra risk of

the self employment information is omitted the 1955 differentials
are: some college 11 percent; bachelors
degree 14 percent; L.L.B. 14 percent
and M.D. 82 percent, which
are very close to those given in T.W. If we
adopt Mincer's interpretation of the log equation, our estimates of the
rate of return to education are less than
5 percent ( except M.D.).

entrepreneurship; and

perhaps

unmeasured attributes that lead to being

a successful businessman. However, it is possible that these measures
have incorporated some of the influences of education. If these variables
were not included, the bachelors, some college and masters degree
coefficients would all be smaller.

It is also possible that a person's tastes for nonpecuniary rewards

or risk bearing are partially formed by education. The inclusion of
the so called nonpecuniary variables caused the some college and bachelors
level coefficients to decrease and the graduate level coefficients to
increase in both years.

College Quality

As a crude measure of college quality, we have included for each
person's undergraduate school the Gourmari Index ( of Academic Quality)

which is described in more detail in chapter 4 in [/iJ. Because the
index is scaled arbitrarily, we initially included it and its square

in the equations. Since these two terms together are never significant
and do not explain more of the variance of earnings than the linear term,
we use only the linear term.
In 1969 we find that attendance at a school that ranked 100 points
( the standard deviation) higher in the index is associated with a $450

increase in earnings. After our usual standardizing, the effect of the
100 point difference in college quality of 4½% is about half the size
of the effect of obtaining some college. In 1955 a 100 point increase
in undergraduate school quality leads tc

$140 increase in earnings or

2j after standardization. Once again this is about half the size of

the coefficient on the some college variable.
It is interesting to note that the introduction of the quality
variable causes a 5% to 10% reduction in the coefficients of the Jewish,
year of first job, attendance at private high school arid attendance
at private elementary school variables as well as a 10% increase in the

pre college teacher dummy in 1969 and smaller changes in 1955. These
shifts are indicative of the fact that college quality can be both determined
by ( or correlated with) and act as a proxy for other personal attributes

that determine earnings. The quality index may still be acting as a
prxoy for unmeasured attributes but we would hnpe that it in part
measures the extra value added imparted by better schools.
The quality index used is ob,viously not the only one possible but

we have not studied this problem in detail since it is the focus of the

work of Wales [ 5, and especially of Solmon

I 3].

Mental Ability
In TW it was found that the seventeen tests taken by the people
in 1943 contained at least four factors, but only the first factor which

was denoted mathematical ability but which probably correlates well with
a standard I.Q. measure, was a significant determinant of earnings.54
In both 1969 and 1955 we tested for an interaction between mental
ability and all other variables by computing separate equations within

each ability fifth. Using analysis of covariance, we could not reject
the hypothesis that the effects of all variables, including education,
were independent of the level of ability in each year.

54No attempt was made here to reinvestigate the usefulness of the other
factors. Since we convert the test score data into dummy variables for the
different fifths of the factor score distribution, we are assuming that post
test taking events C not otherwise measured) do not change the fifths of
the ability distribution a person would belong to in each of the paricular
years studied.

—36—

In both 1955 and 1969 as shown in table 2 the coefficients on each

of the top four fifths are significant. These coefficients are not
sensitive to the inclusion of the self employment related variables.55

The effectsof each fifth increase in ability adds a greater percentage
to earnings in 1969 than in 1955, with the differences more pronounced
in the top two ability fifths.

The numbers in Table 2, which are divided by the average earnings

of the not self employed highhool graduate, can be compared directly
with those in table 1.

Thus the average difference in earnings between

those in the top and bottom fifths of ability ( 14 and 19% in the two

years) exceeds the effect of obtaining a bachelors degree in 1955 and
is nearly as large in 1969.

A person's test scores generally depend on his innate ability, the

quality and quantity of pre test schooling, and differences in other

aspects of "environment." Often we would like to know what portion of
test scores ( and associated earnings) are due to genetics and to

environment. Suppose that the measures of religion, parent's and own
educational attainment, occupation, and income etc., included in our
earnings are the only environmental differences that determine test scores,
then ability coefficients in the earnings equation would be net of the

environmental influences.56 Of course, if other aspects of environment

affect test scores, the ability coefficient will still be a mixture. We
examined the genetic! environmental problem in [/L7] and conclude that
in the tests we are using most of the variation in scores is due to genetic

differences( or other nonmeasured dimensions of environemnt). This
finding in no way tells us innate ability is more important than learned
knowledge since we have not examined the effects of various types of
learned knowledge on earnings.

Since the sample only includes the top half of the I.Q. distribution,
it seems safe to conclude that ability is a more important direct
determinant of the range of earnings than education for those who are

at least high school graduates. Even when self employment information
is not used, the same conclusions. are reached though the differences are
smaller.

Family Background

An individual's "socioeconomic background" can determine earnings
for a variety of reasons including being a prnxy for : genetic endowments;

differences in "training" which increase cognitive, affective, physical
and nonpecuniary rewards; and business contacts, "pull" and nepotism.

The measures of family background we have analyzed include: father's
education and occupation; mother's education and labor force participation;

wife's education and her parent's education and occupation; various data
related to family income, wealth, and size while the respondent was growing

The variables in this equation which have been held constant include:
education, mathematical ability, various measures of socioeconomic background of the respondent and of his wife; information on self employment
and on teaching; a crude measure of risk preference, age and work experience,
health, hpurs worked, marital status, and attitudes towards nonpecuniary
rewards.

up; how the respondent spent his time while growing up, age at entering
school and religious preference.57
In TW the two measures of SES used were father's education and the

so called biography variable. This biography variable Is based on the
respondent's family income and education, his hobbies, sports and interests,

and his pre test education and gradee as reported in 1943.58 The weights
of this index are based on how well the items predicted success in
pilot and navigator school.

It was, of course, a bit frustrating that a variable made up of so

many disparate items with unknown contributions determined earnings. Thus
we are happy to report that Inclusion of information collected in 1969
and 1972 similar to that collectad in 1943 has substantially reduced tle
size of the biography coefficients, but the top 2 fifths are still sig-

nificant and the coefficients are monotonic. It is interesting to note
that the big shift in the 1969 and 1955 coefficients occurred only after

we included information on tastes towards nonpecuniary rewards and a
proxy for family wealth, implying that these are the components in the
biography variable that influenced earnings.

The differences between

the top2 and the bottom fifth are 11% and 8% in 1955 and 1969. This is

57mis is a wider list than that used in most previous studies, and
some of the variables require justification as SES measures but almost
all of these variables are significant in 1969 and 1955. Several of the
variables have been used at one time or another by others; see,'for example,
Blau and Duncan [
), and Sewell et al [

J.. ].

—39--

one of the few variables that has a smaller percentage affect in 1969.

Additionally, the effects of father's education are reduced to

insignificance in both 1969 and 1955. Part of the reduction of the
importance of this variable occurs when the father is an owner variable

is introduced. But the reduction in the size and significance of the
coefficient is primarily associated with the introduction of the respondent's

business asset variables. Since this variable is not often used in other
studies, there is a suggestion that fatherTs education is a proxy for
family

wealth and business ownership.

There are other SES variables which are significant. Perhaps
the

most interesting of the new measures are the Jewish and Protestant

variables.59 Compared to Catholics, (as well as aetheists, agnostics and
others who all earn about the same amount In the various years), Jews
received from 33 to 40 percent more earnings than the average high school
graduate and Protestants from 3 to 9 percent less.6° The reader is reminded
50

In 1969 the respondents were asked to indicate their religious
preference by checking one of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, None, Other.
It is possible that different answers would have been obtained if "the
religion you were raised in" was asked. Compared to the U.S. white population
the NBER—TH had 1.7 percent more of both Jews and others and 5 percent fewer
Catholics. However, the differences from white males in the particular
cohorts who were at least high school graduates would probably be smaller.
601f self employment and M.D. are not held constant, Jews earn even
more. The asset variable is measured imperfectly, but it is difficult
to attr[bute a difference of $4,000 a year to this. There are relatively
few aetheists and agnostics and others.

—40—

that these differences are not of the influence of education(

including

M.D.) mental ability, self employment, and various other personal attributes
and family SES dimensions.61
At least for the generation being discussed, it seems likely that
those who are Jewish had more of a taste for acquiring knowledge and

as shown in chpter

achieve more education and go to better schools,

given ability and other SES measures.

62

Hence for given levels of

schooling and mental ability in 1943, Jews may have acquired more
knowledge useful in earning a living.

We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that some unmeasured

genetically determined characteristics are related to religion. Unfortunately, since we do not know whTat nonmeasured attributes are important

determinants of earnings, we cannot usefully examine the genetics literature
to see what if any differences exist by religion.

a study of college graduates of the first half of this century,
Hunt [ZO] also found similar qualitative results. Also using the same
basic data source as Hunt, Haverman and Wes.t [17] found that being Jewish
was the most important determinant of earnings of people who graduate college
in the first half of this century. Featherman I i5 j also found Jews to
earn more and some Catholics, such as French, to earn more than the average
Protestants. Both the Hunt and Featherman studies hold constant education
and mental ability as well as other variables.
62

For example, Bruce Eckland, Academic Ability, Higher Education and
Occupational Mobility" American Sociological Review , 1965, pp. 735—746
,,

finds that for given test scores and social class, Jews go to higher
quality institutions for learning. This would Indicate either hIghr tastes
for education, more motivation and drive, or lower costs relative to returns.
He also finds certain ethnic groups of Catholics to do better than the
average Protestants. Given the education cutoff to be in the program,
it seems likely that our Catholics come heavily from these successful
ethnic groups.

—41—

We also cann,t rule out the possibility that the Jews and other
nonProtesl:ants are a more select group of their respective populations.

However, given th nature of the Air Force work they volunteered for,
it might be argued that

those

who volunteered could include more people

who wanted to gain revenge on Germany or to inflict destruction in large

doses quickly. But the revenge motive would seem to suggest that Jews
and to a lesser extent Catholics would be a more random (less select)
group of their religious compatriots.

That religious upbringing or the different environment in families
or various religions can mold the individual receives some further support

in the sample. That is, we find that those wbo remembered attending
religious classes (

not

parochial- school) several times a week earn 9

to 11% less than those who attended once or twice while those who did
not attend earn 1 to 4% less.

Another set of variables which reflect both the type of family and
affective, physical and cognitive, and psychological attitudes that can

be formed by the family and peer group is contained in the question (aked
in 1972) of "

indicate

how you spent your time while growing up".63 The

categories examined were sports, hobbies, chores, part time job, reading
and

other.

The last two groups were never significant and will not be

discussed here except to note that reading is related to the ability measure

and educational attainment. The remaining categories were significant in

is for practically no time spent and 5 is for the most time spent.

—42—
1969 but only part time job was significant in 1955. The difference in
earnings of those who spent prctLcally no time and the most time on
part time jobs is 5% and 11% Lu 1955 and 1969. It seems likely that
the men who came from poor fainLLles needed money for themselves and!

or valued financial success greatly. Thus these men would be willing
to work hard and apparently have succeeded with success being cumulative
over tune.64

In 1955 and 1969 those who spent much time on sports while growing
up, earn 4 and 10% more than those who spent practically no time.65

Several explanations of this result are available. First, activity in
sports may show up in later life as better physical fitness and as
shown below healthiness is related to earnings.

(

in

this explanation

1955 has a smaller impact because of less health deterioration at that

age). Second, most sports involve both a competitive and cooperative
structure which are also found in many work situations. That is, a
boy's play is training for the man's work. Third, activity in sports
may be indicative of energy and aggresiveness that pays off in the
business world.66 Finally, there is some indication in Thorndike and Ilagen

641f we are right about the type of families these men came from,
I would expect them to have a high rate of time preference , and less
access to capital early in their lives; thus, I would find it hard to
interpret the growth in earnings over time to an investment theory as in
Mincer.

is doubtful that this result is due to people becoming professional
atheletes since it was primarily baseball players who were highly paid
then ( and Ted Williams was in the Marines) and the sports which recruit
from college graduates would have had to gamble on rookies aged 25 or
more.

66Related to this last viewpoint is the idea that people who play
sports may be more able to make decisions quickly. If intellectualism
Is taken as evidence of the opposite personality, it is interesting that
the Phi Beta Kappas among top management earn substantially less than
other people. See Taubman—Wales[, ] appendix on Liewelen.

—43—

that in 1955 that sports distinguishes company presidents and vice presidents
from treasurers. This suggests that sports itt the 1920's and 1930's was
an indicator of family wealth and availability of leisure time, or an
indicator of attitudes such as risk taking.
The hobby variable has practically no effect in 1955 but in 1969
those who spent the most time on hobbies received 6% less which is

significant at the 10% level in the final equation. The:znost obvious
explanation for this finding is thatmany though not all hobbies represented
the opposite of sports and that the effects should be reversed.
The last and perhaps most difficult of these to explain is the chore

result. Those who spent much time on chores earn 3 and 10% less in
1955 and 1969 with the former not.. significant. Initially I had expected

chores to be a proxy for "willingness to take on responsibility" and to

have a positive effect. Merton(3J however, argues that families who
insist on their children doing chores are lower middle class and are

very interested in conformity. He further argues that these families
will produce "tame" individuals who make the Ideal bureaucrat and who
receive less earnings than people In riskier jobs ( see below). I might
add that Merton only refers to one piece of empirical evidence which,
he acknowledges, is not very compelling.
As might be expected time spent on chores and on part time job
are positively correlated (R2 = .13) but the differences in emphasis
of paid and family work reflect different types of environment and
different types of men.

—44—

Thus far we have included SES measures which are strongly related

to family upbringing and taste formation. Parental income or wealth
can also influence a child's earnings by being used to purchase goods
that produce marketable skills, by being a proxy for nepotism, or by
being a proxy for genetically determined skills.

One possible proxy for family income is father's education, which
we have already indicated is not significant once business assets are

included in the equation. Another possible proxy is father's occupation
but this also does not explain directly much of the differences in
earnings, with the other variables held constant. There are, however,

several caveats that must be attached to this conclusion. First father's
occupation, ( and resulting income) has an indirect effect on earnings

through the amount of schooling the respondent receives. Second and more
importantly, father being an owner is significant when the self employment

variables are not included. Third, in 1968 father's occupation and education
have a much greater impact on the range in family income than on earnings

of

the head. This suggests that income inequality is perpetuated through

generations directly through financial inheritance( including business

assets) and indirectly through educational attainment. The biography
variable also includes some parental wealth indicators though it's not
clear what aspects of the variable determine earnings.

Two extremely important determinants of earnings which appear to
be proxiesfor large amounts of parental wealth, are type of elementary

and of high school attended. Those who went to private elementary school

4

—45—

earned 13% more than those who attended public or parochial schools
or a combination of schools.

(

The difference is divided by the earnings

of the average nonself employed graduate

of high school as is done

with the variables). The coefficient on private high school is positive
but not significant, probably because 22 of the 29 people who went
to private elementary school went to private high school. Thus the
elementary school coefficients only measures the extra earnings above

private high school. Those who attended both private elementary and
high school in 1955 earn 29% more than those who always went to public

schools. In 1969 those who went to private elementary and private high
school earn 56% more than those who didn't go to private school.
Since private schooling is both different from and more costly
to the respondent's parents than public
that these results are due to quality

schooling, it might be argued

differentials. But if this

argument is accepted, it is difficult to explain why in chapter

neither type of private school is significantly related to our ability
measure, which contains some learned knowledge.
Our explanation is that those who went to private elementary schools
in the 1920's came from very wealthy families, who provide a good home
environment and/or genes or who used pull to aid their sons. The pull
argument seems to be the most likely since the variable is primarily
a proxy for large amounts of weath.67

67lndeed when we include a crude measure of net worth in our equations,
the private school variables become insignificant and much smaller.

—46—
We are still left with explaining the change in the coefficient between 1955 and 1969.
C

as in chapter

)

I would argue that a screening sorting explanation

is

relevant since even if nepotism is involved, you

want to see how good the person is before you give him an important job,
though of course a person can probably become vice president quicker if
his father owns the company.68
Another interesting finding in our equations that suggests nepotism
is that father—in--law's education, measured continuously in years, is a

significant determinant of the respondent's earng in both 1955 and 1969.69
A primary explanation of these results is that business and social contacts
provided by father—in—law are important. But there can be other explanations.
For examples daughters from good--social backgrounds may have the necessary
graces —

not

learned in school —

which help to promote their husband.

Alternatively, women ith successful fathers may be able to spot and marry
men with those characteristics that made for their father's success, or
push their husbands into achieving success.
Interestingly4 mother—in—law's education also is positively relate
to earnings in 1969 with the high school variable somewhat greater than

the college variahle though the two are combined in the final equation.
This finding makes ft less likely that women are marrying men who are
like

their fathers and suggests nepotism.

The variables in this equation which hav been held constant include:

—47—

The other dimensions of SES we have tried but found to be insignificant

include: whether the respondent was the youngest or oldest sibling,
additional crude proxies for family wealth based on type of house, the
labor force status of the respondent's niother when the respondent was
less than 5 arid less than 14 years old; being reared on a farm; size of

city or town he grew up in; the region of the country in which raised,

and age at time of entry into school. These variables may be insignificant

because they are too crude proxies for the underlying mechanism being
sought.

Thus far we have been concerned with the effects of individual aspects

of SES on earnings. Except for religion none of these has an impact
as large as ability or education'on the range of earnings in 1955 or 1969.

But it is possible for a person to fall into the top or the bottom category

of all SES measures. Using the significant coefficients only, the average
differences in earnings for such "extremists" would total about $14,000
or 140 percent or the average earnings of the not self employed high school

graduate in 1969 and $5,500 or 90 percent in 1955 and far exceed the
direct effect of ability or education on earnings.70

Maturation and Work Experience
A well—known and docuniented result is that (real) earnings increase

with age till at least age 40. While we do not have data for all ages,
the results for 1955 and 1969 certainly are in accord with this finding.

70m1s onky includes items in table 3, business assets and some other
variables may be partly determined by SES.

—48—
The general explanations for the upward sloping age earnings profiles
are (1) as people age, mental and physical maturation increases those
skills that determine earnings,(2)work experience and learning by doing
Increase earnings related skills,(3) people are promoted on the basis
of performance on the job and/or seniority ,(4) beyond a certain age
senescence sets in or skills depreciate.71

Without distinguishing for the moment type of work experience, time

on the job can be represented as TJ

(Age —

Year of First Job — H)

where H represents such things as time not working because of illness,
unemployment and departures from the normal period of time to complete

a given level of schooling. If maturation is important than age should
have a separate effect from TJ. -.

Both age and year of first job are significiant in 1969 though
apparently senescence or depre ation has set in since age in table 4
is negative, but the separate age effectis nearly zero in 1955. The
year of first job coefficient can be treated as the negative of the

experience coefficient. Thus contrary to most findings the absolute
value of the experience coefficient is greater later in life, i.e., the
function from 1955 to 1969 is not concave, even though we have deflated

by the CPI. However, between 1955 and 1969 the effect of years exper.ence
has only risen about 50% which is less than the percentage increase in
average earnings of nonself employed high school graduates or people with
71

It is also possible that age is a proxy for particular cohorts. While
most people are within 7 years of one another, the youngest people did not
begin work till after serving in the military while many of the older
people began work before World War II.

—49—
any other education level. That experience is more important than maturity
in 1955 is not surprising given the evidence in Mincer. It is somewhat
surprising to find large senescence effects in 1969 since the discussion
in BloomLZisuggests little changes in intelligence and other skills before

age 50 and since weeks lost through illness have been held constant.72
However, the results may also be due to discrimination an account of age
for those who were fired in 1968 or 1969.
To try to refine the work experience measure, we included information
on military service after initial discharge, and type of work experience.
We find that the additional military experience data do not explain
Earnings, perhaps because military experience is a good substitute for
civilian experience or because, contrary to the above, experience on the

job is not important. In [ LI 7

]

we find that the earlier people enter

into high paying occupations, the more they earn in 1969 and that some
1955 jobs are better preparntions than others, depending on one's 1969

occupation. These results suggest that some some training is not general
and that some people were in wrong jobs in 1955 if they wanted to maximize
their lifetime earnings.

73

Earnings depend on houriy wages rates and hours worked. Unless
there is a backward bending supply curve of labor, higher wage rates

will lead to greater hours worked and more earnings.74 In 1969 each

we have not included those with zero earnings which would include
those (if any) retired or unemployed or mental or physical health reasons.
73
The ranking of occupations is about the same in all years; hence, if
you are going to be a manager in 1969, you should choose to be one earlier if
you have the option.
74Earnings = WH.
Earnings/aW=H(1+c) where a=W3H/HaW. While this
is the usual way of viewing the problem, our equations relate Earnings to H.
aEarnings/H=W(1+1/a). With backward bending supply curves,a might be negative.

—50—

additional hour per week on the first job adds $70 to annual earnings.75
If we use an average hourly wage rate per week of $350, i.e., $l4,000/2,000
hrs. times 40 hours per week, we would estimate a in the footnote as about

—1.2. Each additional hour on the second job is associated with a $120
decrease in earnings apparently because some of those people with low

wages rates want higher material standards.76 Thus both results, which
rely on perhaps erroneous estimates of hours suggests that the supply curve
has some backward bending sections.

Despite the fact that the hours data refer to 1969, we included them

in 1955. The hours on second job are still significantly negative whi]e
the hours on first job have become negative and insignificant. It appears

that moonlighters work hard over long periods of time since hcurs on
second job is negatively related to recalled estimates of initial earnings
and to wife's working in 1968.

Weeks lost through illness in 1969 has a negative impact on 1969

and 1955 but only the 1969 coefficient is significant. The $180 per week
lost would indicate a $9,000 a year job if the figures exclude paid sick
leave, but we have no way of knowing if th is is how the question was inter-

preted. Incidentally, this variable caused the self assessed healthiness
variable used by TW to become insignificant.

75However, part of this earnings increase represents the substitution
of material goods for leisure. Unfortunately, the ho urs data which were
only collected in 1969, do not mesh perfectly with the earnings data since
the earnings in 1969 are those on main job only while we have separate estimates
for hours on first and second job. However, the 1968 earnings data, which
includes second job, gives similar results so that this caveat need not be
important.
76

Secondary labor force particiipation Increases strongly with hours
worked on second job ( by the respodnent.).

—51--

Nonpecuniary Rewards

There are monetary and nonmonetary rewards from a job. Since we
expect people to base their job choice decisions on the total of pecuniary
and

nonpecuniary rewards, those occupations which pay heavily in a non—

pecuniary form should have a compensatory change in wage

payments. We

do not have availabe measures of the nonpecuniary aspects of various

occupations, but we do have some crude information related to the
preference of individuals on specific nonmonetary aspects of a job. For
example the respondents were asked," assuming that you thought that
the financial possiblities were about the same, would you prefer to

work for yourself or for somebody else or no preference?"77 In 1955 fhose
who preferred to be salaried earn 6% less than the average( nonself

employed) high school graduate. See table 5. In 1969 the people who preferred
to be salaried earn 11% less. It is important to realize that these results
are from equations which hold constant being self employed and amount
of business assets.

We are interpreting the answer to the question as indicating risk

preference. Is this a reasonable interpretation? We discuss in some
detail in [ 1/ 7 ] how this variable could correspond to an econombst's

definition of risk aversion. We conclude there that in a formal sense,
if respondents thought like economists, the question would distinguish

additional question was asked in which" about the same" was replaced with "slightly favorable if you worked for yourself". This second
question was never significant given the first, but the first question always
yielded significant coefficients In the earnings equations of variou years.

—52--

between risk averters and fisk lovers. In a less formal sense people
may simply be responding to their belief that this occupation is risky.

This question was asked in 1969. It is possible that people who failed
in their work now choose the salaried answer because of their failure.
But in [ L/

7

J in chapter

we show that this variable is not related

to a (self reported) measure of the difference between actual and expected

financial success. However, an alternative explanation of the question
might be that those who value being their own boss would earn less, eEpecially
since those who prefer independence in working do earn less(see below).

The results do not support the being your own boss explanation but this
may mean that this explanation does not dominate the risk interpretation

in this sample. While the resu1ts do not prove the risk interpretation
result, there is, however, some other evidence that bears on this issue

that tendt to corroborate it. As discussed in chapters

in [ y7].

this same variable determines schooling, the amount of business assets,
and returns to capital in a manner consistent with risk preference.

Finally it is also worth reporting the variables is significant and has
the same sign in nearly all within occupation equations. Moreover, Wolfe
in her dissertation [

],

has found that those who prefer to be salaried

have less children, given income, etc., i.e, appear to be less willing
to risk having children.78

78These examples all assume that risk preference is a trait which is
exhibited in all acitivites. This assumption may be wrong. For example
some college professors may be risk lovers in the field of ideas but risk
averters in other matters.

The variables in this equation which have been held constant include:
education, mathematical ability, various measures of socioeconomic background of the respondent and of his wife; information on self employment
and on teaching; a crude measure of risk preference, age and work experience,
health, hours worked, marital status, and attitudes towards nonpecuniary
rewards.

—53—

Another set of questions asked in 1972 was "as best as you can remember,
what factors influenced your decision to enter the occupational field

you are in at the present time? Check yes or no to each of the following
and indicate factors that were of special importance."79 Since we felt
that the first three and last item in the footnote did not represent
nonpecuniary job aspects, we did not use them, nor any of the special

importance categories. In our equations the dummy variable for each
factor used was set at one if the respondent answered "no".
In 1969 the salary, person to person contact, and free time variables

were not significant though salary nearly was. The other variables
indicate that those who were not worried about future financial success

received 17% less than those who, were worried (

or didn't answer),

those not interested in independent work earn 10% more, those who wanted
to help others earn 8% less, those who wanted to have a

challenge

earn 10% more, and those interested in job security received 13% less

earnings.8' In 1955 when many of the people were in different jobs and
even occupations, nearly all the same variables are significant and
all the signs on the variables significant in 1969 are the same though
the magnitude is always less than in 1969.

79me factors were: type of training in school, type of training in
military, personal contacts, salary offered, prospects of eventual financial
success, chance to do interesting work, chance for independent work, chance
for a lot of person to person contact, chance to help others, represented
a challenge, job security, provided a lot of free time, and always liked that
kind of work.
80The denominator as usual is the earnings of the average nonself employed
high school graduate. Ifthe current salary variable answer is included,
the coefficient is 10%.

81Tor those who want to tryto replicate these findings in other studies,
it is important to note that several of the variables, e.g., independence,
and helping others, were not significant by themselves but became significant
after the financial prospects variable was added to the equation.

-54
Intuitively, all these results sern quite p1asible, and each one
is internally consistent with one another. But there still is the
question of whether these variables are related to nonpecuniary preferences.
This issue was discussed in detail in [ (717 ] wherL we concluded that

thevarjbles were probably related to preferences. This conclusion is
reinforced by the findings in chapters

in

7) that the variables

have effects consistent with the above interpretation in other equations.
Moreover, the introduction of these variables has a big impact primarily

on the various graduate education variables, which seems quite reasonale
since we often think that Ph.D.'s etc. choose nonpocuniary rewards such
as independence in work or helping others.82
The basic threads running through these findings are that pepole

who are willing to work hard on difficult or risky projects will end

up with substantially more earnings while those who are more interted
in the intrinsic rewards of the job will receive less. While this is
hardly a startling conclusion, I know of no other study which has been
able to obtain significant impacts after holding constant such things

as education and ability. Moreover, the consistency of findings between
1955 and 1969 suggest that the 1972 vurvey responses are not expost
rationalizations and this is confirmed by the finding in chapter
that responses to these variables are not a function of exante/expost
differences in monetary success.

82For a few of these variables, the answers may represent an individuals'
recognition of his own limitations. For example, those who like to help
others may not have the aggressiveness to be a successful manager. But
then the variable represents skills that determine earnings.

—55—
The trade off s of earnings with nonpecuniary returns is quite large.

Excluding the teacher dummy which is discussed below, but including all
the other significant soefficients in table 5, we find that the difference
in earnings due to various nonpecuniary preferences could be as high as

55% or $5,500 in 1969 and 40% or $2,500 in 1955.83 Since many of the
attributes or tastes involved could be correlated it is not clear that

we actually observe the extremes in this sample, but if we do then the
eféects are greater than all education differences except M.D.
The last nonpecuniary related variable we have used is being a

pre college teacher. We find that these people earn 10 and 18% less in
1955 and 1969. The premiumpaid to be a teacher is even larger before
the nonpecuniary variables are introduced, which seems reasonable. We
can not, however, rule Out the possiblity that teachers earn less because
they are less able.

Business Assets
The respoddents were asked for their "earnings" without the concept

being defined. But we would expect the self employed to report their net
income from their business since most people would ftnd it difficult to

separate earnings derived from labor from those derived from capital. To
try

to

hold constant the returns from capital, we have included a dummy

variable for self employed businessman, another dummy for self employed
professional, and most importantly a continous variable on amount of business

assets.84 All

of

these variables were only measured in 1969. The extra

831n this calculation we add together the absolute value of all the significant coefficients.
also includes nonresidential real estate and other nonspecified
items. The variable Is crude since people were only asked to check one of
8 categories including "don't have" and over $80,000.

—56—
measurement error involved in using these variables in 1955 undoubtedly
affects the comparability of our answers and our R2 though comparisons
of 1955 and 1969 equations which only use data available in both years
indicates that general conclusions on

are not affected. We shall

interpret the coefficients on the buisiness asset variable as the rate

of teturn on financial capital invested in business.85
In 1969 the coefficient on the business asset variable, which is

an estimate of the before tax rate of return, is .12. Such a figure
is not unlike the 7 to 10 estimates usually found in studies such as Kravis

—
[

o's.

]. 86,82ihe

dummy variable for self employed businessman is

still significant though assets and hours worked are included in the
1969 equations, and equals 10% of the standardized base. The self employed
professionals, who may not have much in the way of financial investments,
receive 31% more than the nonself employed professionals, (though the
denominator is too low since for comparability, we have divided by the
average earnings of high school graduates).

85

This interpretation, however, may be wrong for several reasons. Consider
the results obtained from regressing a person's earnings which equal wage
income plus returns from capital( assuming that education, etc. is held constant
by sample design). That is, we regress W + rk =cK. The expected value of
c would be equal to EE(w+rK) (K)IZK2=r + E(wK/K2). If wage income and business
assets are not correlated ( linearly) the coefficient on K will be an unbiased
estimate of the returns from capital but if people with more capital also have
higher wage rates ( education, etc. constant) then c is biased upwards
as an estimate of r.
86so the asset variale must be measured with error since people only
checked categories into which their assets fell and because the data was
taken from an asset breakdown and real estate holdings could be included
in the business asset line.
87Christenson [ 1
] has argued that because unincorporated businesses
do not have to pay the corporate income tax, a 7 to 10% return is consistent
with the 15% before tax return made by corporations.

—57—

In 1955 the coefficient on 1969 business assets is still highly
significant ( a "t" of ll)at .03 even though the growth of assets
must not have been uniform during the period and some people must have
changed their self epiploytnent/salaried status. Probably because of the

increased measurement error involved in using the 1969 asset and hours

variables in 1955, the 1969 self employment businessman dummy is as
important in 1955 as in 1969. On the other hand the 1969 self employed
professional dummy is not dignificant presumably becasue many of these
people were salaried in 1955 and not had a chance to display their true
worth to their employers.

Since we have only health related data from 1969, we will not compare
the results for variois years though the interested reader can consult
the equations in the appendix.
Conclusion

The many and varied comparisons made in this section lead to several

important conclusions. First the effects of nearly all variables change
during a person's life cycle and in general display a profile that increases

with age. Second the profiles are steeper for the education variables
than most other variables though as shown in more detail below the steepest

profile is for those who attended private elementary school. Third, even
after holding constant a wide variety of variables, we still find that

education leads to large and statistically significant differences in

earnings. These differences, however, are relatively small in comparison
with those arising from the conglomeration of family background, attitudes
and nonpecuniary preferences and are no larger than the differences due

While we

to

unmeasured variables and random events.

V. Inequality: Extent and Causes

In

this as in most samples, the distribution of earnings is skewed to

the right.88 Since most people assume that something called "ability" or
capacity is

question of

why earnings

distributed, much attention has been paid to the

exhibit a skewed distribution.89 Becker and

?5 ] have demonstrated

that such distributions can be generated

by "acquired" human capital models. Mandelbrot[ 3 ii

solely in terms of many different inherited skills. Champernowe[ )C

,

Aitch2son and Brown[ t_ ], and others have shown that stochastic processes

can enerate skewed distributions.90 In Friedman's

from behavior towards risk rather than differences

in abilities. It is appropriate for us both to test various hypothesis
generated by each theory to determine if the theory is correct and to
estimate the contribution of each theory or(more realistically) a set of
variables to earnings inequality.

Ineualitv in Earnings

The inequality in earnings can be measured in several ways.91 One
important measure is the Lorenz curve, which indicates the percent of

I for

88See Lydall.[
or Kravis[ 7
surveys of other samples. Lebergett
suggests that among full time males who are not self employed, the earnings
distribution in 1959 approaches normality. For some purposes, however, the
self employed and unemployed should be included in the earnings distribution.
89

There is little direct evidence on the diltribution of capacity. I.Q.
scores, for example, are generally scored so as to be normally distributed.
90For an excellent summary of all these models, see Mincer [

and 1969 are presented in figure 1. -

Also

drawn in that figure is

a diagonal which is the Lorenz curve that would be observed if each

had the same

earnings.

In

all years studied earnings are not

and are below the diagonal.

All summary measures of relative inequality of two Lorenz curves will

yield the same ranking

Conversely,

provided the two curves do not intersect. 92

if the curves intersect, there always are some measures that

would disagree on whether curve 1 or 2 is more unequal. Sánce earnings
do not follow any well known distribution, we have used the nonparaxnetric

Kolmogorov—Smirnov test (KS) to determine if the difference in the

Lorenz curves is statistically significant. Results of the KS test indicate that the 1969 curve is statistically different from ( more unequal
than) the 1955 curve.

We also have examined the Lorenz curves for various education and

mental ability gpg•3 In either 1955 or 1969, the Lorenz curves
for any two mutually exclusive groups, such as high school and some

college, were never significantly different at the 5 percent level though
many were at the 10 percent level. For any particular group, the 1969
curve always was beneath the corresponding 1955 curve and the maximum

93The education and ability groups are those defined in chapter

differences

which range from 6 to 10 percentage points were always significant

at the 5 percent level. Thus there is ]:1 difference in inequality
in earrdngs between various education and hUity
but

groups

in any year

more inequality in each case in 1969 than in 1955.

From Variance to Kurtosis

Thus far we have indicated that earnings inequality has varied from

yjar

to year. For many purposes, however, it is necessary to ask how

particular features of the distribution have

changed over time and to

what extent these features and their chance are the consequence of the

of education, mental ability, etc. A quantifiable and
decomposable description of a distribution can be obtained

distribution

from

various 'tmoments'1 of the distribution.94 The first four moments

iieasure the mean, variance, skev'ness, and kurtosis of the distribution.

In 1969 our standard deviation,o, is 9•4•95 In some types of labor
markets we would expect 0

to increase when average earnings did. For

these cases a standardized measure is provided by the coefficients of
: variation, 0/mean, •which is about 2/3 in 1969.
Several measures of syirmetry have been prcposed in the literature.

To avoid reranking the observations as we hold constant education and

will assume that the expected values of the first four moments
can be estimated from the actual value. This need not be true. For
example, if the distribution were }areto, the expected value of the variance
would be infinite though a number could be obtained from the data.

insure comparability with the regression results, and to save
on costs, the 1955 and 1969 statistics are based on the approximately
95ro

4600 people who reported earnings in both years.

sets of variables, we will use the third moment standardized by

the second'to eliminate scale effects.

A distribution is skewed to

the right when this measure is positive, as is our 1969 estLnate of

3.0. At the 5% level we can reject the null hypothesis that the
population is normally distributed which is symmetric, using a test
developed by Fisher.

Kurtosis measures the frequency of observations in the tail or
near the mean of the distribution. We use the fourth moment di'ided
(standardized) by the second.

From this ratio we subtract 3 which is

the ex-pected value of the kurtosis in a normal distribution. Larger
values such as our 12, indicate that there are too many observations in
the tails or too few near the mean as compared with the normal curve.

In 1955 mean earnings are $7,300 (in 1958 prices). The standard
deviation is $3.8 and the coefficients of variation is about 1/2. Our
skewness and kurtosis estimates are 5.4 and 62.0 respectively, neither

of which would be in accord with the null hypothesis that the distribution

is normal. Thus in both 1955 and 1969, the distribution of earnings is
skewed

to the right and has larger numbers of people in the tails.

Given the differences .between our sample and the U.S. population,
the

results on the various inequality measures in any one year have

—62--

restricted
the

interest until we control for education, ability, etc. But

changes

during the 14 years are of substantial interest —

especially

since such data are not generally available over such a time span and
so late in the life cycle.
Between 1955

and 1969 mean earnings in constant dollars grew by

about 100%. Since the standard deviation increased by.a greater amount
than the

mean, the coefficients of variation

increased by

27Z.96 The changes in the skewness and kurtosis measures are both negative.

Thus contrary to the usual interpretationf stochastic theories, the
distribution is

becoming'less

as the people age (

asymmetric and less deviant from a norn1
/

though

the 1969 curve is far from a normal curve).

One skewed distribution that has been used to describe the earnings
distribution is the lognormal. The skewness and kurtosis results for
the log of earnings in table 1 are not consistent with the null hypothesis
97

that earnings in 1955 or 1969 are distributed log normally.
Sources of Variance, Skewness and Inequality
Our sample is, of course, better educated, mentally more able, probably

less risk averse, and more limited in age than the population. Since all

TCareful analysis of nationwide random samples has generally concluded

that the earnings do not follow the log normal distribution for high levels
of income, but probably because of the restricted distribution of
education,

mental ability and age in our sample, the deviations from log
normalcy ( on a chart not shown) are greater and occur over a wider range
of earnings in this sample.

As long as the U's are distributed the same as in the population, we can

In examining the sources of various aspects of inequality, several

things must be noted. First since the equation's coefficients are

effect of the various X's, on earnings, for the range of each X in the sample.

Using the most comprehensive equation available, the standard
error of the residual earnings is reduced by about 18% to $7.8 in

row 2 of table 3. The remaining rows in the table, identified at the

bottom, indicate the effects of various sets of variables. For
purposes of reference, Y2 will hc called education, Y3 mental ability,
self employment, Y5 nonpecuniary trade offs, Y6 worlr related experiences,

Y7 socioeconomic standing, and

miscellany. The reduction in the

standard errors indicate the partial R 's —ignoring sign -

of

these

variables but because reductions in variance depend upon the covariance
of the independent variable, the effects of the individual rows .are not
additive.

The self employment data reduces the standard error,a, by 8% with

business

assets beitg the most important single variable. The SES

variables reduce a by 5%. The quantity and quality of education
variables C

including

M.D. and L.L.B .) reduce o by less than 4% and all

other sets of variables have even smaller impacts on a. The percentage
reductions in a are, incidentally, the partial R 's for each set of
103
variables.

In the sample, the standardized skewness measure is 3.05. As
shown in the Y —
row, the full set of variables reduces the skewness
104
Thus even if education, ability, SES, business assets,
by 10% to 2.76.
etc. were equal for all individuals, the earnings distribution would be
about 90% as skewed as originally once we adjust for the reduction in

the moments in table 3 are calculated about the mean that
applies to each row.
1041he reduction in Z(u.3) is about 50%.

—66—
variance from holding each of these items

constant.

Interestingly when education, ability, the nonpecuniary trade offs,

are individually held constant, th standardized skewness measure increases
between 1 and 5%. On the other hand, the self employment variables
reduce the relative skewness by 7% and the miscellaneous variables in
reduce skewness 1%.

Thus we can conclude that if everyone in the sample had the same
education or ability or nonpecuniary preferences, the earnings distribution
would have slightly more skewness. 105 We can also conclude that difference

in self employment (

size

of business assets and being self employed)

have contributed greatly to the existing skewness in the distribution in
this sample.

Now let us examine kurtosis. In the sample the standardized kurtosis
measure had a value of 13.9 which is far from and significantly differen
from the zero expected in the normal distribution. 106,107 The standardized

kurtosjs measure based on the residuals from equation 2, is increased

by 6%. Looking at the other rows, we find that only holding constant
self employment and the miscellany in Y8 has lead to a reduction in relative

kurtosis. Even with self employment held constant the distribution
105

This

increase is partly due to the distribution of people in each
category, e.g., nearly rectangular over the education groups and in the
ability and SES instances, and partly to the pattern of the coefficients.
We have already subtracted 3 which is the value if the distribution
is normal.
107

The unstandardized measure of kurtosis, u. 4 , would decline
.ubstantia1ly, but even with the initial variance the distribution would
not be normal.

of earnings would exhibit kurtosis. On the other hand, the elimination
of education differences leads to a big increase in kurtosis. This

suggests that education pushes more poele away from the mean and makes
for a smoother transition to the tails whose existence is not related
to education.
1955

Our analysis of the source of Inequality in 1955 earnings distribution
is handicapped by the fact that several of our 1Tost important variables —

including

the self employment ones —

are measured only in 1969 and must

have changed between 1955 and 1969. Nevertheless, let us examine the
same statistics on inequality. As shown in table 3, the standard error
of earnings In 1955 is $3.8 C thousands of 1958 dollars). Since the
1955 equation has a smaller

the standard error of Y —

has only

been reduced by 10%. The standard error of earnings is reduced by about
1 1/2 to 3% by each of education, ability, risk preference and nonpecuniary

variables, work experience, SES, and the miscellany in Y8 but the self
employment variables reduce the standard deviation by 4%.
The 1955 skewness measure is 5.3 which is much greater than in 1969.
Examining the various rows, we find that holding constant any subset
(except work experience and the miscellany) of the whole set of the
108
characteristics in equation 2 increases relative skewness.

10rhe major difference between the 1969 and 1955 results for the
self employment variables may well be due to the measurement problem,
i.e., some in the 1955 right hand tail in 1955 are no longer self employed
in 1969 while some with large business holdings in 1969 were not yet
self employed.

Much th same pattern appears on kurtosis. The residuals from the
full or any. partial set of variables (

except the miscellany) have

greater standardized kurtosis than in the original earnings data and
this kurtosis is greater in 1955 than in 1969.

Pattern by Education Level
Since we have eliminated the average difference in earnings for people
with different amounts of education, ability, etc. , the
above analysis
essentially analyzes the between cell contribution of

education, ability,

etc. to inequality. For several purposes it is important to study inequality

various

within

education and ability cells. As shorn

in

1955 the standard error is lowest for those with just a

education, at the peak for those who started or completed college, and

intermediate for those with more formal education than a bachelor's degree. 109
The relative skewness and kurtosis measure increases sharply from high
school through a bachelors degree and then falls to their lowest level

for those with at least some graduate work. In each education group neither
earnings nor the log of earnings are distributed normally.
In 1969 it is still true thatthe earnings distribution is neither
normal nor lognorrnal.

In other respects, the pattern is much different

than in 1955. While high school graduates still have the lowest standard
error, graduate students (including M.D.'s and L.L.B.'s) have the highest.
The skewness and kurtosis measures are greatest for high school graduates

and then decrease through the bachelors level followed by a slight

increase at the graduate level. The major change in the high school
the
category between 1955 and 1969 requires comment. We suggest that

above average growth in the standard error and the large absolute and
comparative increases in the skewness and kurtosis measures occur
because even the talented or lucky individual among high school graduates

people would not be so far out in the right hand tail as they are in 1969.
Perhaps because of a different distribution of talent among the more
educated, because of credentialism based on education or because of

nepotism, this same phenomenon does not occur in other education classes,
More light can be shed on these and other issues by examining the
distribution of the residuals in each education class.

Since we are

not able to find significant differencesin the coefficients by ability
or education level we can use the same sets of coefficients as previously
.111

in making these calculations.

Consider first the 1955 results in table 5. At each education level
the standard error declines by about 10%, with the self employment

variables (Y — Y4) generally responsible for the largest reduction

the standard error and the SES(Y — Y.7) and nonpecuniary trade offs
(Y—Y5)

variables nearly as Important.

education variables, which we hink are a proxy for
nepotism, have bigger range effects and partial R 'S in 1969 than in 1955.

1The private

11•That the coefficients do not differ significantly, of course, tells
us nothing about the pattern of inequality in the residuals as education varies.

—70—

In all but the bachelors group, holding the self employment variable

constant causes a reduction in the relative skewnes r'easurg. The

opposite is true in table 4 for the total aple. It eems likely that
thiB difference is duo to the use of a sepnrate stfmdardization factor
in each education level or in other words the total. ;unple combines
within education distributions i'hich have different pirarneters. In the

high school and graduate level, kurtosis dicreases hen self employment
is held constant while the oppo.itc is true at the other two education

levels. No other set of characti.ristics hrs a large impact on skewness
or kurtosis in 1955 at more than one education level.

In 1969 the picture is more varied. The standard error of Y —

is

.nearly identical for all but the high school category which remains

the lowest and much of the difference in skewness and to a lesser extent

kurtosis disappears. At each education level holding constant the self
employment variable substantially reduces the standard error and the
relative skewness but only the high school and bachelors degree estimates

of relative kurtosis. Once again SES and nonpecuniary variables play an
important secondary role in deterr.ining the standard error but have little
effect on skewness and kurtosis.

Mental Ability
Since very little information has ever been presented about the
distribution of earnings by mental ability, it is appropriate to repeat

the above analysis by the 5 ability levels. Table 6 contains the distribution

—71—
112
statistics for earnings and the log earnings for each ability fifth.

In 1955 the standard error is lowest for the bottom fifth and highest

for the top. The middle fifth, however, has a lower standard error and
coefficient of variation than the group on either side. Since the standard
error of the log of earnings does not vary with ability, the above
results may be due to a few extreme observations — as is also suggested

by the skewness and kurtosis meanure. Both skewness and kurtosis follow
the same pattern, with highest values in the top 1/5th; however, none of
the earnings distributions within an ability cell are normal or log normal.
In 1969 the

standard

deviation follows the same pattern as in 1955

(though the largest fifth has the lowest coefficient of variation).

Skewness and. kurtosis are substantially lower in the top 2 fifths than
in the lowest 3; however, none of the distributions are normal or lognornal.
Table 7 presents the inequality pattern by ability level once other

variables have been held constant. As we have consistently found in 1955,
the self employment variables cause the biggest reduction in the standard

error in most ability fifths with the SES and nonpecuniarY trade offs
contributions almost as large. In 1969 holding self employment constant
substantially reduces the standard error and skewness.

At first glance the inequality pattern seems confusing. For example
when comparing the education results, we find high school to be (about)

It is important to remember that the ability measures is more
mathematical than a standard I.Q. measure and that to be in the sample

The 1/5ths, therefore, are more like tenths for the U.S. population.

—72—

the

113
lowest on skewness and kurtosis in 1955 but the highest in 1969.

A similar reversal occurs in the ability .results.
A sorting uncertainty model can be used to explain these reversals

and other results contained in tables 4 and 6. As explained earlier
the basis of this model is that it is difficult to measure in advance

a person's capacity to perform in various jobs. Firms also do not use
piece pay rate perhaps because of difficulty in measuring one person's

prdductivity and

of

interdependencies within production lines or heirarchial

structures. Firms, therefore, initially assign people to particular jobs
on the basis of certain"objective' criteria such as education, marital
status, military record, etc. and certain "subjective" criteria such
114
as rformance on an interview.
In addition appointment may be based
•

on discriminatic as evidenced by race, gender, or "parental pull".
Since firms know that the above criteria or signals are fallable,
they continually monitor performance on the job to base decisions on

fire, retain, and promote. Average initial earnings may be fairly uniform
when studied by objective criteria, because of morale problems associated
with different pay for the same position and because at low level jobs

a person has little chance to use initiative or display productivity outside
115
of a narrow range.

People with more potential capacity perform better

are promoted faster and have a higher growth rate in earnings, However,
113
Since the adjustments for the other variables never change the rank
order on any inequality measure, we will base our statements on the inequality in Y.

difference arises frr several reasons. For exaple the more talented
partly inherit their capacity from successfulparents who

encourage

them to get more education.119 Second some sources of their capacity,
(such as drive and creativity), may lead to academic leanings and

scholarhips. Third for most people education may be a necessary ingredient
in the formation of capacity.

Now, how do we explain the ability results? A plausible argument
can be made that the mental abIlity measure, we use is cor,related with
types of cognitive and to a lesser extent noncognitive skills.

Following

the lines of the above argument, we would expect skewness and kurtosis
for the less able to be relatively low in 1955 and high in 1969. Comparing
the bottom and top fifths, we find this to be the case. However, table

8 also indicates very large valuesof skewness and kurtosis in the 2nd
fifth in 1955 and an extremely large incease for the top fifth. This
is notthe only time we will find something unusual about these two ability

fifths. In [5j in chapter

we paint out the average amount of income

from capital is greatest in these two groups. This suggests that through
inheritance (

financial

control ,or nepotism), men in this group were

able to reach high positions quickly.

While we can construct a plausible explanation of the changes in
inequality measure on the basisof a sorting uncertainty model, . other
theories are also consistent with the results.

!individua1 Stability in the Earnnc's Distribution
Whilemany

of our findings are based on variables not previously

used in studies of earnings, in priaip1e the same phenomena

could

be examined for different cohorts in Census type samples. The longitudinal
data in our sample also permit us to extend our understanding
of the dynamic evolution of the earnings distribution and to analyze
the relationship of annual to lifetime earnings by examining the stability
of an individual's position in the earnings

distribution over time.

The empirical facts on stability and change over a long time span
are very valuable in themselves since the distribution of lifetime
earnings is more important for many purposes than that of any one years

earnings. But equally important-these

facts allow us to test and thus

to have a chance to reject certain earnings' distribution theories,
as described below.

Individual Stability and Chanin the Earnings Distribution
To examine fndividual stability in the distribution,

we have calculated

the "transition probability matrix" for the people who reported earnings

in both 1955 and 1969. Table 1 indicates the percentage of people who
ended up in any tenth of the 1969 earnings distribution from any given
122

• tenth in the 1955 distribution.

For example, of the people with the

122rhere are not exactly 10% of the sample in each row or column for
two reasons. First the dividing points were found for all respondents
included
with nonzero earnings in the sample while some individuals were not
in
both
in this table, primarily because they did not report earnings
years. Secondly, in a few instances, a large number of people reported
earnings equal to the dividing poiflt. While we could randomly allocate
people to each adjoining class t) ill it, it was simpler and not misleading
to place people in only one class.

prefer one measure to the other).
Of the people who were in the second tenth of earnings in 1955:
1% had a decrease in (nominal) earnings; nearly

l6%(the mode) had a

gain between 125 and 150%; while 8.5% had a growth in excess of 300%.

The average growth rate in earnings in this tenth is 176%.
Of the people in the BOth to 90th percentile in 1955: nearly 5%

had a decrease in their nominal earnings; the mode is in the 75 to 100%
interval; and 14.5% had a growth rate in excess of 300%. The mean

growth rate in the next to bottom, and next to top rowe are identical,
but there are more people in both tails of the distribution in the 80th
to 90th percentile, and the two distributions are significantly different
at the 5% level (K.S. test).

In all but the two extreme rows, the mean growth in earnings only
ranges from 151 to 176% and the compound rates .045 to .051. However,
those whose earnings placed them in the top 70 to 90% in 1955 have
distributions which are significantly different (

K.S.

test, 5% level)

with more people in both tails than those in the bottom 10—50%. In
the bottom tenth the mean change is 267% with a heavy concentration in

the right hand tail. In the top tenth, the mean change is only 143%
and there is a heavy concentration in the left hand tail.

Distribution of Growth Rates by Education Level
Tables 3—6 contain the growth rate distributions for each of 4
126
education levels.
Since in these tables cutoff points for the tenths
are those for the entire sample, we may compare the corresponding rows.
In the 10 to 20th percentile, about 68,57,45, and 36% of people with

hih school, some college, a bachelors degree, and at least some
graduate training had earnings increases no greater than 150%. The
average growth in earnings increases with education for people with

the same earnings in 1955. Despite the relatively small sample sizes
within each of these 1955 percentiles, the KS test rejects the hypothesis
that the cumulative distribution of, say, the second and ninth rows are
the same in each education level..

For any one educational level, the results are similar to those given
for the whole sample in table 2.

That is except for the top and botto

rowi, the mean percentage change is independent of earnings percentile in

27

1955.

The people at the bottom in 1955 have the highest growth rate

while those at the top in 1955 have the lowest growth rate C
except for

the high school category). Within each education level

those with high

earnings in 1955 tend to have distributions with a greater percentage of
people in both tails than people with low incomes.

Despitethe relatively

126We used education as reported in 1969. The distribution of
education in 1955 is different because of the post 1955 education received
by about 8% of the sample.
127
There is however, a tendency in each of the tables for the average
compound growth rate to decrease with 1955 earnings partly because of
the wider variance in growth rates at the higher 1955 percentiles.

—81few observations, within these tables, the differences in the distribution

by row are significant. Thus we can conclude that results in table 2
don't occur because high school graduates are more concentrated in the
lower percentiles in 1955.

In the appendix, we present several equations in which the dependent

variable is (Y69 —

y55)/Y55.

(The reader who wishes to examine the

determinants of Y69 — Y55 can do so by subtracting the 1955 regression

from the 1969 one). The first equation contains all the variables used
in the final equations. for 1955 and 1969 in chapter 4. The second
equation adds Y55 to the first.

We will concentrate first on the second equation which contains Y55

and which has an R2 of .20. The1nclusion of Y55 in our equation means
that we have held constant all theother systxnatic determinants of Y
and its percentage change including luck and K55 —155 where 1(55 is the

stock of investment in one the job training and 155 is the investment in
128,129
But the coefficients on the other variables in this
that year.
equation represent the effect of each variable on the growth rate, net
of the effects passed on through Y55.
The higher is a person's 1955 earnings the slower is his growth rate.

128
We have expressed the on the job training variable in this way to
be in accord with Mincer's model, as explained below.
129

It can be demonstrated that if we compare the estimates of
Y = Xf + (Z + Xb)g that our estlm&tes of g and e
Y
Xd + Ze
and
would be identical while the estimate of f would equal that of d — bg.

—82—

The coefficient of —.09 is highly significant with a "t"

value

of 19.

As just explained, the coefficient on the earnings variable represents

the effect of all the unmeasured variables. Results presented later would
suggest that one of the unmeasured variables that is important is luck.
The on the job training variable, K55 — 155, may also be important though
tests of the theory presented below tend to conflict with Mincer's theory.

Previous research based on crosssection data has shown .that age
earning profiles tend to be steeper for the more educated.

Using

the same people at different points of time,s also find that the
average growth rate increases continuously with education (

except

for some graduate) with most of the difference from high school graduates
being statistically significant. -- The coefficients on the education

variables are larger than most of the other coefficients though attending
private elementary school is the single largest coefficient.
While the average growth rate increases monotonically with ability,

nonef these coefficients are significant at th5% level. There are,
however, several interesting variables, which have significant and large

effects. For example, those who are Jewish have a growth rate 21% points
above that of Catholics. Several other SES variables are also significant.
For example those who attended private elementary school have a growth

rate 80% higher than those who didn't. Also mother—in—law's and
father—in—law's education are both significant and positive.
Of the time spent on youth variables, sports and part time job have
significant positive effects while chores has a significant negative

—83—

effect. The nonpecuniary variables are significant with the exception
of helping others and job security, which is significant at the 6%

level. Those not interested in future financial prospects, nor in
challenging work, have a slower growth rate which also is true for those

interested in independence in their work. The people who prefer to
be salaried have a 10 percentage point slower growth rate.
The age variable has a negative coefficient implying a concave

earnings function. The positive sign on year of first job also implies
concavity but this coefficient is only significant at the 5% level.
Those who were self employed in 1969 have a faster growth in earnings.
Increased hours on first job in 1969 also lead to a faster growth rate
130
Those who moved inter—
but the opposite is true for hours on second job.

regionally after 1955 have a faster growth rate as do those who live in
bigger cities in 1969. Good health in 1969 as reflected in weeks lost
from illness and weight —

are associated with higher growth rates.

We have reestimated the equations dropping the variables that pertain

exclusively to 1969. The general results are unchanged.
The equations clearly indicate that there are important systematic

may be because the 1969 earnings are only for main job while
the 1955 earnings may include all jobs. However, this variable seems to
represent those people with low wage rates who work hard. Thus it may be
representing some of the forces in Y55.

still wonders why these groups are different.
An alternative explanation is that because

in earnings between ladders is greater for older person's because the

sorting process takes place quentia1ly over time and people only
gradually reach the upper parts of the heirarchy.
This explanation, which can be applied easily to the risk preference
and other nonpecuniary variables, can also explain why the other

variables are significant. For example, the in—law and private school

Test of Predictions of Some Earnings Distribution Theories

We begin the discussion with the stochastic theories32In these
models initial earnings depend on an individual's capacity but the

change in earnings depend on luck. Let the earnings of the ith
individual in year t be represented by Y1 and the random event by ej

'3ven if this alternative explanation is correct, Mincer's
theory
may be correct in a formal sense. Lifetime earnings within career ladders

can be adjusted so that they are the same net of risk premiums and non—
pecuniary rewards. But even here, the increase in earnings need not be
due to on the job training but could solely reflect the firm's learning
by observation, bhough a combination of the two learning mechanisms seems
more likely.

If the c's are serially independent, the distribution of Y will depend

In the latter case, these theories predict that the

correlations with education, etc. with Y decline over time since the

variance of Y increases.
The stochastic theories require that either the difference or the
percentage change in earnings be independent of the level of earnings.
But table 2 indicates that the mean growth rate in earnings is differént
at the highest and lowest levels of 1955 earnings and that those with
high earnings in 1955 have distributions with fatter tails.

The difference

in mean growth rates can be attributed to transitory effects that do

not become impounded into a person's earnings base, but such an expiañäion
This is the assumption normally made and the one we will test.
However, it is important to note that Kaldor [ c3 ] assumes the e's to be
serially dependent. He is interested in finding conditions on the correlation
of the e's so that the variance of earnings would be constant at all ages,
which is contrary to fact. It would be possible, however, to generate any
pattern on the tim profile of the variance in Y by making the appropriate
assuintons on the correlations of the e's.
The stochastic processes theories also provide no explanation of
why age earnings profiles slope upward or why the steepness varies with
education.

—87--

is not in accord with the Markov assumptions of the stochastic models.

As is evident from the pattern of the percentage changes and has been
confirmed by direct calculations, the average difference in earnings

increases with the level of Y55. Thus models expressed as equation 1
are also rejected by our data.
Since in Markov models, the education and other variiables are

correlated with Yo only, the variance explained by such variables

should decrease as people age. But education, ability, family background,
and other characteristics have an R2 of about 4 points higher in 1969
than in 1955 even excluding the information pertaining to 1969.

Investment in On the Job Training Models
Next let us consider the investment in on the job training theory
as presented by Mincer [

351. HIs

model can be thought of in the following

terms. Suppose skills learned on the job increase a person's marginal

productivity to many employers If an employee who receives general on
the job training is legally free to accept any job offer at any time,
after finishing his training he will be paid a wage equal to his new,
higher marginal product (

in

a competitive market). Next suppose

occupation A gives no general training and will pay a person the same
wage rate throughout his lifetime but occupation B involves general

training and has a rising age earnings profile for an individual. A
rational person would choose the occupation whose earnings stream has

the larger present discounted value. But Mincer argues that with free
entry into both occupations, the present 'ialue of the two earnings streams

will be equalized. Hence, since a person will receive a real wage equal

—88—

to his marginal product after training, he must be paid less than his
marginal product while being trained.
Mincer expresses his theory as:

2)
where

—

which depends on schooling, ability, etc. is the constant earnings

of a person who never invests on the job, A is the fraction of earnir

invested, and r is the rate of return on investment on the job. Mincr
assumes that investments are a monotonically decreasing function of

which will be positive if A decreases with age.

Mincer has designated as the overtaking point that year in which

rEX equals A or when

correlated with investment C

by individual, people with the same Y and different investments will have

different changes in earnings subsequently. If the distribution of A
is independent of V, so also will be the percentage changes in earnings.

Thus when examined at the overtaking point, Mincer's theory yields the
same testable hypothesis on growth rates as the stochastic theory as
expressed in equation la).

en we apply the tests we will reconsider the effects of this correlation.

Ben Porath has shown analytically that such a
.
,ee
pattern will often arise from utility maximization behavior.

Mincer's model, however, yields different predictions when growth

rates are calculated from a year that is not the overtaking point. We
can see this best if we specify

his analysis often assumes that the individual', investment paths

are exponential as in equation 3).

_bt

3) X—A1e

O<A<lb<O

The Implications of this investment equation ( as well as one with a
linear time trend) for testing this hypothesis which are derived in

will be summarized here. Mincer usually restricts b to be the same
for all individuals while letting A1 vary. In this case a length of

the overtaking period is the same for all A ( and r) though the actual
overtaking year will vary for people of the same age because of differences

in time spent in school and military service. Mincer's model, therefore,

preditts that those with the higher A will have higher growth rates in
earnings.

If we knew Ai for each person, we could test the theory directly.

We can, of course, calculate the average earnings a person with given
set of measurable skills would receive, but the difference between an
individual's actual earnings and this average would be an imperfect estimate

of A1 since other unmeasured skills would also be in this residual. However,
as long as we are willing to assume that A1 is not correlated with
( or the unmeasured skills) we can classify people into groups between

which the average amount of A1 varies. That is in years earlier than
overtaking, those ( with the same education, ability, etc.) who are
investing more must be earning less and the earnings figure C perhaps

—90—

adjusted) can be used as an instrumental variable or proxy for A.

Similarly, those who invest more will have a higher growth rate in

earnings. Moreover those who have below average earnings in the preovertaking years will have above avesage earnings after overtaking.
According to Mincer, the overtaking point occurs in no more than

hr years of work experience or probably less than a decade.

everyone was at the overtakinoint in 1955. But in this instance,
Mincer's and the stochastic theory generates the same hypothesis which

we have already rejected.
Because the more educated have worked fewer years and because individuals
fo±low different investment paths, it is unlikely that all individuals

are at the overtaking point in 1955. Mincer often specifies as his
investinett function equation 2) with bi equal to

for all persons. For

this investment function, the overtaking period is the same for people

with the same education ( who begin work in the same year). But when
we examine the distribution of growth rates within education groups, as
in tables .

we find the same pattern of results as above and this

pattern is unaltered if we standardize the observed growth rates or the
1955 level of earnings for differences in age and time on the job.
13Zbout 1/2 of the high school graduates and 1/3 of the some college
graduates began work before 1942.

within an education class those with

The classification by observed percentiles in 1955 may be affecting

the top and

with large positive and negative e's. But with transitory events uncorrelated
over 14 years, we would also expect those at the top in 1955 because of

large positive e's to have low growth rates, etc. Replacing the observed
fraction of people in the top tenth in the left hand cell with the overall

sample percentage the average growth rate becomes about 1.8 while a

adjustment for the right hand cell for the bottom tenth reduces
its average growth rate to about 2.2.' If these numbers are to be trusted,
table 2 would yield a U shaped pattern of average growth rates which is

not consistent with either the Mincer or luck theories.

—93—
In making these tests, we have consistently assumed that investment
(

or

A1) was not correlated with

It is this assumption that, for

example, allows us to say that people with a given education and low
140
1955 earnings must on average contain the people who are investing more.

Mincer's theory does not rule out either positive or negative correlations,
which if large enough could destroy our ability to distinguish groups
with more or less investments in on the job training.
There are several possible responses to this point. First our
equations indicate which variables have a significant effect on the gráwth
rate in earnings, which indicates differential investment.

Standardization

for these variables ( on the growth rate and on Y55) does not alter our
conclusions though, of course, otrr equations do not explain a majority

of the variance in earnings or its growth. Second if Mincer is not
willing to specify the correlations a priori, then it will be difficult
to distinguish his theory from stochastic ones since it is always possible
to find certain patterns of correlations among the error terms to generate
any age profile of variances.
The essence of Mincer's argument is that labor markets functions well.
There are several reasons why our data might reject the investment hypohtesis,

though Mincer's theory (

with

no correlation between A1 and Y1) might

be a partial explanation of earnings and the labor market. By 1955 the

market might have adjusted for expected wage changes that were not realized.

/ ], as

fhe argument is the same as Friedman's [
to why people
with low observed income on average should have negative transitory income.

—94—

But if forecasts are generally incorrect, it is difficult to consider
how investment modelS can ever be verified with either cross section

or time series sample i

or

more importantly how such samples can be

analyzed within the context of equilibrium investment models.
Second Mincer's formulation only applies to general on the job trainthg.

No one has yet analyzed the implications of firm speific training on
earnings profiles though some arrangements must lead to rising profiles.
Sorting, Uncertainty and Heirarchy Modeir;
Another explanation of the change in the earnings distribution with

age is provided by a sorting uncertainty model. That is suppose that
employers are uncertain about a person's overall skill level because
performance depends on many skill-s some of which are thfficult to test

for in advance. The firm can react to uncertainty in many ways. One
particular method, which may be very relevant in a heirarchial structure,

is learning by observing. In this model firms initially place an individual
141

in a job which is an entry position for one or more career paths.

Then

firms make successive decisions to fire, retain or promote on the basis

of both the observed and required competency in the particular position
held and

the

number of jobs openings in the next rung. People will be

promoted faster the more competence they demonstrate and the quicker
positions that they are qualified for open up.
Let us equate the positions with earnings and denote a per5ofl5

maximum earnings capacity as Y which is a function of education, inherited skills, etc. A person's prgoress towards '-

expect a distribution of growth rates for people

at Y1.
This model has certain characteristics that are different from
those of Mincer and are capable of empirical verification or refutation.

For example since promotions depend on prior job performances, the most
able should, on average, be promoted faster and always have a larger

growth rate in earnings. But for a given a

the

variance of Y will

increase continuously with age.
Second this model does seem to provide a consistent explanation of

which variables determine the growth rate in earnings. The sorting
model postulates that initially employers have very little information
on a worker's productivity but that over time employee quality is rewarded

through faster promotions. The larger growth rate in earnings by education
level — demonstrated in tables
and in
is in accord with this prediction.
However, the same regressions indicate that

workers and that

"best". Since 1955 is still

fairly early in their working life, the best could still have the lowest

1955 highest earnings growth rate. The constancy of the mean growth
rate between the 10th and 90th percentile may reflect the downward pull
of people who in 1955 were at or above their potential, offsetting the
higher growth rate of the more talented.
It is unfortunate that only the 1955 and 1969 data are, as yet,
available since a more definitive test of these two models rests on

whether those with low earnings in the early years have high or low
earnings beyond Mincer's overtaking point.

Since Mincer's theory is

much more tightly specified than the sorting theory, it is easier to
find ways to reject it and the rejection is not based on overwhelming

evidence. Thus it tight be fairer to say that the sorting should not
be given any more precedence than Mincer's model.

VII. Conclusions and Questiq.

years and also have what we consider to be consistent signs

equations

explaining educational attainment, test scores, and assets.
In the earnings equations we find that educational quantity and
quality, mental ability, business assets, certain aspects of family background (

discussed below), preferences towards risk and towards nonmonetarY

aspects of a job, locational information, hours of work, health, and work
experience and age are significant determinants of earnings. Among this
list of items are several, which to my knowledge have never been found

science theory. For example, economists and others have long recognized
that people can trade off earnings for nonpecuniary rewards, but information
on what nonpecuniary rewards are traded off with earnings and the importance
of such rewards are not available.

Our family background variables are much different than in most other

studies. For example parent's or especially fathers' education and occupation
are often used as the major index of. SES. Though we started off using
these variables, we found that they became insignificant especially when

that

inheritance perhaps tinged with nepotism and not for home

training.

(Since

parental education is associated with the educational attainment and
test scores of respondents, we are only speaking of direct effects on
earnings.)

While the traditional SES variables are not significant we have found
others that seem to be related to the types of family life, and child
rearing processes that people have in mind when they talk of training

and taste formation. For example, we find that Jews earn significantly
more than and Protestants significantly less than Catholics ( and the
few aetheists and agnostics). Other studies have found that Jews of this
and surrounding generations have more drive and motivation for financial
success — perhaps because of fear engendered by centuries of economic
insecurity and because most of them were children or grandchildren of
inmiigrants who were poor and wanted to succeed. The Protestant—Catholic

result may be attributable to the Protestants in this group coming
from wealthier families who did not need to emphasize economic success.

While this conclusion may seem contrary to the Profestant ethic, others in
small samples have found that some Catholic groups — such as German or

French — do better than the average Protestant. Given the education cutoff,,
in our sample and the cohort involved, it seems likely that we have drawn
Catholics from the above average earnings group.

'42Parental occupation and education is contained with unknown weight in
our biography variable. As argued in Chapter
when onevariable, X, is
already included in another one variable Z with a weight of b, the estimate
coefficient on X is equal to c—bd where c is the true effect of X and d the
true effect of Z. Thus estimated coefficient is a net effect. But these
were significant before business assets were added.

—99—

We also find that those who attend privat, elementary

school

and

high school earn about $5,000 a year more in 1969(in 1938 prices).
While there are a number of explanations for this result the one that
appeals to me is that these people come from very wealthy families who
use pull to advance their eons.
Another aspect of religious upbringing that affects earnings is
frequency of attendance at religious( not parochial) school with those
attending most often earnings the least and those never attending earning

the most. The ones who attended more than twice a week are probably
certain subgroups of Catholics and more orthodox Jews. This variable
may help to distinguish those less interested in a material life, The
non—attendees are more difficult..to explain though nonattendance in the

1920's or early 1930's may represent a very atypical family.
We also find that those who spent their time differently on various

activities while growing up earn different amounts. The explanations for
these findings include indication of respondent's tastes and attitudes

as well as certain types of family rearing. For example, we argued that
respondents who..remembered spending time on chores, came from families

that are interested in conformity and

people who enter into bureau-

cracies and safe jobs.

it is not surprising that variables such as job security and prefer to

both

of which are related to risk avoidance, have separate

effects. Combining these different variables and others such as chores and
SES proxies into categories, the impression that comes through is that those
who take safe, unchallenging and conventional jobs progressively fall further

behind in earnings. That is, the high paying jobs are at the top of certain

career ladders and cannot be reached by people on other ladders.

occupations.' It also appears that hours worked is an important determinant
of earnings ( though the data is only avsiilable for 1969). However, there

are

a

large group of men who moonlight because their earnings are low.

Business assets as measured in 1969 are one of the most important
variables in our equation explaining 10 percent of the

variance

in earn-

ings by itself. The coefficient is .11 in 1969 which is not extremely
high on a before tax

basis.

We have also calculated the same

equations

within various occupations.

Since many of the above variables are related to occupational choice,
coàfficients tend to be smaller and less often significant. But we do
find clear evidence that some skills, attributes, etc. are more important

in Bome occupations than others. For example intelligence is more important
for the self employed. Moreover the self employed who are the ones who have
more control over their work environment, have larger coefficients on
the various nonpecuniary measures.
We can explain moreof the variance in earnings in 1969 than in 1955 even
when we restrict our attention to varithlcs equ11y accurate in both

years,

i.e., when we ignore business assets, etc.

Second, the truncated education

though some of the effàcts

biggest partial R2 in each year is attached to the 1969 business asset

those that want to avoid risk earn significantly less and that the differential grows with age and is a greater percentage of average earnings

Avoidance of risk can be considered one type of noripecuniary reward.
We find that tastes towards other types of nonmonetary returns also show
up as a reduction in earnings — presumably through the type of Occupation

in which a person chooses to work. We find that those who want interesting
work, or to help others, or who are not interested in future financial

success earn less and that these differentials increase with age. Rut
these variables do not contribute to skewness and kurtosis.

We also find evidence that those who are willing to work hard or
have drive or concern for financial success receive much more earnings.
These conclusions are based on the effects of religion, part—time job

while

growing up, and entered occupation because it(work) was challenging.

These variables have larger effects over time.

pArental education and occupation suggest that education is too crude
an indicator of the differences in

upbringing.

Many people have argued that a good portion of earnings differentials

arise because of family pull. While we have no variable which is an
unambiguous measures of nepotism, we have several which lend themselves

to that interpretation. This,for example, is the simplest explanation
of the in-laws education results and why the inclusion of business assets
wipes out the fathers education coefficients.

Nepotism and/or inheritance

of controlling intcrcst in a business seem to be likely explanations of
why the 22 people who went to private

elementary and high school earn on average
147
up to 5D per cent more than people who went to
public or parochial school.

Some theories such as the one that goes under the general title of

capital are more general in nature. To the

Additional support comes from the

oblems and Extojog
-

Several

different typea of problems remain.

?irst, our interprotation

of many of the new variables we have used may be
wrong. It would be very
useful for some one else,

perhaps a psych1ogjt or sociologist, to tact,

validate and improve our measures of risk aversion, eloomosynary

etc. Second, we have spent

behavior,

very little time examining interactions which

may be very important and

may be biasing some of our results.

Third, we have not related our various

cross-section periods to macro,

time series developments.

Fourth, the results are only generated within an atypical
sample of a cohort which in turn
may be atypical because of war experiences and

the Depression and because the

economy and society are much altered now.

Thus many of our findings must

be subject to replication in other groups
before being accepted as not false. Finally we have not made much
progress
on the nature/nurture or
exp1antjonz of the distribu-

tion. Hopefully progress on this issue will be forthcoming
soon.
