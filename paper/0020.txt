"Short-Run and

Long-Run

Prospects for

Female Earnings"
by

Victor R. Fuchs*
This

paper discusses the prospects for female earnings

relative to male earnings. The determinants of the general

of

level

earnings (female and male) are not considered. I concentrate

on hourly earnings as being the best measure of the price of labor

from both the demand and supply points of view. One can easily
extend the discussion to annual earnings by taking account of annual

hours. (In 1970 on average employed women worked about 3/4 as
many hours per year as employed men.)

The estimates of hourly earnings to be presented are calculated
from the 1/1000 samples of the 1960 and the 1970 Censuses of Population.
(See Fuchs, 1968, for a discussion of the strengths and shortcomings

of this source.) The Census samples provide much useful data on
employed persons including such characteristics as sex, schooling, age,

race, marital status, and class of worker. I have excluded agricultural
and unpaid family workers because of well-known difficulties in

estimating

their

earnings and hours of work. All other persons who

were at work during the Census week and who

preceding
(or

had earnings in the year

the Census are included. Total annual

1969) are

earnings

in 1959

calculated for workers classified by a variety of

characteristics.

Total annual hours are estimated by multiplying

—2—

the weeks

worked in 1959 (or 1969) by the hours worked in the Census

week in 1960 (or 1970) (for each worker) and summing across all the

workers in a classification. Average hourly earnings for each classification are obtained by dividing the total earnings by total hours.

This is equivalent to calculating the mean of individual average hourly
earnings weighted by annual hours.

Because of limitations of time and space the focus of this paper

is on the sex differential in earnings for whites only. It is
noteworthy, however, that the sex differential among blacks and the
color differential between blacks and whites narrowed appreciably

from 1959 to 1969. During the decade black female earnings, adjusted
for age and schooling, rose 82 percent compared with 68 percent for

black males and 53 percent for white females. By 1969 less than
15 percent separated the earnings of black women and white women

of couparablé age and schooling. For women with more than 12 years
of schooling the adjusted differential between blacks and whites
had practically disappeared.

What are
answer

this

the prospects for female earnings? In

order to

question one needs a clear understanding of the factors

that account for the sex differential as well as the ability to
predict how. these factors will change over time. In my view,
neither inherent physical or mental differences nor employer
discrimination can explain most of the differential.

(See Fuchs, 1971,

also, Mincer and Polachek, and Malkiel and Malkiel.) This is not to

— 3-.

deny the existence of some discrimination by many employers and a
great deal by some, but those who discriminate do pay a price. (See
Becker.) For most employers the desire for profit or the fear of loss
make them unwilling or unable to absorb the 30 to 40 percent difference
in labor costs that is implied if the differential in earnings is
attributable only or principally to employer discrimination.
The major explanation, it seems to me, is role differentiation,

which begins in childhood and eventually affects labor force attachment,
choice of occupation, location and hours of work, post-school invest-

ment and consumer and fellow employee attitudes. This role differentiation was functional at a time when men worked long hours at heavy
jobs in mining, manufacturing, transportation, and construction while

women specialized in work at home including the bearing and raising

of many children. Such differentiation is less functional now, and
much of the recent tension regarding sex roles probably arises from
the lagged adjustment of the law, customs and institutions to technologic

and economic changes. These changes include sharp reductions in
infant and child mortality, dramatic improvements in birth control and
major shifts in requirements of the job market.

The effects of these changes on female earnings for given

labor market

productivity can

be analyzed with

the

familiar tools

of demand and supply, supplemented by attention to changes in the

relative market productivity of men and women that are not captured

by adjustment for age and ichooling. In the demand-supply analysis price
is the wages of females relative to males, and quantity is employment
of females relative to males. (See Figure 1.)

Because

curve is

the sexes are not perfect substitutes, the demand

not completely elastic; it is probably becoming more elastic

over time. The demand curve shifts over time as a result of changes
in the industrial and occupational mix of the economy. In particular,
the growth of a service economy and the decline in the importance

of heavy manual jobs tend to move the demand curve to the right.
Demand is affected also by the removal of legal and institutional
barriers to women and by the greater acceptance of women by consumers
and other employees in a variety of occupations and roles.

The relative supply curve is dominated by changes in female
labor force

participation because the supply of male labor tends

to be fixed. Shifts in the curve are related to the decreases in
infant and child mortality, the improvements in birth control,
the

increase in the absolute level of wages, and the desire

of women to achieve greater autonomy

through maintenance and

enhance-

ment of labor market skills.
During the 1960's there was a very large increase in female
employment, which I

interpret

as primarily a shift in

the relative

supply curve. This shift tends to depress female earnings in the
short run not only because increased quantity lowers price but also
because the new entrants tend to have less schooling and less labor

market experience. As Reuben

less

Gronau has shown) they

are probably

able (in labor market terms) than those already at work.

In this same decade, however, there was increased demand
for female labor due to the rapid growth of industries such as
health and education that traditionally have been large employers

of women. The beginning of legal and

institutional

changes within

and occupations also contributed to the increase in. demand.
The net effects of these shifts on female earnings are

Contrary to other reports which typically do not adjust
for hours, age or schooling) the 1/1000 samples reveal that the

female/male earnings ratio increased between 1959 and 1969. For
all whites, the adjusted ratio rose from .61 to .64, a gain of 4.8

per cent. This increase, although small, was noteworthy given the unprecedented increase in the female/male employment ratio of almost
20 percent during the same decade. The improvement in female earnings
was evident in all four regions, with all except the North Central
showing gains of over five percent.

when the sample is disaggregated by schooling, we find that
the rise in female earnings was very large

for those with at

least some col1ege the sex earnings ratio jumped 11.4 percent.
For workers with 12 years of schooling or less the increase was only

1.5 percent. The explanation for this difference lies, I believe,
in an exceptionally rapid growth of demand for well-educated women
and a relative increase in supply of less educated women.

The demand phenomenon is illustrated in Table 2 which lists
major industries and occupations in order of their rates of growth

from 1960 to 1970. It is evident that those industries and occupations
which were large employers of well-educated women in 1960 were precisely
the ones that experienced the largest increases in demand for labor

between 1960 and 1970. A simple projection based on 1960-70 industry
group growth rates and 1960 sex-schooling distributions by industry
group reveals an expected increase in demand between 1960 and 1970 of
47 percent for well-educated females compared with 28 percent for
well—educated males and 20 percent for less educated females.

On the supply side two aspects must be considered. First, what
changes occurred in the relative number of females and males at the
two schooling levels regardless of employment statistics?

Second,

what changes occurred in the relative number employed? We see in Table 3
that although the female/male ratio rose more rapidly for the less

educated in both cases the

differential between schooling groups

was particularly striking for employment. Why did the relative
employment of less educated women grow faster than that of the more
educated when the latter's relative wages were increasing more rapidly?
It is probably true that the relative supply curve of the less

educated is somewhat more elastic than that of the well-educated. The.
principal

explanation, however, is differential shifts in the female

labor supply in response to increases in the absolute level of
earnings

(and other reasons) rather than movements along relative

supply functions in response to changes in relative earnings. An
increase in the general level of wages has very little effect on

male labor force participation rates at any level of schooling. It
has some effect on well-educated females but a greater relative effect
on the less educated ones because the well—educated females are already

at a higher level of participation. Thus the female/male relative
supply function shifts more for the less-educated in response to
a rise in the general wage level.
Disaggregation

by age reveals that the increase in female

earnings was about the same for those below 35 as those above, but

further disaggregation by marital status or class of worker reveals
that this is the result of conflicting trends. When females and males

are compared by marital status the smallest decrease in the sex
earnings

differential is found for married persons. This is not

surprising given the huge increase in the labor supply of married

women during the decade. The female/male labor force ratio increased
32 percent from 1960 to 1970 for married persons. The increases
in

the ratio for never married and "other" were 6 percent and 10

percent respectively. The increase in labor force participation of
married

women

was particularly great among those under age 35, with

a noticeable effect on the sex earnings differential as shown in
Table

1. Of the six marital status—age classes only married persons

under 35 showed a relative decrease in female earnings. Indeed,
for the never married and "other" the increase was greater for those

under 35 than for those above that age.
When the comparisons are made by class of worker; we find that

in

government, where female earnings have been relatively highest, there

was actually a small decrease in the earnings ratio between 1959 and

1969.
was

is

Further disaggregation by age reveals that this decrease

concentrated in the over 35 category. One possible explanation
that this is the result of the strong relation

and seniority

between earnings

in government employment. Older women who entered

government' during the decade had less seniority than men of comparable

age and

therefore

lower earnings. At younger ages seniority in govern-

ment would be more comparable between the sexes, and

in

the private

sector earnings are not so rigidly determined by seniority at any

age.

—14—

One variable that highlights the effects of role differentiation
on female earning power is employment status 5 years prior to the

Census. Of the white males 25 and over who were employed in 1970 and
in 1969 only 6 percent were not at work in 1965. The comparable

figure for white females was 24 percent, Zmong married white
females age 25—44 more than 36 percent were not at work five

years earlier. The comparable figure for males is 8 percent.
These differences are noteworthy because there is a very large differential in hourly earnings, about 18 percent, between employed
persons who were at work 5 years earlier and those of comparable
sex, color, age arid schooling who were not. For white females in
government this differential is almost 24 percent:

This preliminary reading of part of the evidence on recent
changes does not constitute a rigorous test of a theory of female

wage determination, but I think one conclusion is warranted. If,
during a period of rapid increase in supply, female earnings were
more than able to hold their own and for some groups show significant
gains, the long-run prospects for women must be viewed as favorable.
In the decades

ahead female labor force participation is

likely

to continue approaching the male rate, and at

growth

in the female/male employment ratio will taper off as shown

—15—

career-minded while attending school, choosing an occupation, and

investing in themselves after they leave school. Employer expectations
concerning continuity will also change with important implications
for job and training opportunities.

The women who entered the labor force in large numbers in
the 1960's did not have much labor market experience by 1969.

After the transition, however, the average work experience of employed

women will increase. Moreover, when female labor force participation
rates stabilize at a high level) new entrants will consist primarily

of young women who will have been less exposed to role differentiation

at home and in school than those now in tha labor force. The increasing acceptance of women in a variety of occupations, the narrowing
of sex differences in experience arid post—school investment, and

a continued shift away from heavy manual jobs all augur well for
female earnings.
