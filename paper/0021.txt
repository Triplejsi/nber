Introduction

Over the past century fertility behavior in the United States

has undergone profound changes. Measured by cohort fertility the
average number of children per married woman has declined from about

55 children at the time of the Civil War to 2.4 children at the time

of the Great Depression. it is seldom emphasized however that an even
greater relative change took place in the dispersion of fertility a—

children declined from 36% to under 6%,1

fertility over time, they have not succeeded in explaining the fluctuations

and have made

over time. In this paper we attempt to study contraception behavior
and its effects on fertility. One of the effects

on which we focus

considerab]e attention is the dispersion or variance in fertility.
Our analysis is applied to cross—sectional data but it also provides

an explanation for the decline in the variance of fertility over time.

Commission on Population Growth and the American Future (see Taeuber
1972). They are indicated below in Table I—i.

The study of fertility behavior has received increasing attention by economists in the past few years. Much of this analysis has
been conducted in the context of the new theory of consumer behavior

pioneered by Becker (1965) and Lancaster (1966). The work on fertility behavior complements many other studies dealing with aspects of

household production. One of the specific topics in the fertility
literature has been the relationship between child bearing and several
life cycle production decisions such as marriage, schooling, women's
career choices, life cycle time and money allocations and so forth.

A second and related topic of the economics of fertility behavior is
the tradeoff in household production between the family's number of
children and the expenditure of resources per child, particularly the

expenditure of time devoted to children at the pre—school age. A
third focus of this research has been the fertility demand function——
the form and stability over time and across groups of the household's
demand function for children.2

Nearly all of these studies of household fertility behavior assume that the household can produce exactly the number of children

it wants, costlessly and with certainty. We have previously pointed
out that costly fertility control operates as a subsidy to child bearing,

2For a thorough model of fertility demand and the quantity—
quality trade—off s in the context of a static framework see Willis
(1973). For an extensive set of papers pertaining to topics in fertility behavior see the two NBER conference volumes New Economic
Approaches to Fertility and Marriage, Family Human Capital and
tility, Schultz (ed.) (1973) and (1974). These volumes indicate, we
think, that much of observed fertility behavior is amenable to eco—
nomic analysis.

lowerimg the marginal cost of having

additional children (see Willis

1971) and we have suggested a framework

for analyzing the household's

fertility control decisions (see MIchael 1973). In this paper we consider the household's fertility control behavior both in terms of the
selection of specific fertility control strategies (the costs and benefits of specific contraceptive

techniques) and in terms of the effects

of different control strategies on household fertility.
One

model of fertility behavior by treating these costs as transaction
costs associated with acquiring any given level of fertility. In this
framework, the household can select any number of children with certainty provided it pays the requisite costs of fertility control. As—
sinning that total fertility control costs are larger the smaller the

number of children chosen, the

positive marginal cost of fertility con-

trol raises average fertility by acting as a subsidy to childbearing.
In this paper, we have treated the

costs of fertility control in a

somewhat different framework. We have adopted a model in which the
household can select with certainty

of conception,3 but in which the household's actual fertility, N, is a

stochastic variable. By selecting and producing a particular monthly

expenditures over time. So uncertainty about the number of children,
and about the timing or spacing of children, can be expected to affect

the composition and timing of consumer expenditure and savings

behavior.

Third, because of important interactions with other house-

hold production and with the relative value of family member's time,
uncertainty about the number of children may have effects on the parents'

occupation choices, schooling decisions and general orientation toward
market and household activities.

At the aggregate level, positive fertility control costs and the
stochastic nature of fertility behavior affect the observed mean and

variance of fertility. The size and growth rate of the population
affect the age distribution of the population and the rate of growth

and the composition of the economy's output.5 The variance in fertility, on the other hand, influences the distribution of income and of

wealth. If uncertainty about fertility outcomes affects household
investment and savings decisions, it may have an important influence on
the distribution of inherited wealth across generations.

and economic progress. See Kuznets (1960) and other essays in Demo—

II The Analytical Framework

The theory of the choice of a fertility control strategy treats
the fertility goals of the household as given, wbile the economic theory

of fertility demand focuses on the factors which determine thesegoals.
If fertility control Is costly, however, these costs as well as the resource costs of bearing and rearing children influence the couple's

choice of fertility goals. The link between the theory of the choice
of birth control technique and the theory of fertility behavior is

provided by assuming that the household maximizes its lifetime utility
subject to the constraint of a fertility control cost function as

well as the conventional economic resource constraint. The fertility
control cost function is simply the combination (the envelope) of
least—cost birth control strategies for all possible fertility outcomes.
In this section we describe a stochastic model of reproduction,

emphasizing the relationship between the mean and

variance

of fertility

outcomes. We then discuss the economic benefits and costs of fertility
control and conclude with an exposition of the optimal fertility control

The number of children born to a couple and the pace at which

In the past two decades, the

greatly clarified and given rigorous expression in stochastic models
of the reproductive

process by Henry, Potter, Perrin and Sheps, and

others. The basic reasoning

underlying these models and their main

implications for average fertility were recently summarized by Key—
fitz (1971).

These models suggest that the number of children a woman

In this section we draw heavily on this literature in order to

mean and variance of live births as a function of two sets of para-

meters, one representing the coupl&s biological characteristics and
the other Its fertility control

strategy.

The simple observation that it takes a random amount of time to

produce a baby provides the point of departure for recent biological

models of fertility. Suppose that a woman faces a probability p'of

The number of children the woman bears during a lifetime, say
a reproductive span of T months, depends on the number of reproductive cycles completed during this period. Since each cycle is
of random length, the woman's fertility will also be a random vari-

able. The probability distribution of the number of births can be
represented in a simple way if the model of reproduction is repre-

sented as a Markov renewal process. In order to qualify as a renewal process, the intervals between successive births must behave
as independent, identically distributed random variables (Potter, 1970).
To meet these qualifications, it is necessary to assume that all of
the parameters of the reproductive process (i.e., p and s) are constant over time and that the reproductive

period, T, is sufficiently

long (i.e., infinity). Assuming reproduction to be a renewal process, the distribution of the number of births N is

8See Sheps and Perrin (1966) who warn that the asymptotic
normal distribution above does not adequately approximate the
exact probability of N for the relevant (finite) range of T. In
another paper Perrin and Sheps (1964) suggest more accurate approximate expressions for the first two moments of N. Since the
qualitative implications of these approximations are quite similar to those of the more exact approximations, it does not seem
necessary to encumber the discussion with more complicated expressions for mean and variance. A more serfous problem is sug-

gested by Jam (1968) who fund that the actual mean of natural
fertility tends to fail progressively below the theoretical. mean,.

Equations (1) and (2) provide a useful way of suimnarizing the

insights provided by mathematical demography into the determinants

of a woman's fertility behavior. Her mean fertility varies in direct proportion with the length of her reproductive span, T, and in
inverse proportion with the expected lengLi1 of her reproductive cy-

cle. The variance of her fertility outcome depends upon these same
two factors and also upon the variance in the length of her repro-

ductive cycle. The three variables which determine both the mean
fertility N and the variance of fertility a2N in this framework are
the length of the reproductive span T, the monthly probability of
conception p, and the length of the sterile period s following con-

ception. Given T, p and s, the mean and variance are jointly determined. Treating T and s as parameters, the mean and variance of
N are related, at all values of p, as

Consider, next, thedeterininantsof the monthly probability of

which is defined as the

probability of conception from a single unprotected act of coition

which is assumed to

be one month in length). In the absence of conception the probability

Variations across couples in the monthly probability of conception p may result from variations in fecundity—-which affect '$-— or

from variations in coital frequency. Variations may also result from
contraception. If the adoption of a particular contraceptive strategy

So the couple's actual monthly probability of conception p1 Is determined by Its fecundity, coltal frequency and contraceptive practice.
As we emphasized above, to qualify as a Markov renewal process
of reproduction the monthly probability p1 is assumed to be constant

Intrinsic fecundability is discussed In the demographic literature, which contains an empirical justification for expressing p as
approximately proportional to c over the relevant range of variation
in monthly frequency of coition.

in equation 3. Curve A assumes T—240 months ( a reproductive span

uncertainty about the number of its births by its selection of a

contraceptive strategy."
Both the contraceptive technique used and the care with which

it is used can affect e1 which in turn determines p1. In general,
the couple can also affect p1 by altering its frequency of coition,
c, and can also affect the distribution of fertility outcomes for
any given p1 by altering the length of the reproductive period at
risk, T, through decisions about the age at marriage and the age at

which

control strategies includes considerations other than the choice of
contraceptive method, but it is the contraceptive choice on which

"In reality, it is plausible to suppose that the frequency of
coition and contraceptive efficiency will tend to vary over time to
accommodate a couple's preferences for childspacing as well as for
total number of births, or to accommodate any changes in their fertility goals.
It is also plausible to suppose that the choices of c and e1
will be conditioned on past pregnancy and birth outcomes. Thus, in
general, the values of p in a given month will tend to be a function
of time (i.e., age), past reproductive history (I.e., parity) and
random fluctuations in variables that detemnine fertility goals.

.

Unfortunately, the analytical simplicity of considering the
stochastic model of reproduction as a renewal process is lost under
these conditions. While it is possible to write out probability statements in which a couple's contraceptive strategy (i.e., its choices of
c and e) is defined conditional on all possible fertility outcomes at
each period of time, it is not possible to derive the implications of
the resulting stochastic process for completed fertility outcomes using
analytic methods. Moreover, the dynamic optimization problem involved
in selecting a contraceptive strategy that maximizes a couple's expected
utility under conditions of uncertainty may itself be analytically intractable. At this stage, it appears wiser to minimize the formal dif—

'3The estimates of contraceptive efficiency were compiled by
Michael (1973) from the demographic literature ( see especially Tietze
(1959) and (1962) ). See Michael (1973) for a discussion of the difficulties In estimating and the hazards in using this comparative
list of the efficiency of contraceptive methods. In particular, note
that these values represent average observed use—effectiveness and
will in general be affected by the intensity and care with which they
are used.

bility of conception, which yields a particular distribution of fertility outcomes summarized by the distribution's mean and variance.
So long as we assume that the couple selects one value for p
and retains that particular

monthly probability of conception for

all the fertile months in the 20 year span——an assumption we will

characterize as a "pure"

strategy model—-. the couple cannot alter its

expected fertility UN without also altering the variance a. In short,
the pure strategy model restricts the couple to the biological constraint (Curve A in figure lI—i if T=240, s=17). Before we relax the

assumption of the pure strategy we discuss the determinants of the
couple's choice of Its most preferred position along the biological

constraint. We consider in turn the benefits and the costs of fertility
control.

ii Benefits of fertility_control
Recent economic theories of household behavior postulate the existence of several constraints (e.g., a money income constraint, a time
constraint, production function limitations) on the household's maxi-

mization of utility. The utility is derived from a broad set of desiderata which are produced by the household itself In the nonmarket
sector, using purchased market goods and services and the household

members' own time as the inputs in the production.'4 These production functions emphasize the distinction between the household's

wants (the output) and the means used to satisfy these wants (the
goods and time inputs).

I

Willis (1973) recently utilized the household production frame-

work to formulate an economic model of hutn fertility control. We
will generalize a simple version of Willis' model to deal with im-

perfect and costly fertility control. The formal analysis is conducted in a static lifetime framework, although we informally suggest how the implications of the model might be altered in a more
15

dynamic or sequential decision making framework.

In Willis' model it is assumed that the satidfaction parents
receive from each of their N children is represented by Q1, Q2
and the satisfaction from other sources of enjoyment is represented

by S. The Q1, or "quality" of each child, and the other composite
commodity S are produced within and by the houshold using the family
members' time and purchased market goods as inputs. The household
production functions characterize the relationship between inputs of time and

goods and the outputs of Q and S. Assuming (among other things) that

See Becker (1965) and Lancaster (1966) for early statements of
this model. Several monographs and articles in recent years, notably
through NBER, have utilized this framework. For a recent brief survey

parents

treat all their children alike, the total amount of child—

services C may be written as a product of quality per child Q and
the number of children N: C = NQ.

It is assumed that Q Is positively

related to the amount of time and market goods devoted to each

child——Q Is perhaps best considered an Index of the child's human

capital. The household's preferences for number and quality of
children and for all other forms of satisfaction are summarized
by its lifetime utility function
U

U(N, Q, S).

The household's capacity

to produce

(4)

C and S Is limited by its

lifetime real income and by the quantity of its nonmarket time. Willis
(1973) discusses in detail the relationship between the relative prices

of N and Q, and considers how various changes in the household's characteristics and circumstances would be expected to affect its demand
for N, Q and S.

One important implication of the economic model of fertility

demand should be noted. From an assumption that children are relatively
time—Intensive in the wife's time (i.e. C—production requires more of
the wife's time per dollar of goods—input than does S-production), the
relative cost of C rises as the wife's wage rate rises. Hence the
cost of both number of children N and quality of children Q also rises

with the wife's wage rate. If the relative price of N rises with the
wife's wage rate, then abstracting from the change in income, women with
higher wages (or higher levels of education) are expected to have lower

fertility. This is the basis of the1'ost of tlme"hypothesls (Ben—Porath,

.

1973) which has, since Mincer's pioneering paper (Mincer, 1963), received much attention as an explanation for the observed negative
relationship between the wife's wage and her fertility.
The household's lifetime money income constraint, its time
contraint and its production function constraints can be treated
as a single constraint on the household's lifetime full real income, I.
Defining the marginal costs of childservices

and the composite

other commodity ir, the formal optimization problem characterizing
the household's choice is the maximization of the utility function
(equation 4) subject to the full real income constraint.

max

UT (N, Q, S) — x[i— q,(ir,,rJ

}

(5)

where A is the Lagrangean multiplier. This optimization problem
assumes that the household can costlessly and with certainty select

any number of children (N) it wishes and can achieve any given level
of the child's human capital (Q) it chooses.

To relax this assumption, we consider the benefits to the house-

hold of achieving any given number of children. Suppose the household
had the utility function and the full real income constraint indicated
in equation 5 but that the household was endowed with some arbitrary

number of children N' where N' —

0, 1, ,.. (To

simplify the mathema-

tics N' will be treated as a continuous variable.) Given its arbitrary N', the household's only remaining choices would be the optimal
values of child quality, Q, and other satisfaction, S, which must be

chosen subject to the lifetime full real income constraint. If N and

.

Q as well as N and S are substitutes in terms of the parents' preferences,

-- h.L —

the levels of both Q and S will tend to fall as N' is increased. This

.

azalysis implies that sub—optimal values of Q and S would be chosen
if fertility were arbitrarily constrained.

Q and S would tend to be

larger than (or smaller than) the optimal values, Q* and S*, as the
arbitrarily constrained level of fertility, N', is smaller (or larger)
than the freely chosen desired level of fertility, N*. 16

This hypothetical experiment of assigning some arbitrary N to
the household is equivalent to maximizing equation 5 while treating
N as a parameter, for all possible values of N, Such an exercise
yields the household's net utility level as a function of its assigned

level of fertility N' and the economic variables. Written as an implicit function the net utility, V, is
V

V(N; I,

(6)

For each arbitrarily assigned value of N' there is a maximum

achievable level of utility, obtained by the appropriate mix of Q and

S. By definition, the maximum

value

of V, indicated as V*, will be

achieved at the desired level of N (N* =

N'),

as depicted on Curve A

in Figure 11—2.

16

It should be noted that we are implicitly assuming that the
couple knows In advance what number of children it will have and
can plan accordingly for its level of child quality and S.

Deviations of fertility from N* in either direction, such as N1 or

of figure 11—2. Given the emphasis in discussions of family planning on the problem of excess fertility and unwanted births (i.e. N)N*),
it is worth stressing that deficit fertility (i.e. N<N*) may reduce
welfare by at least as mucit as excess fertility.'7

As indicated above, in the case of deficit fertility quality

tility which accrue from moving nearer the

optimal allocation of re-

sources which would exist if fertility control were perfect and cost—

less (i.e., N*, * and S*).
We suggest above that the choice of particular values of fertility control parameters such as ei yield particular ex ante distri-

butions of fertility summarized by

1N and a. We can, therefore,

formulate the discussion of the benefits of fertility control in terms
of

induced reduction in mean fertility represents the adjustment to

the variance associated with N*. This is indicated by Curve B in figure

11—2.

By subtracting an amount proportional to N from Curve A, Curve B

peaks at a level of N below N*.
So far, we have shown that imperfect fertility control implies that

a couple's actual fertility N is a stochastic variable. The couple, by
its choice of a contraceptive strategy, acquires some distribution of
expected fertility outcomes, and by the nature of the biological process
involved, the higher the mean of the distribution the greater its variance
(up to at least N
the

uncertainty about the actual fertility, or the greater the expected de—

viation between the mean and the actual fertility. Since deviations from

expected fertility, N' are associated with greater uncertainty, the
household is induced to reduce its optimal expected

fertility u be-

low its desired fertility N* in order to reduce the uncertainty or

variance a.

iii Costs of fertility control

The costs of fertility control are the amounts of other desir—

ables forgone in achieving the control. These costs include money
costs but also include forgone time, sexual pleasure, religious prin-

ciples, health, and so forth. It is, at best, difficult to measure
these costs empirically. We will Instead discuss some of the determinants of these costs and seek to derive testable hypotheses about
the relationship between observed fertility and contraceptive behavior.

By definition, couples which avoid all the costs of fertility
control have an expected level of fertility p, which is frequently

referred to as natural fertility. 19 We will assume that costly fertility control strategies are limited to two dimensions: (1) the choice
of contraceptive technique (including regulation of coital frequency) and

'9See the discussion of natural fertility in an earlier section.
Throughout section II of this paper we continue to assume that the
couple's fertility control strategy is determined at the outset of the
period—at—risk of conception and remains constant throughout the re—
productive span. uNaturalt fertility results when the age at marriage
(which affects T) and the rate of coition, c, are determined without
regard to effects on fertility.

.

(2) the care or intensity with which a given technique is used (i.e.
we assume that the contraceptive efficiency, e1, of the 1th technique
is a variable which may be increased at increased cost to the couple).20
In this section we also restrict the choice of contraception strate-

gies to "pure" strategies. Thus each strategy yields a different monthly
probability of conception and hence a different point on the mean—variance
curve (say, Curve A) in figure lI—i.

Associated with each contraceptive strategy is an opportunity
cost measured by the utility loss associated with the change in behavior

required to implement that strategy. Some strategies cost money, some
coat sexual satisfaction, some cost real or imagined decreases in phy-

sical health. The assumption of utility maximizing behavior implies that
couples will choose the least costly strategy they are aware of in order

to achieve any give level of p which yieUs TMN and its associated cy.

20
Thus we rule out for now abortion and sterilization and we
assume age at marriage to be exogenous. To emphasize this restriction
we will use the term "contraception" in place of "fertility control"
in discussing costs, strategies, etc. For a study of abortion as a
means of fertility control see Potter (1972) or Keyfitz (1971) or for
an economic analysis see a study in progress by Kramer (1973).

It is important to stress that the classification of the contraception costs F1 of a given technique as fixed (o<.) or variable

is distinct from the classification of costs by their source. An eco—

physiological (e.g. health) cost may he either fixed or variable.

Some factors, however, are more likely to affect1 thanB1 or
vice versa. Lack of contraceptive knowledge, for instance, is often
cited as a reason for imperfect control. To the extent this is true,
it is sensible to suppose that the acquisition of Information about

fertility control methods is costly. A characteristic of the cost of
information is that it does not depend on the amount of use to which

the information is put. It follows that the oosts of information tend

Each contraceptive strategy involves both the adoption of a con—
traceptive technique and the care and precision In its use. The adop—
tion of technique 1 and its careless use results in less efficient
contraception, a lower e1, higher p1 and fewer births averted. Nearly
all contraceptive techniques are capable of achieving a low e1 with
careless use or a high e1 with proficient use.

case
The loss of sexual pleasure occasioned by contraception almost
surely affects only the marginal costs of contraception and not the

fixed costs. Thus, the number of births averted by condoms depends
on how frequently and with what care condoms are used. The most ancient
contraceptive techniques——abstinence or educed coital frequency, and
withdrawal——probably have zero fixed cost and

marginal

rather high (psychological)

costs. By way of example, consider the choice between re-

duced coital frequency or withdrawal as alternative contraceptive
techniques.

23
This argument should be qualified to the extent that information
is acquired by a process of "learning by doing" or that information deteriorates with d1susey a process of forgetting. In this case, the
marginal cost of the i
technique ($.) would tend to shift downward
as the volume of use increases. Analytically, the learning hypothesis
and the once—and—for—all hypothesis have the same implication, namely,
that the average contraception cost per birth averted decreases as B
increases.
24
The cost to an individual Catholic of violating the Church's
precepts may also be a function of the behavior of other Catholics or
of other members of the society at large. Thus, the dynamics of diffusion of the pill use among Catholics might be interpreted , in part,
as he progressive lowering in the cost of contraception to each mdi—
vidual Catholic as he or she sees others using the pill. Of course, the
equivocation within the Church itself also presumably lowers the costs
of using forbidden techniques (see Ryder and Westoff, 1971, chapter 8
for evidence on the effect of the Papal Encyclical on the contraceptive
behavior of Catholics.).

The

more persistently either technique is used, the smaller will he the

Uhich technique is least

costly depends solely on which technique has the lower marginal cost.
If the marginal cost of reduced coital frequency exceeds the marginal
cost of withdrawal, for example, the couple would not use the former
technique whatever its desired number of averted births (note that
we are limiting the choice at this point to pure strategies).
It is not always the case that one technique dominates all

others for all possible fertility goals. Suppose, for example, that

at each possible level of expected fertility (reading the lower hori-

cost of using condoms to achieve each possible outcome.
To avert fewer than seven births (i.e. to have five or more
children), the least cost strategy in figure 11—3 is withdrawal. How—

births to be averted rises, at some point (e.g. seven in the example
illustrated in the figure) it becomes cheaper to incur the fixed costs
or make the investment in an alternative technique——to switch to the
technique with the lower marginal cost.

Additional contraceptive techniques with still higher fixed costs
and lower marginal costs may have lower average cost at higher numbers

of averted births. The total cost function F (equation 12) is defined
as the collection of line segments which represent the least—cost method

.

— 32 —

of

achieving each number of averted births. It is the envelope of

segments of the F1 curves in figure 11—3. The limiting case would be
a contraceptive with zero, marginal cost (i.e. method i=4 in the figure).
A relatively low, marginal cost appears to be a major advantage of modern

contraceptive methods such as the pill aed IUD. If line F represents
such a technique in figure 11—3, note that it represents the optimal
contraceptive choice only if the couple wishes to have fewer than one

child (as the figure happens to be drawn). That is, only couples wishing
to avert nearly all potential births would select that high fixed cost,
zero marginal cost technique.

iv. jimal fertility control strategy
The preceding sections have discussed the separate elements
in the determination of an optimal fertility control strategy. Using
the simplifying assumption that a household must follow a pure strategy (i.e. must choose a constant value of p for the entire reproductive span), we derived a biological constraint on fertility choices
illustratcd by the mean—variance curve in figure Il—i.

Next, we derived the expected utility of the household as a

function of the mean and variance of fertility outcomes. This relationship Is depicted in figure 11—2. The fertility level with the
highest net value, N*, under conditions of certainty (i.e.ci

0)

and costless contrapeption is defined as the couple's "desired fer-

tility". If, however, the couple is constrained to choose points on

the mean-variance curve in figure. TI—i

(but may choose any point with—

out incurring any fertility control cost), the decrease in uncertainty
associated with decreases in expected fertility makes it optimal to
choose a level of expected fertility u that is somewhat lower than
its desired fertility, N*.

Finally, we introduced the (utility) costs of controlling fertility

by means of specific contraceptive techniques. We derived a fertility
control cost function as the envelope of least—cost segments of the cost
curves of the individual techniques which is shown in figure 11—3.
Holding the couple's expected natural fertility, p, constant, its total
cost of fertility control, F, is larger, the smaller the level of its
expected fertility, 11N•

The selection of the couple's optimal fertility control strategy

1nvolves two steps. First, for any given choice of UN and, jointly,
the couple selects the least costly contraception technique—— say
the ith technique—with total cost

Second, it

selects a level of UN (and a) such that total expected utility (i.e.,

Equation 1.6 summarizes the influence on fertility outcomes of
imperfect and costly fertility control. If the couple could select
any level of fertility costlessly and with certainty, it would select

N*, its "desired fertility" determined by its tastes, economic circum-

stances and so forth. Since fertility outcomes involve an element of
uncertainty (i.e. result from a stochastic Dror'ess), there is a variance
associated with each level of fertilii-y, and since this uncertainty

lowers the expected benefits or utility from each level of N, this uncertainty induces the couple to prefer an expected level of fertility
lower than N*

= N* —

). Furthermore

since it is costly to

avert births, the costs of fertility control further modify the optimal
fertility outcome, raising the optimal above the level ii

=

+ k).

In effect, 8 is a per unit subsidy to child hearing because a couple
may reduce its contraceptive cost by

with every additional birth it

has.

The relationship between these various levels of fertility can be

indicated by coibining figures 11—2 and 11—3 (see figure 11—4). Utility

would be maximized at a level of N N* if the costs of fertility control
were zero and the uncertainty about fertility outcomes were ignored (e.g.
the maximum of the net benefit function A is at a level of N =

N*).

The

presence of uncertainty modifies the optimum by raising the peak of the
net benefit function (function B) to the level N =

.

The presence of

fertility control costs further modifies the optimum by lowering the pre—

ferred N to N' the intersection of the marginal cost of fertility control
and the marginal benefit from fertility control.

III Pure and Mixed Contraceptive Strategies
In the previous section we restricted the discussion of contraceptive strategies to a "pure" strategy defined as one in which the
couple selects some specific contraceptive technique and uses it with

some specific amount of care throughout th reproductive span of T
months. The pure strategy model, in which the couple uses one tech—
nique continuously implies a constant monthly probability of conception

p over the fertile months in the reproductive span. This implication
is essential for the Markov renewal process on which are based the
equations for the mean and varlaftee of fertility outcomes (equations

1 and 2) and the mean—variance curves depicted in figure Il—i. So the
pure strategy model lends itself to a simple analytical structure and
represents a boundary on the relationship between mean and variance of

fertility. As we have noted, this Markov renewal model also underlies
much of the important analytical work done in the past decade in mathematical demography.

However, it is evident that in reality a couple is not restricted
from altering its contraceptive technique over the reproductive span.
Even in the context of a lifetime strategy which could be mapped out
initially and carried out over time, a couple might choose to use different contraceptive techniques (including no contraception) in various

segments of that span of time. Furthermore, since the discussion of the
benefits of fertility control emphasized that under fairly general con—
ditions couples prefer to reduce the variance in their expected fertility,

.

— 36 —

it

is economically sensible as well as technically feasible for couples

to select a mixed contraceptive strategy which may result in a lower
2

aN for any level of expected fertility 1.1

For example, if a couple used the oral contraceptive at its
average observed use—effectiveness throughout its twenty year reproductive span, Table 11—1 indicates that the distribution of its
expected fertility has a mean of 0.19 births and a variance of 0.18

(point a on the mean—variance curve in figure 11—i). If this couple
wished to have about three children, it could use a less effective
technique or use the pill somewhat carelessly, thereby achieving a
monthly probability of conception of 0.0182 which over a twenty year

span would yield an expected fertility of 3.4 and a variance of 199
(point c on the mean—variance curve in figure lI—i). The couple could
also achieve a mean fertility of 3.4 however by combining periods of

25

The economic rationale,offered in Section II, for prefering a
reduced variance in fertility was that any deviation in actual fertility
from the desired level of fertility implies a reduction in utility. The
greater the variance a2 the greater the likelihood that the discrepancy
between actuá3. and desred fertility will be relatively large.
There is an additional economic reason for generally preferring a
lower variance In the distribution of expected outcomes, risk preference
aside. The more certain the couple is about the number of children it
will eventually have, the more efficiently it can optimize on the allo—
cation of its resources. The couple which is more certain about the timing
and number of its children can more efficiently plan its savings pattern,

its rate of output is constant over the long run than if its rate of output varies significantly from season to season or from year to year.

result would be a mean of 3.4 children and a variance

considerably

below that indicated by point c on the mean—variance curve. Indeed the
variance would be no greater than that indicated by point f, the variance

associated with the use of no contractf on over the entire twenty year

time span.

Furthermore, the pure strategy implies that the births will arrive
at random intervals over the twenty year span, while the mixed strategy
permits the couple to achieve the same number of children with considerable

control over their spacing.
By combining the use of a highly effective

26
The logical extreme would be a mixed strategy in which natural
fertility (no contraception)ls pursued in those segments of the reproductive span in which a birth is desired and perfect contraception (i.e.
0) at all other times. This strategy would enable a normally fecund
e1
couple to achieve any given number of children fewer than,say, five with
virtual certainty and would also enable them to approximate many plausible
desired spacing patterns fairly closely (see Potter and Sakoda, 1967).
Such a strategy is not only a logical possibility, but it is also
technically feasible since the monthly probability may be set to zeroát any
time by reducing coital frequency to zero. The fact that couples do not
appear to follow this "perfect contraception" strategy suggests that the
problem of fertility control is not a matter of technical feasibility.
The biological constraint on fertility choices must be considered simultaneously with other constraints on behavior, with fertility goals viewed
as competing with other family goals.

The mean—variance curve in figure li—i represents the biological
constraint on the distribution of expected fertility when a particular
monthly birth probability persists for the entire span of T months. By
using a mixed strategy, combining contraception with periods of no contraception, the biological constraint Is no longer an effective constraint—the couple can move off the mean—variance curve toward the horizontal

mixed strategy is more likely to be used the greater is the efficiency of
the contraceptive technique chosen.
In this discussion of mixed strategies of contraception we have
focused upon one particular type of mixed strategy—— that of going on

and going off one contraceptive technique. Although shifting from
contraceptive technique to technique is arther possibility, the theoretical discussion of the costs of contraception suggested that this would

not be the case. The fixed costs associated with the adoption of modern
techniques would inhibit technique switching. Consistent with the model's
implication, evidence from the 1965 National Fertility Survey suggests
that technique uwitching has not been a prevalent practice in the U.S.

in the past two decades. Ranking contraceptive methods by their mean
monthly probability of conception (as indicated in Table Il—i) and limiting
the subsample to women who had used some contraception in each of their
first three birth intervals, Nichael (1973) found that the correlation
among techniques used across the three pregnancy intervals was quite
high (ranging from 0.57 to 0.97) for non—Catholic women partitioned by
color and age cohort?9 Ryder and Westoff (1971) study the relationship

Evidence of consistency of use across intervals is Indicated by the
following rather remarkable statistic: of women who used a contraceptive
"sJ1ccessfufly" in the first three
pregnancy intervals, 20% experIenced
contraceptive "failure" in the fourth
pregnancy Interval, while of those
who had experienced a
contraceptive "failure" in each of the first three
intervals, 77% experienced a "failure" again in their fourth interval
(see Ryder and Westoff for definitions of success and failure).
This statistic and others
support quite strongly, we think, the
contention that couples act as If they adopt a lifetime strategy toward
contraception and that that strategy involves
considerable continuity
in the use of a technique
throughout a lifetime. (The Princeton Study
begun in 1957 also suggested that
across—interval changes in fertility
control are "clearly not a matter of couples shifting from ineffective
to effective methods " of
contraception. See Westoff, Potter and Sagi
1963 (pp. 232—235).)

IV

Contraception and Fertility Outcomes
In the model described in Section II the household's number of

children, N, is a random variable. The household adopts a contraceptive
strategy which yields a particular value of p, the monthly probability

of conception. Given p as a known and fixed parameter, the household has
an ex ante distribution of fertility characterized by a mean

and

variance

The discussion has focused on the

ante distribution of fer-

tility outcomes for a single household, but in our empirical analysis
we focus on the corresponding distribution for relatively hoinogenous groups

of households. It is assumed that the observed mean and variance in births
among households with relatively homogeneous demographic—economic characteristics reflect the mean and variance of the distribution of fertility

outcomes faced by each of the households in that group. Recall that
the equation for the variance in number of children (equation 2) assumed
that the unprotected monthly probability of conception and the length
of the period of infertility were constant over the couple's reproductive

lifetime. To apply the model across households implies not only constancy
of these parameters over time for a given household, but also constancy

across households. Heckman and Willis (1973) deal explicitly with the
problem of estimating the average monthly probability p in heterogeneous

groups of households. For our purposes, we will not pursue this issue'
31Consider two populations of fecund, non—pregnant women with identical
mean monthly probabilities of conception, . One population is homogeneous
in the sense that p is identical for all members of the population and the
other is heterogeneous in the sense that p varies across women according to
some distribution with positive variance. It is known that the mean waiting
longer and the
time to conception in the heterogeneous population will be
average birth rate lower than in the homogeneous population, and that this
difference is a function of the distribution of p in the heterogeneous population (see, for example, Sheps, 1964).

— tL. —

The model in Section II was set cut in a lifetime context and
considered fertility control in terms of a lifetime strategy. Accordingly,

.

in our empirical work we frequently use information about contraceptive

behavior at one point in the couple's marriage as an indication or index

of the &ifetime contraceptive strategy. As we indicated in Section III
there is considerable evidence that contraceptive behavior is not characterized by switching from contraceptive technique to technique over the

lifetime. Consequently, in this section we will distinguish couples
either by the best contraceptive technique used lk the time interval
from marriage to their first pregnancy or by the best technique used at any
time In their_marriage. 32
32

In addition to the evidence cited above
regarding consistency
of technique use between pregnancy intervals, the
following table
indicates the percentage of users of a
contraceptive technique
in the first Interval who also used that
in the second
interval. The second column Indicates the percentage who used either
that same technique or no contraception in the

The table indicates, for example, that of those couples which used the
diaphragm in the first pregnancy interval, 77% also used the diaphragm
in the second pregnancy interval.
Furthermore, of that same group another
12% used no contraception in the second pregnancy interval thus a total
of 89% used either that same contraceptive method or no method in the
second Interval. (The second interval here is defined as either the period
of time from the first to the second pregnancy or from the first pregnaney
to the time of the survey if no second
pregnancy occured.)
Since these data were collected by interview at the time these women
were 40—44 years of age and pertain to periods of time shortly after
marriage, there may be a tendency to give the same response for successive
intervals. If so, these percentages overstate the consistency of technique
selection across intervals.

Fertility Survey which was conducted by the Office of Population

Research at Princeton University. This cross—section survey of some

their spouse, contains information on the specific contraceptive
technique used in each pregnancy interval, as well as information

on the couple's actual fertility outcome. In this section we use
this data set to document the relationship between contraception use

and fertility outcomes. Since we are interested in studying the
variance in fertility we group the data into cells and study between—
cell differences in observed behavior.
In this section we explore how contraception behavior is related to the observed disttibution of fertility across groups of

households; we do not attempt to explain ! couples differ in their
desired fertility or in the dispersion of their fertility. Although
we indicated in Section II that the model is capable of treating contraception choice and fertility control choice in a simultaneous system
of equations, we do not attempt to estimate the parameters of those

and religion group which ever used a "good"35contraceptive technique.

The relationship between these percentages and the distributions of births

indicated in figure IV—1 is striking. Among white non—Catholics, the percentage of users of "good" contraceptive techniques rises significantly

with the wife's level of schooling, and this is also the group for which

schooling most clearly distinguishes the distributions of births. The
percentages rise less rapidly by education among the nonwhites, and for
these groups the frequency distributions of births are less clearly de-

lineated by education. Among Catholics neither the percentage of users
of good contraceptive techniques nor the frequency distribution of births

seems to be closely related to wife's education. Thus, in comparisons
among and within color and religion groups, there appears to be a quite con—
sistent relationship: groups characterized by a relatively high percentage of users of good contraception are also characterized by relatively
low dispersion In fertility.

Table TV—i summarizes this same relationship. The table indicates
for each education, color and religion group the percentage of couples

ever using "good" contraception and the actual mean and standard devia-

tion of live births. Groups characterized by a high percentage of users

35Throughout this section, "good" contraception is defined to include pill, IUD, condom and diaphragm. For older cohorts the best a—
vailable contraceptive methods were the condom and diaphragm while for
the younger cohorts the more reliable pill and IUD were also available.
Since we are attempting at this time to distinguish use of highly reliable from less reliable techniques, the distinction was arbitrarily
made as indicated. All contraceptive methods other than the pill, TUD,
condom and diaphragm are categorized as "poor" methods. The use of no
contraception is called "none" and is distinguished from the "poor"
methods.

The relationship between contraception behavior and fertility
outcomes indicated by Table IV-1 is somewhat circumstantial——groups of

households which had relatively high rates of use of good contraception
also had relatively low mean and variance in fertility. To relate contraception use to fertility outcomes more directly we partition the age, edii—
cation groups of white non—Catholics by their contraceptive strategies.
Table IV—2, for example, indicates the separate frequency distribution
of live births for users of good contraception and users of poor contraception in the first pregnancy interval by wife's age for women with 12

years of schooling. That is, in Table IV—2 two of the cells in Table TV—i

— 49 —

(defined by wife's education equal to 12 years for women age 35—44
and age 45—54) are partitioned by the contraceptive technique used
in the first birth interval.

* "good"

methods are defined to be pill, 11Th, condom and diaphragm;
"poor" methods include all other contraceptive methods excluding abstinence

For each of the two age groups the distribution of live births is considerably less dispersed among the users of good contraception than among
users of poor contraception (e.g. the percentage of households with five
or more live births was 10.3 and 3.0 among users of good contraception

while the percentages were 14.9 and 15.4 among users of poor contraception).
Notice, too, the large percentage of non—users in the first interval which

had zero live births. Presumably a relatively large fraction of the users

S

of no contraception knew themselves to be sterile or suhfecund. In the

—50—

.
terminology

of the model developed in Section II, couples with a rela-

tively low natural fecundity and a low expected fertility need avert
fewer births to achieve any given level of desired fertility. So these
couples have less incentive to use any contraception in general and
less incentive to adopt high fixed cost techniques in particular.

Table IV—3 also indicates the relationship between contraception

use and fertility outcomes. While Table IV—2 shows a frequency distribution of live births by contraception use for two of the cells of

white non—Catholic women from Table IV—1, Table IV—3 indicates the
mean and standard deviation of the live births by contraception use for

each of the 5 cells of white non—Catholic women age 35—44 from Table IV—1.
Compare the fertility behavior of the "good" and "poor" contra—

ceptors for some given level of schooling in Table IV—3. In terms of
mean fertility, couples which used a "good" contraceptive method pill,
IUD, condom or diaphragm) in the first birth interval had somewhat lower

mean fertility than couples which used relatively "poor" contraceptive

methods. As Panel B indicates, however, very few of the differences in
means are statistically significant. By contrast, the comparison of
differences in the standard deviation of the fertility outcomes does exhibit
statistical significance——the users of poor contraception have appre—
ciably higher variation in their fertility outcomes than do users of
good contraception.

36

36Note that in the tests of significance of the variances, the
few pairwise comparisons which were not significant involved the relatively small cells containing 40 or fewer observations.

The lack of a stronger association between
contraception use and
mean fertility in Table IV—3 is somewhat surprising.

However, recall

that equation 16 emphasized two opposing forces influencing optimal

mean fertility. The marginal costs of fertility control raised optimal
mean fertility (ik), although the positive relationship between the
mean and variance lowered optimal fertility (—K/2) as a mechanism for

reducing the uncertainty about the number of births. We showed that
couples wishing to avert more births would be induced to adopt better
(higher fixed cost, lower marginal cost) contraceptive techniques. We
also suggested that users of better techniques are more likely to use
a mixed strategy of contraception which implies a weaker relationship

between the mean and variance of fertility. So users of good contraception are expected to have lower marginal costs of fertility control
(

a lower

C

a lower K ).

)

and also a weaker relationship between mean and variance

Consequently, if wife's education

sorts couples

by their desired fertility in Table IV—3, the further partitioning by
good or poor contraception may not have a systematic effect on mean

fertility. The users of good contraception have lower marginal cost of
averting births, but less incentive to reduce mean fertility as a mechanism

for lowering the uncertainty or variance of fertility. As the relationships in Tables IV—1--—Table IV—3 indicate, across relatively homogeneous

S

—

S

groups there is a negative relationship between the use of good contraception and mean fertility, but within the homogenous groups,
the use of good contraception systematically affects only the variance of

fertility outcomes. Couples wishing

to

avert relatively more births have

greater incentives to use good contraception, and within a group homogenous with respect to their desired fertility, those who use good contraception achieve a lower variance of fertility.
Table IV—3 also indicates that there is a tendency for the more
educated women to have lower mean fertility and smaller variance of fer-

tility for each contraception category. The differences in the means do
not often exhibit statistical significance (see Panel B), but the differences in the gariances among users of good contraception are statistical-

ly significant, often at a= .01. The observed relationship between
and

across education groups for good and for poor contraception

users separately, mirror the observed relationship between

and

across good and poor contraception users holding education constant. This
observation is quite consistent with more educated couples being more
proficient users of each given contraceptive method——the partitioning of
the sample of women aged 35—44 by "good" and "poor' (holding education
constant) yields the same qualitative differences as the partitioning by
more and less education (holding contraception quality constant).

To obtain another measure of the relationship between contraception
choice, the wife's education, and fertility outcomes as indicated in
Table IV —

.

3, a multiple regression was run using the twelve education—

(assigned

the values 7, 10, 12, and 14 for the respective columns).

The regressions, weighted by the square root of the cell sizes, yielded:

N = 5.23 - 0.18(E )+

The wife's education has a significant negative effect on both the

mean and the standard deviation of the number of live births. Contraception use had no significant effect on the mean number of live

births, but users of poor contraception had a significantly lower
standard deviation in live births than users of no contraception, and
users of good contraception had a significantly lower standard deviation in live births than users of poor contraception.

the

Partitioning by marriage duration should more adequately
standardize
for the length of the period of time at risk of
conception. To standardize further for the incentives to avert births,
we have used a definition
of expected number of children
of live births on a set of

derivé,d by regressing the actual number

economic and demographic characteristics.38

We used this fertility demand
then grouped households into

The regression was estimated from the 1965 NFS for white non—
Catholic women aged 35 or above. The estimation yielded: N =

earnings function using husband's
education and market experience; ED

is a multiplicative interaction
term using ED and I; IB equals 1 if the
household lives in a rural area
or equals zero otherwise; MARD is the
duration of the current
marriage in years; and ACE is the wife's age.
39
This procedure partitions the group of households into cells on
the basis of the economic and
demographic chracterjstjcs which, on
average, are associated with one, two, three or four children. For our
purposes this procedure suffices, but it does not resolve the problem
of partitioning the household's
actual fertility into the "desired" and
the "unwanted" components.

to

be a positive association between mean fertility and the standard

deviation of fertility. Furthermore, as figure IV—3 indicates, the
positive relationship between

and GN appears to be strongest among

users of no contraception.4°

Since more educated women tend to marry at later ages, the total
length of time at risk of conception probably differs by education for

women of a given age. Table IV—3 partitions the sample by wife's age
and education; for comparison Table IV—5 partitions the sample by wife's
education and marriage duration for women married once and aged 35 and

above. Although the cell sizes in Table IV—5 are smaller and the results
somewhat more erratic, one again observes a tendency for users of good
contraception to have somewhat lower mean fertility and, more systematically,
lower variation in their fertility.

The demographic literature has emphasized a distinction between
wanted and "unwanted" fertility, and It is tempting to try to partition
actual fertility into these two components for separate analysis.41

40
•The figure plots only cells based on 20 or more observations..
Unfortunately the cell sizes for the users of poor contraception are
quite small, making generalizations difficult.

Ryder (1973) and Part IV "Unwanted Fertility" of Volume 1 of the Commission
on Population Growth (1972), particularly the essay by Ryder and Westoff (1972).

The difficulty, of course, is in obtaining an estimate of wanted births
distinct from the household's actual fertility. The problem is not sim—
ply one of estimation. Viewed in the rontext of the stochastic model described above, it is not possible even in principle to designate each pregnancy as !desiredIl or undesired. Also, we have emphasized that the house-

hold's optimal number of children Is affected by fertility control costs
(i.e.

In equation 16) and the relation between mean and variance of

fertility (i.e. —K/2). So the definition of "desired" fertility depends
critically upon what is assumed about fertility control costs, the

van—

ance in actual fertility, etc. 42

Recognizing these limitations, we nevertheless attempted to consider
"unwanted" fertility since the NFS data set contains retrospective infor—
mation on the couple's fertility, goals prior to each pregnancy. By summing

up the number of pregnancies "wanted" and subtracting this number
from the total number of live births, we obtained an estimate of the

number of births "unwanted" in each household. Panel B of Table IV-5
indicates the mean number of "unwanted" births by marriage duration,

wife's education, and contraceptive method used in the first pregnancy

interval. There appears to be a relativeiy strong negative relation

43

The NFS data contain retrospective information about the contraceptive behavior and the husband's and wife's attitudes about another
pregnancy prior to each of the wife's pregnancies. Following Ryder
"wanted" or
and Westoff (1971) we considered each live birth as
"unwanted" on the basis of the behavioral and attitudinal circumstances
prior to that pregnancy. The birth was considered "wanted" if any of
the following three conditions was met: (1) The birth was "wanted"
if the couple had used no contraception in the interval prior to that
pregnancy and responded "yes" to the question "Was the only reason
you did not use any method then because you wanted to have a baby as
"
soon as possible?
(2) The birth was "wanted" if the couple had used
a contraceptive method in the interval prior to that pregnancy and had
"stopped using a method in order to have a child." (3) If the couple was
not using contraception but responded "no" to the question quoted
above or if the couple had conceived while using a method or while having
stopped using a method but "did not want to become pregnant at that time,"
then the couple was asked two additional questions. If the response
was "yes" to either of these additional questions the birth was considered "wanted." The two questions were "Before you became pregnant
this time did you want to have a (another) child sometime?" and "Did
your husband want to have a (another) child sometime?" Our definition
of"wanted" differs slightly from the definition used by Ryder and Westoff.

44

level, and a somewhat systematic relationship between the
number
of "unwanted" births and the use of good contraception.

We want to stress that the results pertaining to unwanted
births are subject to many qualifications and are included here primarily as some evidence that this one measure of the

intuitively

appealing notion of an unwanted pregnancy seems to be related to

contraception use as one would expect. The arbitrariness of the
precise definition of an unwanted pregnancy helps convince us that it
is more useful in studying the uncertainty related to fertility behavior to focus on the distribution of actual births than to concentrate
on partitioning observed fertility into "desired" and "unwanted"

fertility. We have shown in this section that across broadly defined
groups of households there appears to be a systematic

relationship

between contraception strategies and the mean and variance of observed

fertility. Couples characterized by the use of more effective contraception appear to have somewhat lower mean fertility, lower variance of
fertility, a weaker relationship between their mean and variance of fertility and perhaps a lower level of "unwanted" fertility.

44
This finding is consistent with Ryder and Westoff's conclusion
that "*here is a strong negative association of education and unwanted
fertility" (See Ryder and Westoff 1972, p.483). Their conclusion is also
based on the 1965 NFS data and its sequel, the 1970 NFS, which is not yet
available to us.
It must be stressed however that Ryder and Westoff's
definition of "unwanted" pregnancies and their criteria for selection of
the subsample studied differ from ours and or should not make inferences
about fertility behavior from comparisons between their tables and ours.

V Diffusion of the Pill
The 1965 National Fertility Study and its sequel, the 1970 National

Fertility Study, provide a unique opportunity to follow, at the household
level, the diffusion of a major technical innovation——the oral contraceptive
——from its Introduction for sale in the TJ.S, in 1960. In addition to the
intrinsic interest of studying the diffusion of new technology, the observed
pattern of adoption of the pill provides an important test of hypotheses
derived from our theory of contraceptive choice (see Section II).
There are two main reasons why the study of pill adoption provides a

more powerful test of our model of contraceptive choice than would he afforded
by studying differential choices among techniques existing before 1960.
First, the introduction of the pill was an exogenous event from the stand-

point of potential adopters. Second, the pill is a truly new kind of contraception in comparison with alternative methods available prior to 1960——
it is eignificantly more effective and less coitus—related than alternative

methods. This second consideration suggests that the pill has a significantly
lower marginal cost of fertility control than other methods, at least in terms

of the psychic costs associated with forgone sexual pleasure. Thus couples
were confronted, after 1960, with a significantly different set of potential
contraceptive rethods to choose from, and we investigate in this section the

differential rates of adoption of the pil] aiong women fth different initial
conditions in 1960 (e.g., marital status, age, parity and prior contraceptive
practices).

We first present a few hypotheses about the expected pattern of diffusion
assuming contraceptive choice is governed by factors considered in our theoreti—

S

— 60 —

cal

model. Next, we utilize data from the 1965 NFS to test these hy-

potheses and to estimate the probability of pill use as a logistic
function of the household's economic characteristics, parity in 1960, and
prior use of contraception.

The main behavioral hypothesis underlying our theory of choice of
contraceptive technique is that couples choose the least costly technique to achieve a given fertility goal (e.g. a given value of the mean and

variance of fertility outcomes). It was shown In Section lI—ui that the
same technique will not be least costly for a].l possible goals unless the

technique with the smallest marginal cost Is also the technique with the

lowest fixed cost. This proposition led to the derivation of the contraception cost curve for a "typical" couple in Figure 11—3 as the envelope
of least costly segments of the curve associated with particular contra-

ceptive techniques. According to this analysjs, the more births a couple
expects to avert the more likely it is to choose a technique with rela—
tively low marginal cost and high fixed cost. 45

To derive hypotheses about the adoption of the pill from this theory,
we shall assume that for most couples the pill has a lower marginal cost than

other contraceptive techniques available In 1960—65. Since It is easy to
provide examples of components of marginal Cost which are higher for the pill
than for alternative techniques (e.g., money cost, side effects on health,

45

For the time being, we shall Ignore risk considerations and argue in terms
of variations in expected fertility within an essentially deterministic frame—
work.

.

etc.), the plausibility of this assumption depends on th further
assumption that the major component of the marginal cost of contraception for most people stems from the conflict between effective use
46

of a method and sexual pleasure.

The fixed cost of the pill includes

the cost of acquiring information about its existence, characteristics
and method of distribution in addition to the money cost of visiting

a doctor to obtain a prescription and various psychic costs (e.g. religious principles) which are not related to information acquisition.

We can use figure 11—3 (page 31) to il1utrate the hypothetical
fertility control costs faced by a typical couple. Recall that the
line OF2 represents a zero fixed—cost, high marginal cost techniciue such

as withdrawal, and line a F represents another technique such as condom.

Suppose that the high fixed—cost, low marginal cost technique

depicted by a4 F4 represents the costs of the pill at the time of its
47
introduction on the market in 1960.

46
The ITJD, a close rival of the pill in terms of effectiveness and
coitus—related costs, was not widely available until after 1965.
47
While the line a F in the figure has a slope, or marginal cost
of approximately zeo the cost curve for the pill could have been drawn
with a positive although relatively low marginal cost.
Also, for simplicity of exposition, we wtll assume here that these
three techniques, withdrawal, condom, and pill, represent the entire envelope
cost curve. In our empirical analysis all available techniqueg are included.

newly married in 1960, the couple will adopt the pill only If

it wishes to avert all of its potential births (i.e if it wishes to
have zero children). If the couple wishes to avert between seven

and eleven

births (i.e. if it wishes to have one to five children) it will use the

condom as its contraceptive method. As the figure is drawn, if the couple
wishes to avert fewer than seven births (i.e. if it wishes to have more
than five children) withdrawal will be used as its contraceptive method.

The probability P that a couple will adopt the pill is equal to
the probability that the total contraception cost of using the pill, is
less than the total cost of using the least costly alternative technique.

were identical constants for all members

of the population, P would be either zero or one for everjone and the pill

In fact, of course, these variables will be distributed according to

some joint pr?bability distribution across the population so that we should
expect to find some fraction

Moreover, our theory suggests that each of these variables is a function of

exogenous variables as well as purely random factors. For example,
is a function of husband's lifetime income and wife's price of time, two

variables hich help determine the couple's demand for children. Like—

where u is a random variable and h(x,..., x, u) is a joint density function of the x's and u.

as a logistic function of the form

variable related to

is the wife's age when the pill became available.

So our hypothests is that, ceteris paribus, the older the wife was in
1960 the less likely she is to adopt the pill.49

Alternatively, if we hold constent natural fertility,,u and the
fertility control total cost curve, factors which increase the demand for

probability of adopting the pill. In studies of completed fertility,

In the simple three—techniQue case the effect on condom usage is
uncertain since some who previously used the condom are expected to switch
to the pill while some who previously used withdrawal are expected to switch
to the condom. In the more general case of several techniques an incresse
in B is expected to increase the proportion using the high fixed cost, low
marginal cost technique, ceteris parihus.

.

That is, the older she is the shorter the remaining reproductive
time span, so the smaller her remaining natural fertility and thus the
smaller her remaining expected averted births. Since she wishes to avert
fewer births, ceteris paribus, her incentive to adopt the high—fixed—cost
pill is relatively slight.
This hypothesis should he qualified in two respects. First, there
may he an advantage to postponing the investment in the fixed cost asso—
dated with pill adoption until the benefits of the reduced variable costs
associated with pill use are close at hand. If these benefits are greatest
when the couple wishes to contracept with high efficiency in order to
prevent any additional pregnancy, the adoption of the pill might he postponed until desired fertility is reached. Second, age at marriage is likely
to be inversely
correlated with the couple's demand for children. So
the younger the woman is at a given parity the more likely she wants to
have a large family, which would tend to offset the effect of age on expected births averted, unless desired fertility is explicitly held constant.
Thus our inability to hold desired fertility precisely fixed may introduce
biases on the other variables.

Briefly, the argument is this. When the wife is not supplying
labor to the market, the shadow price of her time is higher than her
potential market wage and is an increasing function of her husband's
income.

to

When she supplies labor
the market, her price of time is
equal to her market wage and is independent of her husband's income.
Since children are assumed to be time-intensive, the positive income
effect of H on the demand for children is offset by a substitution
effect against children in families with non—working wives, while
there is no offset in families with working wives. Since the wife's
labor force participation is negatively related to H and positively
related to W, Willis (1973) shows that the effects of H and W on
number of children will be nonlinear with a positive coefficient on
the interaction variable, MW. See, however, Ben Porath (1973) for
alternative interpretations of nonlinearity in the demand function
for children.

51

The husband's lifetime income and the wife's education are not,
of course, the only variables relevant for the demand curve for
children. The demand curve used in the previous section, for example,
included

several additional variables (see footnote 38 ) and also
pertained to white non-Catholics only. For the analysis of pill
adoption in this section we again restrict ourselves to white
non-Catholics.

Estimating the effects on pill use of variation in the fixed
and marginal costs of the pill and alternative methods of contraception

presents a number of difficult problems. These costs are likely to
be dominated by psychic or nontnarket components which may vary widely

across households but cannot be measured directly. Certain variables
such as Catholicism are known to inf1eice the costs of certain forms
of contraception and it is frequently argued that education reduces the
cost of acquiring birth control information (see Michael 1973). Pnfortunately, both of these variables also help determine the demand for
children and it is not easy to see how this influence can be disentangled
from their influence on the cost of contraception.

.

One advantage of studying the adoption of the pill is the fact

that we may study the response to the introduction of the pill by

women whose initial conditions differed in 1960. This procedure
enables us to study the effect of prior use of other forms of
contraception before 1960 on the probability of adopting the pill

after 1960. The theory suggests that couples which have incurred the
fixed costs associated, with some other technique will, ceteris paribus,

be less likely to adopt the pill. Hence, we expect prior use of the
diaphragm and condom, for example, to be negatively associated with
52
adoption.
A second aspect of prior use which may influence the

pill

probability of adopting the pill is the success the couple has with

the

previous method. If

suggests

that it would be used relatively

using that method. Since the pill has a

low marginal cost, the higher the marginal cost of the

alternative method, the more likely the pill will be adopted.

52That is, after the fixed costs are borne, the fertility control
costs fall from c1 +
to simply B, There are difficulties in
this test of the suruc-cost hypothesis, however. A woman's prior
contraception history is not independent of residual variance caused by
variation in the couple 's demand for children, fecundability, or costs
of contraception which we are unable to hold constant with the other

variables in the model. Several potential biases tend to work against
the "sunk cost" hypothesis. For example, subfecundity or sterility,

one of the reasons that a woman has not contraceptod in
the past, would also tend to reduce her probability of adopting the pill.
If this bias dominated, we might find that prior users of contraception
have a higher rather than a lower probability of using the pill compared
with prior nonusers.

I
Consequently,

we expect prior "contraceptive failure" to be positively

related to the probability of adopting the pill. This expectation is
strengthened by the likelihood that couples whic)t have experienced

contraceptive failure confront the prospect of larger losses of
expected utility from additional "unwrted" births than do couples who
have successfully contracepted in the past.
While we have discussed three separate sets of factors influencing
the probability of pill adoption in a static framework, we have not

as yet considered the diffusion of the pill over time. A major driving
force in any process of diffusion of new technology is the reduction

53

Although they are not information costs, a similar mechanism may

operate to reduce the costs associated with deviation from group norms
as individuals in the group withess increased nonconformity with
these norms. In the case of the pill, the interaction between the
teachings of the Catholic Church and the behavior of individual Catholics
might be interpreted along these lines (see Ryder and Westoff, 1971,
Chapter 8).

- 70

To

consider the effect of decreasing information costs of pill

adoption, we again make use of figure 11-3 (page 31). With the
passage

of time the fixed cost (which includes the information cost)

of the pill for the average household may fall from 0c4 to
Thus the switching point--the number of averted births at which pill
adoption is warranted--falls from about 11.5 births averted to about

6 births averted, as the figure is drawn. Obviously, in the

reduction in the fixed cost increases the proportion of couples

using the pill. Notice that the model implies that the users of the

those who most readily adopt the new

as its costs of information fall over time.

The

new low-

marginal-cost technique first displaces the existing technique with
the

lowest marginal cost.54

To test the hypotheses advanced above, we have selected three
samples of white non-Catholic women from the 1965 National Fertility
54

Hence, should a new contraceptive technique be introduced which
further lowers the marginal cost of contraception, our theory implies
that
technique to be displaced. Ryder (1972)
shows that by 1970 pill use differentials by education, race and
religion had converged. Much of the convergence, however, was caused
by an absolute decline in the use of the pill after 1967 by highly
educated white non-Catholics, the group which has the highest rate of
pill use. It is interesting to speculate whether new techniques such
as the IUD and the increased pepularity of the vasectomy and tubal
ligation had begun to displace the pill, in this group. Ryder emphasizes
the effects of fears about long—term adverse health effects of the pill,

In each sanp1e we estimate the probability that a woman uses the pill

was used. These results pertain to the sample of "contraceptors".
This latter dichotomy is the appropriate one if pill adoption is
characterized by the two—stage

decision:

(1)

contracept or not

55

One might in fact offer hypotheses about the relative magnitudes
of these negative effects based on the assumed ranking of the fixed

(the ct) of each. But there may be persistent or

cost components

serially correlated error terms across intervals, so we have refrained

from emphasizing this hypothesis. For example, couples which chose the
condom in the previous interval presumably did so for reasons only some
of which we have accounted for. Also, each technique has its own set
of characteristics which may be related to pill adoption (eg., the
diaphragm is a prescription method, so some of its fixed costs which
are related to a medical examination may in fact lower the fixed cost
of pill adoption).
56

The computer program was written by Kenneth Maurer of the Rand
Corporation. The advantage of the maximum likelihood estimation

procedure is that the data need not be grouped. Thus the effects of a
relatively large number of independent variables may be estimated from
relatively small samples.

contracept and (2) select a contraceptive technique.

Tab1 V-2 indicates the estimates on the total sample for each

of the first three pregnancy intervals, excluding the variables
which indicate prior contraception use.

The

time trend (the date

interval began) is positive and statistically significant. This
conforms with our hypothesis regarding the effects of a decline in

information costs over time. The age of the wife has the expected

negative sign in only the second interval, while the age at marriage
has an unexpected negative effect on the probability of pill adoption.58

The effects of the variables related to the demand for children
were computed both with and without the income-education interaction

term. In all cases the variables exhibited the expected signs. The
relatively stronger effect of husband's income than wife's education,

however, is quite surprising. In several studies estimating the effects
of

these variables on fertility demand, the wife's education has the

57The estimates were computed on both the total sample (for the
unconditional P) and the sample of contraceptors (for the conditional
P). The results were quite similar in the two cases so only the former
are reported here.

58We have no explanation for the consistently negative

effect of

age at marriage. }Iolding wife's age and current parity constant, a
higher age at marriage implies a shorter duration of time front marriage
to current parity. Thus we think age at marriage in these estimates

may be

positively related to relatively high fecundity, relatively high
rates of coital frequency, or relatively low demand for children, but
each of these factors implies a positive effect of age at marriage on
the probability of pill adoption, ceteris paribus.

S
stronger effect. The introduction of the interaction effect does

strengthen the effect of the wife's education in the first and third
59
intervals.

In general • the signs and magnitudes of the effects of

these three variables tend to support the hypothesis that these
variables affect fertility demand and h2ve an effect of opposite sign

on the probability of using the pill, given the wife's age, parity and
the time sequence of the pregnancy interval.

Turning to Table V-3, the effect of prior use of contraception

is added to the estimating equations. The table includes the results
for the total sample and for the subsample of contraceptors. The

effects of the fertility demand variables, the information cost variable,
and the age of the wife and age at marriage variables are only slightly
affected by the introduction of the set of prior—use variables, so they

will not be discussed again here. The effect of failure in the
preceding interval is positive as hypothesized. The effects of
prior use of the diaphragm, condom or other contraception are negative

as hypothesized in the subsample of contraceptors, but are seldom

statistically significant; the signs are not as hypothesized in the
third interval for the total sample. The expected positive effect of

prior pill use is quite strong in iost cases.
effect of the wife's education, W, on the probability of
adoption in, say, the third interval, is 5p/tSW = .084 — .013H
which is positive at lower values of husband's income and negative at
high values of husband's income.

While it is tempting to discuss in detail several of these
estimated coefficients, we will not do so here. We think the
qualitative results of our study of pill use offer rather strong
support for the hypotheses we developed earlier in this section.
