• WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE BABY- BOOM?
NEW ESTIMATES OF AGE—AND PARITY-'

SPECIFIC BIRTH PROBABILITIES
FOR MiERICAN WON

by
Warren C, Sanderson
Stanford University

The baby boom is over and, with fertility in the United
States currently below replacement level, it may well be saia that a

birth dearth is already upon us. Graph 1 shows the U. S. general
fertility rate1 from 1909 through 1968.2 The secular movement of this

rate is clearly downward. However, this secular decline was interrupted
by a period in the l95Os when fertility was both relatively high and
increasing. The peak general fertility rate during the baby boom occurred
in 1957 and subsequently fertility has fallen every year thereafter with

the exceptions of 1969 and l97O, This recent fertility history presents
a problem for economists and other interested in fertility.

Is the

current low level of fertility but a trough in a long cycle which is
destined to produce yet another baby boom or is it a manifestation of a

continued secular decline in fertility? To put the same problem in
somewhat different terms: is a baby boom an anomalous or

systematic

phenomenon.

.Although in recent years, there have been important advances

in the economic theory of fertility,4 these contributions have not yet
been sufficiently articulated to throw much light on the course of

—2—

postwar fertility changes. It is the main purpose of this paper to
examine in detail the pattern of fertility fluctuations n the United
States since the Second World War and to define, with some

precision,

the questions these patterns raise for students of fertility behavior,
Towards this end I present new estimates of age— and parity-.specific

monthly birth probabilities for cohorts of native white women born in

the twentieth century. These data lend themselves to numerous uses, only one
of which is pursued here——the close analysis of the structure of fertility

changes after 1950, What they reveal in that connection are hitherto
unrecognized patterns of fertility variation across age and parity groups

during the baby boom, Perhaps the most startling finding is that, although
aggregate fertility measures reach their "baby boom" peak in 1957, the

birth probabilities often do not, Looking across groups of women of
different ages one finds that probabilities of second and higher order
births reached a peak level during the years 1953—1955 as frequently as

in the years 1956—1958. The probabilitjes of second through fourth order
births for young women consistently reached their peak during the period

1959—1961. In addition, the new data pertaining to lower order births
show that before the Second World War temporal variations in birth pro-

babilities were quite similar across age groups. After the War, that is
to say during the height of the Baby Bàom, a marked structural change
occurred and the positive correlation across age groups disappeared,
To aid further analysis of the mass of birth probability data,

I have "decomposed" the time series for different birth orders into an

-.3—

"age",

a "current year", and a "cohort" component. For each of the

birth orders, this trio of components allows us to disentangle the
distinct influences which intertwined themselves, giving rise to the

observed birth probabilities. This analysis shows that the cohort
influences were very important in creating the pattern of first

birth

probability fluctuations in the baby boom period. The strength of this
source of influence progressively diminished in the case of higher order

births, however. The current year components for first birth probabilities
exhibit a time profile which is unlike those for higher order births in
that its peak precedes 1957 while the peaks of the current year components

for higher order births all occur in 1957, In view of the absence of
uniformity in the temporal patterns exhibited by the various birth
probability series, it may be reassuring to note that the familiar move—
ment to a 1957 peak does emerge in the current year components for each
of the birth orders save the first.

While the behavior of the current year components by themselves
would have promoted a cyclical swing in aggregate fertility paralleling
the one in the postwar period, the amplitude of that movement would have

been much smaller. Since the current year effects had to work against
the anti—natal influence of the changing age structure of the population,
were it not for the "cohort" influence already noticed the outcome

may not even have qualified as the "Baby Bubble" much less

the "Baby Boom".

Birth Probabilities.

Patterns of fertility variations will be analyzed, in this
study, using data, estimated by the author, on age— and party—specif Ic
birth probabilities for cohorts of native5 white wOmen born after 1899.

Birth probabilities were first measured for the United States by Wheipton

in his pioneering book, Cohort Fertility, published in 1954. There
Wheipton presented annual age— and parity—specific birth probabilities

for native white women for the years 1920 through 1950.6 Whelptonts
original work spawned further efforts at measuring birth probabilities7
and birth probabilities for all U. S. women are now regularly published
in Vital Statistics of the United States.. Since the first year for which

these data are reported is 1956 those interested in the behavior of time

series fertility measures are left in something of a quandry. There is
one study on birth probabilities of native white women for the years 1920
through 1950 using one methodology and another for all U. S. women covering

the perixl 1956—1968 using a somewhat different methodology. In order to
facilitate the interpretation of time series trends it is preferable to study
the birth probabilities of native white women rather than those of all U. S.
women and so, with an improved methodology,8 I have, re—estimated some of

Wheipton's birth probabilities for native white women and extended his series

through 1966.
Annual age— and parity—specific birth probabilities are of interest

for a number of reasons. Chief among their attractions is that a birth probability is a period fertility measure which is consistent with economic decision—

making models of fertility. It is implausible to think of the total fertility
rate or the net reproduction rate as being the outcome of a household decision—

making process. However, birth probabilities may, quite plausibly, be considered
as outcome of such a process as Michael (1973) has already demonstrated.

—5—

Another attraction of the birth probability data used in this

c

paper is that they allow the investigator tofollow cohorts of women

over

their life cycles and study the processes through which their

completed family sizes are attained. Also, birth probabilities, particularly monthly birth probabilities like those presented here, are parameters
in mathematical models of fertility and contraception developed by
10
demographers.

Conceptually, an age— and parity—specific monthly birth probability

is a rather simple affair. Let us consider, for example, a highly simplified
computation of the monthly birth probability of thirty year old native white
women who have had exactly two previous births having a third birth in

1960. This particular monthly probability is, by the way, about 1.2
percent or on an annual basis about 13.8 percent. For ease of exposition,

0

let us assume that all these women were born on January 1, 1930, so that
each of them spends the full twelve months in which she is 30 in the

calendar year 1960. In addition, let us assume that all of these women
had their second births before they were 29 (ie. before the calendar
year 1959). If we were to consider the possibility of second births
occurring in 1959, in this simplified example, then the women who had
had such births would not be, on the average, at risk of having a third

child for a full twelve months in 1960. Neglecting mortality, we may write:

(1)

B =

N

-

N(1-p)'2

where B is the number of third births to 30 year old native white women in

1960, N is the number of 30 year old native white women who are capable

0

—6.-

of having a third birth at the beginning of 1960, and p Is the

monthly birth probability we are seeking. From Equation 1, it may
be readily seen that:

N
(2)

1/12

p=1_(-j!)

The two major components of all birth probabilities are data on age—
and parity—specific births and age— and parity—specific num1ers

of

women at risk of having a birth.
When monthly birth probabilities are actually computed, we
cannot take for granted that all women are born on January 1st, nor that
all previous births have occurred sufficiently long before the period of
interest that current birth risk status is unaffected, nor can mortality

be neglected. In addition, in estimating birth probabilities we must
obtain data on births by parity and single years of age for native white
women, and estimates of women capable of having a birth of a given order,
aggregated according to whether .they have had their last birth more than
one year11 before the period of interest or not, - When these

complications are added to the computation, the birth probabilities can

no longer be calculated directly and must obtained using an iterative

procedure. This procedure is discussed in more detail in Appendix I.
Looking at the aggregated birth probabilities presented in
Appendix ii and the underlying disaggregated birth probabilities, one can

see what is a rather remarkable fact: birth probabilities often do not

of

peak in the period 1956—1958.

It is clear from Table 1 that the 1957 peak was

most

common

for

first births.

In fact, if we consider only second and higher order births, we find that
the seine number of series peak in 1953—1955 as do in 1956.4958. It is also
interesting to note with regard to Table 1 that peaks occurring after the

D56—1958 period are not coon except for second, third, and fourth order
births, The observation that birth probabilities do not generally peak in

1957 suggests the important question: what regularities, if any, exist in
the post—war movements of birth probabilities.

0

—8—

One

important

and striking regularity in the pattern of

birth probabilities is shown by the first birth probabilities of women

27 years old and younger. All the first birth probabilities of women
15 through 27 years old rise in the 'fifties to a peak in 1957. These
ages account for 13 of the 15 first birth probability series which peak

in 1957. The other series which peak in 1957 do so more or less unsystem—
atically. For example, the four ages for which there are peaks in third
order birth probabilities in 1957 are 31, 32, 43, and 44 and the five ages
in which there are peaks in sixth order birth probabilities are 31, 36, 37,

41, and 43. Thus, the first birth probabi1ities of women 27 and under
form the only coherent set of birth probabilities which peak in the same

year as the crude birth rate.'4 The timing of the fluctuations of these
first birth probabilities was an important determinant of the timing of
the baby boom fertility peak.

Although in 1957 first births to

native white women 15 to 27 accounted for only about 25 percent of all
births to these women, the decline in the first births to women 15 to 27
accounted for about 50 percent of the decline in all births from 1957 to
1958,

As can be seen from Appendix Graph i-i in Appendix II, the
fact that first birth probabilities for young women tended to peak in the
same year as the crude birth rate does not mean that their patterns of change

in the 'fifties were similar to one another. By 1957, the first birth
probabilities for women 15 to 19 years of age had increased about 31 percent

over their 1950 level, those of women 20 to 24 had increased about 38 per—
cent over their 1950 level, but those of women 25 to 29 increased to only

10 percent above their 1950 level. The first birth probabilities of women
15 to 19 fell somewhat more rapidly from its peak than the first birth

probabilities of women
of women 25 to 29 fell

20 to 24 and the first birth probabilities
the least.

The first birth probabilities for women orer 27 years old'
behaved quite differently in the postwar period from those of their

younger sisters. It can be seen from Appendix Graph 1—2 that the first
birth probabilities of women in the 30—34, 35—39, and 40—44 year old age

grouçsbegan to fallin the fifties before 1957. The differences in the
behavior of the first birth probabilities of women of different ages
can be clearly seen in Graph 2, where we have plotted the first birth

probabilities of women aged 20, 26, and 32. This graph shows that,
although before World War II the first birth probabilities of these women tended
to move similarly, in the postwar period their first birth probabilities show

a rather remarkable divergence. This considerable dissimilarity of the
patterns of change of first birth probabilities by age groups is an important feature of the baby boom and any thorough explanation of postwar

fertility variations must come to grips with it. We shall return to this
question later in the paper.
Second birth probabilities to women 16—19, 20—24, and 25—29
are plotted in Appendix Graph 11—1. All three age' groups show a substantial
increase in their second birth probabilities over the course of the 'fifties.
However, unlike the first birth probabilities of women of the same ages, the

second birth probabilities do not reach their maximum

in

1957, but rather

in 1960 or 1961. Thus the baby boom peaks in second birth probabilities
for these women lag their first birth probability peaks by about three

years. Another interesting aspect of this graph is the difference in the
of first and second birth probabilities to women 25 to 29 years.

—10-.

•

•

The first birth probabilities of these women are almost constant from
1951 through 1956, but during the sie period their second birth prob—
abilities rise by about 25 percent. This difference in the behavior
of first and second birth probabilities during the baby boom

raises

another interesting question and we shall also return to it below.
Appendix Graph 11—2 shows the second birth probabilities

of women 30—34, 35—39, 40—44. Like the first birth probabilities of
these women and in sharp contrast with the second birth probabilities of
younger women, the second birth probabilities of these women tend to peak before

1957. The baby boom peak of second birth probabilities to 30—34 year olds
lags the peak of first birth probabilities by two years, but the peaks of
first and second birth probabilities to women 35—39 and 40—44 occur in
the same year.

It can be seen from Appendix Graphs 111—1 and 111—2 that the
patteriof third birth probabij.tjes appear to be similar to those of second

birth probabilities. Third birth probabilities for women below 30 tend
to peak around 1960 and third birth probabilities for women 35—39 and

40—44 tend to peak before 1957. In this case, third birth probabilities
for women 30—34 peak in 1957. In fact, as can be seen from Graph 3, as
e move from first through third births the time profile of birth probabilities

of 30—34 year old women looks more like the time profiles for younger
women.

Although the fourth birth probabilities of women 20—24 peak
in 1961 and those for women 25—29 in 1960, their rise over the decade
of the 'fifties is considerably smaller than the lower order birth probabilities of women the same age. For example,

for women 20—24 rose over 30 percent from 1950 to 1960, whereas
fourth birth probabilities to these women rose less than 7 percent

during the decade. For women 25—29 the rise in thirdbirth prob—
abilities was about 33 percentand for fourth birth probabilties only
about 15 percent. The fourth birth probabilities for women over 30 roáe
more rapidly in the first half of the baby boom decade than the fourth

birth probabilities of younger women. Indeed, as a practical matter
it appears that the fourth birth.probabilities of women 30—34 and
40—44 peaked in 1957.15

With fifth and higher order births, post—1957 peaks in the
aggregated birth probabilities presented in Appendix II disappear and
the age patterns of the birth probabilities become somewhat less regular.

The fifth birth probabilities for women 25—29 peak in 1952, their sixth
probabilities in 1953, their seventh birth probabilities in 1954, and

their eighth and higher birth probabilities in 1956. The fifth, sixth
and seventh birth probabilities for women 30—34 peak in 1956, and
the eighth—plus birth probabilities peak a year later.

Component Analysis.

We have seen above that fertility behavior in the postwar

period was far from being uniform. All

birth

probabilities did not

rise in the 'fifties to a peak in 1957 and decline thereafter, but rather

they showed a number of different patterns. How are we to understand
these patterns? In order to make some sense Out of the multiplicity
of fertility series, we must introduce at least a modicum of analytic

structure. In this.pursuit, we shall posit the following representation
of birth probabilities:

(3)

+

ln(pk2.) =

+

+
Cijk2,

is the monthly birth probability of birth order

where

women of age i in year j

, (the

2..

for

index k represents the year in which

these women were born and can be derived from a knowledge of i and j ),

is

the age component, 8. is the current year component, k2. is

the cohort component, and c. .

.

ijk2..

is

a random disturbance term

assumed

to be independently normally distributed with mean zero and cohort variance
This is a rather broad decomposition because we do not need to
know precisely what the current year or cohort influences on birth probabilities
of a given order are in order to measure their contribution to variations

in birth probabilities. The decomposition proposed here is roughly in
the spirit of Easterlin's analysis. In his article on the baby boom
in historical perspective,16 he explains the fertility variations of
native white urban women using variations in the unemployment rate and

—13--

L
•

changes in the rate of growth of the size of the group of males 20 to

29 years of age. The influence in the first of these factors would be
recorded as variation in the current year component in the proposed
decomPOsition, and the latter, since it is a reflection of relative
cohort size, would be recorded as variation in the cohort component.
The Easterlifl—FUChs intergenerational relative income hypothesis17 may

also be easily represented in our proposed framework because parental
income levels, in as much as they affect tastes, are likely to have
influences which remain with cohorts throughout their whole reproductive
span, and therefore influences which can be captured as changes in cohort

components. The suggested decomposition, broadens somewhat the Easterlin
hypotheses since separate age, current year, and cohort components are

estimated for each birth order. Separate cohort components, for example,
allow for the intergenerational relative income effect, if it is present, to
affect the birth probabilities differently for different birth orders.
However, along with certain advantages, the birth probability

decomposition in Equation 3 has certain disadvantages. One has to do with
the interaction between cohort

and current year components. Given the

specification in Equation 3, temporal patterns of birth probabilities of

women

of

differing ages, parity held constant, are allowed to differ only

because of the variations in the cohort components. Thus certain sorts of
influences on fertility may not be correctly captured in this analysis.
The influence of

benefits

after World War II may be one of these.

We do not maintain the total absence of such influences on fertility, but
rather that they.e of minor importance compared with those influences which
are correctly measured.

—14—

Another disadvantage of the proposed decomposition is the
econometric difficulty of thoroughly disentangling the age, current year

and cohort components. We can rewrite Equation 3 as follows:

Let us denote this latter sum by Xp,

Clearly we cannot use the goodneof fit Lo help us determine X

since

the

regression coefficients are not affected by its value and further there is no

observed birth probability for the combination of age j , current year k

and cohort n.
Therefore, in order to estjjnae the component differences

we must use some additional information to compute the
We have estimated Equation 13 for the first four birth orders.
For birth orders one through three, we used ages 18 through 39, omitting
age 30, current years 1920 through 1966 omitting 1960 and the var—affected

years of 1942 through 1947, and cohorts 1900 through 1946, omitting women

born in 1931. In terms of the notation of Equation 13, j = 30

m = 1930, and n = 1931.

,

k=

1960

For birth order four we followed the pattern of

the first three birth orders except that ages 22 through 39, current

years 1924 through 1966, and cohorts 1900 through 1942 were used. This
procedure yielded three regressions with 107 dummy variables and 705
observations each and one regression with 95 dummy variables and 595

observations. The results of these computations are reported in Appendix Ill.
Before the results of these regressions can be used we must compute the

We know that the decline in birth probabilities from

1930 to 1933 ought not to be attributed to a fortuitous configuration of
age and cohort components, but rather to a decline in the curreit year

component. Similarly the increase in birth probabilities from 1933 to
1934 ought to be accounted for mainly be an increase in the current year

component. Let us denote the coefficient of [Y]

in

Equation 13 by

If estimates could be made of l933,& l93O

or indeed any current year component difference, then the value of

could be estimated. Any

estimate

of current year components drawn from

observed data must be confounded with age and cohort influences, There
is no way around this problem. The tack taken here is to try to minimize the effects of age and cohort influences by choosing to estimate
current year component differences using observed data for years for
which there is a priori information that changes in current year
conditions were of speical importance in explaining fertility variations.

essence, this criterion allows the selection of that X& whose implications

for current year components fit most closely the notions that the declines in
birth, probabilities from 1930 to 1933 and the subsequent increases to 1934

were mainly due to changes in current year components.

Given the values of X computed from the criterion above, we
have computed the current year component differences

and

The current year

component differences are shown in Graphs 4, 6, 8, and 10, and cohort component

differences in Graphs 5, 7, 9, and 11. The data shown in these graphs are
sensitive to the criterion chosen to estimate the

and by no means

ought the plotted data to be interpreted as being precise. However, the
general patterns shown by the component differences remain given any plausible
criterion of which we are aware.

Graph 4 shows the current year component differences for first

births. It is somewhat surprising to note that the current year component
for first births does not peak in 1957, but earlier in the baby boom

decade. How then are we to understand the first birth probabilities of
women 15 through 27, all of which peak in 1957? The answer can be found

—20—

by turning to Graph 5. Here we can see that the cohort component was
rising after the middle of the l92Os. It is the rise, particularly
the increase for women born in the Depression which is the main cause
of the increase in first birth probabilities for young women

during

the baby boom. The rather large differences in the behavior of first
birth probabilities by age group which we noted earlier in the paper
can be traced directly to variations in the cohort components.
Clearly, if we are to understand the increase in first births

over the course of the baby boom, we must focus our attention on the large
upward

movement of the cohort component which occurred across the

Depression. Apparently relative cohort size has some impact on this
component
ponent

because the small cohort of 1919 has a relatively large

corn—

and the relatively large cohort of 1921 a comparatively small one.

The year 1917 for which the cohort component has a local trough is also
a year in which the birth series has a local peak9 Nonetheless, the sheer
size of the change in the cohort component over the Depression relative
to previous changes suggests that some other factors were also at work.

Perhaps one of the other factors is the Easterlin—Fuchs intergenerational

relative Income effect. However, it is not evident that these two factors
taken together would imply a 1941 peak in the cohort component. In any
case, one thing is clear from Graph 5, cohort components have been the
source of a considerable portion of the variability in first birth probabilities
over the baby boom.

It suggests that students of

fertility might profitably study first and subsequent births separately.

Considering the cohort cQmpQnnts of second through fourth
births, it can be seen that the rise in the

cohort component over the

• significantly attenuated as birth order increases.

In Graph 11, which shows

the cohort components for fourth births, the rise over the Depression is

Thus it appears that at least some

a coton pattern in the cohort components. Cohort components tended to have
a declining phase in the 'twenties followed by an increasing phase beginning

in the middle or late 'twenties. This pattern raised the fertility of
younger women in the 'fifties and làwered the fertility of older women.
The increasing phase of the cohort component clearly grew smaller in
amplitude as birth order increased and it is possible that the reverse

happened with respect to the decreasing phase. Most order differentiation
in the patterns of birth probabilities by age occurs between first and
subsequent births due to the change in the pattern of current year
components from one which is relatively flat from 1952 through 1957 and which
falls thereafter to a pattern for second and higher order births which is

more rounded and which peaks in 1957. The less rapid fall from 1957 to 1960
in this latter pattern accounts for why the interaction between it and the
cohort components produces peaks around 1960 rather than the earlier
peaks in the first birth probabilities of young woman.

In this paper we have presented data on monthly birth probabilities
for native white women which are age.- and parity—specific,

We have considered the patterns of variation shown by these probabilities
over the baby boom and demonstrated that these patterns may be illuminated
by decomposing the birth probabilities into age, current year, and cohort

components. It is hoped that the data presented here and the questions
which hve been raised will aid in the development of models and data which
will deepen our understanding of the intricate processes of fertility change
over time.

APPENDIX I

The Methodology of the Creation of Birth Probabilities.

As an example, we shall relate in detail the creation of the
monthly probability of 30 year old women

having

their second birth in 1950.

First, we assume that women are only born on the first day of, every

Donth. This assumption makes our computations managable without neglecting
the substantial variations in monthly births which have occurred. Women
who report having a second birth at age 30 in 1950 may have been born

between February 1, 1919 and December 1, 1920. In other words, the
women may have any one of twenty—three monthly birthdays. Let us call
women born on February 1, 1919 members of cohort one, women born on

March 1, 1919 members of cohort two, and so on. Women born on December 1,
1920 are members of cohort 23. In order to determine the birth probability
we must know how many women are capable of having a second birth at age
30

in 1950 and how many months these women spend as 30 year olds in

1950. We have assumed in the birth probability computations that a
woman was not capable of having a birth until twelve months after her
last one except in the case of twins.

The assumption that, except in the case of twins, a woman
was not capable of having a birth in less than twelve months after her
last one, forces us to divide those women capable of having a second
birth at age 30 'in 1950 into two groups, those who nve had their first

birth more than a year before they turn 30 in 1950 and those who have

had their first birth within a year of the date on which they turn 30 in

o

—24—

1950. Let us consider, for example, those women of cohort 12
(i.e. those born on January 1, 1920) who are capable of having a second

birth at age 30 in 1950. Some of these women had their first birth when
they were 20 in 1949. If their births were distributed uniformly over
the year 1949, these women would have, on average, six months of 1950

in which they were capable of having a second child. Women who had their
first birth before they were 29 in 1949 would have a full twelve months
of 1950 in which they were capable of having a second child.

Let us define N11 through N231 as the numbers of
women in cohorts 1 through 23 who have had their first child before

age 29 in 1949 and N12 through N232 as the niunbers of women in
cohort 1 through 23 who had their first birth at age 29 in 1949. If
these numbers of women are known and the total number of second births

to 30 year old women in 1950, called B ,

is

known, we can write the

following equation in which p is the monthly probability of having a
second birth.

Equation 1 is not easily solved for p in general. However since we know
that p is generally quite small, often around 0.02, a Taylor series
expansion of the terms involving (1 — p)
in which we delete all terms above
the quadratic one will

yield

a good approximation.

In general, we can write

In the computation of the

probabilities q was initially set at 0.05.

After p was computed

by solving equation 6, the new p was introduced as the value of q and
p was computed once again. Through experinentation it was found that the

value of p almost always converged

to

its true value after two iterations.

—27-.

C
The underlying birth data for the years 1915 through 1946
are implicit in Wheipton (1954), and data for the years 1947 through 1966
are derived from the relevant issues of Vital Statistics of the United
States.

The data on the number of women capable of having a birth

of a given order at a given age in a given year and essentially derived,

simultaneously with the birth probabilities. For example, we assume that
women do not give birth to children before the age of 15. Therefore,
once we have computed first birth probabilities for 15 year old women,

we can determine the number of months of exposure to having a second
birth 16 year old women

have

in the subsequent year. For more details

on this procedure see Sanderson (1974) Appendix A.

The general fertility rate is defined as the ratio of the number
of births to the number of women 15—44, multiplied by 1,000,

2.

The data in Graph 1 are from Vital Statistics of the United States:
1968, Volume 1, Natality,

3,

The increases in fertility from 1968 to 1969 and from 1969 to 1970
show up not only in the crude birth rate, but in the general fertility

rate as well. The following pattern of recent fertility variations
has been drawn from various issues of the Monthly Vital Statistics
Report, a publication of the U.S, Department of Health, Education
and Welfare,

It is possible that more disaggregated fertility measures such as
age— and parity—specific birth probabilities do not show the 1969
and 1970 increases.

By "native" white women, we mean women born in the United States,

6.

Data for the years 1920 through 1949 appear in Wheipton (1954),

Table E. Data for 1950 can be found in Table C,
7.

See Wheipton and Campbell (1960), Although birth probabilities were
not published in that report, it laid the foundation for the birth
probabilities which were subsequently published in various issues
of Vital Statistics of the United States.

Our estimates are created with a methodology wiich differs from the
original Whelpton procedures in a large number of relatively unimpor-

tant ways. For example, our estimates explicitly
account,

take twinning into

whereas the Wheipton birth probabilities do not, However,

is one quite important difference in our methods. We have taken

into consideration the fact that women who have had a child are not

inmediatej.y at risk of bearing another child, The Wheipton methodology

makes no distinction ebtween women who have had births within the
previous year and those who have not, See Sanderson (1974) Appendix A
for a more comprehensive discussion of the methodology used in creating
the current estimates as well as the methodologies used by others.
9.

We have not re—estimated birth probabilities for cohorts born in

the nineteenth century. There are a number of difficulty technical
problems involved in doing this which seem to make this data considerably less reliable than the data for twentieth century birth

cohorts. Our estimates stop in 1966 because this is the latest date

for which birth data on native white women are published in the

needed detail, Age— and parity—specific birth data for all white
women have, at this writing, been published only through 1968,
Thus even adjusting the white data as best we could would only
give us two extra years of data.
10,

For example, see Keyfitz (1971).

11.

The birth probabilities presented in this paper have been computed
on the assumption that, neglecting twinning,, a woman mast wait at

least a year between births, While twelve months may be slightly
longer than the average period of gestation and pst—partum aiumenorhia,

using that figure iads in our computations without doing much violence
to reality.
12,

Throughout this paper, wesha11 use the phrase 'baby boom peak! to
refer to the highest birth probability in a series during the period
1950 to

13.

1966.

These birth probability series are time series of age- and parity—

specific birth probabilities. Thus the 30 first order birth probability series referred to in Table 1 are for women from age 15 to

age 44. We assume, following Wheipton, that 15 year old women do
not have second births (except for twins) and therefore there are
only 29 series for second births,

It is these minimum age assumptions

which cause the number of series to decrease as the birth order increases.

By coherent set of birth probabilities we simply mean a set of

birth probability series with adjacent ages. Thus the birth
probability series of women 20, 21, and 22 would be coherent, in
this sense, but not those of women 31, 35, and 39,
15.

The third order birth probability peak for 40 to 44 year old women
occurred in 1954, 1955, and 1956, but the fall from. 1956 to 1957

is so small that for practical purposes 1957 may also be considered
a peak year.

Briefly, this hypothesis suggests that adolescents' tastes and
hence ultimately their adult fertility are affected by their

parents standard of living.
