I. wish to thank my sponsor, Professor Jacob Mincer, for intro—
ducing me to the study of the economics of labor and human resources
and for making useful suggestions throughout my preparation of this

dissertation. The Ford Foundation (through a grant to the National
Bureau of Economic Research for the study of the economics of population),
the National Science Foundation, and the Manpower Administration of
the United States Department of Labor provided financial support
during my graduate program; while I was working on my dissertation,

the

National Bureau made available to me its research facilities,

which were especially helpful.

CHAPTER I•
INTRODUCTION

A.

The Topic

This dissertation analyzes the timing and spacing of child-

births within an economic framework. I have attempted to explain
when women in the United States begin child bearing ——

"timing" (of the first birth) — and
spend in child bearing ——

i.e.,

the

i.e.,

the

length of the interval they

the "spacing" of births.

The timing and spacing decisions have both demographic and

economic significance. In the first instance, they help determine the
size and growth rate of the population; for not only is a postponed
birth less likely to occur but, even if it does occur, its postponement

results in a lower birth rate and a lower population growth rate. For
e:cample, if

early

each couple achieves the same completed fertility as under

timing but experiences these births at a later age, then the length

of a generation ——

the average age of mothers at the births of all

children regardless of birth order ——

increases;

birth rates drop; and

the population grows more slowly.

The levels of birth rates have obvious direct effects on the
supply of workers when these babies reach the age of entering the labor
force. The age—composition of the labor force at any point'iri time and
the proportion of the population of working age depends on the pattern

of birth rates in the past. A more subtle effect of the pattern of birth
rates on the supply of labor may work through forces in the marriage

market: Since "marriageable age" differs for men and for women, changes
in the number of birtis per year will result later in surpluses of men

or

of •ocn of marriageable age. This causes a change in the proportion

of young persons who are married and alters the average age at marriage;
these affect particularly women's labor force participation.

The moèt important effect of these fertility decIsions on labor

force participation by ween orera:es directly. In recent years, in

U.S., mast wcLen have worked ufltil the birth of their fIrst child was
imminent. ?ariy of the weren have rettrned to work after their youngest
the

child wa of .chooi z or even sooner; thIs is especially true of women

2.

with

high levels of education. But, few women work while they still

have small children at home, regardless of their educational attainment.1
Therefore, women's labor force participation depends importantly on when

a woman has her children. This, in turn, depends in part on how many
chIldren she has, since there are physiological limits on how close

together births can occur. Family size or "completed fertility" is already
being studied intensively by economists;2 my research focuses on the timing
and spacing of those births.
B.

Survey of the Literature

Most fertility research has focused on completed fertility ——

i.e.,

the number of children born —— rather than on the timing of these births.

The published work in child spacing is dominated by sociologists and
demographers. In general, the work of the former is descriptive in
nature while that of the demographers is directed toward developing
mathematical models with little related empirical te'ting or explaining
purely physiological phenomena.

Fonald Freedman and Lolacene Coomhs, sociologists who have produced a series of articles based on the Detroit Area Scudy, describe
the relationships observed between the tempo of farnly growth and income,
asset accumulation, age at iarrIage, religion, employment history, and
other socio—economic variables, although

no testable

hypotheses are

presented and no unifying theory or model is suggested to link together
the

observed phenomena.

In an article on the effect of current, expected, and relrttive
income on fertility behavior, they reported that current income was not
related to the expected or preferred nuaber of children, but was strongly
rtlated to the timing of events —— to the age at marriage, to the incidence of prentarital pregnar.eIe (PMP), azid to the length of the interval

from marriage to a birth of a given order.' Women who expected large
increases in family income expected to have more additional children

than other women. At all income levels over $3,000/year, wives who
viewed their family's income as adequate expected more children and

planned to have.them sooner. However, those who felt that their incomes
were higher than the incomes of other families they knew expected or
preferred more children than other women only if the women already had
four or more children.

A high aspiration to provide material things for ones children
was not a function of income but was associated with •xp.cting fever
additional. children; it was not related to birth intervals. However,

those mothers who expected their children to attend college and who

saving for it had fewer children and had wider intervals between
births. Freedman and Cooinbs also found that women in the labor force
expected to have fewer children. Long labor force participation was
correlated with an expectation of fewer additional children and with
were

longer intervals from marriage to the parity birth. There was no

informto aboit labor force particiration and the ftttervals between

successive births; the observed relationship may result primarily from
work experience before child bearing was begun.
In another article published in the same year as that described
above, the authors reported that a family's economic position was better
the longer the interval from marriage to first (or later) birth but
ascribed this at least in part to marriage duration and to the husband's
education.2 They noted that the sooner after marriage births occur the
less asset accumulation ano the greater economic pressures the couple

faces at the time of the birth. In particular, woren

with

PMP have

subsequent children sooner and have the strongest relationship between
chiidspacing and economic position.

In

a more recent article Coouibs and Freedman described the effect

of the first interval (from marriage to first birth) on the family's

later economic status.' They coEpered •con;ic characteristIcs of
couples with PM?, with short first intervals that were not P, and

with

long first intervals and asserted that the fertility and

patterns of the PNP

were

economic.

markedly different from other couples with short

first intervals. Over time the income disadvantage of a PNP

couple

decreases, but the relative gain in assets is not so good; this was

ascribed mostly to their lower education and lower age at marriage.
Those few PM? couples who had few children or a long second or third
Interval were able to improve their economic situation.
Comparing (non—PM?) short spacers with those couples who had a

longer first interval, they found that the income and asset disadvantage
did disappear with time. Couples with a short first interval had not
been married as long at the birth of the i—th child o their disadvan—
tage was due to the husband's lower age and the shorter marriage duration.
The authors expect that the two groups would have similar incomes and

assets at the same a. The short spacers had similar education but a
somewhat higher occupation status than long spacers, and they wanted more
children and wanted ther sooner than the others. By contrast, most PM?

couples were dissatisfied with their fertility situation.

of

timing and spacing of births. The quarter and year of birth can be

determined only for those children still residing with the mother, but
most women who have passed the normal age of child bearing already have

had one or more children leave the household.1 Furthermore, in the
Hastings study, observations were eliminated unless all birth intervals
were 0 to 18 months long or all were 18 to 48 months long or all were

longer than 48 months. Since most first birth intervals — from marriage
to first birth ——

are

short (0 to 18 months) and most intervals ietween

successive births are longer than 18 months, this selection criterion
eliminates most families with two

or

more children. For example, among

white couples who had at least a high school education 100 percent of
one—child families were included; for two child families the incluslen
rate was 37.5 percent for mothers under thirty, 28.2 percent for mothers

aged 30 to 44, and 28.7 percent for women over 44. In three—child
families the percent included in Hastings' sample was

18.0

for the

youngest women, 98 for those aged 30—44, and 2 • 5 percent for those 45 and

ov.

with four or morc children, the inclusIon rates were
10.5 percent, 3.4 percent, and 0, respectively. No non—white COUple.s with
four or more children were included in the sample studied, and only four
percent of the three—child families were included.2 Hastings claims only
to have replicated the findings of previous research, namely: that the
interval between marriage and first birth and between successive births
In fami1i

that

between successive events decrease as

the number of children increases;

not; that, the more recent the marriage the shorter the interval from

marriage to first birth;1 and that the more education a couple has the

longer the interval from marriage to first birth. The selectivity bias
of the sample severely reduces the importance of the support from this
study; but the five findings stand on their own and can all be observed
in Table 25 of the U.S.

much usable information

on the timing of births; much of the research

reported in this dissertation was based on data from the 1965 National
Fertility Study.

Their data show that the lengths of birth intervals of each order
are correlated negatively with the number of children desired and with

the number achjevd. For the entire sample education, age at marriage,
and religion (Catholic-non—Catholic) are not correlated with the length
of birth intervals, but comparisons within parities yield some weak

correlations. The negative relation betwe'u age at marriage and the span
of fertility is stronger for women with more children, although this is
not biologically necessary; Bumpass and Westoff point out that "late"
marriages are at young enough ages for most s'omen to have as many as five

children at longer than average intervals.

Noting the negative relation between a woman's education and the
fertility span, they suggest that this may result in part from more

educated women marrying later. But since, for women with only two
children, education is :tegatively related to the inter—birth interval

and age at marriage

is not, they theorize "a

desire to minimize the span

of fertility in order to be freed for education—related female roles."1
They

also

suggest "that spacing preferences are oriented more

towards the desired duration of child care than towards specific lenghts

for given intervals."2 There is evidence that women who have a short
birth interval because of accidental pregnancy have a subsequent interval

of at least average length. However, women with a longer than average
i interval (successful planners) do not have a shorter than avarage i+l
interval.

evidence about the relationships among labor force participation, birth
intervals, and education, concluding only that once a woman left the
labor force in any interval she was very unlikely to re—enter it in a

later interval. However, he did very little analysis of the open
interval

other

(from most recent birth to the date of the intervie.z).

His

findings are "... that there baa been a recent convergence of

labor force rates between better and less educated women, in some

instnces reversing thetraditional pattern of higher labor force rates
for less educated women." He also noted "... a greater tendency for more
recent cohorts of women to re—enter the labor force after chi1dbearing..."
It appears that much more could be done with these data than
Mott's

simple cross—classifications and calculations of contigent pro-

babilities of labor fotce participation, which might yield some conclusive

results. However, the residents of that state are not representative of

the U.S., being less well—educated, having ler inc-"'s, having higher
labor force participation for women, and consisting of a very large
percentage of Roman Catholics.

The

demographic works may be divided into mathematical models of

population growth, birth rates, and the like with little or no
testing or application and studies of the purely physiological

empirical
aspects of

fertility. Examples of the former include models of the time required
for conception: Sheps derived a model of the expected distribution of

conception is a random event, that
couple in the population is stable over time, and

intervals to conception assuming that

the

fecundability of each

that fecundabilitv varies across couples.2 Other examples are an examination of the
theoretlial effect of truncation on the length of birth intervals3 and a discussion of the effect on birth rates of contraceptive techniques with
various levels of efficiency.4

There

have been empirical studies of the physiological factors

affecting the length of time

required

for conception, Such

as

the length

of the period of post—partum sterility. In a biological study Potter and
Parker used a waiting—time model to estimate the expected time to con—

ception) They found that as the period of infertility lengthened the
likelihood

of sterility

increased rapidly, and that if the couple is not

the number of expected additional months to conception increases
at about one—half month for each additional month of previous conception

sterile

delay. The authors also attempted to relate the time to conceive the
second child to the time to conceive the first, and they report that past
abcrtions have little effect on the time to conception.
Potter analyzed the components of the birth interval into gestation,
post—partum amenorrhoea, anovulatory cycles, time to conceive after
resulTip'ion of ovulation, and pregnancy wastage.2 Among his findings was
that the average birth interval increases somewhat with age probably

because of fetal loss and secondarily due to a decline in fecundability.
ciatias with littIc' contraception, according to Potter, the mean birth
lu
interval varies frozi to to somewhat less than three years, due to differences
in the duration of post—partum amenorrhcea. Finally, he concludes that the
average length o ovulatory exposure (frctn resumption of ovulation to conception) probably varies between four ad seven months for women in their 20's.
Using data for Chilean women, Perez found that the timing of the first
pot—partum ovulation and menstruation depends closely on the lengths of
Cull and partial breast—feeding.3 The average interval to ovulation for

women whose breast feeding was artificially suspended was only 49 days;
for those who stopped spontaneously within fifteen days after childbirth,

60 days; and for all others, 117 days. Among women who breast fed ex-

clusively only 36 percent had ovulated within 18 weeks. Thirty—four
percent ovulated within nine weeks of beginning supplemental feedings

for

their infants. Fifty percent ovulated within three and one—half weeks

of ceasing breast—feeding. The authors also found that most women ovulated
before the first post—partum menstruation: 51 percent of those whose
cycle was 30 to 59 days in length and 83 percent of those over 60 days.
Of more relevance to my research were such studies as those of
the French demographer,

Louis Henry, who

estimated fertility rates,

age—specific fertility rates, and age—specific sterility rates for such
diverse non—contracepting populations as

the Hutterites, eighteenth—

century Canadians, and the seventeenth—century bourgeoisie of Geneva.1

The Hutterjte data were studied more intensively by iieps and by Eaton

and Mayer.2 The former calculated the proportion of Hutterite women
not having a birth of any given order at stated intervals after the

preceding event; Eaton and Mayer estimated the birth probabilities for

women by age in this non—contracepting population. In both studies,
it appears that average fecundability changes little for wonen between
the ages of 18 and 29 and therafter declines gradually; however, this
decline may be due in part to the high parIty of Hutterite women in their

thirties. I decided, based on these studies, that in my empirical work

I could safely assume that the length of time required for conception
to occur is not related

a woman's age.1

In a demographic study that is atypical of that field, Natnboodiri
data from the 1955 Growth of American Families study to show that,

used

not surprisingly, the longer a woman has been married when she gives
birth to a child of a given order (up to the third) the more years she

has worked between marriage and that birth.2 From the data as presented
in the article it is impossible to examine relationships among the
lengths of successive intervals, the length of the total interval from
first to last birth, the work experience after the first child was born,

the

work experience since the birth of the last child, and other rele-

vant

variables such as the wife's education or the husband's income.

fetal, late fetal, neonatal, infant, and childhood (through four years
of age) —— death rates are highest in the shortest intervals. Fetal and
neonatal deaths, which are due primarily to biological factors, are at
their lowest rate when the interval from the preceding birth to the
current conception is around two years (child spacing of about two

years

and nine months). The mortality rate rises sharply as shorter

intervals are considered; it rises, but to much lover levels, as the
interval increases from the opt1nui. Postneonatal (one Month to one year)
and early childhood mortality, affected primarily by environmental

declines monotoulcally with the length of the interval between
births. The longer a child is born after his immediately preceding sib,
the higher are the chances of his surviving to age five.1
One study, using British data, reported higher mortality for all
factors,

ages aad social classes if the first birth occurred within one
year of marriage. It was suggested that this was pr ably because many
maternal

these births were either premature or premaritally conceived. In the
lnttcr instance th mother may have vceived 1.es pre—na'l medical care.
Wray found little evidence f rota developed countries on the relationship, if any, between the lengths of birth intervals and child

morbidity. In poorer countries, a short birth interval is detrimental
to

the health of the eriier child. In these countries physical

developmert during childhood was related to birth intervals in a manner
similar to morbidity. 2
The lowest incidence of prematurity was observed when the Interval
between conceptions was from three to six years in length. Women with

fecundity wh!ch also increased the risk of a premature birth.3

The effect of child spacing on the mother's health is not at all
clear.

little evidence supporting or refuting this assumption.

A Johns

Hopkins study did find the lowest rates of anemia in pregnancy with birth
intervals of forty-eight months or longer. However, the incidence of
hemorrhage, infection, and maternal mortality were not affected by the
interval's length; and hypertensive toxemia was more common in pregnancies

as the birth interval was longer. This may

have resulted, at least in

part, because the mother was older on average the longer the interval
since her preceding pregnancy.1
In another review of the medical literature on the effects on

He concluded: "An interval of approximately two years between
the end of one pregnancy and the beginning of another is associated with
the lowest incidence of late fetal and neonatal

mortality and prematurity.
Survival through childhood is more likely if pregnancy intervals are
three years or more."1 (Such a pregnancy interval implies a birth interval
of forty—five months or more.)

Links also have been found between child spacing and various

aspects of the child's intelligence. A study of middle—class British

families found thatwithin each family sizevocabulary test scores of
children were relatively high when births were widely spaced and relatively
low when births were close together. A study of general attainment by
children in two—child families, standardized by sex, birth order, and
sex- of sib, found the highest scores at each age occurred with intervals
of medium length (two to four-years) as compared to intervals of less than
two and of more than four years. (Only these three r
tegories of intervals

used.) It was concluded that contact with adults was correlated with
intelligence scores; th effect. of the interval, on scores increased as the

Twins represent the ultimate in close spacing of births. It is
generally agreed that twins score about five points lower on IQ tests than
singletons, a difference not accounted for by differences in e;periences
before and during birth but rather due to post—natal environment.3 Twins
who are raised alone, generally because of the co—twin's'death, have IQ
or verbal reasoning scores much higher than twins raised together; their
scores are almost equal to those of singletons despite the fact that such
twins have a

in their low verbal reasoning scores, is due to postnatal rather
than prenatal influences."

Vandenberg also noted that single born children are consistently
faster than twins in language development, IQ's, and reading scores.2

However, he found that when twins were carefully matched with single

born

children who had one sibling near to them in age, the differences

were smaller: twins still performed somewhat more poorly on verbal and
quantitative parts of the tests, but they did about the same as singletons
on spatial tests and scored better on perceptual tests.3 It appears that
children who are not born after a short birth interval are both healthier
and more intelligent, as measured by standard tests.

Althougn knctvledge about contraception has been 'iceprad ero'th

niented income and substitution effects In completed fertility among
working women and, using area averages, for all women.1

Deborah Freedman reported that women with an extensive work
history (occurring primarily pre—maternafly) tend to have almost as
many children as those with little or no labor force experience but

have the births later. This relationship may not hold, true today when
many more women work also after having children. She suggests that in
this

society family size is converging toward a conmionly held norm and

that the important fertility differential is the timing of that common
number of births.2 "This suggests that differential child spacing may

Because

incomes are much lower in Sierra Leone than in the U.S., couples

may be unable to finance large families in a short period of time. These
differences may also be attributable to the fact that probably not more

that

thirty percent of the households in Snyder's sample practice contra-

ception;1 also, the data used in most of the studies cited above and
those used in the research for this dissertation are for U.S. whites only.
Snyder also finds that the relation between income and number of

children is

negative

for younger households and positive for olderones.2

He suggests that this may be because higher—income families delay child
births while they accumulate human and other capital and then make up
for
it in later years. This same phenomenon will be discussed later in this

dissertation

with respect to white families in the U.S.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Work Experience

1967, Mincer and Polachek note peripherally in
their report on human capital investment by femai that, as observed wage
rates and the marginal price of time increase with education, highly
cduc.ted mothers respond by spacIng their children more closely (and by
having fcwer children.)3 Thus total expenditures on children do not
rise nearly as fast as the price of time, when education increases.
Until the past year there seems to have been no research at all
by other econor'fsts in timing and spacing, and still none has attacked
the problem xplicit1y. Therefore, in this dissertation, I have attempted
to determine i'hethcr and how economic and other forces affect the decisioa
by white non—farm couples in the United States with respect to when they
begin child bcarirg and how long they spend in the child—caring life—stage.

The data and variables used to test the model's hypotheses are
described in Chapter III. Chapters IV and V describe, respectively, the
empirical tests of the titnir.g and the spacing hypotheses. The results of

an investigation of some relationships between the timing of the various

demographic events and labor force participation are reported in Chapter
VI.

Chapter VII sumvarizes the theoretical analysis and the empirical

results,

which generally support the timing and spacing hypotheses.

CHAPTER II

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
General Framework

A.

This model assumes that couples receive utility from household
production and consumption activities that may be divided into those that

are child—related and all others. These activities require as inputs
the

time of one or both persons, purchased market goods and services,

and ——

for

child—related activities —— own children.

1.

Parents desire

children because of the "child services" they can produce, and couples

marry

in

order to have children.2

I assume that each couple attempts to maximize the utility it
receives from these various activities and that the utility received by
each partner to a marriage while he or she is still single is considered

none—the—less as part of the life—time utility to be maximized. The

only difference is that there can be no utilit rom child—related
activities before marriage. Thus, the couple's total life—time utility

a function of the levels of each member's non—child—related activities
before marriage and of both their child—related and their other activities
is

after marriage. This utility maximization is constrained by the amount
of time and goods the couple can put into their household activities,
and this depends in turn on the amount of non—labor income available

1This approach was derived from Cary S. Becker, "A Theory of the
Allocation of Time," Economic Journal, LXXV (September 1965), 493—517;
Kelvin J. Lancaster, "A New Approach to Consumer Theory," Journal of
Political_Fcoiioay, LXXIV (April 1966), 132—57; and Jacob Mincer, "Labor

to the couple and on their market wage rates and their productivity in
household activities.1
The amount of time that is available to a husband and a wife in
each time period is fixed; the length of the life—time is taken to be

exogenous. The wife allocates her time between household activities
and labor market activities;2 the husband's time Is used only in market

activities. (See footnote 4, page 24 ).

of human capital leads to higher money wage rates in the future.
The model also assumes that money, like time, cannot be shifted
to an earlier period. That is, a couple's cumulative consumption cannot
exceed cumulative income at any given point in time, for they cannot
borrow against future earnings to finance the goods inputs for current
household activities. Apparently private ir iduals usually are able to

across individuals and may vary for an individual over the lifetime.

analyses of completed fertility (i.e., nurber of children born).1 We

production/consumption activities are the

same to all households. Comparisons of

completed fertility for different
cohorts apparently also have assumed implicitly that these prices do not
change over time.3 In an analysis, such as this, of fertility over a
span of time it seems worthwhile to acknowledge this
assumption explicitly.
The price of time of household members that enters

The pattern of investments in human capital by women is probably
not as straightforward as the monotonically declining path of invest-

ments usually posited for males. Women may invest in on—the—job
training before and/or after the childbearing and rearing period.1

However, given Mincer and Polachek's findings that human capital

during the child caring period and tha' depreciation rates
are greater the larger the stock of capital,2 there are strong economic
incentives to postpone some human capital formation from the pre—maternal

to the period after the last

predicts that an employer will bear a

birth.3 Moreover, human capital
greater share of the costs

of capital acquisition the greater the probability that the employee

remain with his firm and the greater the proportion of the capital
that is firrt—specific. Since greater job continuity can be expected
after the period of child caring than before, the employer should be

will

more willing to help finance human capital investment then; this should
reinforce the tendency for women who will ir substantially in themselves to do so after the period of child caring. Also, the highly
educated woman is more likely than the less—educated woman to postpone
investment until after she has her children in order to shift more of
the cost of the investment to the employer, if persons with more skills
in total also have more specific skills (as suggested by Becker, 1964,
op.

cit.).

Since depreciation is greater the longer the skills are not

used and greater the higher a woman's skill level, this reinforces the
assertion above that woman with more education face higher costs for time—

aat.vites, not only because of earnings or opportunities foregone but beca'c they have a greater amount of market skills which de-

pp. 19—20.

3Ibid., p. 18 presents evidence tending to support this hypothesis.

30.

From this exposition of the various forms the price or substitution
effect can take, it should be clear that for each couple the various
timing and spacing patterns have different costs of child—related activities
associated with them. Spacing a given number of births closer together
will reduce the cost of children (as would reducing the number of births);
the reduction in Costs of closer spacing would be greater the higher is
Having children early in the life cycle, when Pt is usually lower,
would reduce the cost of child—related activities; the reduction would
be more pronounced the steeper the rise in P over time. Therefore,
this model hypothesizes a substitution effect that produces a stronger
incentive to have children close together if P is high and to have
children earlier after completing school1 if P is rising. The higher a
woman's educational level ar4 to a lesser extent, the higher her husband's
income if she is not a labor force participant, the sooner and closer

together she is expected to have children. Also, if labor force parti—

These hypotheses are reinforced by considerations of depreciation:
Women with more education are more likely to plan to re—enter the labor

fcrce

after having children so that considerations of depreciations are of

more concern to them. These women are also subject to the highest rates

of depreciation. If the highly educated woman postpones investment in
her market skills until after the period of child caring, she suffers
less depreciation during that period and is more likely to get her

employer, post—chIldren, to bear some of the investment costs. This

of investment is also economIcally rational because women

after the child caring stage, the less time she is likely to work pre—

will be much lower than for women who do little post—school investing

desire to reduce depreciation, which

at a higher rate as education is greater. And the substitution

providing an incentive for more educated (steeper Pt) women to

presumed greater career commitment and concomitant greater acquisition
of market skills; for it is rational not to acquire these skills until

investment). This should result in less work experience before having
children; a more continuous labor force participation over the lifetime can occur if the woman postponas her career until after having and

Inccune Fffects

Almost certainly the income elasticity for child—related
activities and for children is positive; couples with higher incomes
will demand more child—related activities than those with lower incomes.
They also will demind greater child—inputs to these activities, but child—

inputs are not synonymous with number of children. The 'tnount of child—
inputs available to a couple depends both on the number of children, or

quantity, and on the quality of the

children.1

Although probably no one

definition of child quality would satisfy everyone, perhaps the two most
1rportcnt aspects of quality are the child's health, including at the

whether

extrerc

attainments

or not he survives at all, and his intelligence or

and accomplishments. The literature reviewed in Chapter I

1:;early all recent studies of
the

fertility by econoiist acknowledge

two dimensions of the quantity of children produced and consumed.

In T.W. Schultz, ed., p.cit., Willis defines C=NQ, p..21; DeTray states
that CCN,Q), p. :72: Michael defines C(N) with Q(h(), p. S130;
icn—Ir.h equates C with ON, p. S2C7; au Becker and Lewis specify a

32.

indicates that the timing of the first birth has little or no effect
on child quality, (except perhaps that a very late first birth might

preclude wide enough intervals between later births.) It was also
quite clear, however, that longer intervals between births, at least
up to a maximum of about six years, enhance child

survival, health,
intelligence, and verbal ability.' Thus child quality would be
maximized by havirg moderately long intervals between births, with the
timing of the first birth of only minor consequence. 2
The quantity (N) of children obviously can be increased

by

having more children, but quantity also has a time dimension: During
how much of their lifetime does a couple have children? It is
not
clear what spacing of a given number of births maximizes the quantity
of child—iput5. Two obvious and extreme solutions would be to have
all children as soon as possible, maximizing the child—years
experienced

during the parents' lifetimes, or to have the first child

as early as possible and then space widely, to minir,i the number of
years without children in the home —— i.e., to minimize the "empty
nest" neriod. Whether one of these schemes or some intermediate course

to permit closer spacing the steeper the slope.
The fact that couples with rising incomes, given permanent income,
can finance closer spacing of births does not nean that they will choose

to

do so. Tne diagran and exposition have considered only when a couple

can afford to have

they are expected to demand identical levels of child—related activities.

Therefore, although the restriction on how soon they

sample of 5617 women who were currently married and living .th their
husbands at the tina of the interview late ir. 1965; the
women were aged
eighteen to fifty—four, living in the United States, and able to partici-

pate in an English—language interview.1 Women over forty—four were half—
sampled; Negroes were doubled—sampled but arc excluded from my empirical
analyses. I focused on white, non—Catholic2 mothers from this sample who

The relicion distinction was made because I found statistically
sinifjcant differences be-ueen Catholics and non—Catholics in the way
certain independent variables —— in perticular, education —— affected

timing and spacinr and because I assume basic differences between the

two

groups with respect to thlr taste for child—related activities and the

who did not live on a farm at the time of the interview, and who were
old enough to have almost certainly completed childbearing —— namely
those aged forty to fifty—four.1 Occasionally comparisons were made
between this primary subset of the NFS and other subsets, such as
Catholics, mothers of two

results from the NFS refer to the 585 observations in the primary

function on all husbands of white non—farm mothers aged twenty—five to

fifty—four. (See Appendix B.) The rcsuiting equation was

used

to predict

annual income at age forty for each husband in the smaller sample (of
women forty to fifty—four) on the basis of his own individual characteris-

tics. This predicted—income measure was expected possibly to be more relevant than the, perhaps poorly measured, 1965 income in early fertility

decision. Additionally, Y40 has the advantage of representing income at
a given point on the life cycle income profile, providing a more comparable
measure of income than 11965 for men whose current ages differed over two

detailed, and probably more reliable, information on labor force participation, the earnings of the various family members, and non—labor income.
The NLS is a national probability sample of American women aged
thirty to forty—four.1 The subsample used in this research consisted of
706 mothers who were aged forty to forty—four, white, married once—

spouse present, and not living on a farm. As explained in footnote 1
on page 43, women who had acquired children other than by giving birth
to them were excluded.2 There is a high incidence of missing information
for the observations in this survey; therefore several different subsets
of observations were used, depending on which variables were needed.
The timing variable (Sch—31) is an estimate of the number of months
from the time the woman left school3 until she had her first birth. Unfortunately, the design of the interview questionnaire was such that women
who had never entered the labor force were not to be asked the year they

left schcol (Grad). Of the 706 women, ninety—eight reported no labor

participation; however, all but

forty—one of t

do report the

leaving school. In addition to those forty—one, five of the

wor who did work outside the home lack information on Grad.
The spacing variable, Total Int, is conceptually Identical to that
used with the NFS data. With the NLS data, however, the date of the last

birth is not given. In constructing Total mt I have assumed that the
yo:;ast child in the household at the tina of the interview was the last
child born to the mother. His age as of April 1, 1967 is reported; by

urv October athe "avera'e" month of birth I estimated the month and
year of B and, from that, Total mt. This will, of course, result in a

income,

The wife's income was not included in Y1966 (or in Y1965 from the NLS)

because her decision as to whether to work outside the home is complementary to the timing and spacing decisions; because women's earnings
generally are a small part of total family incorre (for husband—wife

families); because this results in overstated income differences between

with working and non—working wives by not taking account of
the added expenses incurred by the former or the greater household productivity of the latter; and because most w i do not work anyway during
the child caring years.

Several variables relating to labor force participation were used

with

observations

from the NLS, both in the examination of fertility

behavior and in the study of the timing of labor force activities reported
in Chapter VI. The number of years during which a woman worked at least

months (Yrs LF) consists of three components: years worked before
marriage (LF S—I), years worked between marriage and the first birth
(LF 1—B), and the nunber of years worked after the first birth. The first
two of these combine to give the number of years of labor force activity
between leaving school and having the first birth (LF S—B1). The lengths,
in months, of the intervals from school to marriage (Sch — M), from marriage
to first birth (M —
are
B1), and from school to first birth (Sch —
six

B1)
used as independent variables in some regressions on years worked. LFPR
designates the
of the total number of years worked to the total

ratio

number of years since leaving school. The number of months after the
first or after the
birth until the woman entered or re—entered the

last

labor force, if indeed she did, B1 — LF and B —

in soe regressions in the hope that they might reflect some of the
effects of differences in the slope of the lifetime path of
P, under

an assumption that women with greater labor force experience are investing
nr in human capitd and therefore having more sharply rising
P profiles.
Because the predicted income effects of income level and income
slo',e on the timing of B1 differ, tests of the
model require variables
that reasure each or these effects separately. The

are the current (1965 or 1966) reported annual incorte and the level of

included in a regression equation, I assume that the coefficient of U Ed ——

the effect of the husband's education, given his level of income ——
represents the income slope effect and that the càefficient of Y1965, Y1966,
or whatever income, variable has been used, reflects the effect of income

level, given slope. Since the income of one year may not accurately
represent a couple's general economic situation, the size of positive or
negative transitory components being unknown, and since the income
variable in the NFS is not measured well, I have used cohort variables as

proxies for the level of Income. Especially for the National Fertility
Study, a positive and monotonic relation exists between the value of
cohort variable and the general economic condition prevailing when the

couple was in its prime childbearing years. This variable may even have
an added advantage over the more direct income measures, Y1965 and Y1966,

being ex—ante rather than ex—post. That is, the cohort variable is
related to the

their

economic

situation existing when the couple had to make

fertility decisions; current income is relev-'t only to the extent

that the couple correctly foresaw what their income would be in middle—
aie and to the extent that it contains small or no transitory components.
•The variable 1/C, number of children born,

is introduced into most

the equations in order to standardize for the fact that timing and
spacing decisions cannot, for physiological reasons, be iade independently
of the decision as to fa:aily size. I will return briefly to the subject
of completed fertility in Chapter V.
The dependent variables used in studying the spacing decision,
the lengths of the total interval from first to last births and of the
average interval between 'births, are straightforward and the reasons for
t'oir use are self—evident.1 Most previous studies of timing have used,
as tile dependent variable, the length of the interval from marriage to B1.
The inconclusive results are often attributed to inaccuracies in the data,
of

as couples with pre—marital. conceptions report their wedding dates

falsely.1 My model suggests a second explanation: that the most
relevant measure of timing is not the "First
Interval" but rather the
couple's age at B1 or the length of time between leaving school, and
entering the labor force, and B1. I do not suggest that the independent
variables have no effect on the length of the first interval but that,
because the wedding is an action taken by pairs of adults in

considerations for timing are the price of time and income
levels and paths, which are related to the levels of education and labor

force experience. Hence, the more appropriate measure of variations in
timing decisions is the age at

where it can be determined, the
length of time from leaving school to

CHAPTER IV

IRICAL FINDINGS: TIMING
A.

Primary

Samnies

The tables in this chapter present the results of regression
analyses designed to test the hypothesized effects of economic variables
the beginning of the child—
on the timing of the first birth ——

i.e.,

caring stage of the life cycle) Various combinations of the wife's
education, the husband's educatIon, several income variables, and the

number of children born

were

regressed on W Age B1 for observations

from the National Fertility Study. The results are shown in Table 2.
In all regressions containing either the husband's education or a measure
of his income, the regression coefficient of W Ed is between 4.5 and 6.5;
it is significantly different from zero (positive) but, of more relevance,

it is significantly less than twelve (months). That is, each additionai
year of education for the wife

raises her age at B1 by somewhat less than

one—half year. As hypothesized in the discussion r' the substitution
effect above, women with more education have B1 sooner after leaving
chcel —— a little

over a half

year sooner per each year of education.

Although the coefficient is larger when H Ed and income measures are not
included, as W Ed picks up some of the effect of those correlated
variables, it is still significantly less than twelve (months).
The regressions in Table 3 test directly the effects of education
and income on the interval from school to first birth; the sample differs
from

that

used in Table 2 in that it includes Catholics a-'d it excludes

nearly half of the women who have never worked. The coefficients of W Ed
in the regressions which exclude Grad range from —6.10 to —6.82 if the

estimates. If #C is included in such OLS regressions, this

I performed also two—stage least—squares regressions, first with
#C as the dependent variable. Then, in the second step, I substituted the
estimated for the actual numher of children as an independent variable
tancity

in regressions on the timing and spacitg variables. The results,
presented in Appendix C did not seem to justify pursuing further the
2SLS approach.

The very signifIcantly negative coefficient that was found was expected
both according to my theory and because women who are working after

having children are likely to be women whose children are older because

they had the children at an early age. Standardizing for the age of
the youngest child

greatly reduces the significance of the dummy variables,

they are still negative. On balance, the results from including
work experience variables are inconclusive. Moreover, their inclusion has

very

little effect on the coefficients of W Ed, which was itself intended

to reflect in part different rates of increase in the value of time of

education for the husband raises the wife's age at B1
(Table 2) and the interval from her leaving school to the first birth
(Table 3), ceteris paribus. Since families in which the husband has a
high level of education generally have steeper lifetime income profIles,
the income effect predicted this postponement a the childbearing period
as H Ed is larger.
In Table 2, the income variables, other than the cohort measures,
are insignificant except wIth H Ed is excluded from the equation and
except for Y W Ed + 20. In the former case the Y variables almost cerAdditional

tainly are reflecting the H Ed effect. In the latter instance, inclusion
of this variable reduces H Ed to Insignificance; this is partly because

more education the wife has, the later in the

dati set's income variable is not very useful. The NLS data, with their
more adequate income information, reported in Table 3, have the negative
coefficient on Y that the model predicted. The sign of the coefficient

the higher the family's expected lifetime income. With the NLS data,
the wife's age, the complement of the year of birth, was significantly

forty, these corre]ations are not simply statistical tautologies.1

The coefficients of #C and ltC suggest that couples planning
larger families have B1 sooner but that the shortening of the interval

is less than proportional to family size. If

Table 6 presents a comparison of some of the same regressions

the cohort variable used was the husband's year of birth. The results
arc fairly similar, as expected, except that the cohort measure is much
more significant and (ignoring sign) larger when H Age B1 is the

the excess of the husband's over the wife's age (in months) did not change
the coefficients of the other variables very much. Nor did any of the
other demographic variables entered in the regr?ssions on the other timing
and spacing variables produce any changes in the coefficients of economic

noting.
Most of the other studies of timing have concentrated on trying to

variables worth

explain the length of the first interval (from marriage to first birth).
Although the model leads me
well

to expect this interval to be explained less

by economic variables than the timing measures already discussed, I

did regress some of the same variables on 1st mt (Table 6). I expected
that the results would be less significant than those in Tables 2—5,
because the decision to marry rests in part on a desire to start having
children but that they would not necessarily be insignificant, because
the desire to have children is not the only reason for choosing to marry
at a particular time.
The education variables are much less signf :antin these
regressions on first interval than they are in equivalent regressions on
W Age B1. Th cohort variable also Is lees !ignificant although the
reduction is not so extreme as with the education variables. The large
reduction in explanatory power (R2 changes from .26 to .08 for equations
with education, nunber of children, and cohort and from .18 to .03 for
equations with education and cohort only) supports the contention that an
important reason for marrying is to have children. However, the more
traditicral

economic variables

are still of some importance.

The small positive sign on W Ed might suggest that women with more

primarily in order to begin
to have children or that they simply are more profIcient contraaeptors
(and therefore may choose a wedding date without regard to h long they
education are a little less likely to marry

wish to postpone B1.) The latter possibility receives a sm11 bit of
support from a comparison of equations 2 and 16 in Table 6. In equation

6.16, iLh

a su1.:: le of mnen whose first birth was a

reasons.' It is likely that many others chose

to

have only one child rather

than that those womn were sub—fecund. Eighty—nine of 585 women had only
one child; it is unlikely that fIfteen percent of the females who had

children were unable to have more than one. Moreover, comparison of
the mean values of various economic variables for one—child families

families with two or more children suggests that the two groups
did not come from the same (economic) population, as might be expected
if the reason for small family size were physiological. 2 (Table 14,
and

Chapter V).

Ninety—five (of 585) couples reported that their parents gave
them important financial help when they were first married. For this
small subset the coefficients of H Ed in various regressions on W Age B1
were smaller than for the entire sample and even negative, with an

absolute t—value of less than one (Table 8). (The 490 who received no
financial help had larger H Ed coefficients than the entire sample.)

than those who do not. This "income" in the early years tends to reduce

those aged forty—five to forty—nine and 19.4 percent for those between
fifty and fifty—four (Table. 27, p. 181). These high rates were not due
to inadequate medical treatment of Infertility, for the rates

coefficient

The

of the wife's year of birth was less negative in

the sample of couples receiving parental help. Since W Yr B was a
proxy

for

general income levels, the reduction in its impact also was

expected. All

other

coefficients were similar to those reported for the

entire sample.

When women who had been married more than once were added to the
primary sample, raising the total number of observations to 748, most

of the coefficients changed very little (Table 9). However, the slope
and t for

W

Ed were larger, probably because the values of H Ed and

income were for the current husband. In the case of women who were
married more than once, those are not necessarily the relevant values,

although they may be reasonable proxies for information on the previous

husbands. In those cases W Ed picked up more of the variation in the
relevant husband variables.
To summarize, the empirical evidence supports the hypotheses

that if the wife's P is rising, represent by W Ed, she will have B1
sooner after finishing school; that a couple will postpone B1 more if

they anticIpate a rising family income profile — H Ed Is the proxy; end
that they will have B1 sooner

FMPIRICAL FINaINGS: SPACING
A.

Total

Interval

The hypothesized substitution effect on the spacing of births
(subsequent to B1) is that a high price of time for the wife ——

i.e.,

high W Ed if she does not leave the labor force permanently at B1,
high W Ed or husband's income if she does ——

will

induce the couple to

plan on closer spacing between births or, given #C, a shorter total

interval between the first (B1) and last (B) births. The income effect
probably is to enable higher income families to space widely, which

apparently facilitates the production of child quality. This positive
effect will be offset to the extent that the husband's inco'e affects
for non-labor force wives, producing a negative substitution effect.
If the slope of the income profile has any effect on the spacing of
births, it niy cause closer spacing intended to offset the later start

of child—bearing occasioned by the steep income prfile.
The various specifications of the regression equation in Table
JO yielded the

predicted negative coefficient on W Ed. From the c

efficients it can be seen that three additional years of education for
a woman reduce the total birth interval for a given family size by five

or six months (Equations 10.3 or 10.6). If family size is not held

constant the reduction is btccn thirteen and fifteen months (Equations
10.1 or 10.4). Thus,

as

education and P rise, women have their

children in a shorter span of titre and/or they have fcwer children) As
will be noted in Chapter VI, they may also spend less time at home after
the last birth.2

The results for data from the National Longitudinal Survey (Table
11) are sImilar but the coefficients and t—values are sr.ialler; much of

the difference in results probably resulted from the errors in the

measurement of Total mt

the NLS

data.

(high H Ed) children might be spaced more closely together. In reThe

gressions on the NFS data the coefficient is positive but of low

significance. Since the income measure for the NFS data is not good,
H Ed may be picking up some of the income level effect. In regressions

on the LS data, which has more adequate inco

information, the

coefficient of H Ed is negative.

A large value for the income variable was expected to cause shorter

force; an offsetting positive influence results from the income effect, as
couples with higher incomes demand more child-related activities and

child quality cnd can afford lorer bIrth intervals. This is based on
an assumption that prospective parents believe that longer birth intervals
produce more quality per child, as suggested by the authors of the

articles cited in

Chapter

I. In regressions on FS data the coefficients

of the several income measures are negative and insignificant

(Table 10).
The coefficients of Yl966, for the NLS data in Table 11, are positive; the

and about 2.4 if #C and I/C2 are omitted from the regression equation.

Although the :csults are inconclusive,

since the income data are apparently

more reliable in the National Longitudinal Survey than in the
National
Fertility Stud,, 1 would conclude that the positive income effect is
stronger than that part of the substitution effect that works through
the husband's incore for women not in the labor force. Still another

possible explanation for the difference in signs between the two data
sets is that, since they represent two substantially diiferent cohorts ——

the NFS —— the income effect may have changed. Finally, in addition to
its other shortcomings, Y1965 measures incomes for husbands of many
different

ages, not a desirable characteristic for a "permanent income"

proxy.

In some regressions on the

NFS data, Yr Mar was introduced to

reflect changing economic conditions over time. But, its strongly
negative coefficient probably was inevitable, however economic condiUons
varied across time; for more recently married couples cannot have birth
intervals that are as long as those who were married earlier can.
Similarly, the coefficient of the Age variable in Table 11 reflects the fact
that some women do have children after the age. of forty, greatly lengthening
Total Int for them.

These reressjons were run on other subsets of the National

of their births as soon as possible are included in this subsample,
while approximately two hundred (or 260) of the

W Ed and H Ed are more significant in regression on families with

one—child families may have resulted because, for want of a

better alternative, I had assigned the value zero for the length of
the interval fron B1 to B to one—child families (B1 to B1); therefore,
the data are not homoskedastic. Also, the relationship between the
number of children and the total Interval may not be able to fit the
specified "b1. #C + b2. #C2." Finally, it is possible that another

In regressions on the various sub—sets of the 1965 NFS (Tables 10

and 12), when the nunber of children is not held constant the coefficient
of Y1965 is much less negative or is even positive although, in all
cases, its t—value is very snail. In regressions on the 1967 NLS (Table
11) not standardizing for family size more than doubles the size of
the (positive) coefficients of Y1966 and raises their t—values. This
suggests that higher income couples have had more children. Although
this is not a study of completed frti1ity, we may note that the income
effect apparently not only makes possible wider spacing of births but
also results in more births. Note

one response to a husband's inability to work

The total result of the timing and of the spacing (and of the

number) decisions can be seen in the regression results in Table 15; the
dependent variable is the wife's age in months at the birth of the last

child 01 Age B). The first two equations show that an additional year
of education leads to an insignificant increase in a woman's age at B.
This results partly from having fewer children, but most of the year is

"recovered" by having children soonerand/or closer together (equations
15.3 to 15.5). Even if the woman with more education has the same number
of children as a woman with less education, each year of education adds

only 2.6 months to her age at B.
High H Ed raises a woman's age at B primzii1y by causing her to

start childbearing later. The income variab s difficult to analyze
because of inadequacies in the variable as a measure of expected income

young ages or even as an accurate measure of current income. Women
in the most recent cohorts completed childbearing at a younger age than
at

older women in the sample; this may be due in part to the more recent

being able to begin childbearing sooner because of better
economic conditions, but it could result simply becau.e the most recent
cohorts have not had a chance to have a last birth at a late age. As
cohorts'

in tha c:a of the total interval, the s1i'ht1y le:s r- :e

effect

when family size is not held constant probably reflects a larger family
size for higher income couples.
The reader nay wonder whether the negative effect of W Ed on the
Total mt isn't merely the result of women with more education being
older when they marry and having to compress birth intervals so that they
cart complete their childbearing at about the same age as other women.
The regressions on Total mt in Table 16 .'cre run ioth with and without

the wife's ige at marriage being held constant. Not unexpectedly, the
coefficient of WEd was lower when W Age Mar was included in the

thirty percent when family size
is held constant and by thirty--seven percent when family size varies.

of children is not reported directly In this data set but was reconstructed
from answers to several questions on missing children and acquired children
and from a count of household members listed as children of the respondent;
thus, it is subject to more measurement error than the 1/C variable in most

data sets. The average interval equals the total interval in months from
to B divided by one less than the number of children; it is undefined

if nl. The lengths of the intervals relating the dates of school leaving,
marriage, and B1 were expressed in months; the amount of labor force
experience in those intervals was measured in years, using in both

instances, the units of measurement used in the original data set. Dummy
variables are described as they are introduced.

There are 706 women who were white, non—farm, married once—spouse

children. Since labor
force experience is recorded for the three mt rvais from school to
marriage, marriage to first birth, and first birth to the interview, there
are eight possible combinntions of labor force participation or non—
participation for each women. Table 17 presents the participatlor. rates
for each of the three intervals and the probe.bility of participation or
non—participation in an interval given the labor force status in an earlier
interval. The mean values of several variables of interest, by labor force
participation in the three intervals, is presented in Table 18.

this study should be extrapolated

to more recent cohorts with caution, for labor force participation by
married women has been increasing; indeed, more of these women may have

B.

LFP Before

I examined the

B1

components of the

interval

from leaving school to

the date of the first birth separately as well as j toto. Table 19
presents regression coefficients for the effects of several variables on
the amount of labor force experience between school and marriage, given

the length of that interval. Table 20 presents regressions for the interval
from marriage to B1; Table 21, the total interval from school to B1. In
each table observations with a. negative interval were excluded from the
analysis, as were observations for which Grad, the year of leaving school,
was unknown.

In each table results are presented for all women whether or

not they worked in that interval and then for only those women who were in
the labor force during the interval.

From regression equations 19.1 through 19.12, it is obvious that
the wife's education level is a very important determinant of how much

of the interval from school to marriage she sp ds in the labor force.
The higher her education the more she will work between school and

marriage, given the length of that interval. The larger coefficients and
t—values for W Ed in the first six equatioas. compared to 19.7 through 19.12

indicate that the level of education also affects whether or not a woman

will work at all after leaving school. The average W Ed for the 508

wci vho worked in this interval was 11.45 years; for all 612 women, 11.33

(Table

22); therefore the average education of the non—workers was approxi—

mately 10.74 years.

1

The variables for the husband's attributes, H Ed and Y1966, were
not expected to affect the wife's labor force decisions premaritally.

The positive but insignificant signs may be indicative of women who are
more firnly attached to the labor force meeting and marrying men with

higher education and/or income, but this is only speculation. Nor dd
the ntmber of children a woman would later have affect significantly the

aot of her lbor force parttcpaton in the pre—marital interval, given
the length of that interval, although the negative sign does seem appropriate.

increased sigziificaatly her work experience after school, before marriage.

This re1atioship disappears in the

sample

of all women regardless of work

experience before marriage. These results may be affected by the omission
of

the women who never worked at any

interval

time

(omitted because the length of the

from school to marriage cannOt be

determined); 104 women in this

did not work before they married did work after. Inclusion of
the other women would raise the (positive) significance of the dummy
variable in equations 19.4 and 19.6.
The coefficient of the interval in months, .07, indicates that
lcngthening the interval by one year increases the time spent in the labor
force by about twelve times .07 or .84 years. The average interval for
sample who

all women was 51.21 months; for those who worked, 56.77 months, indicating
much shorter intervals — about two years1 —— for women who did not work.
Same of these 104 non-workers may have had very short or even zero—length

intervals. (The marriage month was reported but the mnnth of leaving
school. was not; my assumption that the month of le school was June
may have produced positive

intervals where they did not exist.) Also,

force e::prrlerice was reported to the nearest year; so Lhai. any woan
who married within six months of leaving school must report no labor force
lbor

participation during that interval.
Only 250 or about thirty—eight percent of the 656 women who had

their first birth subsequent to their marriage worked during any of the
twenty—eight months (average) between the
educational

for

marriage and B1.2 The average

level was nearly one—half year highr for ie :oi:ers than

the entire sample, 11.89 as against 11.44.

Their husbands had more

education and income. The probability of their participating in the labor
force after was much higher —— sixty—four percent for workers, forty—
six percent for the total sample, and therefore thirty—five percent for
the non—workers.

The only si2njfjcant variable in the regression on work experience

bct:2n marriage and first birth (Table 20), other than the length of the

rather than quitting her job. If she does

to

continue working she is likely

work somewhat more than the woman who will not work once she has begun

An additional year in this period adds less labor force experience
than

an additional

year before marriage. Even among only those women who

did work in the period between marriage and B1 an additional year added to
the interval results in. only a little more than

two—thirds of a year of

labor force experience.
The dependent variable in the regressions in Table 21 is total work

I

first attempted to predict whether a woman would enter the labor

force after having children, on the basis of her education, her husband's
education and income, and measures of the extent of her childbearing and
labor

force interruption —— the number of children

she bore, the length

the average interval, and the length of the total interval from B1 to
B. In the regressions reported in this section, 1 eliminated observations
eporting a husband's and others' income of less than $1,000 in 1966 on
of

the assumption that these were mainly refusals to answer or reporting
'rrors. Although this reduced sample sizes, that cost seemed justified
here, for Yl966 was expected to be an important consideration or to be
'orrelated with important factors in determining a woman's post—B1 labor
dorce behavior)
The dependent variable in the regressions on ble 23 is a dichotomous
'rariable whose value is "one" if the

ic is that she will work even after having children. The strong negative
sign on the

income variable also is not

surprising: data in Table 14

dicated that many mothers who work report they do so

because

of family

i:ancial need.
The negative signs on the fertility variables were also predictable;
fo: uc:cn who have m:r.y children or who have them far apart are probably
committed to market work. It should be noted however that many women

SUHMARY

This dissertation has analyzed some economic aspects of the
timing and spacing of births and examined women's labor force participa-

tion relative to this timing and spacing. According to the model
developed in Chapter II women with more education, who have a higher
price of time
lifetimes than

and a more steeply rising P profile over their

do less educated women, should have their children closer

together and earlier than less well educated women. This is primarily
because child—related activities are time—intensive; close spacing
produces more of a saving for women with high Pt than for other women.

the first birth (B1) early produces more of a cost

These effects are reinforced to the extent that women with more
education have a greater labor force commitment and acquire more depre-

ciable market skills. Aside from the fact that the present value of

is lowered as the receipt of that income is postponed, the most
prfIabla timing of a woman's labcr force participation Is In one continuous perlod,after childbearing.1 This allows the woman to acquire

The income effect depends on both the level and timing pattern of

incomes should, other things equal, have the
first birth sooner and subsequent births more wIdely spaced. Those with
a stecply rising income, especially in the early adult years, should have
B1 later; this later start would probably cause them to have subsequent

year

older for each additional year of schooling. Since an additional

year of education raises women's average age at leaving school by
slightly more than one year (based on my calculation on published 1960

Census tables), the women with more education were having B1 sooner
after leaving school. This finding was confirmed by regressions on
another data set which found a significant negative effect of wife's
U.S.

education

on the

interval between

leaving school and B1.

In both data sets the husband's education had a positive effect
on wife's age at B1 (given her education) and on the interval from

to B1. In the data set with more reliable information on family
income, income's effect was to shorten the interval from school to B1)
If the income variable measures the level of family income and the
husband's education, given income, is regarded as a proxy for the slope

the lifetthe income stream then these results support the hypotheses

about the income effect on the timing of

education and the size of the slope of the income profile is positive.

Because the wife's year of birth is positively correlated with the

level ot economic conditIons it was used as a proxy for the
(expected) level of family income. It had the expected negative effect
of an income level measure on the timing of B1. A similar result was
observed in the second data set when using the year the wife left school
general

as

a cohort variable; but since those women spanned only five, not fif-

teen, years of age, the cohort measure is affected strongly by the level

of education, as well as by the cohort, of the wife. The interpretation
of the cohort effect in regressions on both first interval and total
interval is muddied somewhat because the time period represented by the

cohort varic5le limits the dependent variable; the average age at B1 for

The results of the regressions on the husband's age at marriage

were similar except that a—squared was higher, primarily because the

cohort variable (the husband's year of birth) was much more significant.
RegressIons on different sub—groups of the population of white, non—farm,
non—Catholic Americans did not produce notable differences in the results
reported above, excpt that for couples who received substantial financial
help from their parents in the early years 'of marriage the t—values of
the wife's education, the husband's education, the completed family size,

cohort variable all were reduced. This is to be
raising of the family income (and flattening of the

and the

expected, since

this

income profile)

is not reflected in the independent variables.

The total effct of family income and wife's and husband's education on the interval from marriage to first birth is significant but the

Individual effects are not. Only the cohort variable, year married, (and
the family size variables) retained their significance when the interval
to

B1 was measured from the wedding date rather ti from the date the

woman left school.

Tests of the hypotheses about the spacing of births are described
in Chapter V. The higher the wife's education the shorter the total
interval between B1 and her last birth (B), as predicted by the model
because of the substitution effect. The effect is even stronger f
fari1v size is not held constant, as highly educated woen also have fewer
children.
The sign of the husband's education in regressions on the total
interval is positive and insignificant for the NFS data, perhaps because
it is flickIng up some of the income effect from that sample's less than

A negative sign was emected. The weakly positive coefficient in the NFS
data may also represent an education—related demand for child—quality

even though this raises the total cost of children to them.
The ch-igcs in the coefficients when I stndardized for family size
suggest that families with higher incomes have more children. As noted
above, much or all of the negative coeffic tt on the cohort variable,

that more recent cohorts have not had time to have long total intervals.

among these variables, although some of the effects are offsetting:
High levels of W Ed and

11

Ed shorten the total interval while the high

income associated with more education tends to lengthen it.

CertaInly at lcz t

part

of the explanation for the small

coefficients in some of the NLS regressions is the inclusion of Catholics

in those datasets. Certain of the independent variables have completely
opposite effects on the

dependent

variables for Catholic and for non—

Catholic couples. (See Appendix H.) Still another possible partial
explanation

rn lie in the inclusion

of women

with

less than

nine

years

of education. Although a linear relationship was assumed between W Ed
and TotalInt, for example, from the data of Table 28 it appears that

length of the total interval does not change at all for education
levels from zero through nine to eleven years bnt that it decreases for
education classes "nine •to eleven" through "sixteen and over." Of the
706 observations in the flLS sample, 103 had eight or fewer years of
the

education, enough to bias downward the coefficient.
Finally, the observed relationships may have

been blurred or

weakened if knowledge of contraceptive techniques is correlated with

t iS s.'- .:& rLportcd as
occurring sooner than desired because of contraceptive failure or non—use;
(rlso,a few worsen reported difficulty in conceiving when desired.)
Women who are inefficient contraceptors may have shorter intervals. On
the other hand, women who know that they are efficient contraceptors may
have children sooner than others because they need not fear a long
fertile interval after their last desired birth. Thus, the effect of
ta:' LirtJ to wo.. n in

differential

knowledge of fertility control is ambiguous.

tost signiricant contributions was the separating of the effects

of wife's educatIon, noted in Childspacinc and other publications, into
at least some of its components; the effect of the level of her education

was assessed separately from that of correlated variables such as her

husband's education or income. Secondly, I have demonstrated that non—
Catholic couples respond differently to education and income than Catholic
couples ira their tiring and spacing of births. Finally, as the model
predicted and the empirical evidence bore out, researchers have in the
past

been analyzing

traditional

variable

the

"wrong" first birth interval; instead of the

"interval from marriage to first birth," the timing decision

that differs across couples in response to economic forces is

the interval from leaving school to having the f.::t child, (or the age
at B1 given the education level.) This seems to be an important
innovation; I hope analysis of this interval will be pursued in the
future.

If one had to compare the relative impact on couples of timing
and spacing decisions and of the decision on family size, it is likely

additional child raises the Costs of child—
related activities more than do changes in the timing or spacing of a
given number of births. An additional child probably also reduces labor
force participation by the wife by more than do wider birth intervals,
although the 1960 Census did show women with W Ed 16 having four children
in nearly the same length of time that women with W Ed 9—11 had three
children. Although completed family size can assume only discrete,
integer values, the level of child—related activities produced and consumed in a household is a continuous variable because parents can alter
