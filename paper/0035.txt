Changes in the Recession Behavior of Wholesale PriceE:
The l920s and Post-World War 11*
Phillip Cagan

I. Introduction
Inflation has been stronger in the United States since World War II
than in any other three consecutive decades of the nation's history.
Prices have declined less than they used to in periods of business

recession, and the declines have offset less of the increases during business expansions even though the latter have also diminished.

This change in cyclical behavior lies at the heart of the 'inflation

problem" as it has been discussed in recent years. The present
study

examines

the recession behavior of wholesale prices since World

War II and compares it with the 1920s as the most recent period of
earlier recessions with

in

comparable severity. The focus is on changes

recession behavior, possible bias in the data, and differences

in behavior between various groups of wholesale prices. (Differences

between wholesale and consumer prices, though of importance,

are

not examined here.) The purpose is to extend the evidence on the
degree and uniformity of the chang in price behavior and to test
various interpretations of those changes.

the declines were much less in the four following 1949. The decline
relative to the exransion rate has diminished steadily since l9'),

culminating in 1970 with the perverse cyclical behavior of the re-

cession rate exceeding the expansion rate. Such perversity occurred
only once before in 1894 for this index. The rate of change of the aggregate index is graphed in Chart 1.

subgroups of wholesale prices available since 19l, basic materials,

as low or below those of some postwar cycles. Although it was not
unusual in the 192-Os and earlier for the expansion rates to be low,

it was rare for the recession rate not to drop appreciably below
zero. It is true that the cycles in business activity have been

to

reduce it by one third (.85 x .79 = .67).

McAllister's

tables indicate that nearly all the reduction after

the first revision was due to the reduced amplitude of the finished goods

index. For the later revision, the 1945-49 overlap in Table A shows that
all the reduction occurred in the components for intermediate and finished

goods; the amplitude of the materials component actually rose. These reductions likely reflect the addition of less volatile prices. Simply
adding more items, once the number already exceeds a few hundred, would

This can be shown as follows. Suppose an index Z is composed

of n prices (xi), all with the same weight and variance2 and a correlation

R with each other. (This example abstracts from changes in
the weighting and variance of new items and concentrates on changes
in number of items only.)

McAllister

also examined the number of reporters per individual

price series, which has generally increased. The use of more reports
for each series increases the probability of catching and recording small
changes in market prices, but averaging tends to smooth the movements

in individual price quotations. The effect on cyclical amplitude,
however,

is probably. minor.

To avoid the problem of changing

coverage

and

weighting,

the present

study analyzes frequency distributions of price changes for the same

products. Section II presents distributions of subindexes of wholesale
prices for which the converage of products has continued from the 1920s

to 1970 without major change. They make up most of the aggregate index
in the 1920s but only half by weight in the 1960s. These subindexes
allow us to compare the behavior of the same prices in the two mild re-

cessions of the 1920s with the five after World War II. (The dates are

those shown in Table 1.,) The 1930s and World War II are omitted as
not being comparable with the mild postwar cycles. Section III
analyzes frequency distributions of the prices of 1100

individual

products which have no gaps or major changes in specification from

1947 to 1970. Section IV utilizes the Stigler-Kindahl data on prices collected from buyers in order to determine whether and to what

extent BLS reports fTom sellers are biased. These sections are designed to identify and circumvent possible bias in the cyclical behavior of the aggregate indexes.

Possible Explanations of the Reduction in Cyclical Amrlitude
As a first step toward explanation of the changes in price behavior, Section V analyzes prices according to three characteristics of products and markets: the degree of processing and durability of products, the fraction of value added in production, and the

market concentration of firms. These three were chosen because they
are relevant to various theories of price behavior and also because

the necessary data are available. Durable products are held in
inventory, high value added reflects a preponderance of wage costs,
and high market concentration can lead to tacit collusion on pricing.

All of these are thought to make prices less subject to shifts in

-7-

demand and less volatile. It is conceivable that the effects on
prices of high wage costs and concentration have intensified over
the postwar period to produce the observed attenuation in price

responses. A grouping of prices by the degree to which they are
subject to each of these characteristics helps to determine the
importance of these influences.

Section VI summarizes and interprets the findings.

II

Comparison of Post-World War II with the 1920s
Does the long-run decline in cyclical amplitude from the l920s to
post-World War II pertain to xmst of the individual price series
or is it largely a reflection of changes in the composition of the

aggregate indexes? It is desirable to examine indexes which have
had little change in coverage. Price series from the l920s to 1970
are available without breaks for only a small number of individual

products, but many continuous series exist for groups of essentially

the same closely related products. There are 48 major component
series of the wholesale price index which are available from 1926

to

1970, and 44

series make

up 93

these can be extended back to 1923.

The 48

per cent by weight of the 1926 aggregate index though

only 50 per cent of the 1970 index. (The 44 series make up 92 per cent
of the 1924 index.) These are mostly the second-level price indexes in
BLS

coding which are just below the first level of industry aggregates,

though some available third-level series were substituted where the corresponding second-level index began too late and

did

not cover the full

period. The 48 series are identified in Appendix Table B. The components
and

internal weighting of these series have changed over the years, of

course, but the products covered by

These

changes in specification do not greatly affect the

rates of price change within a single

period

since the

business cycle, but over a longer

such changes may reflect developments in the product which alter

price behavior. So far as these series are concerned, such developments
cannot be distinguished from the changes in coverage which accompany

them. Nevertheless, these 48 series, though of restricted importance in
the later period, avoid much of the composition and weighting bias of the
aggregate index. (The coverage of Section III, which deals with individual
product prices, was feasible only for the post—World War II cycles.)
To determine the range and pattern of price changes among these
series, we may plot frequency distributions rather than construct an

aggregate index. The average level of each series was calculated for the
three months surrounding the peaks and troughs of seven National Bureau

on the horizontal axis.
Recession Rates

Chart 2 presents cumulative frequency distributions of the
percentage of rates in each interval for the seven recessions.

The chart shows that the distributions shift in successive cycles
toward smaller negative and larger positive rates of change, except
the distribution for 1949 which lies to the left of most of the
1927 distribution and of the upper half of the 1924 distribution.

In the 1949 recession,prices declined from the inflated levels carried over
from wartime, so that this episode may not represent typical peacetime
behavior.
The distributions for 1927, 1949, and 1970 have similar shapes and
differ mainly in horizontal position; the entire distributions shift

fairly uniformly to the right for successive recessions. Compared with
these three, the variability of price changes is much greater for 1924

and much less for the three recessions from 1954 to 1961. The latter
three are much steeper than the others in the middle range around a zero

rate. Their steepness reflects not only a low variability but also a bunching at low positive rates: Compared with the curve for 1927 and particularly 1924, these three are deficient in the number of price declines
relative to increases, though declines are by means uncommon and represent
for these three from 41 to 52 per cent of the total number.

The successive rightward shifts of the distributions except for

1949 are summarized by various measures of the average price change in

Table 2. The two constant-weight mean rates differ from the rate of change
of the aggregate index in the last column, reproduced here from Table 1,

not only in coverage but also in the method of calculation. Here the
rates of change of each component are averaged, whereas for the aggregate
index the rate of change is calculated after the levels of the component
series have been averaged.

These measures of price response rank the recessions generally
in the same order, but the use of weights and changes in the weights

do lead to some sizable differences. For the last three recessions
in particular, the weighted indexes reduce the rightward shifts shown

by the unweighted mean and median. The weighted indexes

rank

the 1958 and 1961 recessions out of chronological order, while the
median and unweighted mean show progressive rightward shifts in
the postwar distributions..6 The weights place more importance on

6The 192i distribution, which in Table 2 has the largest mean
rate of decline except for 1949, appears to be representative of
earlier recessions back to the early 1890s in both the mean and

variability of the rates of change. This observation is based
on the distributions of specific cycles in over 100 wholesale

price series. See Frederick C. Mills, The Behavior of Prices,

NBER, 1927, Table 139, p. 42l

prices which rose more in 1958. This is examined further in Section
V below. The weighted indexes are generally preferable as indicators of aggregate behavior, but they canemphasize developments in
a relatively small number of markets in which the value of shipments
is very large.

Recession minus Expansion Rates
Insofar

as rates of

price change

respond

to business recessions grad-

ually rather than abruptly, the recession rates minus
pansion

the

preceding ex-

rates (both on an annual basis) will be more indicative of that

effect than the recession rates alone. Since rates of price change in
expansions

vary considerably, the shape as well as the mean of the dis-

tribution is affected. To determine how much, the expansion rates for
each series were calculated for the sevencycles and subtracted from the
corresponding

recession rates. The expansions

ran from

peak of the reference cycles, modified for four of
year averages were used for

and

the trough to the

the cycles: Calendar-

the beginning of the two expansions in 1921

1924 instead of the three months surrounding the troughs because not

all the needed monthly data have been published. (The use of annual averthe
ages reduces the magnitude and probably/variability of the expansion rates.)
The first expansion after World War II was shortened to run from February
1947 to November 1948 to conform to the period used later in Section III

where data before 1947 are not available. And the last expansion was
started in December 1965 instead of the 1961 trough, because the inflationary
second half of this unusually long phase seemed more appropriate here than

the full period. Except for the two truncated phases, the difference

between recession and expansion rates is equivalent to a measure of
total cyclical amplitude.

The cumulative frequencies of the change in rates of price
change from expansion to recession are presented in Chart 3 for the

cycles. Four of the subindexes are not available before 1926,
the 1924 and 1927 distributions comprise only 4 series. All

seven
so

seven distributions lie further to the left than their mates in

-12-

Chart

2 for recession rates alone, because expansion rates are

typically positive and the subtraction moves the recession rates

in a negative direction. The distributions in Chart 3 are also
generally flatter, indicating greater variability among the components; as a result they are less steep around zero.
The post-World War II distributions shift successively to the

by
right, as can be seenparticularly/the medians and percentages of
declining series.

-

These shifts, which are more prominent here than in
Chart 2, are not a mechanical result of the method of computation.
There is no arithmetical reason for the change in rates of change
in successive recessions to be higher or lower than previously,
even if the rates had an upward trend, which was true only of the

1960s. These recession-minus-expansion rates are a way of allowing
for trends in prices and focusing on recession deviations from
trend. Thus recession responses have attenuated, even allowing for

rising price trends. The progressively higher level of the rates
later
of price change in the / recessions shown in Chart 2 reflects both
ratecarried over from the preceding expansion and the progressively smaller decline in recession rates relative to, expansion
rates.

III

Changes Since World War II
The subindexes used above are adequate to demonstrate a decline in

anplitude and variability of price responses since the 1920s. Those
data lack breadth of coverage and

precision,

however. Since

they

are subject as was noted to internal changes in weighting, which are
generally minor, but also to changes in components, which may often

—13-

be important, composition bias was not absent. We may obtain a more
precise picture of changes in cyclical behavior since World War II
by confining the analysis to individual product prices (the fifth

level of the BLS code). Although few of the individual price series
comprising the wholesale price index span the period from the l920s

to 1970, 1106 run from 1947 to 1970, and an additional 32 series

ver all but the 1970 recession. These 1100-odd price series are
all that the BLS publishes which have no break and pertain to the
same product over the period, though even these undergo minor changes

from time to time in the specification of products which cannot be

avoided. The coverage by industry is shown in Appendix Table C.

difference) are presented in Chart 4. As before the

series have not been seasonally adjusted. These distributions are
broadly the same in shape and position as those in Chart 2, but also are smoother and provide a sharper picture of differences between

the recessions. Chart 4 differs from Chart 2 mainly in the center
segment of the distributions, which is steeper here -- showing less
variability -- because of the inclusion of many more of the less vol-

atile prices of manufactured goods. The middle three distributions
for 1954, 1958, and 1961, which are very close together, are steeper
around zero than the other two, suggesting a downward rigidity of
prices in which the rates bunch at low positive rates (mainly zero).

This bunching reduces the number of declining series in these three

recessions to a1tst 30 percent; this is discussed further in Section IV.

The bunching at zero partly obscures the relative position of
the distributions, though they clearly shift rightward from re-

cession to recessions As was done for Chart 3, we may eliminate
most of the zero bunching and obtain more distinctive distributions
by taking the differences between the recession and expansion rates.
This is presented in Chart 5 for the same 1100-odd series covered by

Chart 4. The expansions run from the trough to the peak with the
exceptions previously used for the first and last cycles: the first
runs from February 1947 to the 1948 peak because most of the series
are not available earlier, and the second runs from December 1965

to the 1969 peak in order to focus on the inflationary second half
two
of that phase. The truncation of these/phases generally increases
the measured expansion rates of price change and so tends to increase
the size of measured declines in the rates from expanion to reces-

sion. Thus the 1949 distribution stands out even more here than
in Chart 4 because its short expansion period catches the bulge
in prices following the termination of World War II price controls
in mid-1946 and records high rates of change.
Chart 5 can be viewed as measuring the recession rate of each,

price relative to its trend, where the trend is estimated by the
previous expansion rate. (A better estimate would be the average
rate of change for the three cyclical phases of previous expansion,

recession, and succeeding expansion. This more elaborate computation
was not done.) Recessions in this view work to reduce rates of
price change, but the level of prices can continue rising until --

if ever --

the rate gradually declines to zero. Consequently, re-

cession rates are correlated with the preceding expansion rates. The
postwar phenomenon of inflationary movements persisting in the face

the response of prices to recessions As shown in Chart 5, the
responses measured as changes in the rates of change have progressively declined fairly uniformly along the entire range of price

changes except for the very large declines. By 1970 the median
response to recession as measured here was virtually

zero. The

magnitude of the dec1ir in responses is recorded by various measures of the distributions in Table 3. By either the mean, median,
or percentage of declining series, the rates of change (top section)

in recessions became less negative or more positive, though not
entirely in sequence, and the changes in the rates (that is, recession-minus-expansion rates) did so entirely in sequence for all
three

measures. The 1966-67 mini-recession has been

added to the

bottom group to provide a further test of the chronology of the shifts

in price behavior. It falls in its chronological order for the
median and percentage of declining series and is only slightly out
of order with 1961 for the mean.

The severity of postwar business cycles haC generlly been
decreasing in real terms, which conceivably might account for ihe

declining response of prices. This cannot be said of the large decline in response from the l920s to the later postwar recessions,

because the differences in severitythere are slight. But it is a

possible reason for the declines following l949 The evidence on
this point has been assembled in Chart 7. Various measures of the
distributions of recession_minus_expansion rates are plotted for the

five postwar recessions and the 1966-67 mini-recession. The chart
graphs the measures of Table 3 and Table 5 (presented later), the
change in rate of change of the weighted aggregate index, and the
change from peak to trough rates of corresponding cycles in the in-

dustrial component of the aggregate. A ranking of the severity of
the recessions in real terms is also presented. (This ranking omits

expansions. The severity of the total amplitude of business cycles
has

also been diminishing but by less.)
All the measures of price response decline over the period as

a whole, and the ndian and percentage of rates below zero show sig-.

nificant declines from every recession to the next. Here the slight
overall response of prices to the 1970 recession does not appear as
a new phenomenon but as simply another step in the postwar progres-

sion. By contrast, the ranks of severity do not decrease in exact

sequence: 1949 and 1958 tied for st severe and 1961 and 1970 tied

r next to least severe. None of the price measures follow the time
pattern of the ranks. The price responses in the 1966-67 mini-recession are conspicuously out of order with its severity. Based on
this evidence, therefore, the declining response of prices appears
to have occurred sequentially, due presumably to a set of ins titu-

tional and expectational developments, and not due solely to the
overall reduction in severity of recessions,though it no doubt contributed.

It might also be concluded that the inflationary climate of
the expansion is apparently not crucial either, because the 1958
distribution followed upon a more inflationary expansion than did
the

1961 distribution which is farther to the right.

-17-

Since the response of prices to recessions has progressively
diminished, it is natural to ask whether the time lag of the response

has lengthened. To provide an answer we may examine the distribution of price changes for the eight nnths following each trough.
This span was selected because it terminates the first cycle in
June 1950 as prices erupted at the outbreak of the Korean War, arid

last cycle in August 1971 as a price freeze was imposed. To
allow comparison between the cycles, eight nths was used for the
other recovery periods as well. To facilitate comparison with Chart
the

5,

the rate of change of each price in the preceding expansion phase

was subtracted from these rates for the eight-month period follOw-

ing the trough. The cumulative distributions of these rate differences are

in Chart 6, shown earlier.

7The number of prices included here is 1104, 34 less than in
Chart 5 (the 32 series not covering the 1970 recession were excluded here from all the distributions, as well as two other ser-

ies inadvertently). These minor differences in total number of
series are of no consequence.

While the distributions in Chart 6 are quite similar in shape

to those in Chart 5, they are closer together. Compared with the
recession distributions in Chart 5, there was a shift to the right
in the reco'treries following 1949 and 1954, almost no shift follow-

ing 1958 and 1961, and a slight shift to the left following 1970.
Thus, while the, recoveries from the 1949 and 1954 recessions brought

the usual strengthening of prices relative to the recession rates,

the recession pressures on the rates of price change continued un-

-18-

abated after 1958 and 1961, and to some degree intensified after
1970. Chart 6 hints at a delay in the response of prices in 1970
from the recession to the recovery period, but the shift in these
distributions relative to their positions in Chart 5 is too slight

to be of any significance. It is the magnitude of price responses
which has changed and apparently not the lag time.

Variability and Skewness of Price Responses

Along with rjgJard shifts, the distributions display considerably less variability in the post-1949 period compared with the

1920s. This was evident from the flatter distributions for the
1920s and 1949 in Charts 2 and 3. The 1924 and 1949 recessions may
be atypical, to be sure, in that they brought forth large declines

in some prices still inflated from wartime increases. Yet the mild
recession of 1928 also elicited much larger changes in a substantial

number of prices than has occurred in the postl949 recessions.
There is no doubt that large price swings have become less prevalent.
Whi].e the reduction in response and variability of prices might

appear to be related phenomena, the response has continued to de-

cline and the variability has not. The shapes of the distributions
in Charts 4 and 5 exhibit little change in variability after 1949,

and the measure of variability in Table 4 confirms it. This measure
is the average (absolute) deviation from the mean.8 The variability

of change, but the average deviations in Table 4 are based on

at zero, the midpoint of the 0 -2 1/2 class overstates

the actual mean of this class and biases the average deviation
upward except when the mean is above the midpoint of that class
as in 1970. But this bias is bound to be small.

1949 is by far the largest, and the others differ very little

and show no tendency to decline further. (Standard deviations,
given in Appendix Table C, also show no trend.) Whatever the change
in

cyclical behavior which

reduced

the variability of pricessince

the 1920s, it appears so far tO have been a once-and-for-all change.
As a result, the continuing decline in the response of prices following 1949 has

occurred fairly uniformly in all segments of the

distributions.

Table 4

also presents measures of skewness which give a similar

though more erratic picture of changes in the distributions. The
distributions are all skewed to the left as shown by the means being
less than the medians. This implies that the size of declines in
prices was larger on balance than the size of increases, which we

might expect to characterize recessions. (The measure of momental
skewness is positive for 1954 and 1970, however, indicating that

very large increases outweighed very large declines. The use of
the third power in this measure puts great weight on very large deviations from the mean.)
By the

difference

bet*een the mean and

median,

the skewness

decreased after 1949 but has had little further change, particularly

for the recession-minus-expansion rates. (The larger leftward skewness for the mini-recession is a surprising exception which, since
its variability was not out of line with the other recessions,

means that a relatively small number of prices had unusually large
most of
declines.) The uniformity of skewness in/the recessions after
1919 is another indication, along with variability, that the right-

ward shifts in the distributions do not reflect major shifts in

-20-

the pattern of price changes across the economy.

Iv

The Bunching of Price Changes At or Near Zero
Downward Rigidity
Bunching at zero, which is often interpreted as downward rigidity of prices, was noted in Charts 2

and 4. It is indicated there

by the jump in the cumulative frequency in the 0 - 2
plotted at 3 1/3.
Tabulations not shown indicate that most of the jump

1/2 interval)
represents

zero price changes. The phenomenon is portrayed in Figure 1 by the

solid curve

relative to a symmetrical distribution (dotted). Since

many prices change infrequently, a short recession would register

more zero changes than would a long recession. The recessions studied here vary from 9 to 14 months, however, not enough to rke a
great difference.

A small percentage of declining series is sometimes taken to
indicate such bunching, but a rightward shift of the distribution

also reduces the percentage declining. Another possible indication
of bunching is leftward skewness -- as measured by the mean minus
the median --

but

this may

result from very large rates of

decline in a subgroup of volatile prices. To measure the effect

on the distributions due to bunching without imposing a specified
functional form on the distributions, we may rely on a simple method illustrated in Figure 1 and calculated for the postwar recessions in Table 5. It is based on the assumption that a distribution withOut bunching would be symmetrical around the mean.

The measure of bunching is the ratio of the actual

declining to the hypothetical percentage for a symmetrical distribution. A lower ratio indicates more bunching, and unity indicates no

percentage

bunching. The hypothetical percentage is approximated by assuming that

the frequency of price changes above 2 1/2 per cent per year is unaffected
by the bunching at zero. Given a symmetrical distribution, the frequency
above 2 1/2 per cent equals the frequency below a point equidistant to

the left of the mean. The distribution between these two points is assumed
to lie along a straight line (in that middle range the distributions with
less bunching do appear to be linear), and the hypothetical percentage of

declining prices is read off this line. This percentage is biased downward, thus overstating the bunching ratio, because bunching increases the

mean. Recalculation of the ratio with an adjusted mean to correct for this
bias indicates that this

overstatement

of the ratio is minor. (The cor-

rected ratio z 1961 is reduced from .59 to .54.)

the
By this measure of bunching, it was largest for/recession rates in 1961,

which had only

/ 59 percent of the hypothetical number of declining prices, and almost as
large in 1954 and 1958. The bunching was somewhat less in 1948 because
so many prices declined sharply in that recession) and it was considerably
less

in 1970

because the hypothetical percentage declining was small.

The distributiors for recession_minus_expansion rates are largely

free of this bias when the trend of prices is significantly upward,
because there is no comparable tendency for firms not to report smaller

rates of price increase. There is little evidence of zero bunching
for these distributions in Table 5.

The phenomenon of price changes bunching at zero has received wide

attention. It is attributed to downward rigidity of Iadministeredv
prices, which has allegedly contributed to the persistence of

inflation• Chart 4 demonstrated its prevalence in postwar recessions.
Is it simply a statistical
artifact of the data? For prices fixed

-22-

by contract, for example, no change occurs until they are reset

(assuming no prearranged escalation). It is not clear how many
of the BLS series reflect contract prices. Even for noncontract
prices, the I3LS compiles reports from sellers who can be expected

to omit the unannounced discounting and shading of prices often
made in actual transactions.

We may analyze this omission with the aid of the StiglerKindahi collection of prices compiled from buyers, largely of
products for which "administered pricingt' was likely to be strong.9

9George Stigler and James Kindahl, The Behavior of
trial Prices, NBER, 1970, p. 23.

Their data cover the 1958 and 1961 recessions only. Chart 8 presents three sets of cumulative frequency distributions of 62 National

panels show the 1958 and 1961 recession rates, and the third panel
shows recession-minus-exnansion rates for 1961.
It is apparent that the BLS series underreport price decreases,

mainly small ones. The paired distributions are fairly close ex-

cept between -5 to 2 1/2 or 5 percent per year. It is clear from
the underlying data not shown here that the main exception occurs

at zero. This result presumably reflects a tendency of the quoted
or list prices reported to the BLS to omit market shading when no

change in the list price has occurred, but to include them when the

list strays too far from the market price and is changed. Thus
the paired price series display the same cyclical behavior, as is
indicated by a correlation coefficient between the two sets of

prices. (This regression was not computed for

1961, but it would give similar results.)

The last panel of the chart also shows a difference in zero
bunching between the two sets of data. Although such chan9es in the
rates of price change generally do not bunch at zero, the expansion
rates for this cycle were fairly small, and the bottom panel partially replicates the results for recession rates alone.

There may be other reasons, to be sure, for part of the dif-

ference between these two sources of price data. The StiglerKindahl data involve some interpolation of price observations,

which spreads a change occurring in one month over the intervening

months back to the previous observation. This makes less difference for the
9 to 12 month recession periods used here, however, than for in-

dividual months. Also, buyers who shift to lower-priced sellers
would report a price decline even though all sellers reported no

change. This causes the Stigler-Kindahi data based on buyers to
overstate price changes. On the other hand, the BLS apparently does
not list contract prices except in the month they are set, while
Stigler-Kindahl list them in all months of the contract period as

having no change. These differences in buyer and seller reports
are difficult to evaluate, but the tentative conclusion seems valid
that the greater zero bunching in the ELS series mainly reflects the
omission of market discounting from list prices.

If we take the difference in bunching between the BLS and

NBER

data in Chart 8 at face value, the percentage of

the Stigler-Kindahi data and 5.26 percent by the BLS data and in

1961, 67.87 and 15.15 percent, respectively. This implies that
40.19 and 52.71 percent of the BLS series in 1958 and 1961, respectively, should be shifted from the interval 0 - 2 1/2 to less

than zero. These percentages were applied to manufactures with
concentration ratios above 33 percent only and not to all series
in that interval on the view that the nonmanufacturing and lowest

concentration industries are less likely to display bunching at

zero. This also reduces the size of the adjustment. (The elimination of low concentration industries is consistent with the analysis of Section V below and with numerous studies in the litera-

ture on pricing in concentrated industries.) For 1958, there are 2l
series shifted in this way and for 1961, 295 series, which results in
the percentages reported in the text.

from 30.5 to 40.2 for 1958 and from 31.2 to 48.9 for 1961. The
ratio of these adjusted figures to the hypothetical percentage declining in Table 5 is raised from .66 to .87 for 1958 and from .59

to .92 for 1961. The adjustment therefore accounts for a substantial part of the bunching, though apparently not all. The downward
rigidity of wholesale prices, though not entirely a statistical arti-

fact of list instead of transaction prices, is certainly minor. The
çersistence of inflation since World War II is not, therefore, characterized by downward rigidity so much as a general tendency of
prices in the whole range of rates to respond less to recessions.

and hardly noticeable in the distributions of recession-.

rate of price change among products depend upon a large number of
influences, and we might at first expect their combined effect to

follow a normal frequency distribution. But the central limit
theorem for a normal distribution requires that the probability distributions of the contributing influences not differ too greatly,

which is not likely here. Basic commodity prices are typically
more volatile than the prices of highly fabricated products, because of differences in the operation of their respective markets.
Even aside from such characteristic differezxes among prices, the

deflationary pressures of a recession can hit different sectors with
'erying severity and speed.

Table 6 shows considerable variation in kurtosis over the

period. The kurtosis of the 1949 distribution is the lowest and
its standard deviation the highest, because the price changes are

widely dispersed. This is evident from examination of the histogram
of its price changes (not shown). The 1954 and 1970 distributions
have practically equal values in Table 6, indicating that the fundamental determinants of the distributions had no trend over this rer-

iod. Relative to these two, the 1958 distribution has a high kurtosis and standard deviation because of a greater number of very
large values out in the tails, and the 1961 kurtosis is low

because

the distribution is less peaked.

As an analytical explanation of these high values of kurtosis,
we may describe price changes in a recession as

malvolatility

generated by a nor-

pressures among prices. Furthermore, we might view

this process as a distribution which determines the variance of the

normal distribution from which each price change is drawn. Then the
kurtosis of the subordinated distribution depends upon the

ratio

of

the variance to the mean/of the directing process.

ordinated distribution has a kurtosis necessarily greaterthan the
3 of a normal distribution.
In these terms a change in kurtosis reflects a change in the

generating process. A increase in the ratio of its variance to
its mean raises the kurtosis of the distribution of price changes.

On certain assumptions an increase in uniformity of price anticipations among firms

would decrease the mean but not the variance of

the generating process, and hence would *cre the ratio of variance
to

the mean and also icrease the

kurtosis. Since kurtosis has not

increasing over the inflationary postwar period, we might at
first conclude that the anticipated rate of inflation, even though

however, the effect of a greater uniformity of price anticipations

the kurtosis is very slight, and an inference about their uniforraity from the kurtosis of these distributions cannot be drawn.

V
Grouped by Durability, Value Added, and Concentration

To what extent does the reduced response of prices in successive
business recessions following 1949 reflect the behavior of partic-

ular groups of prices? The answer will help identify which of various possible influeixes may underlie this development. Three class-

While the durable nonmanufactures comprise very few series in our sample

comparison of the frequency distributions of their prices. Value added

The fraction of total industry shipments by the four largest
firms was used. In afew cases where the four_firm ratio for 1963
was not availabl, the concentration ratio for 1958 was used if the
eight-firm ratio suggested that the concentration of the industry had
not changed much since 1958.

These data are not published for every five-digit industry,

so

that some

manufacturing prices had to be omitted from these distributions in addition to the exclusion of all nonmanufacturing prices (farming and mining).

worthwhile.

Although these classifications are quite different in concept,
they

may in fact overlap for many prices. Such interdependence of

characteristics makes indentification of influences on price behav-

ior difficult. Still, with the large number of prices in our sample,
there is sufficient diversification to allow some indication of differences in behavior.

the previous 1100-odd product prices except those omitted from these
classifications for the reasons noted.

The group of lare1y unprocessed goods isolates the raw materials,

which characteristically undergo large price fluctuations. The raw
materials aside, the relevance of durability to price behavior concerns

This is not invariably/of course, since users of/nonessential nondurables can also

the feasibility of sizable inventories. Inventories absorb short-run

this correspondence is only a rough one. The durable manufactures

inventory. No attempt was made to alter the BLS classification

for present purposes. Nevertheless, BLS durability still corresponds
in part to the degree of importance of inventories in pricing. This
classification helps to show whether these characteristics of products

prices.

Chart 9 reveals a sharp difference between the nondurable, largely
unprocessed goods and the

two manufacturing groups. As expected, the

distributioiof the former are much flatter, indicating considerable
variability of price response to the recessions. The smaller number of
series covered by this group (about one-fifth of the other two) makes

- 31_
these distributions more jagged but would not ordinarily affect their

slope or median. The strong dependence of these prices on short-run
market conditions apparently is the reason why these distributions do
not shift successively rightward for each recession, as do those for the

manufacturing groups and for the combined distributions in Chart 5.

in the three groups are 28, 50, and 66 percent. respectively, and

the variability roughly declines by that relative amount between
the first two

groups,

though by less between the second two (see

Table 7, below).

For

each recession the medians of the distributions for each

higher group of ratios tend to move rightward, though much less so

for the later than the earlier recessions. Also, the distributions
for the higher ratios cluster more around zero and exhibit a response to recession which is smaller over-all and changes less over
the postwar period.

Taken all together, these results support the view that the
inflexibility of wage rates (due to custom as well as union baroziin-

ing) contributes to the lack of responsiveness of prices to recessions, whereas a high dependence in production on basic materials

adds to price variability. Yet the tendency in successive recessions
for the rate of change of prices to decline less or rise more rel-

ative to expansion rates cannot be attributed directly to labor

Costs. These rightward shifts are largest for those prices having
the greatest variability and least dependence on wages. In the
l99 and 1954 recessions at the beginning of the postwar period,
the high value-added group displayed the least price response but
the subsequent rightward shifts in the distributions for this

group were also the smallest. Hence the rightwarcl shifts in the
total distributions of Chart 5 reflect a reduction in price response to the later recessions more by the lower value-added

products. By implication wage costs have not contributed to the reduction in price responsiveness.

at

the time as a new phenomenon. The change in behavior was attri-

buted to the emergence of dvmward rigidity in prices and a tendency of producers to "administer't their prices with less regard

for short-run changes in market demand. Why did this phenomenon
emerge following the 1949 recession? One explanation given was
the growth of market power of firms to set prices and of labor

unions to dictate wages. Yet, while labor unions had become stronger
compared with the 1940s and earlier decades, firms as a whole did

not appear to have more market power. Another explanation was that
price setting is strongly influenced by anticipations of future

levels. The Employment Act of 1946, which had committed the government to pursue full-employment policies, was followed in the postwar years by an upward trend of prices, and the two together rein-

forced a belief that any deflationary pressures would be brief. Presumably that dissuaded firms from reducing prices in recessions.

Some theories of inflation see large firms as raising prices in
excess of increases in costs? even at a time of excess capacity, in

order to maintain profit margins as output contracts, but most of
the postwar inflationary movements could be attributed to excess
demand pressures if due allowance were made for lags in response.
Given sporadic bursts of demand-pull inflation, the failure of prices

to undergo offsetting declines during the ensuing recessions seemed
sufficient at that time to explain the upward trend of prices.19

the system could be invoked to argue that prices continued rising to

catch up with previous cost increases, such lags had not been equally

significant in previous recessions. The new behavior required a
revision of the theories.

An important revision brought in the anticipated rate of inflation as a basic determinant of price changes to which the effects
of market demand and supply conditions were then added.'

Even so, there is no doubt that the average rate of decline in

that the distributions of recession price changes display a high
variability, less than in the 1920s but still considerable and

changes has long been noted.21 It indicates the diversity of price

behavior,

reflecting both random variations and persistent differ-

ences between certain groups of prices. The variability of price
changes was less in the recessions following 1949 in part because
of greater bunching at zero, which was

widely

interpreted to imply

a downw rigidity of prices. But such bunching results largely from
a bias toward zero change in reported prices, which the Stigler-Kindahi

data for transaction prices in 1959 and 1961 show did in fact de-

cline moderately (Section IV). If we allow for this bias, however,
the data still indicate a general reduction in the size and number
of declines in prices since the 1920s.

This reduction in response is clearer in the distributions of
recession-minus-expansion rates, which exhibit little bunching at

zeros These rates also crudely allow for differences in the trends
of prices and are equivalent to uasures of overall cyclical amplitude. This amplitude has diminished since the l920s and has contin

rates have both helped to reduce the c1ica1 amplitude, but th
change for recession rates has been greater. A decrease in the
severity of business recessions in real terms undoubtedly has Con-

tributed,

but it does not provide a full explanation, because the

severity of the five postwar recessions has not decreased chrono-

logically. The l96-67 mini-recession was examined as an additional
test case, and the size of its response to prices fell between that

of 1961 and 1970 even though it was less severe than either of those
recessions.

Furthermore, although the variability,of recession price changes
has contracted sharply since the 1920s, it has remained the same

following 1919. Deve1opnnts in market structure and mix which could
stabilize price fluctuations would show up in the variability of

price. Since variability has not decreased, we may conclude that
the continued decline in response to recessions has occurred aJonc

not account for diminishing dec1ii in the ra.tes of change. The answer
involves either or both a reduction in magnitude of price responses to
excess capacity or an increase in the speed of adjustment of anticipations

to actual price changes. The first would be influenced by the history of
restraints taken against inflation. If declines in demand growth have
been brief, the response to the next one will be less. It is hard to
believe that the postwar history of government failures to curb inflation

has not affected price responses significantly. Second, the speed of
adjustment of the anticipated rate to the actual rate of inflation can

be important, because it will affect the difference between the two at

Thus

than if they had been rising at a fairly constant rate for some time,
though an offset to this faster reversal is the persistence of accelerated
inflation while its lagged effects on costs work through the economy.
The actual and anticipated rates will also be closer should anticipa-

tions be adjusted faster.
These considerations suggest two reasons why the anticipated rate
of inflation at the beginning of the 1970 recession may have been closer
to the actual rate than had been trie at previous cyclical peaks and why,

therefore, the average price response was so slight. First,
the rate of inflation at the end of 1969 had been about the same for a

year or two. Second, the adjustment of anticipations may have become
faster as a result of the recurring postwar periods of inflation .

which characteristically fluctuate less in price than do raw

classification of the prices into durable and nondurable manufactures,

the latter exhibited somewhat larger rightward shifts than the former.
The exception to successive shifts is shown by prices of raw materials,
which continue to exhibit their characteristic sharp and variable responses

to

market developments. Other classifications of prices which might be

thought to reveal structural changes

are the concentration of markets

and the ratio of value added to shiments of producers. It is true that
variability of price changes is lower in more concentrated markets and

for firms with high value-added ratios. And the more concentrated markets

exhibit fewer price declines in the recessions. But these differences between
groups of prices have remained the same over the postwar period. The response to recessions of the high valued-added and

concentration groups has

declined the same or perhaps less than the others. Therefore, even if
they increased in relative importance, which is not generally true, they
cannot

account for the general decline in response.

as to catch up to past, excess demand, the first term of equation

It is certainly conceivable for lagged excess demand to raise

prices even though p were above e and there was a deficient current
demand, that is, a negative D-S. Such a rise in prices greater
than e could be described as due to the push of past cost increases not previously adjusted to.

across products is crucial to the following argument, but it seems

reasonable as a first approximation: The anticipated rate of
price change for a product will depend mainly upon prospects for
inflation in the economy at large and ordinarily much less upon

developments in the individual sectors. Individual firms will
assess these prospects differently, of course, but nyst of the

Appendix
Anticipations and the
Distribution of T)rice Changes
This appendix develops a theoretical relationship between the
kurtosis of the distribution of price changes and the uniformity of

rrice anticipations. A smaller variability of anticipated rates of
inflation will reduce the variability of the actual rates and will
also, in combination with demand influences on prices, increase the

kurtosis of the distribution, though by very little. We begin by

formulating

the effect of excess demand and anticipations on price

changes.

A Model of Price Changes
For each product we may postulate demand and supply schedules
which are continually shifting upward because of inflation (and

rightward because of grcwth in real terms). The anticipated rate
of increase in their intersection point is pe, which represents

the anticipated rate of equilibrium price increase. The anticipated level of the demand and supply schedules is not at any time

necessarily equal to the actual levels D and S. The excess quantity demanded implied by these actual schedules at the market price

p is, for some point in time, D - S, and we may suppose that thi.s
helps determine

given

an adjustment fraction x and distributed

lag function L as follows:
(1)

p

czLID(p) -

S(p)1

+

e

The lag function L reflects delays in adjusting to past cost
increases, which accounts for the time it takes for increases in
the prices of factors of production to work through the price system.

Actual prices rise along the anticipated path e with deviations which depend with a lag upon D-S. The anticipated path changes

Appendix _44_

slowly over time, so that D-S does not remain always positive or
negative but moves cyclically above and below the anticipated path.

A change in aggregate demand is reflected in the rate of change
of demand

and affects excess demand D-S.

depends upon past

rates of price change as well as information about future develop-

ments. It is unrelated to current excess demand D-S. A special
case is for pe to equal the anticipated rise in unit costs at a

'standard" level of capacity utilization. It is possible for p
to be rising even though

D-S is negative. Thus a slowing

of aggregate demand makes D-S negative, so that f

is less than ,

and D equals S at a price lower than the current p.
Equation 1 implies corresponding adjustments in quantities to

the discrepancy between D and S. Assuming there are inventories,
one possibility is that dollar sales are D(p) and the value of
production is S(p), so that the bracketed expression is the unplanned change in the value of inventories (ignoring planned changes

and revaluations of inventory stocks due to price changes). But
the actual amoun sold and produced might not be on either schedule,
though sales would be less than D. Thus D(p) is the maximum demand
and S(p) the desired production, hypothetical amounts which the

firm estimates through its experience n the market.
It is difficult to imagine equation 1 without the price anti-

cipations terms, for that would imply that price changes always

moved according to (a lagged function of) excess demand. A moving
equilibrium of rising prices would then not be possible. Yet ii:
seems plausible that a fully anticipated inflation could occur in

which excess demand at each moment was zero. In general, however,
j

could be above or below e•
