UNEMPLOYMENT EFFECTS OF MINIMUM WAGES

1. Introduction
Empirical investigation of employment effects of minimum wage legislation is a subject of continuing interest, judging by a growing number

of studies. The

older

studies were concerned mainly with changes in

employment in low—wage industries. In the more recent work attention
has shifted to effects on unemployment in low-wage demographic groups,

such as teenagers. Despite the statistical difference there is no
apparent recoqnjtjon of a conceptual as well as substantive distinction

between minimum wage effects on employment and those on unemployment.

The

purpose of this paper is to explore the analytical distinction

between employment and unemployment effects in the hope of providing some

understanding Of

the observations.

Though related empirical work is

far

from being definitive the findings appear to be informative.

Both factors receive explicit attention in a current study by

Finis Welch of effects of minimum wages on sectoral distribution of
employment. His analysis omits the unemployment effects, which is
the focus of this paper.

along the demand curve in the covered sector and the corresponding re-

duction of employment there is only a beginning of the story: there are
responses in movements of labor from the covered to the uncovered sector
(or conversely), as well as from the market to the norunarket (or conversely),

and some

amount of

"perinanent"2unemployment is generated as well. More

precisely, given similar labor in the two sectors (there is only one before the imposition of minimum wages) and a wage w, the imposition of

will change from w to w inconsequence of generated sectoral movements
of labor, and with w > W (as we shall prove) a certain amount of

—3—

"waiting" for jobs in the covered sector becomes worthwhile, creating a
fixed amount of unemployment.

A question of particular interest is the direction of labor mobility

resulting from the minimum wage imposition (or increase). An outflow from
the covered sector implies some withdrawals from the labor force and
some reemployment in the uncovered sector as well as a decrease of the

wage in that sector. In the opposite case, there are net inflows of labor
into the covered sector both from the nonmarket and from the "free"

sector, in turn raising the wage in the latter as well. I proceed to
explore the conditions which distinguish these opposite movements, as
well as the specific effects of increasing minimum wages and of coverage
on (a) wages in the uncovered sector, (b) unemployment, and (c) labor

force withdrawals. The qualitative conclusions hold regardless of whether
coverage is partial or complete and whether the total labor force is fixed

or responsive to wage changes. Also, similar results hold for a multiperiod analysis as for the analysis collapsed into a single period, from
which I start.

2. The Probability of Employment and Equilibrium Unemployment
A wage w exceeding the equilibrium wage w is imposed on a part of

the economy (the "covered" sector), creating a differential wm -

where

w is the resulting wage level in the "uncovered" sector. In order to
abstract from other influences assume that the job searchers' probability

of employment in the uncovered sector is unity within the period. With

—4-.

wages above equilibrium in the covered sector, jobs must be rationed.

Chances of success in job search depend on the method of rationing.
I shall assume probabilistic rationing,3 one in which every job searcher

Price rationing or discrimination would eliminate unemployment

rather quickly. One form of price" rationing is worker monetary
investment in search. This would reduce waiting time, hence observed
unemployment, by substituting direct costs for foregone earnings of
job searchers.

has an equal chance of getting a job, and every employed worker an equal

chance of keeping the job. This assumes that some vacancies arise
periodically in the covered sector, due to turnover (Vacancies are also
created by growth in demand, a factor I shall consider later.)

Abstracting from risk preferences and from search costs other than
foregone earnings, equilibrium wages after imposition of wm in the covered
sector are given by:

and p is the probability of employment in the

In the covered sector employment is E, the number of vacancies

per period is 6E. Abstracting from growth or cycles, the rate 6 is
simply a separation rate. The 6E vacancies are filled as soon as they
appear and a remaining pool of unemployed searchers of size U is ob-

served. Since the number of vacancies (separations) is

It appears that the unemployment rate induced by the imposition of

minimum wages is proportional to the percent wage gap (w) between the
sectors, the separation rate (6), and the coverage ratio (k). The
separation rate 6 has a maximum

value

of unity. This case of complete

(100 percent) turnover provides the highest chance of success for job

searchers, hence maximum unemployment, namely U'

= w, and

= k w

The opposite extreme, zero turnover implies no unemployment--all those
without jobs having left the covered sector.4

Even when turnover is zero, if demand for labor is growing,

vacancy rates appear and by eq. (2) unemployment will arise, since

when g is the growth rate of employment. This is the

case discussed in the context of rural-urban migration in less
developed countries by Todaro (1969) and Harberger (1971).

3. Labor Mobility and the Equilibrium Waqe Differential
Before the imposition of minimum wages, the market wage in both

sectors was w. The minimum wage produces two adjustments: it
generates an unemployment rate u and it changes the wage in the un-

covered sector from w0 to w in consequence of the movement of labor

between the sectors. Which way does labor flow? It is usually assumed
in the minimum wage literature that disemployed labor flows out

of the covered to the uncovered sector. The opposite assumption is made

—7—

in the development literature--that labor will be attracted to the covered

sector even at the cost of a substantial period of unemployment. Each
may be right in their context, but this is not obvious. At a purely
arithmetical level, it simply depends on whether generated unemployment
U is less or greater than the reduction in employment CE0 - Em) in the

covered sector. If (E — Em) >
o

u,

there is an outflow from the covered

sector and a depression of wages in the uncovered sector, while the

opposite is true when U > CE0 — Em).

In the latter case, wages rise in

the uncovered sector as well, but never to the level of w.5

M to the left increases all three, induces outmigration from the covered

reducing the outflow of labor from the covered sector. When coverage is
100 percent, L is vertical and unemployment equals disexuployment, only

because of the assumption of zero elasticity of aggregate labor supply.
Labor Force Resoonses
The graphic solution in Figure 1 remains useful, mutatis mutandis,

after the assumption of a fixed labor force is dropped. This more general

case presents no particular complications. The only new development is
the inclusion of the non—market along with the uncovered sector as the

destination (when n > 6) or origin (when r < 6) of labor mobility.

Consequently the downward pressure on wages in the uncovered sector

n < 5, the flatter L-curve means that the wage gap and unemployment will

The division of outflows from the covered sector into reemployment
in the uncovered sector and withdrawals from the labor force is determined
by the relative sizes of demand and supply elasticities in the uncovered

sector. As Figure 2 indicates out of E0 -

To the extent that welfare systems provide payments near w
this extreme case is relevant. Wage hikes which create downward pressures

on wages in the uncovered sector will result mainly in withdrawals from
the labor force. Therefore, when n > 5, the connection between minimum
wage hikes, growth of coverage, and growth of welfare enrollments is
strongly suggested.

Finally, an interesting case worth considering, in view of the
high coverage proportion of the U.S. labor force, is the case of complete

coverage, k =

1.

In this case, the L-curve in Figure 1 is simply the

supply curve S, and w is an unobserved shadow wage: All those not
employed at the minimum wage w, drop out of the labor force, if their

shadow wage exceeds w. Again, if w > w, which takes place when n < 6,
people move from the non—market into the labor market.

This was the case considered by Hashimoto and Mincer (1971),

The direction of labor force change now depends on whether demand

unemploy-

ment ratio cannot exceed the (percent.age) size of the wage hike.

Multiperiod Analysis and Growth of Demand
In a multiperiod formulation workers search or wait for jobs in the

covered sector, as long as the net discounted gain from doing so is posi-

tive. Abstracting from risk preferences, the net gain is zero at the
margin:

Pt in the expression for G is the probability of having a job in period t.

This is to be distinguished from the probability of getting a job

and the probability of losing the job when employed,

namely 6. The discount rate is i.
The probability Pt grows with time, according to the recursive re].ation:

The coefficient a now plays the same role as the separation rate
6 in the single—period analysis.

According to (19), a > 6 so long as 6 < 1.

Only when i =

a = 6 which is the single-period case, while t = 0 or 6 = 1

, is

makes

a = 1 its highest value. Thus when discount rates are extremely high
or turnover complete there is no distinction between the single and
inultiperiod analysis. The lower the discount, rates the higher a, the

greater unemployment (cf.

)

because of the

greater willingness to wait. Since a > 6, the likelihood of n <

a,

hence of labor mobility toward the covered sector is greater than suggested in the single period analysis, where the comparison was between
n

and

6.

This likelihood becomes even greater when growth of demand in the

covered sector is taken into account. Even if turnover were zero, and
demand grows at the rate g creating a vacancy rate of g percent,

Also, when g > 0,

a can be sizeable and unity is no longer its upper limit. It is plausible
therefore, that promotion of rapid employment growth in "protected" high

— 19 —

wage sectors, as described in the development literature, stimulates movement tø these sectors creating high levels of equilibrium unemployment,
while the opposite movements, disemploytnent and labor force withdrawals

are the major conseauences of minimum waces in the U.S. and in other developed economies.

5. Some Conclusions
Do minimum wage hikes represent a redistribution of income toward

low wage labor? Total income is, of course, reduced. Does a larger
share of the smaller product go to low wage labor? A demand elasticity
n < 1 increases the wage bill of labor in the covered sector, but only

the employed pocket the gains, at the expense, in part, of those dis—

employed. However, if labor turnover is complete (5 =

1),

the employed

and unemployed are the same people and each of them is working less but

earning more, at least nominally.
The analysis in this paper suggests that this conclusion would be
correct if iS

n

= 1.

Otherwise, a less than unitary demand elasticity

it mi,ist be

Only then will those employed In the not—covered

sector have a wage w >

and those unemployed in the covered sector

Since an implication of ri < 6 is the flow of labor from the un-

covered sector and from the non—market to the covered sector, such a
hypothesis is subject to empirical tests, even without estimation of

— 20 —

parameters r and 5. The empirical work to be reported rejects the hypothesis. The labor force diminishes in consequence of minimum wage hikes.
This finding supports the alternative hypothesis that n > ci >.6 .

It fol-

lows that unemployment arising in consecuence of minimum wage hikes understates the disemployment being only a part of it, the other two parts
being reemployment at wages lower than before, and labor force withdrawals.

The inference that n >

ci further

implies that growth of coverage aggravates

unemployment even within the covered sector, and that the growth of numbers of welfare recipients may be induced by the growth in minimum wages.
It is suggestive, in this connection, that labor force withdrawals appear
to be rather substantial in the empirical analysis which relates employment and labor force changes to minimum wage hikes.

The MW variable enters the regression with an Almon unconstrained
quadratic distributed lag. Experiments showed that a lag pattern of
6-8 quarters was significant for most groups.

is the

interest.

Unemployment effects were estimated as the difference of

labor—force and employment effects. Unemployment regressions, however,
were also run to facilitate a comparison.
Except for males (25—64), nonwhite males (65+) and nonwhite
females (20+) ,the minimum

wage variable is significant in both

labor—

force and employment regressions. For most groups, therefore, unemployment effects are substantially smaller than disemployment. Unemployment
effects estimated from labor—force and employment regressions are

also shown in

Table 2.

effects on labor—force participation appear

negative for most of the groups. The largest negative effects are

observed for nonwhite teenagers, followed by nonwhite males (20—24),
white males (20—24), white teenagers, and nonwhite males (25—64).

— 23 —

The net employment effects are negative with the exception of nonwhite females (20+), for whom the positive coefficient is statistically

insignificant. The largest disemployment effects are observed for nonwhite males (20—24), followed by nonwhite teenagers, white males (20-24),
and white teenagers.

Except for nonwhite teenagers and white males (65+), the magnitude
of the employment effects are greater than those of the labor-force ef-

fects The implication is that labor flows from the covered sector to
the

uncovered and out of the labor force. Also, both the

and the

labor—force

employment effects are greater for nonwhite groups than for

white groups in general. The largest increase in the unemployment rate
is observed for nonwhite males (20—24) followed by nonwhite teenagers,

white males (20—24) and white teenagers. This pattern is observed for
both the direct regression results and the indirect results calculated
from the labor-force and employment effects.

It is striking to observe that the labor-force effects of minimum

wages are predominantly negative. According to the theoretical analysis,
the labor force may increase or decrease, given a decrease in employment,

depending on demand elasticities and turnover rates. Findings of negative labor—force effects indicate that the demand elasticities are not
so small as to cause

an increase in the

labor force, and that low-wage

workers who are not employed in the covered sector perceive the minimum
wage hike as a deterioration of their wage prospects.

INVEST/GA lIONS
The law provides that authorized representatives of the \\'age and Hour Division may investigate and gather data regarding the wages. hours, and other conditions. and practices of employment. They may enter establishments and inspect the premises and recoids,
lrtacrjhe records and
interview employees. They may investigate whatever facts. Conditions, praLtLcs. or nmttcis are
considered necessary to find out whether any person has violated any provisions of the Act.
Wage-Hour compliance officers generally ' til make stiggestions regarding an change neccsarv
or desirable regarding pyroll. recortikeeping, and other practices which will aid in achieving and
rnaintainint compliance with the la . omplaints, records, and other information obtained from
employers and emplo'ees arc treated confidentially.

Under the act, these methods of recovering unpaid minimum

provided:

and/or overtime wages are

1. The Division's Administrator may supervise payment of back wages, and in
certain circumstances,

2. The Secretary of Labor may bring suit for back pay upon the written request

of the employee.
3. An employee may sue for back wages and an additional sum, up to the amount
of back pay, as liquidated damages, plus attorney's fees and court Costs.

4. The Secretary of Labor rna also obtain a court injunction
to restrain any
person from violating the law, including the unlawful withho!ding of proper
minimum wage and overtime compensation.
(An employee may not bring suit if he has been paid back wages under supervision of the Ad-

ministrator or if the Secretary has filed suit to enjoin the employer from retaining the wages
due him.)
A 2-year statute of limitations applies to the recovery of back wages, except in the case of
willful violations for which there is a 3-year statute
of limitations.

OTHER ENFORcEMEILIT
It is a violation of the law to discharge an employee for filing a complaint or participating
in a proceeding under the law.
Willful violajions may he prosecuted
and the violator fined up to S 10,000. A second Conviction for such a violation may criminally
result in imprisonment.
