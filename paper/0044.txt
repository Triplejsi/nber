Abstract

We introduce the concept of a triad census of a digraph arid shcw hc it
can

be used to enumerate various types of subgraph configurations. We

give the basic probabilities needed for computing means and variances for
a triad census under the UJMAN distribution for digraphs. These concepts

are combined to provide a way of testing propositions about social structure using sociometric

data. An application to O8 sociograins

is

given.

1. Introduction
Graph theory and network concepts are corrronly used by social scientists

to operationalize theoretical statements about structural regularities in

social systems. These concepts are especially appropriate for models of

fine structure of interpersonal relations. Here the identification of
individuals as "nodes" and interpersonal relations as "edges" in a graph
is imnediate. Graphtheoretic concepts are used to represent both models

the

of social structure and data on social structure. A

basic reference

detailing the application of graph theory to models of social structure is
Harary, Norn and Cartwright [1965]. The usual data representation, the
sociogram, was introduced by Moreno [19314].

Theoretical statements incorporating network analogies have been

fonnalized in mathentical models of social and perceptual behavior. For
example, the cogri-tive balance theory of Heider [191414] was fonrialized

by Cartwright and Harary [1956],Davis [1967] and Flament [1963]. Horrns'

[1950] propositions about behavior in groups were fonralized by Davis and
Leirthardt [1972] and Holland and Linhardt [1971]. Radcliff-Brc.jn's 119140]
and Nadel's [1957]

theoretical statements on

kinship and role systems were

fonnalized by White [l963J and White and Lorrain [1972]. We view these

models as "global" in the sense that they imply that the entire organization
of the system will fit into some relatively simple patterns.
Sociomet-ric data have corrnon1y been collected by investigators interested

in sill-sca1e social systems. In the years since the introduction of the

—2—

technique, data have been compiled on a large variety of groups by numerous

S

investigators (see, for example, Davis and Leinhart [1972]). The complexity
of this data has led to the development of various techniques and algoTithms for organizing and simplifying them (see, for example, Moreno, et.

al. [1960] and Boyle [1969]). Most analyses of sociometric data to

social

there is an abundance of theory, mDdels, data and data analyUc

procedures, it seems fair to say that our understanding of small-scale social
structure has not advanced much beyond the fundamental insights of Moreno,

Heider and Homans. We believe that a major reason for this is the discrep-

ancy between the local level at which the data are collected and the global
level at which the rrDdels are conceptualized. We propose to bridge this
gap by examining local structural properties which are expected to hold,

on the average, across entire social systems. This approach permits the
formalization and empirical study of propositions concerning the effect of

social organization on individual perception and behavior. Such propositions

are quite corrmn in the sociological and social psychological literature.

In the absence of a statistical methodolo' for testing empirical
tendencies of local structure) even Davis' theoretical reformulation

remiins little nre than an interesting exercise in forlism. Our
purpose here is to propose such a methodo1o, (for an earlier statement of our approach see:

(Holland and Leinhardt [1970].) Using this methodolo'

a variety of propositions concerning local structure in networks of
interpersonal relations can be irdeled in graphtheoretic terms and tested
by determining the discrepancy between empirically observed structure
and that which would obtain by chance. 1hi1e we emphasize the sociometric

interpretation of graphs,this interpretation is not essential to the
development or use of our methods.

In sections 2 through 5 we develop the technical rrteria1 needed for
our method.

if the nodes correspond to groups of people rather than to individuals but
we ignore this possibility here. The sociomatrix, X, is not exactly the
same thing as the digraph because it implies that the nodes have been labeled

from 1 to g in some arbitrary way. Strictly speaking, each sociomatrix
corresponds to a labeled diaph, whereas two different sociometrices can
represent the

same unlabeled digraph. In this latter situation the two

sociontrices

will only differ by a simultaneous r.i-colunri permutation.

There correspond to any unlabeled digraph a certain number of labeled

digraphs. These are called the labeled versions of the digraph.

B. The Triad Census

In a digraph there are () distinct 3-subgraphs formed by selecting
each of the possible subsets of 3 nodes and their corresponding lines.

These subgraphs can be classified by their isorrorphism type. Let T
denote the number of these 3-subgraphs of isorrorphism type u (where u

ranges over the 16 triad names given in Figure 2-2). The triad census
T is the vector of 16 components given by:
T

(2-2)

(T003' T012,..., T300).

We have adopted the folling ordering of the components of T to simplify
coiraninication: 003,012, 102, 021D, 021U, 021C, 111D, lllU, 030T, 030C,

this is a real reduction in information since X contains rrre than 16
elements of data. In general, knowing the triad census of a digraph does
not uniquely determine the digraph. However, as we show in section 4, T contains

a surprising amount of useful inforntion about X.

A triad census is a special case of the rrore general concept of a
k-subgraph census. Thus we might also consider a dyad census, a tetrad
census or even a pentad census. We show in section 4 that a dyad census

can be computed from a triad census. Furtherore there are so many tetrad
types (218) and pentad

types (9608) that a

k-subgraph census for k >

is

often rrore cumbersome than the original sociomatrix. Thus the triad
census occupies an important position among k-subgraph censuses in that it

is both manageable and yet contains a substantial amount of useful informa-

tion.
For various random digraphs, the first and second rioments of a triad

census are readily computed. These computations are illustrated in

section 5 for a particular random digraph (Corollary 2). This permits

us to test propositions about average local structure in specific
digraphs using the triad census (see section 6 ).

3. Configurations in Di graphs
A.

Reasons for considering configurations

Davis and Leinhardt [1972] present a procedure in which a version

of the triad census is used to test a model of small-scale social

structure. Distilling a set of structural propositions from Horrris
[1950]1they examined the triad types to determine which ones were

logically inconsistent with the propositions. They felt that, formalized
in this fashion, a fair interpretation of Hornans was that the inconsistent
triads would be empirically rare. They then showed that a social structure
coithining clusters, Davis [1967], with a transitive hierarchy, French [1956],

was implied by the propositions. Their empirical analysis of sociometric
data lent some support to the model)as did a latter analysis by Davis [1970].
However, a re-examination of this model revealed that it and most other

structural models of interpersonal affect assumed that the affective choice
relation is transitive, Holland and Leinhardt [1971]. The models them—
selves could be expressed as transitive graphs (t-graphs) upon which some

additional constraints had been applied. 'Iftansitivity, however, is not

a characteristic of a triad. Father, it is a property of
configuration

the point

is, the -transitive condition,

of i, j, k. On the other

hand, if one examines the 120C triad type1the transitivity condition
holds only once while it is contradicted, i.e., i±j, j+k and not i-k,

twice. Thus, if Horrns' propositions are

in

fact statements about the

intransitivity, then a failure to recognize the complex nature of triads

iry yield erroneous conclusions. Indeed, our reanalysis of Davis' [1970]
results

yielded a high level of confinition for the t-graph model (see

Holland

and Leinhardt

It

[19 71]).

is useful to pursue the notion of transitivity in interpersonal

because it demonstrates the utility of thinking of

structural

propositions in termis of configurations of social relations. Consider, for
example, the statement by Heider [1957] in regard to positive interpersonal

sentiment in triadic situations: "In the p-o-x triad, the case of three
positive relations rry be considered psychologically...transitive" (p.2O6).
For Heider, transitivity defines cognitive balance in affective situations.
His examples of balanced psychological structures are configurational in

that they emphasize transitivity from the point of view of p, the perceiver,
and not necessarily from the points of view of the other entities.
In an alternative to the t-graph model, Mazur [1971] put forth another

structural proposition. He argued that interpersonal affect data could be
explained by the proposition: "Friends are likely to agree, and unlikely

to disagree; close friends are very likely to agree, and very unlikely
to disagree" (p. 308). If one assumes that an asymmetric pair represents

—10—

"friends" while a mutual pair represents "close friends" then Mazur's

.

proposition anrunts to a set of hypotheses concerning the relative
empirical frequency of simultaneous choice of individuals by "friends"

and "close friends". Since the choices of the third individual are not
at issue1 Mazur's proposition is not about triads but refer's instead to
configurations contained in triacis.
An examination of Davis [1963] reveals numerous other structural

propositions that can be fonm1ized in terms of configurations. The
concepts

of cross—pressures (Berelson, et al., [1954]), homophily-

heterophily (Lazarsfeld and Mertori [1954]), structural balance (Cartwright

and Harary [1956]), distributive justice (Horrns [1961]), cliques (Horrns
[1950]; Lazarsfeld and Merton [1954]; Lipset, et al. [1956]), innovation
in ideas (Katz and Lazarsfeld [1955]), attitude change (Horrris [1950])

and conflict (Colerrn [1957]), as reformulated by Davis ,are all propositions

about

try to rr]<e this vague idea more precise. In section 2 we introduced the
concepts of labeled and unlabeled subgraphs of a digraph, and the socio-

matrix, X. For any 3-subgraph we may construct a 3 by 3 sociomatrix such
as the one given in (3-1):

i, j and k are 3 distrinct nodes. There are 266LI possible zero-

one sociomatrices of the form (3-1 and they correspond to the set of

all possible labeled 3-node digraphs. These in turn are the labeled
versions of the 16 non-isorrcrphic unlabeled 3-node digraphs. It is

easier to illustrate h to construct a configuration than to give a
precise definition of this concept. We begin with the pairs

scripts that

appear on the entries of

of

sub-

(3-1). The first step is to select

a subset of these ordered pairs of subscripts. For example, to define

the configuration that corresponds to "intransitivity'we select these

three ordered pairs: ij, jk, 1k. The order of the pairs indicates the
direction of the relation. Next, associate a zero or a one with each
ordered pair of subscripts that has been selected. For example, for
intransitivity we associate a 1 with ij, another 1 with jk and a 0 with
1k. These correspond to: i÷j, j÷k and not i-k. For convenience these

The first row of the rrtrix that describes a configuration is the

reading rule but be of different types. For example, the configuration

but a different type. It is given by:

(3—3)

It is convenient to have a picture for a configuration. We adopt
the following conventions for drawing them. For an ordered pair of

nodes, ab: (i) if ab is not in the reading rule,then no arrow is drawn
from a to b; (ii) if ab is in the reading nile and has a 1 associated

with it1then a solid arri is drawn from a to b; (iii) if ab is in the
reading rule and has a 0 associated with it)then a dashed arrow is drawn

from a to b. For example, the matrix given in (3-2) can be represented
by Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1 goes about here
inother example of a configuration comes from Mazur 's proposition

about agreement among friends. The reading rule for configurations

which pordray situations in which friends agree or disagree in their

choices of a third individual is: ij, ji, ik, jk. If close friends are
pairs of individuals who choose one another then disagreement among

close friends can be represented by the following configu-ation matrix:

for considering configurations is that they are a

refined set of concepts than the triads. A single triad may contain
different configurations. Furthermore, many sociological and social
propositions about networks make predictions about

psychological

configurations rather than about triads. However, in the next section we
show that the triad census can be used to enumerate all 3-configurations.

The next

Proof: Again we only prove (a). First we note that every B configuration
in the graph is contained in exactly one 3-subgTaph. Hence to count Bin
configurations) we only need to weight each triad frequency by the nuither

of B1 configurations contained in that triad type. To finish the proof
we observe that these weights are exactly the values of binu given in

Table -l.
C. Counting Configurations from Triads

The proof of Lenuma 2 irkes use of the fact that the number of configurations

of certain types can be counted using only the triad census, T. This leads
us to consider counting all of the possible types of 3-configurations

using only the triad census. Evidently, this requires no new ideas since
any configuration that involves 3 nodes is contained in exactly one 3subgraph. Thus, to count the nuither of 3-configurations of a given type

that arise in a digraph)we need only find out hi rrny of these are in each
of the 16 triad types and then sum the correspondingly weighted tri,ad

frequencies. If a configuration only involves two nodes, the same rule

applies except that in order to take care of the fact that each 2configuration is contained in g-2 triads, we must divide the weighted

sum of triad frequencies by g-2. This is why the factor g-2 arises
when we count dyad types from the triad frequencies.

As an example, suppose we wish to find the nimber of intransitive

configurations in a given digraph. An intransitive configuration is
a 3-configuration and can therefore be enumerated by the above rule. The

weights used for counting intransitive as well as transitive configurations
from T are given in Table '.1—1.

—19—

As

the

a final example of counting a 3-configuration using T we consider

.

one given in (3-3), (3.—4) and in Figure 3-2. Each weight given in

Table L_l for this configuration (the colurrn marked "close friends
disagreeing")

given

is found by counting the number of mutual dyads in the

triad type for which only one member of the mutual pair chooses the

other triad member.

Table -l goes about here
The discussion of sections 4A and 'B shows why the linear combinations

of triad frequencies are important. They give additional information about
the graph, information which iray not be obvious from the triad census

itself, but which is implied by it. Thus the set of all linear combinations
of the triad frequencies is a natural extension of the triad census. While
not all linear combinations of triad frequencies have interpretations in
terms of counting configurations, many do and the concept of configurations

is a key to understanding the set of all linear combinations of the triad
frequencies.
5. The Distribution of a Random Subgraph Census
Various
analysis

notions of "random" digraphs have statistical utility in the

of sociometric data (see Holland and Leirthardt [1970] and the

appendix to this paper for further discussion). When we obtain a triad
census from an actual sociomatrix, it is also useful to know what we would

expect the triad census to be from a random digraph. While the exact

probability distribution of a triad census from a random digraph is very

complicated, it is also true that when there is a sufficient number of nodes

for some simulation results.) In this section, we give foniiulas

covariances of the components of T for a

general class of random digraphs. We also give special results for

particular class of random digraphs which we have found useful.
A. Ivbirnts of a Subgraph Census

We begin by considering the number of k-subaphs of a given digraph

that are of a particular isorrorphism class. We justify this extra gen-

erality on the grounds that it entails no additional difficulties and that
the general results for k-subgraphs may be rrore useful for related problems.

We specialize to triads in section 5B.
Let u and v denote two isorrürphism classes for k-subgraphs. (In the

triad case, the range of values for u and v are given in Figure 2-2.) For
k-subgraphs where k >

, the possibilities are very numerous --

some

are

given in Ivbon [1968].

In Theorem 1, beli, we give foniulas for the means, variances and
covariances for the number of k-subgraphs of types u and v for a random

digraph generated by a completely general stochastic mechanism. In

Corollary 1 we specialize this result to the case of a triad census, and
in Corollary 2 we specialize even further to the rroments of a triad census
where the random digraph is of the special variety used in Holland and Leinhardt [1970].

We need some notation. Let K and L be subscripts that refer to the
distinct k-subgraphs of a given digraph. Thus, we shall speak of 1< being

of a particular isoror'phism class, etc.

Holland and Leinhardt [1970] we derived some of the relevant probabilities

for a particular random digraph that was introduced in Davis and Leinhardt

[1972]. Since we have discussed these derivations extensively elsewhere,
we shall only give a description of the random digraph and the complete

tables of the relevant probabilities.
The UIMAN Random Digraph Distribution: This is the probability dis-

tribution on the set of all digraphs with g nodes which makes all digraphs
with given values of N, A, and N (defined in (14_3), (L_!4) and (L_5))
equally likely. In other words, this is the uniform distribution on the

set of all labeled digraphs having given values of N, A, and N --

hence

the notation UIMAN. One way to generate random digraphs from this dis-

tribution is as follcs. First randomly allocate M mutual pairs to the
randomly allocate A asymmetric pairs to the
() possible pairs. Next
pairs and then randomly and independently orient the

rerrining ((fl - N)

asymmetric pairs. The result is a random labeled digraph with the given
values of M, A, and N and all such digraphs are equally likely to be
generated by this mechanism.
A random digraph with the UIMAN distribution possesses certain properties

which simplify the calculation of pK(u), pKL(u,v), (uv) and (u). The
UIMAN distribution on the set of digraphs is "horrDgeneous" in the sense

that it is invariant under permutations of the labels given to the nodes.

we illustrated ha some of the values

derivations here. Tables 5-1,2,3 give the formulas for p(u), p0(u,v) and
p2(u,v)

Holland

and

triad types, i. e., those which contain at least one intransitive configuration.

C. Moments of Linear Combinations of a Triad Census
Once

all the work has been done to generate the means, variances and

covariances for a random triad census T, it is very simple to calculate
the corresponding nürrients of any linear combination, 9. 'T.

It is an

elementary result from probability theory that if 9.'T and stT denote
two linear combinations of the components of a triad census then

tests of propositions about local structure in empirical socioniatrices.

Testing Structural Hypotheses
In this section we make use of the tools developed in the previous

sections in a procedure for testing propositions about local structure in
a sociomatrix. In outline, the procedure has these steps:
(1) Operationalize the proposition into a hypothesis that a particular
3-configuration will tend to occur or fail to occur in the sociontrix
(this hypothesis will usually be directional).
(2)

Find the weighting vector which when applied to the triad census

will enumerate

the

critical 3-configuration.

(3) Use the weighting vector to enumerate the critical 3-configuration
as well as to compute its mean and
(4)

variance

for a random triad census.

Set up a test statistic that compares the observed arid the

prediction about the nuffber

observed sociomatrices. As

example we consider Mazurts [1971] proposition mentioned earlier in

section 3A.

We first note that a simple sociomatrix indicating choice or

non-choice does not represent the strength of the relation so that Mazur' s
distinction between "friends" and

"close friends" has

to

be made on some

other basis if this proposition is to be operationalized and tested on

binary choice data. We follow Mazur's suggestion and

They all have the reading rule given by:

.

The first two pairs in the reading rule refer to the pair of individuals
who are designated "close friends", "friends" or neither. The second two
pairs in the reading rule refer to the choice or non-choice of other group
merrers by the pair in question. For example, the configuration that
corresponds to "close friends agreeing on their choices" is given by:

as mentioned earlier in section 3B. Since the reading rule is understood

here to be the one given in (6-1) we shall use the follciiing shorthand
notation for these configurations: (6-2) is denoted by 1111,

(6-3) by

1100,

and (6_14) or

(6-5) by 1101/1110. Thus, we only use the 1ier part of the

matrix and if

about

the folling seven configurations: 1111, 1110, 1101/1110, 1011/0111,

1010/0101, 1001/0110. The

observed number of the seven configurations mentioned above with the
corresponding number expected in a random sociomatrix having the same

number of mutual, asyrrunetric and null dyads. This is the U MAN distribution
for a random
appropriate

digraph discussed in section 5, and

it appears

to be especially

for Mazur' s proposition because they are based on mutual and

asymmetric pairs. In view of the foregoing remerks, we would formulate
Mazur's predictions as given by the second colunui of Table 6-1.
Table 6-1 goes about here
Note that under the UIMAN distribution the seven predictions in Table
6-1 are not independent. For any observed sociorratrix the number of con-

that this configuration does not occur

exactly one configuration of type 1111. Triads 210 and 300 contain,

Table 6-2 gives the weighting vectors for all of the configurations critical

The formulas for the mean and variance of the number of these

configurations in a random triad census from the UI MN\T distribution are

given by fonr&ilas (5-27) and (5-28). A computer program that carries out
these calculations has been written and is implimented on the TROLL

Setting up the Test Statistic
We let

T denote the triad census vector as usual. Then 'T is the number of times
the critical configuration occurs in the observed sociomatrix. Under the

Another Exaule, Transitivity

D.

Consider the follcMing proposition stated by Davis, Holland and

Leinhart

(1971);

"Interpersonal choices tend to be transitive --

if P

chooses 0 and 0 chooses X, then P is likely to choose X" (p. 309).
Elsewhere (Holland and Leinhardt [1971]), we have described the social
structural consequences of the transitivity of interpersonal affect when
social status is associated with asymmetry and clustering is associated

with mutuality. Here we use our method to explore the proposition's
empirical validity.

There

and

are

two critical

configurations, given in (3-2) (intransitivity)

(trans:Ltivity). The corresponding weighting vectors are given
in Table 4-1. Using the 08 sociorrtrices mentioned above we obtained
(3-5)

median T (2.) values

of 5.18 for transitivity and -3.89 for intransitivity.
These results support the proposition that interpersonal choices tend to
be transitive.
Hever, these results and those found for Mazur 'S proposition are
not independent of each other. Indeed, the weighting
itively

vector for trans-

is the componentwise sum of the weighting vector for the

configuration 1011/0111 and two
weighting

times the

weighting vector 1111. The

vector for intransitivity is the sum of the weighting vectors

for configurations

1010/0101 and 1101/1110.

The transitivity prediction is therefore weaker than Mazur's in that it
involves fewer configurations.

We

iry view

the very strong observed effect of transitivity as the sum

of two more modest effects corresponding to the configurations 1011/0111
arid 1111 or conversely the effects of these two configurations rry be viewed

as

the result of being

"pulled along" by the very strong transitivity effect.

Surrinxy and Discussion

Our purpose has been to describe a method for fornlizing and testing

theoretical propositions about regularities in social structure. The method
involves the use of graph theoretic concepts to restate verbal propositions
about local structure in terrrs of configurations. Although configurations

are relatively simple graph theoretic concepts we shed that they could be
used to represent some important social structural propositions

Arguing that nest theories of structure in interpersonal relations concern
average local properties we proceeded to develop statistical procedures
for testing the tendency of a particular property to hold across a social
network. With these procedures an investigator can determine whether the
discrepancy between the empirical occurrence, and the chance occurrence of

local structure is statistically significant. Some examples were presented
to illustrate the use of the method and its interpretation.
Sociometric data are quite coirucn. Because of their prevalence and
variety they represent an important and fundamental resource in the study

of structure in interpersonal relations. Hever, these data are complex
and, like all empirical measurements, they contain an unkncn arrcunt of

measurement error. Their inherent complexity and the likely presence of

measurement error significantly reduce their applicability to the study of
global

organization in small social systems. Moreover, such application can

also be questioned from the point of view of the level at which the data
are

collected.

Interpersonal

from local regularities in interpersonal relations. Although some simple

rrdels may fit

these data, the data are

properly used in the

study of local conditions.
The method we have described possesses several advantages when used
to study local structure in small-scale social systems. First, it leads
investigators to develop operational constructs which are

empirical testing. Many

of

the theoretical propositions advanced by

sociologists and social psychologists concern the behavioral and exper—

of

relations.
However, these propositions are rarely stated with precision and an
absence of ambiguity that would permit them to be tested. Second, the
rrthod focuses attention on the analysis of average local structure in
sociometric data. It thereby exploits the essential feature of these data.

the method facilitates the analysis of structural tendencies in

lead us to study random digraphs whose distributions

different from and often rrre complicated than the U I MAN distribution

discussed in Section 5. In this appendix we describe some of these distributions and propose an approxirrtion that may help with some of the rrcre
complicated ones.
A. Examples of Random Digraphs

The Uniform Distribution: This is the basic distribution from which all
the others we discuss here may be obtained by conditioning on particular

statistics of the graph. For the uniform distribution, all labeled digraphs
with g nodes are equally-likely. It is easy to generate the sociomatrix (X1)
for a uniformly distributed random digraph, because the

The

(A-i)

UI C Distribution: This is a simple conditional distribution of the

uniform distribution just described. C defined in (-6) denotes the number
of directed edges in the graph. Thus U C is the uniform distribution con-

ditioned on C. It makes all labeled digraphs with a specified value of C
equally-lixely. It is also easy to generate the sociomatrix for such a
random graph by selecting at random and without replacement C of the g( g-l)
possible ordered pairs of nodes and allocating the C directed edges to them.

In the uniform distribution C is a random variable with a binomial distribution

whereas in the UC distribution C is not random and is fixed at a specified
value.

The UI{X. } Distribution: This is the uniform distribution conditioned

by

the out-degrees. For the U{X1÷} distribution, all labeled digraphs

and N and C fix A. N is determined by M,A and g. This is also a highly

besides the UIMAN distribution. We have merely catalogued a few of the

important ones that stem from the notion of the uniform distribution. There

are a host of possibilities for non-uniform distributions but we will not
discuss them here. In a sense, the rin virtue of UIMAN is that it is the
nst highly conditioned uniform distribution that fixes N and A for which

we are currently able to compute the probabilities defined in
B.

Approxirrate Distributions for the Triad Census

While the UMAN distribution

is useful, it

does not control for the out-degrees

(which ny reflect experimental constraints like the fixed-choice procedure)

or the in-degrees (which reflect status and isolation). We are left with the
gnawing possibility that an observed triad census T from real data departs

substantially from its UI MAN expected value T not because there is structure
in the sociogram, but because T does not control for all the simple effects
we would like to condition out in our analysis.

Since a direct attack on the exact UIM,

{X1÷}

or UIM,

{X+}

distribution appears to be too difficult, at least at present, we propose the

folling indirect arid approxinte approach which rrakes use of the simple

nature of the conditional distributions for the multivariate noniial.

We observe that T is a sum of loosely correlated indicator variables

(i.e. see

(5-2)

), and thus it

under various random dis-

it is fairly simple to approximetely condition T on linear combinations

of its elements. N we make one further approximation, instead of conditioning

on {X.1+} we

condition on the mean, C, and

variance, S2out'

of the {X. }.

While

this is clearly a reduction in the level of conditioning used, it promises to

be useful. For example, if Sutz 0 this means that all the {X1} are equal
(i.e. the fixed - choice procedure). Now we use the result of s?ction that
C and S2out are essentially linear combinations

of the triad frequencies to

transform the problem to one of conditioning T on some of its linear corrinations.
There are various ways to impliment this approach and only direct empirical
will show us which ones are the nDst useful.
