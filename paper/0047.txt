THE DISTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS AND HUMAN WEALTH
IN A LIFE CYCLE CONTEXT

by
L. A. Lillard*

INTR)DUCTION AND SUMMARY

Economists

have

long been interested in individual earnings differ-

ences and in the dispersion of earnings within populations. Recent development of explicit theoretical and empirical earnings functions front

life cycle human capital investment models increases the potential to
explain existing earnings distributions and to predict changes in it.
Life cycle models suggest that current earnings are not a good index of
well—being if choices about interteinporal transfers are available. Under
certain conditions the present value of earnings net of investments in

human capital, human wealth, is an index of economic well-being. The
purpose of this paper is to outline a set of conditions under which
human wealth is an index of well-being in a life cycle as prefatory to
empirical estimates earnings and human wealth distributions for the

1960 Census population. Some tentative remarks on the interpretation

of economic well—being in a life cycle context when these conditions are

not

met. The basic conditions which allow human wealth to index well-

being include the existence of loan market for

consumption expenditures,

a fixed leisure—work time pattern, and no consumption

investment.

If

these are

be made

to human wealth.
The

basic earnings equation used to predict earnings and

human

is estimated on the NBER-Thorndjke sample described later.

Earnings are a function of age, schooling and

ability.

This earnings

function is used to predict earnings and human wealth distributions for
the 1960 Census population based on the joint distribution of age,
schooling, and ability based on age and schooling data from the 1960

Census of Population and ability data within schooling classes from the
NBER-Thorndike sample.

The purpose of this exercise is essentially to point out how earnings
functions, which have been studied quite extensively, can be made more
useful. That is by predicting humAn wealth and by generating earnings

distribution. Researchers often state "If the distribution of such and
such

an independent variable had been this, then

... ." These statements can

considered more formally as I am trying to illustrate here. Even if the
Thorndike sample isn't like the 1960 census (differences are noted
later), the
earnings function estimated from it can reproduce the general characteristics
be

of

the 1960 census observed earnings distribution. In another previous

paper

I have presented in more detail the statistical distribution theory.

necessary to go from the joint density of a population with respect to

characteristics which determine earnings through the estimated earnings
function to a predicted earnings distribution. Even without any restrictive
those

assumptions such

positively

as log—normality

the predicted distributions are

skewed and the moments for subpopulations Buch as schooling

and age groups behave similarly in actual and predicted distributions.
The many caveats are pointed out in the paper.

Predicted earnings distributions are derived for the overall population,

for schooling classes, for age groups, and for ability classes. Both the
actual distribution and the distribution of earnings corrected for variation
not explained by age, schooling, and ability are presented for each along

with selected summary statistics and Lorenz Curves. The predicted distributions reproduce the characteristics of the actual distributions for the
1960 Census population quite well except for differences which can be explained

between the 1960 Census population and NBER—Thorndike sample. This section
may be characterized as answering "What would be the distribution of earnings
of employed men if they were like the men in the NBER—Thorndike sample?"

Recognizing the

degree of

"fit" between predicted and observed 1960

Census earnings distributions and the reason for it we then proceed to
• predict the distributions of mean human wealth based on the same equations.

This section attempts to estimate "What would be the distribution of the
expected value of human wealth for employed men in the 1960 Census if they
were

like the NBER-Thorndike sample?" Detailed mean human wealth

distri-

butions and selected statistics are presented assuming a retirement age

of sixty—six for several rates of discount. The sensitivity of the selected statistics, especially the mean, to discount rate and retirement
age assumptions are then considered. Finally, some rough estimates of
the variance of human wealth rather than the variance of the mean, are
constructed.

Utility maximizing behavior is clearly influenced by the existence

clearly earnings in a given time

There are many possible sets of assumptions. Consider market
opportunities as they affect consumption, investment in human capital
and interperiod transfers of non-human wealth. The possibility of
borrowing and loaning funds, endowed or earned, expands the permissible
set of time paths of investment and

This development of the human capital model has ignored one sense of

the

time concept and has implicitly assumed that human capital is embodied

in the individual so that time and human capital enter the human capital

production function in the same way. That is, Q(Ka Da)

Q(SEa Da)

where S is the fraction of total time allocated to the production of new

human capital. An equivalent model can be developed in terms of the use

of

time. A fuller discussion of the time interpretation is attempted in

Ben—Porath (1967), Ghez (1972), Heckman (1974), and Lillard (1973).
The relevant index of lifetime economic well-being is lifetime

utility. Consider a pedagogical construction under which human wealth
defined as the present value of earnings net of educational investment
is a relevant measure of economic well—being and the effect of failure
to satisfy those conditions.

Human

Wealth

As An Index of Lifetime Well-Being

Human wealth is an index of economic well-being when the individual
behaves in such a way as to maximize the present value of net earnings
and there are no exogenous endowments of initial wealth or time stream

of receipts or debts. The individual then maximizes his lifetime

utility

by arranging intertemporal consumption in an optimal manner sub-

ject to the wealth constraint represented by human wealth. When exogenous
endowments are present but do not affect the
wealth

criteria

of maximizing human

their present value (positive for a time stream of receipts and

negative

for a time stream of debts) should be added to the wealth

constraint and correspondingly to the index of economic well-being.
Under what conditions then will an individual behave in such a way

as to maximize human wealth. We have already assumed the individual has
perfect knowledge of himself and the world and faces no uncertainties.
There is a fixed constant amount of time in each period to be allocated
to either the labor

production.1 The utility function of the individual does not include as
arguments either the stock of human capital or the use of time allocated

to either the labor market or human capital production. This condition
excludes the possibility that either investment or work is a more desirable activity, that obtaining education or going to school could be a
consumption activity, and that the individual might derive utility

directly from being more educated or highly trained. The individual has
available a source of unlimited borrowing and lending at a constant rate

of interest, r, for the purpose of consumption. This source of funds may
or may not be available to finance educational expenditures as long as

the loan markets are perfectly separable as defined earlier. If the unlimited funds are available for human capital investment then the funds

need not be separable and

markets

Porath (1967)

the model corresponds to the Ben—

specification. However, the loan market for human capital

may contain any sort of imperfection as long as it is separable. This
loan market may include low interest loans from parents or government
agencies, high interest loans due to the embodied nature of human capital,
or in the extreme no loan market for human capital investment expenditures

Time

spent in on—the—job training is considered in human capital production, as is investment time off-the-job, rather than in the labor market. The distinction of where investment occurs on or off the job has
no implication for total investment, assuming a single production function,
but does have empirical implications for the interpretation of earnings per
unit time for time intervals within a period. They may represent net or
gross earnings or even earning capacity. More detail on this issue is considered in Lillard (1974).

at

all. Under these conditions clearly the relevant rate of discount of

net earnings is the interest rate, r, on loans for consumption purposes.
The particular life cycle of earnings model specified by these
conditions, assuming no loan market for direct educational expenditures
and a Cobb—Douglas production function1 is capable of being fully solved
analytically which illustrates the simultaneity of schooling and earnings
while providing an exact functional form for earnings and human wealth.
This solution is exposited fully in Lillard (1973) and only summary
results are presented here.

The solution implies that in the early period the individual specializes in the production of new human capital, full time schooling, using

all of his earning capacity for investment.2 The period of specialization
is

0<a<a*
where a* denotes the age at which the individual stops specializing and

begins investing only a fraction of his earning capacity. Specialization
ends when earning capacity ceases to be an effective constraint on invest-

ment. One implication of assuming no loan market for educational

and the only qualitative

from

the

Ben-Porath per-

Specialization with no loan market meaxis investing exactly all of

earnings capacity in the form of foregone earnings and purchased inputs.
Specialization with the same perfect loan market available mean using all
of human capital in production and borrowing to finance purchased inputs.
There are many intermediate assumptions including availability of special
loan markets, scholarships, etc.2 which may be available only during the

period of specialization or formal full—time schooling. The effect of
these conditions are summarized in the stock of human capital, earning

capacity, at a*. This earning capacity at a* depends upon injtial earning capacity,

It is important

to

note that the solution for earn-

ings after the period of specialization take earning capacity as a* as a
datum,

both earnings and a* are endogenous state variables and any

exogenous change which affects earnings will also affect the length of

time in specialization and both must be considered jointly.

1The constant fraction result is due to the Cobb-Douglas productions

function.

2Becker (1967) provides

a discussion of loan markets.

— 12 —

The length of the period of specialization is endogenous to the model.
The optimum age to stop specializing in production and begin positive net
earning is that point where the investment paths of the two regions cross.

That is, the individual will invest according to the rule K and D for
a
a
non-specialization except when he is constrained by his earning capacity

during which period he will invest all of his earnings capacity. The
solution for a* as a function of the parameters and initial endowment of
human capital, but not age, is an implicit simultaneous structural re-

lationship which must be satisfied for each solution. The implicit
solution for a* must be considered simultaneously with earnings function

to make any inferences. The expression allows inferences about the
direction of effect of each characteristic on the length of the period of
specialization.

For the particular solution reported in Lillard (1974) the length
of the specialization period varies directly with N, R, and B and in-

versely with E, P and r. The effect of all other characteristics is

ambiguous.

For the rest of the life cycle, after the period of specialization
ends, a* < a < N, the individual invests some fraction of his earning

capacity in producing more human capital. Neither foregone earnings nor
direct educational expenditures and thus investment in human capital is

declines with age after the period of specialization reaching zero at

retirement age2 N. Earning capacity, observed earnings, and net earnings at any age after a* depend upon the stock of human capital and the

investments at that age. All of these results for the specific solution
are presented in greater detail in Lillard (1974).

Given these assumptions so that human wealth is an index of well-

being what then does human wealth depend upon. As we have noted it depends upon access to borrowing funds to finance human capital investment.
Clearly access to such a loan market expands investment possibilities and

enhances human wealth. Also individuals may differ in the efficiency
with which human capital is produced, the productjon parameters $

and 2 in the specific model above. More efficiency in producing new
human capital clearly increases human wealth. An empirical counterpart
to B is introduced later.

An increase in the retirement age, N, or a decline in the rate of

interest will clearly increase human wealth. A decline in the rate at
which human capital deteriorates,6 ,

will

clearly increase human wealth.

Individuals may differ in some or all of these parameters. For empirical

purposes we will asse that they differ only in ability representing efficiency of production and schooling representing a*. The effect of increased schooling on human wealth is less clear since it represents the
effect of all other differences between individuals and these differences
must satisfy the implicit simultaneous schooling relationship.

When Human Capital Is Not An Index of Well-Being

The life cycle model

makes it

clear that when individual inter-

temporal choice is available individual period earnings are a myopic

measure of well—being. Under certain conditions when intertemporal
consumption choices are perfectly free human wealth is a measure of
lifetime well-being and individual period earnings observations and
the age-earnings profile itself merely illustrates the optimal timing

of a separable process. When these very stringent conditions are not
met the problem of indexing well-being falls ultimately back to con-

siderations of the intertemporal utility function. Human wealth and

the lifetime pattern of earnings become variables of choice. Constructing an index based on observable values becomes extremely com-

plex. The relevant models of life cycle behavior have not yet been
fully developed or analyzed. The problem is not solved here but
relaxation of certain conditions one at a time may lend some addi-

tional insight into the problem. Let us begin with relatively simple
deviations with the clearest implications.
The first potential problem is that schooling or education or
the level of investment in human capital may enter the utility func-

tion directly. Alternatively utility may be a function of the stock
of human capital held by the individual, say as a status measure or

by affecting the efficiency of consumption, see Michael (1972). In
these cases an investment in human capital yields returns not

individual

unambiguously better off even if he chooses a lower value

of human wealth than an individual beginning with less. This does
not get us very far empirically but is meant as food for thought.
Another obvious omitted concept is non—human wealth which must

be included in any wealth calculations. The existence of initial
non-human wealth clearly affects the access of the individual to
funds for financing educational investments.
The effect of risk and uncertainty on investment in human capital
is considered briefly by Levhari and Weiss (1973) and Razin (1973).
Again the problem is exceedingly difficult and clear implications are
few.

These tenuous statements are meant only as caveats in the interpretation of the empirical estimates which follow.

1960 CENSUS: PREDICTED EARNINGS DISTRIBUTIONS
AND THE DISTRIBUTION OP HUMAN WEALTH

The previous sections considered the appropriateness of certain measures of economic well-being. This section considers the distribution of
well-being if it is measured by either earnings or human wealth. Both
the overall distributions and distributions within schooling and ability

classes and age classes where appropriate will be considered. The format
is to consider an earnings equation estimated using the NBER-Thorndike
sample data then to predict aggregate

earnings distributions for the

1960 Census. The estimated age-earnings equations are a function of
schooling and ability levels. This section may be characterized as
answering "What would be the distribution of earnings of the men in the
NBER-Thorndike sample if they had the distribution of age and schooling
present in the 1960 Census?" or "What would be the distribution of earnings of employed men in 1960 if they were like the men in the NBER-

Thorndike sample?" As will be pointed out later, several caveats are in
order to use one group to predict the other. Predicted and actual 1960
distributions are compared when possible.
Recognizing the degree of "fit" between predicted and observed 1960
Census earnings distributions and the reason for it we then proceed to
predict the distributions of mean human wealth based on the same equations.
This section attempts to estimate "What would be the distribution of the expected value of human wealth" either "of the men in the NBER-Thorndike sample
if they had the schooling distribution present in the 1960 Census?" or "of

.

— 19 —

employed men in the 1960 Census if they were like the NBER-Thorndike sample?"
Detailed mean human wealth distributions and selected statistics are presented assuming a retirement age of sixty-six for several rates of discount.

The sensitivity of the selected statistics, especially the mean, to dis-

count rate and retirement age assumptions are then considered. Finally,
some rough estimates of the variance of human wealth rather than the
variance of the mean, are constructed.
A lower bound on the variance of human wealth is defined as the
variance in the present value of predicted earnings plus an error component which is completely transitory and independent from period to period.
An upper bound is defined as the variance of the present value of predicted earnings plus a completely persistent error component which is
constant over the life cycle but varies randomly over individuals

independently of the level of ability and schooling. Intermediate cases
can be considered as combinations of these when the transitory and persistent variations are independent.

The primary conclusions are that aggregate earnings distributions
can be reproduced reasonably well even with the crude calculations made
here and that it is possible to generate estimates of human wealth dis-

tributions. In doing so we can study the effect of schooling level,
of ability level on the distributions and on measures of

inequality. These estimates are especially sensitive to discount rate
assumptions. The effect of increased schooling level, for example, is
to increase mean human wealth at discount rates below some level and

— 20 —

to

decrease mean human wealth at discount rates above that level. The

cutoff rate is in the neighborhood of 5.5 per cent. If 5.5 per cent is
below what we believe to be the appropriate discount rate, say the rate
appropriate to consumption loans or the real rate of return on physical
assets, then the discrepancy could be accounted for by, for example, the

consumption value of schooling or education discussed earlier. In this
case then the human wealth measure is not a good index of economic
well-being and the distribution of mean human wealth not a good measure
of the distribution of mean economic well—being. We may gain some insight into the partial effect of other attributes such as ability if
they don't affect the consumption value of schooling.

Ability increases

the mean human wealth almost uniformly. Some inferences are made about
the effect of retirement age on mean human wealth but these results are
tenuous due to the limited upper age range in the sample.

A Specific Earnings Function and Estimates
It is well founded theoretically and empirically that earnings de-

pend upon schooling, ability, and age or experience1 The earnings
function estimated and used here results from a life cycle of earnings
model which is discussed elsewhere in detail along with the empirical

estimates.2 The estimated earnings function is cubic in age, quadratic
in schooling, and cubic in ability, including all interactions. This

Age and schooling in this equation are years beyond age sixteen. No individual in the sample had less than a high school education.
Caution should be taken for predicting below this schooling level, especially
late in the life cycle. The estimates are based on observation of 15,578 age—

points from 4,956 individuals. The upper age range of the sample is
54 years and the age earnings profiles turn down sharply because there are
four men who are three to four years older than the rest of the sample, older
when applying in 1943, who have unusually low earnings. All predictions of
earnings are restricted as closely as possible to the age range observed.

Consider

the characteristics of the NBER-Thorndike sample which may

make it different from the general population described in the 1960 Census.
The NBER-Thorndike sample is based on a group of males volunteering for

Air Force pilot, navigator, and bonibadier programs in the last half of
1943. These volunteers were given initial screening tests
seventeen

and a

set of

tests to measure various abilities2 in 1943. Thorndike and

Hagen sent a questionnaire to a sample of 17,000 of these men in 1955

which included a question on 1955 earnings. The NBER sent to a subset
of these a subsequent questionnaire in 1969 which included additional
questions on earnings in later years and questions on schooling and
initial job earnings.

The data includes five separate approximately equally spaced points3
on the age—income profile as well as the year of initial job, year of

predictions it was assumed the earnings profiles are flat after the end
of the sample range where the profiles peak. I prefer this to either the
quadratic or linear profile estimates. For example, in the quadratic
estimates the profiles rise parabolically since the convexity at early ages
dominates the concavity at older ages, which is even more unrealistic.

full-time schooling, years of schooling and seventeen separate measures

of ability. The age—income points are approximately initial job, 1955, 1960,
1964, and 1968. The individuals in the Thorndike sample differ from the

U.S. male population as a whole in several ways.1 First the sample includes
a high ability group. All of the men completed high school of high school
equivalency examinations, and passed the initial screening for the Air Force

flight program. Their general health was better than the general population2

in 1969. They were more homogenous in height and weight due to military
qualifications. They seem to have a high degree of self confidence, self
reliance and risk preference. They tend to be entrepreneurs, an unusual 20

per cent work longer hours. Some of these factors may however be related
to the high ability. The observed age range is nineteen to fifty—seven
years but with less than 1 per cent outside the range nineteen to fifty—

five. The cubic earnings equation is quite a poor prediction above this
range since predicted earnings drop rapidly to large negative values;
therefore, earnings are assumed constant at their peak level after the
peak occurs.3

data collection for the NBER.

good, 3 per cent fair, and less than 1 per cent each were poor or nonresponse.

3when mean earnings predicted distributions are derived without this
assumption (and negative earnings are not counted in relative frequencies)
about 10 per cent of total frequency is lost primarily from high schooling, low ability, and late age groups. Three, fifteen, eighteen, and
twenty—seven per cent are lost within schooling classes 12, 13—15, 16, and
17+, respectively. Four, eight, twenty, and thirty—eight per cent are lost
within age groups 30—34, 35—44, 45—54, and 55—64, respectively. Thirty—
three and fourteen per cent are lost within the lowest and second lowest
(both below average) ability groups, respectively.

Earnings Distributions from the Estimated Earnings Function
The distribution of earnings derives from the distribution of the

population with respect to age, ability, and schooling. Our predictions
use 1960 United States Census of Population data on the distribution of
the United States population of males eighteen years old and over by
labor force status, years of school completed,

and

age to predict earn-

ings distributions based on the estimated earnings function.1 A general
framework for translating the

which

joint

density of age and

characteristics

determine earnings through the earnings function into earnings or

human wealth density is presented in Lillard (1973).
Since the earnings
of

function predicts earnings only after the end

full-time schooling, the distribution of the population by age and

schooling is taken only for persons employed and in the civilian labor

force. The joint and marginal distributions of age and schooling are
presented

in Table 1. Since all persons in the NBER—Thorndike sample

have at least a high school

education, predictions are restricted to

that population. That is, the distribution of yearly earnings is predicted for persons who are between the ages of eighteen and sixty-four,

have at least a high school education and are employed.2 The

1U.S. Census of Population: 1960 (Final Report PC(a)—5A) Subject Reports, School Enrollment: Personal and Family Characteristics of Persons Enrolled in School or College and of Persons Not Enrolled (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1963, Table 4, page 54).
2The age is extended to forty-four because it corresponds to the
closest Census of Population age classification 35—64 years old. The
distributions do include persons employed while going to school full
time and are correspondingly incorrectly estimated.

distribution
the

of the population with respect to ability is assumed to be

same as the NBER—Thorndike sample on which the earning function was

estimated since no ability data are reported in the 1960 Census of

Population. Statistics for the distribution of ability by schooling
class

used is presented in Table 2.1 For calculation of predicted yearly

income, it is assumed that all individuals in an age or schooling class
are at the midpoint of that class.2
Yearly earnings are calculated for each age, schooling, ability

combination corresponding to midpoints of class intervals. Each calculated yearly income assumes the relative frequency of the corresponding

age, schooling, ability combination. The relative frequency of any
(A, B, S) combination is calculated as the joint relative frequency of
the age, schooling combination reported by the Census of Population
times the relative frequency of the ability level within that schooling

class.3 These relative frequencies are then sunned into relative

1Forty ability intervals were actually used in calculations.
2Any assumption about how observations are distributions within reported class intervals is arbitrary. This assumption facilitates calculation of earnings but adds a source of error in the predicted distribution of earnings. The predicted relative frequencies are created in a
discrete rather than a continuous manner.
3Assuming this distribution of ability is a source of error in the
predicted distribution to the extent that the distribution of ability
of Air Force pilot and navigator school candidates in 1943 is different from the distribution of ability of employed males in 1960.

The resulting predicted overall distribution of earnings and the
predicted distribution for various subpopulations effectively represent
distributions of mean earnings allowing no variation around the pre-

dicted value. However, only about 28 per cent of the variation in earnings is explained by variation in age, schooling, and ability.

Consider the problem of correcting the distribution of earnings
for variation not accounted for by variation in age, schooling, and

ability. The error variance of the estimating equation is ct
(standard error =

6049.25).

= 36593472.

It is assumed that the errors are identi-

cally and independently2 distributed with mean zero and standard devia-

tion 6049.25. The obvious first order approximation is to simply correct
the standard deviations of the various distributions by simply using, for
example,

=

/arAS,B

[Y(A,S,B)] =

/VarA,S,B

(Y(A,S,B)] +

1The equal intervals of $1,000 is used to allow the greatest perspective
and skewness since the discrete and widely spaced midpoints of the age and
schooling intervals distort the continuity of the predicted distribution.
The predicted distributions with unequal interval lengths for higher incomes
used in Census of Population tabulations are presented later for comparisons
with the actual distributions calculated from Census of Population data.
2Each individual observations error is distributed independently of age,
schooling, ability and the error in any other observation.

— 34 —

This

correction is unsatisfactory because of the possibility of negative

earnings and it is desirable to see the effect on other statistics than

the variance. Another simple approximate procedure based on the truncated normal is used to construct the distributions themselves, then

selected statistics are calculated from these distributjons) This
procedure is not entirely satisfactory either since the truncation increases the mean and decreases the dispersion, but it allows a crude

approximation. The probability density for any individual age, schooling, ability combination is calculated as before but the density is
allocated to earnings intervals according to the above normal distribution centered on the midpoint of the interval in which the predicted

value falls. This is an admittedly crude but simple correction. Better
corrections can no doubt be obtained through more complex calculations.
The interval in which the predicted earnings value falls receives an
incremental relative frequency of .0662 times the relative frequency of

that age, schooling, ability combination. Intervals adjoining the central interval receive an incremental relative frequency of .0643 times
the relative frequency of (A, S, B) each, and so forth until all relative
frequency of the error is exhausted.
Finally, the actual distribution of earnings for employed males
sixteen to sixty-four years old with at least a high school education

normal so that only positive earnings are counted and the total relative frequency of all positive earnings is unity.

is

calculated from more general distributions reported in the 1960 Census

of Population.

All three overall earnings distributions and the corresponding
Lorenz Curves are presented in Figures 3.

Selected statistics and re-

lative frequency tables are included in the tables of individual type
distribution subsections.

The major caveats may be summarized as follows. The NBER—Thorndike
sample and the population of employed males in 1960 differ in several ways
the most important of which is the high level of ability present in the

NBER-Thorndike sample. Even though ability distributions by schooling
class are used, the distribution of ability especially in lower schooling classes will overstate ability relative to the actual distribution

in the 1960 population. The 1960 population is heavily concentrated at
lower levels of schooling especially high school which is at the lower
end

to

of the range of observation for the Thorndike sample and thus subject
less confidence in estimation.

schooling

Interval midpoints with respect to

are used for schooling classes 13—15 (14) and 17+ (18). More

precise information about the distribution within these intervals would
sharpen the prediction.

Predictions beyond age fifty—six are made assuming earnings con-

stant after peak earnings. This is necessary due to the data limitations in the NBER-Thorndike sample. The age distribution used from the
1960 Census assumes individuals are at the midpoint of age intervals
that increase in length from two years at early ages to ten at late ages.

of the 1960 population falls in the least reliable

age interval 55-64.

The unequal intervals also cause problems in comparing predicted and

actual earnings distributions. Predicted distributions can be made for

any

interval groups and are made for equal $1,000 intervals here. The

Census of Population earnings distributions are unequal beyond $7,000.

Statistics

are computed using interval midpoints and will vary with differ-

ent groupings. The interval midpoint 40,000 is used for the interval > 15
in the Census of Population while equal 1,000 intervals up to 90,000 are
used for predicted distributions.

Several important differences remain. The 1960 Census figures are

for total income while the predicted figures are for earnings in the labor
market. There may be important differences in weeks worked during the

year,

and hours worked during the

week between the

sample and the popula-

tion. There are indications that the men in the NBER-Thorndike sample
tend to work longer hours and to spend less time unemployed. Another very
important difference is that the 1960 Census figures include employed
students while these persons are excluded in estimating the earnings func-

tion. This contributes to the large relative frequency of very low income
at early ages in the actual Census distribution. For example, 53 per cent
of eighteen and nineteen year olds earned less than $1,000. These are
likely to be employed students.

Predicted

Mean Earnings Distributions

These earnings distributions are derived by transforming probability
density from three-dimensional (age, schooling, ability) space through

the estimated earnings function into the earnings dimension. Since age,
schooling, and ability are not the only characteristics of an individual
which determine earnings, these may be termed expected or mean earnings

distributions. They are the distribution of the expected value of earnings.

Selected statistics relating to the earnings distributions are

presented in Table 3. The relative frequency distributions and Lorenz
Curves are in Figure 4.

Predicted Earnings Distributions Corrected for Unexplained Variation
These earnings distributions are mean earnings distrIbutions cor—
rected for variation in earnings not explained by age, schooling, and

ability. Instead of transforming density from (age, schooling, ability)space into a single earnings point it is spread over the positive real
line in a manner proportional to the normal probability density with its
center at the predicted mean value and standard deviation equal to the
estimated standard error of the regression.
Selected statistics are presented in Table 4.

Relative frequency

distributions and Lorenz Curves are presented in Figure 5.

Actual Earnings Distributions

These earnings distributions are those actually observed in the 1960

Census. Again they include total income and include employed students.
Selected statistics are presented in Table 5. Relative frequencies
Lorenz Curves are presented in Figure 6.
Comparison of Mean Earnings, Corrected Earnings,
and Actual Earnings Distributions

It should be remembered than any comparisons between predicted and
actual distributions are subject to the qualifications implied by earlier

comments. Another important factor in comparing actual and predicted
statistics is the unequal 1960 Census income intervals, especially the

open ended interval "greater than $15,000." Better comparisons could be
obtained from more detailed intervals since the selected statistic estimates
are quite sensitive to the interval midpoint chosen for the "greater than
$15,000" interval.

Both the mean

and

corrected earnings distributions display the gen-

eral characteristic of the actual distribution but tend to "overstate"

earnings. All of the distributions display positive skewness, and have
center and dispersion positively related to age and schooling. The predicted distributions also indicate increased center and dispersion with

increased ability. The distributions corrected for unexplained variation
tend to "overcorrect" in the sense that the resulting distributions are
more smooth than the actual distribution.
The mean earnings distributions obviously have less dispersion than
either the corrected or actual distributions, and the corrected distributions
tend to overpredict mean earning relative to the actual distribution, especially

at young ages. The procedure used for "correcting" the mean earnings dis—

tribution to account for error variation seems to be inadequate. Evidence
cited later with respect to human wealth will indicate that the error is
not purely transitory, but has a persistent element that is related to age.
That is, there are unobserved variables which may be uncorrelated with

schooling and ability but which are not uncorrelated with age. An individual's profile may lie wholly above or wholly below the estimated profile

and this is not captured in the correction to earnings distribution. Further
evidence indicates that the distribution of this persistent component of
earnings is itself positively., skewed ihich would further enhance the positive

skewness of earnings as evidenced by the underprediction of positive
skewness in the predicted as opposed to actual earnings distributions.
These problems could be partially alleviated by a more complete accounting of

the variation in earnings than is present in this earning function. It should
be remembered, however, that a source of the discrepancy in skewness is

the large number of employed students at very low income level. The students'
problem also partially explains the overprediction of the mean at young ages.
For example, note the $l000—$2000 mean income of eighteen through twenty—

one year olds. Fully employed males should have mean earnings greater than
this even at young ages. The inclusion of these students will also pull down
the mean of the overall actual distribution and the mean of the lower schooling

groups. It should be noted, also, that the correction procedure by truncating
the normal distribution at zero earnings and using conditional densities causes
the corrected means to be too large.

Consider the properties of these distributions in more detail. With
respect to central tendency, both the mean and median are overstated by the

— 62

predicted

—

distribution. Even so, the mean and median move in the right

direction between age and schooling classes. The mean increases within
higher schooling classes for both predicted and actual distributions.
Mean and median earnings rise continuously with age in the actual distributions but decline very slightly before rising continuously after age

twenty—four in both predicted distributions. The dip in mean earnings is
clearly evident in the age—earnings profiles in Figure la. In the actual
distribution this property would be hidden by the inclusion of employed

yount students with very low earnings. Both mean and median earnings are

predicte to rise sharply as the ability level of a subgroup rises. Again
the high ability level of the NBER—Thorndike sample itself is a source of

the overstatement of earnings. It should be noted that the overall mean of
the population is a weighted average' of individual subgroup means, whether
grouped age, schooling, or ability.

Dispersion is overstated in the corrected predicted distribution when
measured by the standard deviation but understated when measured by the co-

efficient of variation. The standard deviation increases continuously with school-

ing. As age increases it dips slightly before age twenty-four in the
predicted distributions then rises continuously as it does throughout in

the actual distribution. It is interesting to note here that the variance
of overall earnings is the sum

groups

of

the average of the variances of the sub-

and the variance of average earnings of subgroups.2

Another

characteristic of earnings distributions widely discussed

in the literature is concentration represented by the Lorenz Curve and

1The weights are obviously the relative frequency of the subgroups.
the average, of variances, and the variance, of averages, are
calculated weighted by the relative frequency of the subgroups. Formally
Var(Y) — E (Var(Y subgroup)]
+ Var (E(Y subgroup)].

— 63

its

—

summary statistic the Gini coefficient) The Gini coefficient is

roughly the same between the corrected predicted and actual distributions except that the predicted distributions always understate inequality at the extremes of age and schooling and overstates it in the

middle range. This is partially caused by the large unequal income intervals
in the actual distributions. Since the Lorenz Curve is approximated by
joining chords, the Gini is always understated but the understatement is much
larger for the actual distributions.

1The Gini coefficient is the area between the diagonal and the Lorenz
Curve relative to the area of the triangle, one-half. A larger Gini
coefficient implies more inequality. The extremes are zero when every
individual get an equal share of total income and one when one individual holds total income.
An alternative interpretation of the Gini coefficient is the mean
absolute difference between all possible pairs of values relative to their
mean, i.e.

+ +
f I

x

-Y

f(X) F(Y) dX dY

2X
X and Y represent all possible pairs of values, earnings, and the numerator
is the coefficient of mean difference. The mean difference due to Gini
(1912) is dependent on the dispersion of the values among themselves and
not on deviations from the mean as in the case of the standard deviation

and thus coefficient variation. The Lorenz Curve and Gini coefficient are
unambiguous measures of concentration only if the Lorenz Curves do not
cross. An infinite number of Lorenz Curves may have the same Gini concentration coefficient if they cross. If two Lorenz Curves cross once, say
at the point (.7, .3) and have the same Gini coefficient the population
underlying the Lorenz Curve which is beneath in the region bounded by
(0,)), (0, .3), (.7, 0), and (.7, .3) may be said to have income distributed more unequally among low income holders (lower 70 per cent) than
among high income holders relative to the other population. This says

nothing about location of high and low, only about the concentration of
low relative to high income holders. This may be thought of as if populations have the same Gini coefficient, and thus their Lorenz Curves must
cross, and the same variance and mean, the population with the largest
positive skew will have its Lorenz Curve above the other in the lower
earnings region.

— 64 —

The predicted distributions tend to indicate less skewness than the
actual distribution but this statistic is very sensitive to the unequal
broad earnings classes in the actual distribution and the results are not

directly comparable. This statistic, as mentioned is especially sensitive
to the normality assumption used for the correction.

Predicted Human Wealth Distributions from the
Estimated Earnings Function

The purpose

of this section is to predict the distribution of human

wealth overall, by schooling class and by ability class for several inter-

est rates and retirement ages. Human wealth is defined here as the present
value of earnings net of educational or human capital investments over the

individual's lifetime. The earnings function and corresponding age—
earnings profiles estimated from the NSER—Thorndike sample correspond to
an earnings somewhere between net and gross values depending upon what

fraction of investment is obtained on—the—job. The empirical measure of
mean human wealth is then the integral of the discounted estimated earnings function with respect to age from the end of formal schooling to the
retirement age.

Since the estimated earnings function corresponds to mean earnings
the estimated human wealth corresponds accordingly to the mean present

value of observed earnings. Since the mean error for any age is zero
and the estimation error is assumed to be uncorrelated with age, schooling or ability, the expected discounted sum of errors over the life
cycle is also zero.

That is,

so that

The predicted distributions presented in this section are the distributions

of RV(S, B) and thus correspond to mean human wealth distributions. This
should be carefully noted in observing the small measures of dispersion

and inequality. Corrections for other sources of variation are considered

later. The means

should

be unbiased estimates but the variation should be

interpreted as variation in the mean, which obviously has much less dis-

persion. Thus overall variation is due to differences in expected human
wealth due to schooling and ability. Variation within a subgroup, say
schooling, is due to differences in expected human wealth due to the other
factor, ability.

Everyone in the population is assumed to have the same discount rate
and the same workIng life, but individuals differ in schooling and ability.
Density is transformed from two-dimensional (schooling, ability) - space
into human wealth - space through the integral function. The same schooling and ability distribution and midpoints are used as before. Detailed
selected statistics for mean human wealth are presented in Tables 6

discount rates three through seven and retirement ages sixty—six and

seventy and a retirement age that is a function of schooling level. The
expected retirement ages as a function of schooling level, N(S), are taken
from Mincer (1973) and are reproduced in Table 9.

The relative frequency distributions for discount rates three,
five, and seven per cent and retirement age sixty—six are presented
in Figures 7.

The most striking result is that there is much less inequality in

mean human wealth than in mean earnings. Both the coefficient of variation and the Gini coefficient drop drastically. To the extent that
perfect capital markets for consumption are available to everyone the
human wealth variation is a more appropriate index of the variation in
expected economic well—being.

The clearest result of a more detailed study of the effect of
schooling, ability, retirement age and the discount rate is that an
increased retirement age unambiguously raises mean human

wealth,

see

Figure 8, and an increased discount rate unambiguously lowers it, see
Figure 9.

It is interesting to note that a 1 per cent change in the

rate of discount, within the range three to seven, has a much larger
affect on mean human wealth than an increase of four years in retire-

ment age from sixty-six to seventy. As expected retirement age has an
increasingly smaller effect at higher discount rates but the rate of
discount has an increasingly greater effect for later retirement ages.

The effect of the discount rate on variation in human wealth is more
ambiguous and is intimately related to the effect of schooling

wealth.

on

human

It is important to note that due to the year of foregone earnings

and the short initial period of lower earnings associated with more schooling, increased schooling does not unambiguously increase predicted human

wealth or mean human wealth averaged over ability levels. Predicted
human wealth increases with increased schooling only if the discount rate

is below the internal rate of return) Figures 10 and 11 clearly illustrates this result for mean human wealth at various schooling levels.
The reversal occurs at approximately 5.75 per cent except that high school

graduates pass those with some college at approximately 4.5 per cent. The
effect of schooling declines as the discount rate increases up to the

crossover then has a negative effect on mean human wealth. Thus an increased rate of discount decreases variation up to about 6 per cent at
which point

it causes the variation within ability groups, due to school-

ing, to increase. That is, at high discount rates schooling differences
cause variation but because of its increasing negative effect on human
wealth.

The effect of increased ability is to unambiguously increase mean

human wealth as illustrated in Figures 12 and 13. The magnitude of the
effect of ability declines at higher discount rates since the returns to
higher ability come late in the life cycle.

The human wealth distributions are corrected for error variation by
decomposing the error into purely random or transitory and persistent

components. A lower bound on the variance of human wealth is defined as
the variance of the present value of predicted earnings plus an error
component which is completely transitory and independent from period to

period. An upper bound is defined as the variance of the present value
of predicted earnings plus a completely persistent error component which
is constant over the life cycle but varies randomly over individuals

independently of the level of ability and schooling. Intermediate cases
can be considered as combinations of these when the transitory and per-

sistent variations are independent. The upper and lower bounds allow no
comparisons of inequality in human wealth versus earnings since human wealth
coefficient of variation lower bound lies below and the human wealth
coefficient of variation upper bound lies above the earnings coefficient

of variation. The answer lies in the "persistence" of the error over an
individual's lifetime. The standard deviation of the persistent component
is estimated and used to estimate standard deviation and coefficient of

variation for human wealth. Corresponding estimates are also made by
calculating the actual present value of the residuals for each individual.
Consider the more general combination of these two variance components.

Both the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation
differ widely
between the lower and upper bound. The inequality in mean or expected

S

human wealth is much less than either the lower bound or upper bound.
This indicates that the error component is very important in determining
human wealth inequality and indicates that the persistent component is

very important in determining inequality in human wealth. We can note,
however, that inequality in mean values before correcting for error
variation is much less for human wealth than for earnings———in the overall

values the difference being 38 percent for earnings as opposed to about 5 or

6 percent for human wealth. When the correction for error variation is made
the lower and upper bound on the coefficient variation for human wealth

brackets the coefficient of variation for either the predicted distribution
of earnings or the actual coefficient of variation observed for earnings.
It is necessary, then, to estimate the variance of the persistent component
in revising our estimate of the standard deviation and coefficient of
variation of human wealth.

The standard deviation of the persistent component of the error term

is estimated in the following way. For each individual, of the roughly5,000 in the sample, the persistent component is measured as that value of
a constant error, deviation from the predicted profile, such that the present value
of deviations from it, the purely transitory part, is zero, i.e.,

=

()_ra

The standard deviation of the error term is $6,048 and the standard deviation
of the persistent component, a6, is roughly $4,000 depending on the discount

rate. The corresponding estimates of the standard deviation and coefficient
of variation of human wealth based upon this estimate of the standard
deviation of the persistent component are presented in Table 12 under

the heading "Estimated for 1960 Census Groups Using as."
Corresponding estimates are made by calculating the actual present

value of the residuals in the sample and inflating them to the equivalent
of a working life of observations1, and taking the standard deviation.
These are presented as the "directly estimated" values also presented

in Table 12. These estimates correspond quite closely to those of the
previous procedure and are larger probably because of the more schooling
present in the Thorndike sample than the 1960 census of population.
The estimated inequality in human wealth is slightly less than the
inequality in the predicted earnings distributions corrected for unexplained

variations, the coefficient of variation being 60 percent for earnings and

50 percent for human wealth. The actual distribution of earnings are even
more unequally distributed with the coefficient of variation of 83 percent.
It should be noted that the coefficient of variation for the actual distribution of earnings is larger than even the upper bound of the coefficient
of variation for the human wealth distributions.
These crude estimates seem to indicate that human wealth is more equally
distributed over individuals than is earnings, but that the variation in
these measures due to other factors than schooling and ability are quite
important and that much further analysis is necessary to really pinpoint

sources of human wealth inequality. This analysis is meant to be
suggestive of the procedure by which more precise implications can be

obtained. This general type of analysis can be carried out using any

maximum of five and an average of 3.2 age—earnings points are observed.
These are then inflated by the factor (N—S)/No. of Points. These estimates
are slightly different from the others in that the underlying schooling distribution is that of the Thorndike sample rather than the 1960 Census population.
