PRCI'ECTION AND CONPETITIVENESS IN
EGYPTIAN AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY

by

Bent Hansen and Karim Nashashibi*

This paper contains the basic statistical material upon which Effective
Rates

of Protection (ERPs), Domestic Resource Costs (DRCs), and crop acreage

responses

were calculated by the authors for their volume on Egypt

in

the

NBER project Foreign Trade Regimes and Economic Development. This material,
which includes some comparisons of Egyptian costs of production with those of
other countries for a number of conimodities, is too extensive for that volume,

in which interest is focused on the end results of the calculations. The
underlying data, however, are

not

easily accessible: some of them took us a

to gather, and readers might want to work on the data themselves
for further research in this field. We also felt that readers should be in
long time

a position to evaluate our calculations.
In agriculture it was possible to estimate EPPs and DRCs for fourteen

crops in 1961 and 1963, and for ten crops in 1964. 1962 had to be left out
because the official exchange rate changed in the middle of the agricultural

year, and for several crops it was uncertain which rate should be applied in
converting Egyptian pounds to U.s. dollars, or vice versa. In manufacturing,
major industries were studies for as many years as possible between 1954 and

1970, but for some industries data were available only for one single year.

In all cases our choice of coverage (crops and industries as
was

*

well as years)

dictated by the availability of data.

I. DEFINITIONS

The effective rate of protection (EPP) is defined as
DVAom -

DVAt

DVAt

xlOO

where DVA stands for domestic value added, including nontraded produced
inputs. DVA is thus equal to total value of output minus produced traded
inputs, all in terms of domestic currency. Dom indicates estimate at domestic

prices, mt

at

international prices (in domestic currency), while i denotes

crop or industry.

Domestic

resource costs, or, DRC, are defined as the sum of labor costs,

rental of land, and

"normal" gross returns to capital, plus the

value of

nontraded produced inputs minus nontraded outputs, all expressed in domestic

currency. DRC per U.S. dollar then follows directly through division by
dollar value of traded output minus traded inputs, at international prices
in terms of U.S. dollars.

II. AGRICULTURE, EP.Ps, AND DRCs

The data used in calculating the ERPs arid DRCs are reproduced in the
Appendix, Tables 2A-2C and 3A—3C. The calculations of the DRCs are presented

in Tables 4A—4C. The results are summarized in Appendix Table 1.
For

from

and

output,

acreaqes, yields, and domestic prices, data were obtained

publications of the Ministry of Agriculture. These (for outputs, acreages,

yields) are known to be quite reliable and of satisfactory quality for

our purpose. Domestic prices seem to be ex—farm; thus, the cotton price is for

—3—

unginned

cotton (cotton seeds with lint). Output of by—products such as straw

and stalks is included; for certain crops (wheat, in particular) this changes
the picture substantially. In the case of peanuts1 and chick—peas, straw was
not

included for 1961; so that year the output values for these crops are

somewhat too low for that year.
In

estimating output values at international prices we encountered some

difficulties.

used; they were

modities gave rise to difficulties. Thus, Egyptian cotton in 1961 had 9
varieties with 13 grades, each with its own price; some varieties and grades

were not exported (or imported) and

had to rely here on the Egyptian Cotton Commission' s published prices for

exports, which may not include all handling costs in Egypt and thus fall short

of export price f.o.b. For nonexported varieties, prices were imputed on
the basis of the export price for comarab1e varieties. Weighted averages
were then calculated. Some agricultural outputs had been both exported and

imported, and typically the export price f.o.b. was higher than the import
price c.i.f. In some cases this was due to exports of superior qualities

'Note a problem of interpretation here. In the official Egyptian publications the word ful soudani is used; its meaning in colloquial Arabic is
invariably peanuts. The official translation into French is arachide, which
in colloquial French can mean both peanuts and groundnuts, but botanically
means groundnuts. The offical translation into English is groundnuts. We
have assumed that the item included peanuts only; but if groundnuts are meant,
or an aggregate of the two, our calculations for this item on the basis of
international prices may not be correct.

—4—

and imports of inferior qualities; but it may also be a question of seasonal

price differences. The authors proceeded on the premise that commodities
actually exported should be evaluated at export prices f.o.b. and the rest at

c.i.f. or other international prices. Since domestic prices were apparently
ex-farm, estimates at international prices somehow had to take into account

domestic trade and transport margins. On the basis of average prices for
cotton

at Alexandria and at ginning xn.ills, it was calculated that trade and

transport margins were about 10 per cent of the output value for cotton, and
this margin was applied to all crops;2 the actual margin, however, may differ
substantially from crop to crop. It was included in domestic resource costs
among the nontradable produced inputs (see below).
The cost of estimates are based on the

Ministry

of Agriculture's calcu-

lations of costs per feddan for individual crops for the years 1961 to 1964.

The Ministry's calculations are based on extensive yearly surveys of actual
costs, taking into consideration farm size, location, composition of produc-

tion, etcetera. Economists who have been given the opportunity to scrutinize
the surveys3 consider them representative and reliable. Their main deficiency
is that they classify costs in items that are not always clearly defined (at
least in the available sources), and that the published classification is not

fully appropriate for our purpose. (For the years before 1961 and after 1964
the classification is by agricultural operation —— and thus useless from our

particular point of view.) Our breakdown of costs on tradables and nontradables

Hansen, "Egyptian Cotton: The Margin between Ex-Farm Prices and
Alexandria Spot Prices," unpublished paper, March 4, 1972; E.R.J. Owen (in
Cotton and the Egyptian Economy, 1820-1914, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1969, p.
229) reports information from the time of World War I that points to a margin
between 9 and 16 per cent. But a margin of 25 per cent is also mentioned.
These margins do not include interest on loans extended by middlemen.

is for that reason somewhat dubious. Possible errors at this point are fortu-

nately too small to affect the estimates of either the

ERPs or DRCs seriously.

There is no breakdown of costs on quantities and prices of inputs. The cost
estimates seem to be at "delivered at farm" prices.

ficial estimates.

Labor costs were taken directly from the ministry's estimates and are

therefore at going market wages. The estimates of land rentals were obtained

tax purposes in 1949 and should, in principle, be equal to market rentals
that year. It was then further assumed that free market rentals would be profor

portional to total output value for all crops (Cobb-Douglas, at given input of
labor and

land);

rentals per feddan per crop differ as between crops, but the

difference seems mainly to reflect the length of the growing period for the
various crops.

Normal gross returns to capital were assuied to be E 12 per cultivated
feddan per year in 1961, which would amount to about E 70 million for agri—

culture as a whole. For 1963 the figure was increased by 20 per cent, and
for

1964, by 32 per cent.
We

were led to the figure of E 12 by the following considerations. To

indicate possible orders of maqnitude for interest and depreciation costs, we

assumed the (private) capital-value added ratio in agriculture to be one. No
reliable estimates of the agricultural capital—output ratio exist. Capital
in agriculture consists mainly of the irrigation and drainage system (largely

public) and the animals. The capital sunk into irrigation and drainage is,
however, hardly distinguishable from land, and part of interest on capital is
thus included in the cateqory "rent of land." But the value of the animals

may be of the same order of magnitude as that of agricultural output

alone

value.

Thus, at 10 per cent interest, total interest costs in 1960 should

have amounted to about E 40 million.
Depreciation relating to replacement of animals, not included in output

and value added, can be disregarded. There is some private machinery (pumps,
motors, tractors), and maintenance and depreciation on such capital amounted

to iE 3.9 million in l965. Interest on capital and depreciation

We emphasize, finally, that all our estimates are averages for agriculture
as a whole. It was not possible to break down the calculations by region or
farm size, or to study the production margin, where relationships may differ
completely from the averages.

For sugar cane, special estimates were made,

however, to allow for regional differences.6

tables.

INDUSTRY: EPPs ND DRCs
The data used in calculating the EPPs and DRCs for the ten industries

selected in this study are listed in Tables 13A—13K. The results are shown
in Table 13.
We had no single consistent systematic source of data at our disposal.

A highly disaggregated input-output table could have filled this requirement;7

such a table was not available, however. Instead, we had to use data derived
from industrial surveys conducted either at the industry level

single
1.

or at the

firm level.

The industry surveys were

conducted

by the Central Agency for

General Mobilization and Statistics (CAGMS) through questionnaires and stir—

vey teams in an

attempt

to study production and cost developments. The term

"industxv is loosely defined, but usually encompasses large firms (fifty
workers and over) in a given industrial activity, such as cement or phosphate
fertilizers.

These surveys present detailed breakdowns of all inputs used,

including spare parts, as well as accounts of inventories, indirect taxes,
subsidies, and profits. They do not, however, provide any details on actual
capital

replacement, financial structure, or relationships with the Ministry

of Industry, particularly with respect to exports, imports of inputs,
foreign

and

exchange flows. This is the source we used for cotton spinning and

of virtually all produced inputs (in terms of quantity and value), it is
doubtful whether any standard national input-output table would really suffice for the purpose at hand.

—9—

weaving, sugar, cement, phosphate fertilizers, nitrogenous fertilizers, and

automobiles.
The advantage of the industrywide approach is, of course, that we are

not restricted to the conditions of a single plant but obtain an average

measure of efficiency and competitiveness. Moreover, data compiled at various points

in time for the same

technological

industry bring

in the effects of "embodied"

change accompanying the addition of new plants. The auestion

of how resources have been utilized on the averagn in an industry is inter-

esting in itself. On the other hand, performance in the most efficient units
should also be considered in an appraisal of profitability in import substitution and

much and our DRC computations would underestimate the performance of

most efficient units

to

only a minor extent. But when the sources aggre-

gate a large number of firms (as in the case of cotton soinning and weaving),
the difference between the average and the top may be considerable. Indeed,

the statistics for the cotton textiles industry lump together the large,
modern plants of Mehalla el Kobra and the small firms

with

antiquated equip-

ment. Thus, in interpreting our results for the cotton textiles industry
one should bear in mind that they may significantly underrate the profitability and competitiveness of the modern integrated spinning and weaving units.
Generally, it could be said that the more homogeneous the output and the

fewer the firms included in the survey, the more reliable the data. Thus,

it is difficult to assign international prices to a heterogeneous output. A
nturber of industries (pharmaceuticals, metal products, tobacco) had to be

left out from our study for this reason. From comparisons with other sources

—10—

(e.g., Yearbook, Federation of Industries), we found the CAGMS data source

to be fairly reliable, particularly for industries with a relatively simple
structure of outputs and inputs.

A second type of source was used for the evaluation of the rubber

2.

tires plant

(Transport and Engineering Company), the Helwan Steel plant, and

the paper factory (RAKTA). It consists of unpublished papers
from a

series of courses on industrial development given by

the Institute of

National Planning, Cairo, which frequently required participants to present

analysis

an

of the performance of specific industrial firms.

These papers

represent a valuable source of information and are available in the library

of the Institute. Their main drawback is that cost categories are not stan—
dardized

and

domestic

prices, since the latter usually include transport and

are subject to varying interpretation.
In our tabulations ex—factory unit values were used in lieu of published

margins.8

Whenever possible, we attempted to get equivalent international

prices on a c.i.f. basis at

Egyptian ports. Such prices were obtained either

the Egyptian Trading Organization, which collects quotations in foreicn

currencies directly from foreign exporters for a wide variety of products,
or, in the case of easily identifiable conmiodities, from trade statistics.
In

some cases (such as steel), we used f.o.b. export prices published by the

United Nations, OECD, and other international organizations and added freight

margins obtained from freight conferences to obtain prices on a c.i.f. Alexandria basis. For a number of manufactured traded inputs, international prices
were obtained by reducing the domestic unit value by the appropriate tariff

levied on most goods. In the case of export industries (textiles), we used

profitability significantly. Some industries (e.g., cement) enjoyed
revenues from sales of special services (transportation) which had to be inimproved

cluded since their costs were not distinguishable in the input breakdown.
Where an industry operated at less than full capacity, we computed DRCs at

full capacity utilization (usually defined as 90 per cent utilization) by a

linear extrapolation

of outputs, produced inputs, and, in most cases, labor.

Profitability was assumed to increase only through better utilization of
capital, a conservative assumption that tends to underestimate the overall

benefits

of higher-capacity utilization.

Capital

is usually evaluated at historical costs minus

tion charges. This method did

plant's construction was of recent origin (tires, paper, steel, automobiles)

but may have led to underestimates of

of

"normal" returns to capital in the case

cement, fertilizer, and textile plants, which were constructed or recon-

structed in the late 1940s. In the sugar industry, where much of the equipment was of a pre—Worid War II vintage, capital was estimated at replacement
cost.

—12—

"Normal"

returns to capital (before taxes) were assumed to be 10 per cent.

Our basis for this assumption is the average return of 143 joint stock corn—
panies for 1958 and 1959 -— 10 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.9 Since
depreciation allowances were computed on the historical costs of assets, the

rates of return in 1958 and 1959 may have been somewhat lower. However,
investments were much higher in the first half of the 1960s than in the preceding period

were

and capital was scarcer. On the other hand, many investments

financed from Communist countries at low interest rates, and some foreiqn

funds were directed to specific projects (such as the High Dam and the current

steel expansion). In such cases, it is the actual interest rate that is relevant to evaluating profitability of a given industry, provided the capital
equipment supplied by the lender is priced at c.i.f. quotations from the

cheapest alternative sources. Any

differential is in effect an interest

to be seen as part of the overall bilateral trade agreement

with the country in question)° We do not have sufficient information on the
actual terms of financing for most

of

the industries included in this study.

Hence we propose to experiment with two additional rates of return, 5 per
cent and 15 per cent, which should provide us with a range that surely must

have

included the "natural" rate of return within it.
Returns to labor only pose problems insofar as average wages were raised

above labor's social opportunity cost by the nationalizations, the statutory
minimum wages and

the

employment drive of 1961. Empirically, it is not

feasible to correct for such

discrepancies, particularly because these may

with

skill categories. On the other hand, we have noted instances

of overeinployment (in textiles and

steel,

for example), maintained a long

time after the employment drive, partly because the industries were not at
liberty

to release excess labor. To the extent that labor was redundant

suspect that the textile industry and particularly its modern, large—

scale units may be much more

nother problem in evaluating labor remuneration is the treatment accorded

by statistics to the workers' share of profits and to payments to old age
pension funds. Since 1961 wage data are broken down into four categories:

wages, salaries, social services, and insurance and savings. "Social services" means the usual fringe benefits, such as free transportation to and
from the plant, paid holidays, and free medical care. These certainly rep-

resent a cost to the firm. "Insurance and savings" consists of old age
pension fund contributions and retained employee profit shares. By

and

large these charges do not represent a social resource cost. Hence, we have
viewed them as a tax on profits and have excluded them from resource cost
evaluation.

INDUSTRY:

INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS

Indentifying the factors that have contributed to the competitiveness

of Egyptian industry or the lack of it is a natural sequel to the foregoing
evaluation. According to the theory of comparative advantage one expects

Egypt to excell in labor-intensive industries. In

terms

of the theory of

effective tariffs, this would suggest that Eqypt would have an advantage in

—14—

lines of production with a high share of labor in value added. A large
component of nontraded goods in

value added should also be an advantage since

such

goods tend to be labor—intensive. We shall make an attempt to throw

some

light

producing

on these hypotheses by selecting from our industries activities

homogeneous goods and comparing their costs with those incurred in

other countries (both developing and

developed)

in the

production

of the

same goods. Comparisons have been made for cement, phosphate fertilizers,
nitrogenous

fertilizers, rubber tires, and paper for countries with compara-

ble cost data. Data were obtained from the tJNIDO publication Profile of
Manufacturing

Establishments.

Cement production in Eqypt was found to be highly competitive. Comparisons of EgvDtian costs data with those of India, Israel, and France are shown

in Table I. Since the data refer

standard Port-

cement, reasons of comparability prompted us to use Eqyptian cost

the share of Portland cement to two—thirds of total Eqyptian output. With
the
of

production mix virtually identical for all four countries, costs per unit

output were calculated for variable material inputs, labor, and machinery.

In addition, labor productivity, capital productivity, and

capital-labor

ratio were computed, together with ex—factory prices. In Eqypt,

exchange rate systems were in effect at that time. Exchange

rates were chosen to reflect the fact that domestic cement prices in India
and Israel fell roughly to the level of the international cement price (taken

here as Egytian export price of $11 per ton) so that for that particular com-

modity, the exchange rate would be an equilibrium rate." Thus, absolute

Egyot with average capacity per factory of 600,000 tons. Capacity utilization
exceeds in all cases 90 per cent. Capital values refer to book values of machinery and equipment after depreciation. For Egypt the exchange rate is the official
rate after the devaluation of 1962.

Cement production depends heavily on bulky raw materials like limestone,

which, in effect, is a nontraded commodity. It is also a large consumer of

reveal substitution differences. In this respect the countries can

be ranked according to their relative labor abundance as reflected by the

wage rate. India has the lowest materials cost per unit of cement produced,
followed by Eqypt, France, and Israel. The differences may be attributed to
the costs of extracting the raw material component (limestone, clay, gypsum),
where highly labor-intensive, low-skill techniques can

be used. But they

may also depend to some extent on the location of raw material deposits and

factories.

high capital-labor ratio results in lower capital productivity and a high labor
productivity. Labor costs are nonetheless higher than in Egypt because French

labor costs are considerably higher than in France; the explanation seems

to be underutilization of capacity in Israel.
For our purposes, the comparisons between Egypt and India are the most in-

teresting. Disregarding inadequate valuations of capital that might bias the
results, the striking fact is that with a capital-labor ratio two and a half times

of India, Egypt's capital productivity is roughly the same, and her labor
productivity is three times larger. With the same productivity of capita], but a
that

productivity of labor, production is clearly more efficient in Egypt
India. Two possible explanations come to mind:

1. The technology used in Egypt might be superior to that
capital

used in India

although

(at historical values) per ton of cement produced is the same. However,

the simnie and

standardized

nature of the technology of cement production would

render little weight to this explanation. Moreover, the average age of equipment
seems to be about the same in the two countries; in both some plants were erected
in

the 1920s and additional

weight

units added

after World War II. What may

give some

to the argument is the difference in scale of operations. The average plant

in Egypt has an annual capacity of 600,000 tons, as against 400,000 tons

in India.

However, the resulting difference in cost of production hardly exceeds 10 per cent
and cannot explain away the equality in capital productivity.12

Nitrogenous Fertilizers

with a calcium axnmonium nitrate plant in India; both depend

upon the

same electro-

may, of course, be overvalued to a different degree and the inputs may bear dif'-

ferent rates of protection. Nevertheless, the relative cost structure is informa—
tive.

difference would have been even larger if pyrites had been imported

by Yugoslavia rather than mined domestically.

variable costs of production in the two countries were quite similar.

Note, however, that capacity utilization in India (95 per cent) was higher than
in Egypt (80 per cent). Arid while average wages in India appear to be one third
lower than in Egypt, wage costs per nitrogen unit at equal capacity utilization

would probably have been the same in both countries. The significant

($2.71 per mwh against $3.69 per mwh in India), with physical input of electricity

the facto that contribute to make Egypt's nitrogenous

data on paper mills in other countries reveals a very low level of labor productivity in the Egyptian plant. Experience with other Egyptian industries during this
period

suggests that overstaffing depressed average productivity. The share of

wage costs in output value (at international prices) is low, however, and compares
favorably with the European example in Table V. Thus, if overstaffing did, in fact,

at world prices and is engaged in exports. All plants worked close to full capacity utilization, with the exception of India I, which operated at 75 per cent

occur, it cannot explain the Egyptian plant's inefficiency. Rather, the explanation appears to be —— starting—up costs notwithstanding -- the low skill level of

—25—

workers and possibly also the inexperience of management. Together with capacity
utilization skill of the operatives is, indeed, critical in this industry and may

account for most of the differences in efficiency. Much responsibility rests

productivity should rise substantially. Whether this will happen remains to be
seen.
Conclusions
The following conclusions emerge from the preceding cost comparisons.

1. Egypt has an
traded

advantage in industries using substantial aiunts of non—

goods. This advantage deénds upon low labor costs incurred in the ex-

traction

of the nontraded input (cement), on savings in transportation costs for

a bulky material (phosphates), or savings in nontraded resources such as hydroelectric power or natural gas (nitrate fertilizers).

2. Labor costs in Egyot in all of the industries surveyed compare favorably
with those of higher-income countries. At the same time, labor productivity is
relatively high in Egyptian industries like cement, phosphates, nitrates, and

rubber tires. Here a combination of low labor costs

and a

relatively high level

of skills seems to have given Egypt an advantage. Indeed, the rubber

ence indicates

tire experi-

that even if most material inputs are imported (provided they are

high—value inputs bearing low freight margins), a relatively labor-intensive

—26—

import-substituting industry may be competitive.
3.

The skill constraint is in the steel and paper industries. Insufficiency

of skill appears on the organizational and engineering levels as well as in manual
labor. 18

18Cairo's small private machine tool shops employ a large nulTiber of skilled
operatives, but, by and large, the wages and other incentives offered in the
public enterprises have failed to attract skilled labor.

Source: For Tables A—il through A—13: 1913 through 1957, M. M. El Imant, "A Production
Function for Egyptian Agriculture, 1913-1955." Memo No. 259, Institute of National Planning,
Cairo, December 31, 1962. For 1912 and 1958—61, Annuaire Statistique, several issues,
gicu1tural Economy, Ministry of Agriculture, several issues, and Economic Bulletin, National
Bank of Egypt, several issues. Kantar, dariba, and ardeb are volume measures. The weight
equivalents can be found in icu1tural Economy, op. cit., 1962, p 42. The cotton lint
Kantar used here is the "old" Kantar. 1LE = 100 piasters = 1000 millieme. 1/eddain = 0.42

ha = 1.04

acres.
For 1962—63, Economic Bulletin, op. cit., 1970, and 1964—1969, Deve1oment of the

Sector, 1964-1969, Central Department of Mobilization and Statistics, April
1962, p. cit., 1969. Beans, including humus. For onions, the figures in parentheses from
1964 to 1968 are from Economic Bulletin; the reason for the rather large deviations between
the two sources is not clear. For helba, 1961 figure is from Agricultural Economy, op. cit.,
1962, p. 142, 1962 and 1963, our interpolation.

Sources: For 1960: The Sugar Industry, CAGMS,Cairo, May 1963; for 1970: Federation of

Industries, Yearbook, 1971. Data for packing and fuel, extrapolation from 1960. Data
on agricultural inputs for 1970 extrapolated from Table 6.with the priced indices.
Data on irrigation costs from Federation of Industries, Yearbook, 1969. Agricultural
rents correspond to official, legal maximum average rents for sugar cane land. See
Table 6 and Bahia, op. cit. Depreciation and rates of return were based on the 1960
data on investment and the cost of fixed capacity carried out and completed between
1960 and 1970 (LE 23.3 million). The fixed asset figure for 1960 of LE 8.5 million
at historical cost was judged far too low. Some of the equipment dates back to the
pre—Worid War I period and the investment in the industry during the 1950's was very
small. Assuming the average life of the equipment to be fifteen years and a price
increase of capita], equipment between 1938 and 1960 to be of 103 per cent (IMF
export price index from Western Europe) replacement costs of the fixed assets were
estimated at LE 17.2 million in 1960. Total capital for the two years was estimated
at LE 22.3 and LE 52.6 million. A depreciation rate of 12.5 per cent used in 1960
was also used for 1970; interest charged in 1960 was carried to 1970.
