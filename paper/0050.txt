Since 1941, six Executive Orders have been issued forbidding
Federal government contractors from discriminating against minority

workers.' The latest and strongest Order, 11246, issued in 1965,
enjoins firms to take affirmative action in recruiting and promoting

minority workers. Contractor firms are required to abide by the Order
in all operations including those unrelated to the performance of

the contract. In principle, all prospective contractors are required
to demonstrate compliance with the law before a contract is let. The

potential penalties are severe: failure to comply with the law may
result in revocation of current coiitracts and suspension of the right

to bid on future contracts.

Despite these provisions, doubts have been raised about the

effectiveness of the Orders. In part, these doubts are based on the
small size of the enforcement staff relative to the population of

potential violators.2 The division of responsibility between the
Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCC) and the staffs of the

various Federal departments weakens the enforcement effort. The Order
is imprecise as to the definition of "discrimination" and "affirmative

action." To heighten doubts, before 1971 no firm had its contract
revoked for noncompliance.

Defenders of the Orders cite cases in which contract award
dates have been postponed until firms have taken steps toward compliance

with the law. Competition among contractors has led firms to adopt
affirmative action programs to improve their chances of winning contracts.
In this paper, we investigate these competing claims using data

from 40,445 establishments sampled in 1966 and 1970. For this period,

2

we find that the employment of black males relative to white
males

.

increased 3.3 percent more in firms with government contracts than In

firms without contracts. This comparison controls for the effect of
employment expansion, variation in the size of firms, and geographical

variation in the supply of labor. Using similar controls, we find
little evidence to support the view that the Orders have improved the

relative occupational distribution of black workers. We find strong
evidence that among segregated firms, contractors are more likely to
integrate than noncontractors.

In the first section of this paper, we distinguish what can

be measured from what cannot. We develop a framework to measure and
interpret program effects. In the second section we discuss the
design of our sample and present results of an analysis of the random—

ness of this sample. In the third and concluding section, we present
the estimates and discuss their plausibility.

A Framework of Analysis

a. What Is and Is Not Measured
In this study, we attempt to measure the effect of Executive
Order 11246 on the employment and occupational distribution of black
males relative to white males in Federal contractor firms compared to
identical relative measures for blacks innoncontractor firms. Before discussing

specific indices, it is clarifying to consider a problem that plagues
this, and other studies that seek to measure the effect of a program

on its target population.3 Since we have a (two point) time series,
a natural method for assessing the effectiveness of a program is to
measure the change in a suitable index for target firms relative to

the change in the index for the remaining firms. The basic problem
is the absence of a control group in the presence of a program with

economy—wide impact. Although a program may directly affect one
group of firms, it also indirectly affects the remaining group of

firms as well. Accordingly, comparisons of changes in the relative
status of blacks in target and nontarget firms cannot be measured
relative to what might have been in the absence of the program since

that state is not observed. Thus, we cannot measure the contribution
of the Executive Order to improvements in the aggregate relative

status of blacks. Nonetheless, we can measure whether or not the
contract compliance program has had any differential impact on the
two types of firms.

Consider an index of black male relative (to white male) status

measured at time t, S. This index will be defined more precisely

4

below, but for the purposes of the present discussion, it can be viewed

.

as an acceptable index of relative black male welfare. The proportionate
change in this index through time

St

affords a measure of trend in black economic status. The actual
behavior of St is to be distinguished from the hypothetical behavior
that would have occurred in the absence of the program. Proportionate

movements in the hypothetical index

Index I can be fruitfully decomposed into three components.
Denoting the relative status of blacks in contractor firms at time t by

firms compared to the hypothetical change in the absence of a contract is

Note that I

and I are meaningful only if black status would be the

compliance program.

The first component of equation (6) is the change that would

occur in the absence of the program. We cannot measure this component,

nor can we measure I or I
G
ng

.

We can measure the components of

equation (7). The first component of this equation is the change in

relative black status in noncontractor firms. The second component
measures the difference in the change in black status between
contractor and noncontractor firms weighted by the proportion of
black employment in contractor firms.

6

If contracts were randomly assigned to firms, a simple calculation of mean changes in contractor and noncontractor firms would allow
us to estimate the two components of total change in equation (7).
Since random selection is unlikely, an alternative approach which is
pursued in this paper is to utilize regression techniques to standardize
for nonrandom changes in the indices for the two types of firms.

We postulate the following relationship for firm k:

(8)

ln Stk

BXtk + ydk + Ctk

where dk is a dummy variable with a value of unity for firms holding a
government contract in the second period of the data, Xtk is a vector

of control variables, and

is a disturbance with the classical

properties. Estimates of "y", weighted by G, yield an estimate of the
second component of equation (7).

The available data put substantial restrictions on the way in

which the quantity S may be measured. Since we do not have wage data,
we must use more approximate measures of black relative economic status.
First, consider the index of occupational position for black workers
whose logarithm is defined by

(9)

ln °b =

E(B./B)

ln P..,

where B./B is the fraction of all black workers in the jth occupation
and in P. is the logarithm of the mean salary of all workers in the

jth occupation. °b is nothing more than the (geometric) mean salary

.

7

I

that

would be received by black workers if they were paid the average

wage a white worker within the occupation is paid. °b therefore
reflects only variation in the occupational distribution of black
workers and is nothing more than a method for summarizing the information

available on that distribution. If we define O as the occupational
distribution index for white workers, one possible measure of the

quantity S is the ratio Ob/O. The disadvantage in using this measure
is that it does not reflect the relative number of black workers in an

establishment. An alternative measure of S is (B/W)(Ob/O), which
corrects for this deficiency. (B/W)(Ob/Ow) is the ratio of the total
compensation of black workers to the total compensation of white workers
that would be received if black and white workers were paid the mean

salary that is paid to all workers in each occupation. Defining
S =

(10)

(B/W)(Ob/Ow)

in S =

it follows that in S may be decomposed according to

in(0b/0)

=
=

so that for

(ii)

[(B./B)

+ ln(B/W)

in P. — E(W./W) in P.,] + in (B/W)

— (W./W)J in P. + in B/W,

in S we have

in S =

E[B./B

—

W./W] in P. + (ln B —

in

W).

Thus, we decompose the relative wage share into components of
interest in their own right, and perform a separate regression analysis

8

for

.
each component. We estimate a separate coefficient for the dummy

"presence of government contract" for each occupation, and for the

relative employment equation. Assuming J occupations, and letting y.
be the coefficient of the dummy for occupation j, and letting 1E be
the coefficient of the dummy in the relative employment equation,

J
(12)

j=l

y. ln

÷

measures the estimated average difference In the ratio of the payroll
of blacks to the payroll of whites between firms with a government
contract and those without, holding other factors constant.
If

is positive and statistically significant, government

contracts induce greater relative employment of black males. [f y. is
positive and significant, the presence of a government contract alters
the occupational distribution of black workers relative to white workers
towards greater relative concentration of blacks in occupation j in

contractor firms. The measured occupational shift may arise for
several reasons: internal promotion within existing labor forces,
lateral occupational moves between contractor and noncontractor sectors,
and nonlatera]. moves between sectors.

If internal promotion is the only factor at work the expression

J
=

y.lnP.

j=l

measures the differential shift in contractor firms, as compared to
noncontractor firms, in the difference between the geometric mean of the

9

black male wage distribution and the geometric mean of the white male

wage distribution. Thus

is a measure of differential promotion rates

of blacks relative to whites between contractor and noncontractor firms.

Reshuffling of workers between contractor and noncontractor

sectors obscures this measure. A lateral occupational move of a
black from the noncontractor sector to the contractor sector does not
contribute to the improvement of the black workforce that existed before
the contract was let. Accordingly, on this score we cannot strictly inter-

pret I as a relative measure of advancement of black workers. Nonetheless, since ma competitive labor market sectoral transfers occur only if
wages are raised in contractor firms, a statistically significant
gives indirect evidence of a rise in black wages relative to white
wages in occupation j

for

contractor firms.

Nonlateral reshuffling between contractor and noncontractor

firms has the same unmeasured wage effect. In addition, there is a
promotion (or retardation) effect if the transfer of blacks relative to
the transfer of whites to contractor firms alters pre—transfer
differences between black and white occupational distributions within

contractor firms. If the regression equations are properly specified,

this source of movement in the index I measures the effect of
occupational advancement (or retardation) through transfer.

Of these three sources, only lateral shuffling creates ambiguity

in interpretation. Since we cannot measure the magnitude of the changes
due to each source, we cannot measure the importance of this
component in contributing to the measured total movement of the index.

However, if it is small, the index I weighted by the proportion of

10

post

program black employment in government contractor firms measures

the direct contribution of the contract compliance program to relative
black occupational advancement.

b. Specification of the Regression Relationships
The literature on the employment dynamics of the firm suggests that
fixity in factors causes firms to gradually adjust current levels and

composi-

tion of employment to long—run target levels. We incorporate this idea into
the re2ression eouations and make the further assumption of

separability

between the dynamic system generating firm racial occupational
differentials and the equation generating relative employment.

To simplify the notation, we supress subscripts for individual

firms. Let O be a J x 1. vector where the jth row is the difference
in the proportions of the black and white forces in occupationj for
year t, i.e.,

W.

B.

tj

tj

—

Bt

A firm's adjustment system may be written as

(13)

—

°t—l

=

A(0

—

where A is a J x J matrix of partial adjustment coefficients and

0

is the long—run level of occupational differentials.

This relationship is exact if firm cost functions for movement
to equilibrium, and for persistence in disequilibrium are quadratic and

.

11

I

if the target level, O, does not depend on the costs of adjustment.
Otherwise, the adjustment function may be viewed as an approximation

to the true process of adjustment. Allowing A to be a general matrix,
we explicitly incorporate the notion of interrelated adjustment
processes introduced into the literature by Nadiri and Rosen.4

The jth component of O is given by

(14) O =

+

y.d

where, as before, d is one If a firm

has

a government contract and is

zero otherwise. A common set of K variables, 'tX", is assumed to

determine all occupational differentials. With this specification, we
may rewrite equation (13) as

(15)

Ut —

°t—l

=

A

X —

A i'd — A 0t—l +

where c is a Jxl vector of disturbances, X is a matrix with J identical

columns of the Kxl X vector, and is a JxK matrix whose rows are the
vectors for each of the J relationships, j=1,. .

. ,j.

"i" is a vector

whose jth element is the coefficient of the dummy variable for the jth
long—run relationship. "As" and ltArt are the short—run coefficients.
Since Ut is a column vector of differences in proportions, the

sum of the elements of Ut must be zero (i.e., if I is a Jxl vector of

unit elements, i'U =

U

for all t). This arithmetic relationship

induces an exact linear dependency among the °tl regressors. By
omitting one row of Ut—i' we can avoid exact multicollinearity among

12

the

regressors. Less obviously, we can delete any one of the J

.

equations and estimate both short—run coefficients (A and A) and

long—run coefficients ( and

F').5

The equation for relative employment is specified in the same

fashion. Only one lagged dependent variable is involved, and
complications from proportionate dependent variables are avoided. The
regression specification becomes

(16)

() t — ()

=

+ A

t—l

—

A() t—l + u

The same control variables are used as those in equation (15). "ut" is

a disturbance with the classical properties. "d" is a dummy variable
indicating presence of a government contract.

To control for variations in local labor market conditions,

regional measures of firm location are included in the X vector. In
addition,, firm size variables are introduced to control the effect of

variation in technology and the efficiency of management. Measures
of firm growth and decline are used to separate the expansionary
effect of government contracts, from the compositional effect which is

the focus of this study.

In our data, there are many firms with no black workers. This
forces us to confine our estimation of equations (15) and (16) to firms

with at least one black worker in both sample years, and is an important
limitation of our proposed decomposition.

However, we can utilize the remaining data to investigate the
effect of government contract compliance programs on firm integration.

I

13

p
Since the complete absence of blacks is easily detected, it is likely
that among a group of firms initially segregated in 1966, more government
contractor firms will be integrated in 1970 than noncontractor firms.

By estimating equations which determine the probability of integration
in 1970, we test this hypothesis.

14

II.

_
The Data

.

Since 1966, all firms with one hundred employees or more, and
all firms with a government contract, are required to file a report on
the status of their employment by-race and sex for each of the nine

broad Census occupational categories. These reports are collected by
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and placed on magnetic
tapes (the EEO—l tapes). From these annual samples, it Is possible to
utilize firm identification numbers and geographical codes to match

establishments in successive years. This paper utilizes a matched
sample of 40,445 such establishments which filed reports in 1966 and
1970.

The basic dilemma in matching EEO—l reports for two different
years for a given economic unit is that as we take greater care to
ensure that the two economic units we match are similar in the two

years, we are less likely to complete a successful match. There is
thus a basic trade—off between accuracy of the match and the size of

the sample. On the one hand, we are interested in careful matching
so that the characteristics of firms that are difficult to control in
a single cross—section can be controlled by examining the changes from
one period to another for firms that maintain the same values of the

uncontrolled characteristics. On the other hand, some characteristics
of virtually all firms change between one period and another, and we do
not want to reduce the size of the matched sample because of minor
changes that are probably of little relevance to the analysis.

.

15

I
The most basic characteristics on which it is hypothetically
possible to match EEO—l reports are the employer identification
number (El), assigned by the Social Security Administration, and zip

coded address. As it turned out, the 1966 data did not, in fact,
contain zip codes, although the 1970 data did. It was thus not possible
to use a matching device based on this characteristic.

The procedure we adopted was based on the existence of the
appropriate data, although it can be argued on some grounds that it

was a good procedure on its own. Our first step was to aggregate the
reports for 1966 and 1970 by E.I. number and county. This resulted in
the 117,579 reports filed in 1966 being reduced to 98,655 aggregated
units, and the 126,686 reports filed in 1970 being reduced to 96,244

aggregated units (hereafter, "aggregates"). Of these two sets of
aggregaged units we were able to find 40,445 aggregated units that
were common to both years.

The matched sample of aggregated units was thus about forty

percent of all units in the two years. In some ways, however, this is
an underestimate of the extent of success of the matching process
because the successfully matched units tended to be significantly

larger than the unmatched units in the two years. Thus, in 1966 the
98,655 aggregated units represented 25.6 million employees and in 1970

the 96,244 aggregated units represented 28.5 million employees. The
40,445 matched units represented approximately 18.6 million employees,

however, which is 65 percent of all employees covered. Thus, when the
standard of comparison is the extent of employment in the matched units
the success of the matching system is somewhat more impressive.

16

Still,

it is of substantial importance to know the reasons for

the failure to match more of the aggregated units than the number

indicated. First, if there is some systematic factor at work, knowledge
concerning it might be helpful in designing a method to secure a more

complete match in future work. Second, it is important to understand
the consequences of any systematic factor at work so as to be able to
analyze its effects on the sample's bias.

The ideal method for examining the causes of mismatching would
be to take a random sample of the units that were not matched in each

year and determine the cause for a mismatch in each case. From these
data it would be possible to estimate the fraction of mismatched cases
due to the variety of factors that may cause a mismatch.6

In practice

this ideal procedure was unavailable because of constraints of both

time and resources. Given the importance of the problem, however, it
seemed essential to obtain at least some idea of the causes of non—
response, and so we pursued the problem in the following crude manner.
We first chose a single county to examine in more detail using the
criterion that it be inexpensive to query the unmatched firms in the

county. Mercer County in New Jersey was chosen for this purpose
because of its representative nature regarding industry and minority
groups.

There were approximately 180 aggregate units in Mercer County

subject to analysis in 1966 and 1970. Of these, 103, or 57 percent of
the aggregate units were mismatched, which is significantly higher than

the 40 percent matched nationwide. Tables 1 and 2 list the largest of
the unmatched units in 1960 and 1970 respectively, along with their
total employment.

p
We

contacted some of the larger firms on each list to see if

we could determine why they had not been matched. As it turned out,
the causes could be grouped under three categories: (a) natural
causes, (b) errors, and (c) identification problems.

The three major natural factors causing an inability to match
were:. closing or opening of a new establishment, a decline or increase
in size between the two years so that the obligation to file an EEO—1

form changed, and mergers. For example, Princeton Inn with 166
employees in 1966 closed its doors between 1966 and 1970, so that it
did not appear in the data for 1970; Yellow Cab Co. with 125 employees
in 1966 declined in size to fewer than 100 employees in 1970 so that

it no longer had an obligation to file in 1970. Likewise, Gino's of
New Jersey with 119 employees in 1970 had grown to over 100 employees
between 1966 and 1970 so that it had an obligation to file in 1970 but

not in 1966. Finally, First Trenton Bank with 422 employees in 1966
merged with another bank between 1966 and 1970 so that it no longer

existed as a separate entity. Clearly, each of these cases represents
a situation where the normal growth, decline, and consolidation of firms

results in some firms appearing in one year but not in another. Aside
from changes in reporting requirements, not much could have been done
to match records for firms affected by these factors.
Errors in reporting also accounted for some of the failure to

match firms. In some cases errors were due to the firms themselves,
in other cases the errors were a result of changes in reporting systems
from one year to another, and in still other cases it is not possible

I

to

determine the source of the error. For example, Mercer Hospital

20

has apparently reported every year except 1970 when its EEO—l form
was

.

never filed due to a new computerized data processing system that was
installed that year and did not function correctly. The most disturbing
unmatched item in Tables 1 and 2 is surely New Jersey Bell Telephone

Co. —Trenton, with 4,617 employees in 1966. This unmatched item is
apparently due to a limitation in the matching program that resulted
from the fact that the Bell System reported on a statewide basis in

1966, but on a county basis in 1970. It was thus not possible to match

the same units in the two years. Only those reporting units using a
consistent system from year to year would be susceptible of a match

using the scheme outlined above. Finally, Dow Jones Co. and New Jersey
Department of Health, Trenton, apparently reported in both years with
the same name and El number, although their 1970 reports did not appear

on our data tapes. We can only conclude that these reports were either
lost or miscoded at some point.

A final cause of mismatching was the problem of identifying

firms with a unique El number. The Social Security Administration,
which is responsible for administering the El numbering system, has

assigned 10,000 to 12,000 more El numbers than there are firms. Thus,
a single firm may have more than one El number and may report using

different El numbers in different years. It is for precisely this
reason that American Biltrite Rubber and National Sponge Cushion appear
in both Tables 1 and 2, even though we report them as being unmatched.

Each of these companies has more than one El number and each reported

under different El numbers in the two years 1966 and 1970. Since the
El number is one of the criteria for matching, this made it impossible
to match these particular firms.

S

21

I

Such a limited sampling is not adequate, of course, for making
detailed estimates of the proportion of our unmatched firms that are
accounted for by natural causes as against the proportion that are

accounted for by errors and identification problems. From our limited
experience, however, we would guess that perhaps 30 to 60 percent of
the unmatched aggregate units are due to errors or improper identification, while the remainder are due to the natural changes in establishments over any four—year period.

In order to explore more systematically the results of the
matching process we computed the multiple regression listed in Table 3.
The purpose of this regression is to provide a systematic summary of
the differences in the industrial, regional and other characteristics

of aggregates as between those that were and were not matched. We
pooled all of the 96,244 aggregates for 1966 and 1970 and created a
dummy dependent variable that took on the value unity if the aggregate

fell in the matched sample of firms and zero if it did not. The
independent variables are sets of industrial, regional, and other

dummy variables. The industrial variables are the set of nine listed
in Table 3 plus a deleted variable for agriculture, fisheries, and

forestry. The regression coefficients are thus interpreted as the
difference between the industry listed in the table and the deleted
industry in the probability that an aggregate from that industry was

matched, holding the other characteristics in the table constant. For
example, Table 3 indicates that holding other things constant, an
aggregate in durable manufacturing was .403 more likely to be matched

than an aggregate in agriculture. Likewise, an aggregate in durable

manufacturing was .062 (= .403 — .341) more likely of being matched
than an aggregate in nondurable manufacturing.7

There are also ten

regional variables, with the fifth deleted. The precise lists of states
in each region are presented in the key following Table 3 and is based
on the first digit of the zip codes for the aggregates. As before, a
regression coefficient is interpreted as the estimated difference
between the region examined and the deleted region in the probability
that an aggregate was matched, holding other things constant. The

remaining variables are dummy variables for whether the firm was inside
an SMSA, for whether it had a government contract, and for its size
class.

As can be seen from Table 3, the most important determinant of

whether an aggregate was matched seems to be its size. Firms with
fewer than 100 employees were .21 less likely to be matched than firms

with 100 to 500 employees. Likewise, firms with over 500 employees
were .17 more likely to be matched than firms with 100 to 500 employees.
This result is probably not very surprising given that employer size is
an important determinant of whether a firm must report in any year.
It suggests that the natural growth and decline of the smaller firms
may be an important determinant of the extent of success of the matching

process, a result previously discussed. Firms inside SMSA's are also
more likely to be matched than firms outside SMSA's, but the size of

this effect is not very large. Perhaps more important, firms with
government contracts are .065 more likely of being matched than firms

without them. It would be interesting to know the extent to which this
difference reflects the fact that government contractors have more

.

25

p

stringent

reporting requirements and the extent to which it reflects

greater care by government contractors in meeting given reporting

requirements. The regional differences do not tend to be very large,
and their direction may be surprising to some readers. For one thing,
there is no obvious tendency for the matching to be less successful in

Southern than in Northern states. Although in simple tabulations there
is substantially less matching in the South than the North, this

apparently results from the failure to hold constant industry, size of

firm, etc. Second, the midwestern states tend to be those where the
matching was poorest, although the differences involved are not dramatic.

Finally, as we have already noted there are some fairly large differences

in the extent of match by industry. Both agriculture and public
administration were industry groups where the matching was especially
poor, but the finance, insurance, and real estate industry group was

also notably less successful than other industry groups. The most
successful matching was in durable and nondurable manufacturing.

Given the few sizable differentials we have noted, however, the remainder
of the industry groups do not differ very much in the success of the
match.

It is clear from these results that the aggregates in our
matched sample are not a random sample of the aggregates we created

from the 1966 and 1970 data. If they were, there would be no significant
differences between the matched and unmatched samples of firms associated

with region, industry, etc. That is, region, industry, and the other
variables in Table 3 would not have a significant effect on the probability

of a match. In fact, these variables have a statistically significant

26

effect.

At the same time, it would be

.
easy to exaggerate both the size

of the effect that these variables have on the probability of
and their importance in

matching

demonstrating bias. As we have seen, most

of the effects of the variables in Table 3 on the probability of
a
match can be explained by the variable effect of the reporting
requirements on whether a firm filed a report in both 1966 and 1970.
Thus, the natural consequence of firms

growing and declining about the

100 employee reporting requirement is to induce substantial
in the extent to which some

variability

employers file reports in both years, and

thus in the probability of a match. On the other hand, the differences
in probability of matching by region and industry that we found, and

which would be much more difficult

to explain by reference to the

reporting requirements, are relatively small. In the absence of any
further evidence, therefore, it seems very likely that the most
important systematic determinant of the non—random character of the

matching is the basic reporting requirements. If this is the case,
inferences drawn from our matched sample may not be too different from

inferences that would have been drawn from the whole population of
EEO—l reports.

III. Empirical Results

a. Estimates of the Components of the Relative Wage Bill
In this section, we report results from estimating equations

(15) and (16). Before presenting the estimates, it is useful to extend
the discussion in Section II to consider potential sources of bias
that may affect our estimates.

One source is due to improper measurement of the government

contract variables. Since the time the first draft of this paper was
written, further study has shown that many firms listed as noncontractors

in fact were contractors.8 Establishments associated with finns
doing government contract work in other establishments frequently did

not report themselves as contractors. Yet, as noted in the introduction,
all plants of a government contractor firm are liable to the provisions

of Executive Order 11246. Since geographically disparate units of the
same firm are treated as separate data points in our analysis, this
source of bias is severe if central managements impose uniform policies
in all plants.

However, it is unlikely that uniform policies are applied to

all establishments. Indeed, it is this presumption which led us to
treat separate geographical units as distinct data points. Nonetheless,
if government contractors advance blacks at a greater rate than
noncontractors, estimates of the government contract effort are biased
downwards, and degrees of freedom are overstated to the extent that

uniform policies apply to some firms. Given the size of the sample
and the number of separate f inns, the potential problem with degrees
of freedom is unlikely to be important.

28

Similarly,

potential contractors and recent contractors not

listed as contractors in 1970 are expected to be like measured govern-

ment contractors in all but name. Our inability to identify such firms
leads to a downward bias if these firms have taken affirmative action.
There are a host of other biases about which we have much less

to say. Since reports are filed by the firm, contractor firms are
more likely to exaggerate their compliance effort in order to avoid

embarrassing investigations. If this is the case, an upward bias is
imparted to our estimates of contract effects. However, it is by no
means obvious that this effect applies only to contractor firms. Since
noncontractor firms with employment less than one hundred are not
required to report, it Is likely that the sample of noncontractors
includes a biased selection of firms which have taken steps toward
affirmative action, or at least are willing to say they have.
Another potential source of bias comes from restricting our

sample to establishments with at least one black worker. This restriction is dictated by our choice of the decomposition of the relative

wage bill. If contractor firms Initially without black workers contribute to decisive gains in the aggregate relative occupational distribution through faster promotion rates, our estimate of the effect of
the compliance progress understates the true effect of the program on
the mean difference in occupational distributions of blacks and whites

between contractor and noncontractor firms. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to determine the importance of this effect. Moreover, it is
equally possible to imagine that the unmeasured firms are more sluggish
in their affirmative action programs than are measured firms.

.

29

Our estimates of equations (15) and (16) are reported in

Table 4. The first column reports the relative employment equation.
The second column is the (log earnings) weighted sum of the detailed

occupational results recorded in columns 3—il. Long—run values,
estimated from the scheme of Appendix A, are presented below the

standard errors for the estimated coefficients. A convenient summary
of these results is reported in Table 5.
In this table we record both long—run and short—run coefficients
for the dummy variables indicating presence of a government contract.

Line 1 contains the estimated difference between the percentage change
in the employment of black male workers and the percentage change in the
employment of white male workers as between firms with and without a

government contract, holding other factors constant. According to
this estimate, black male employment increased by 3.3 percent more
relative to white male employment in firms with government contracts
than in firms without them, and this difference is statistically

significant. The long—run estimate is 12.9 percent. Lines 2 through 10
contain the percentage point differences between firms with and without
government contracts in the change in the percentage of black workers
minus the percentage of white workers in each of the nine occupational

categories available in the EEO—l reporting system data. By definition
these nine percentage point changes must sum to zero, since an increase
in the percentage of black (or white) workers in one occupation implies
a decrease in the percentage of black (or white) workers in some other

occupation. In effect, the estimated coefficients In lines 2—10 of
column 2 of Table 5 tell us how the incremental employment of black

workers over white workers in firms with government contracts reflected
in line 1 was distributed by occupation. As can be seen from the table,
the largest positive difference between those firms with and without

government contracts fell in the operative category. To offset this
positive difference, the change in the relative percentage of black
workers in the service worker category was smaller among government

contractors. The other positive coefficients in the table are for
technicians, clerical workers, salesmen, and laborers, although the
former are marginally insignificant statistically and the latter are

essentially zero. The other negative coefficients in the table are
for the managerial, professional, and craft occupations, although only

the former two are statistically significant. Except for a reversal
of sign in the case of craftsmen, the long—run effects preserve the
same pattern as the short—run effects, but are algebraically larger.

In sum, the basic results of Table 5 indicate that the presence
of a government contract in a firm was associated with a statistically
significant and larger increase in the employment of black workers
relative to white workers than was the case in the firms without

government contracts. The increase in the relative employment of black
workers increased their representation compared to white workers
primarily in the operative occupation, and decreased their relative
representation primarily in the service and professional occupations.
Table 6 summarizes the estimated overall quantitative impact of the

pressure of governmental efforts to increase the portion of black male

workers relative to white male workers. According to these results,
in the short run the governmental effort increased the employment of

black

workers relative to white workers by 1.7 percent while in the

long run the increase is 6.4 percent. In contractor firms, the occupational position of black workers relative to white workers increased
by .1 percent while it is expected to decrease by .2 percent in the

long run. Thus, the governmental effort increased the wage share by
1.8 percent over the 1966 to 1970 period, while this increase is
expected to rise to 6.4 percent in the long run.

It is possible to briefly summarize the effects of the other
variables we examined on the employment and occupational position of

black male workers relative to white male workers. The sets of
variables we examined were a set of regional dummy variables, a variable
equal to unity if the firm was located inside a Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Area, a set of variables representing the size in total
employment (in 1970) of the firm, a set of variables representing the
change in total male employment in each of the nine occupational
categories, and the 1966 (lagged) relative position of black workers

in the firm. We first describe the estimated effects of these variables
on the employment of black male workers relative to white male workers
and then the estimated effects of these variables on the relative

occupational position of black workers. As we have observed previously,
the sum of these two effects is the estimated effect of the variable
on the relative share of black wages.
Region appears to be the most important factor associated with

relative employment increases for black workers. In particular, the
relative employment of black workers increased by 20 percent more in
the North Central region of the U.S. than in the South, and by about

38

18 and 26 percent more than in the Northeast
or West. Second, there is

no indication that black relative employment changes were significantly

related to size of firm. Third, the rate of growth of employment of
the firm was negatively related to changes in the relative employment
of black workers, although the size of this effect was very small.
Finally, the growth over 1966 to 1970 in the relative employment of
black workers was smaller in firms where the 1966 ratio of black to
white employment was highest.

Just as region of location was an important determinant of the
change in the relative employment of black workers, it was also an
important determinant of the change in the relative occupational

position of black workers. In particular, the relative occupational
position of black workers increased by 1.4 percent less in the North
Central region than in the South, and by 2.2 and 1.9 percent less than

in the Northeast or West. This suggests that the relative employment
increases of black workers in the North Central region were a result

of the migration of black workers from the South. If these migrants
were from the lower paying occupational categories in the South, then
their migration would by definition increase the relative occupational
distribution of black workers in the South and decrease their average
relative position in the North Central region so long as the in—migrants
were in lower paying occupations than the workers already in the North

Central region. Second, the relative occupational position of black
workers increased significantly less in firms inside of SMSA's than

in firms outside SMSA's. Third, there was little relationship between
firm size and changes in the relative occupational position of black

.

39

I
workers.

Fourth, the change in the relative occupational position of

black workers was greater the greater the growth of employment in the
middle level occupations, i.e., sales, clerical, craft, and operative

workers. On the other hand, the growth in the relative occupational
position of black workers was smaller the greater was the growth In
employment of workers in the highest or lowest paying occupations,

I.e., professionals, managers, or laborers. Finally, the increase in
the relative occupational position of black workers was smaller the
greater the relative occupational position of black workers in the
firm in 1966.

b. Integration Effects
The analysis to this point has been performed for only those
firms that contained at least one black and one white employee in
both 1966 and 1970.

Since black workers make up only one—eighth

of the population, many firms would not be expected to be "integrated"
in this sense.

In fact, of the 40,445 firms in the sample,

only 24,535 contained at least one black and one white male worker.
It is of some interest, therefore, to know what effect the overall
government effort to increase the relative position of black workers
has had on these firms.

In order to examine this question we

have estimated linear probability functions using data for those
firms that had no black male worker in 1966 and in which the dependent
variable equals unity if the firm contained at least one male black

worker in 1970, and Is zero otherwise. Table 7 reports the results of

occupational integration. Since the linear probability model is known

S

to suffer from important statistical limitations, we computed estimates
of these equations using the logit model on a subsample of firms.

These

results, reported in Appendix C, demonstrate that If the true integration
probability process Is governed by a logistic disturbance, the linear
probability model provides a reliable guide to the true effects of a
government program.

Table 8 lists the estimated effect of the presence of a government
contract on the probability that a firm that was not integrated in 1966

was integrated in 1970. Integration may be defined for the firm as a
whole, and this result is reported in line 1 of the table, or for
each of the separate occupations, and these results are reported in

lines 2—10. As can be seen from the table, the probability was .09
larger that a firm that was not integrated in 1966 would be integrated

in 1970 if the firm had a government contract. The results for the
separate occupations are similar, and in all cases statistically

significant. These results imply that the presence of the overall
government effort significantly increased the extent of Integration In

American industry. Even if the increase in the employment of black
workers is relatively small In each firm so affected, there is a
substantial number of firms Involved so that this effect may not appear
so small when taken in the aggregate.

Summary

We have used detailed records from the Equal Employment Opportunity tapes for a matched sample of firms in 1966 and 1970 to estimate
the extent to which the change in the position of black male workers
relative to white male workers was greater among firms with contracts
with the Federal government than among firms without such contracts.
Since all of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance efforts to
improve the relative position of black workers operate on firms with
Federal contracts, and since the EEOC's efforts are presumably more
successful with such firms, we concentrate on this issue because it
presumably gives us some indication of the overall impact of government
efforts on changes in the relative position of black workers.

First, we find that the relative employment of black male workers
increased by 3.3 percent more over the period 1966 to 1970 in firms with
government contracts than in firms without government contracts, and

that this difference is statistically significant. The long—run effect
is estimated to be 12.9 percent. Second, we find that in the short run
the relative occupational position of black male workers increased by
.2 percent more in firms with government contracts than in firms without
contracts, but that this difference is not statistically significant.
In the long run, a .4 percent decrease is expected.

The most important factor affecting the change in the relative
position of black male workers in these data appears to be the migration

of black workers to the North Central region of the U.S. The employment
of black workers relative to white workers increased by approximately

.

45

I

20 percent more in the North Central region than in any other region of

the country. This migration also resulted in a smaller rate of increase
in the relative occupational position of black male workers in the North
Central region than in any other region, and undoubtedly resulted
because the migration of workers was from the lowest paying occupational

categories. This presumably increased the growth in the relative
occupational position of black male workers outside the North Central
region and decreased this growth inside that region.

Finally, we have investigated the factors that affected the
probability that a firm with no black male worker in 1966 would have

hired at least one such worker by 1970. We find that the probability
that a firm that was not "integrated" in this sense in 1966 was
integrated in 1970 was nearly .1 percent higher in 1970 among firms
with government contracts than in firms without them.

In general, the matrix in brackets is nonsingular, and estimable.
Accordingly, we can estimate

estimate $ and r. Note, however, that A is not estimable without
further information. Note further that while the variance—covariance
matrix of the original system is singular, in the reduced system this

complication is avoided. Thus we have shown that knowledge of any J—l
short—run equations is sufficient to determine both short—run and
long—run coefficients for the control variables and the government

contract variable. Stability of the reduced system of equations
implies stability of the original system. Since the characteristic
roots of the adjustment matrix presented in Table 4 are all less than
one in modulus, the complete system is stable.

.

49

I
APPENDIX B

The previous appendix shows that estimates of A, the adjustment

matrix, are not needed to estimate long—run coeeficients. Nonetheless,
if estimates are available, they provide an additional check on:the

model. Implausibly low rates of adjustment, or implausible orderings
or rates of adjustment will cast doubt on our estimates. Specificity
of training, and length of the training period should cause slower
rates of adjustment in the more skilled occupations.
Without further information, it is impossible to estimate A.

One restriction, overly strong, that will provide identification is the

I

assumption of symmetry for A. A weaker restriction, consistent with
symmetry, is the assumption that

(A—5)

Ai =

0,

where i is a Jxl vector of ones, with J being the number of occupations.
Since we know that the dependent variable in the J equations must be
zero,

(A—6)

i'A =

0.

It Is easy to verify that If A Is symmetric, and the last equation
applies, then the previous equation applies as well. It is also easy
to verify that restriction (A—5) allows estimation of A from [A—Ci'].

50

The empirical results are presented in Table A—i.

.
Reading

down the rows for a given column gives the coefficient on the lagged
difference in proportion for the dependent variable designated in the row.

Casual inspection of the table shows that the matrix is remarkably
"close" to symmetry despite the fact that symmetry is not an implication

of assumption (A—5). Letting A.. be the element of A in the ith row
and jth column, one index of the departure of the matrix from full
symmetry is

(Xi. —

i#j
where N is the number of distinct off diagonal elements in the A matrix

if A is symmetric. The value of the index is .0342 which indicates a
small average deviation from symmetry.

Reading down the diagonal, the own adjustment coefficient tends
to increase as the skill level decreases,

suggesting that adjustments

to final equilibrium are slower for more highly skilled occupations.

This result is consistent with prior notions on the adjustment rates

of fixed factors. Nonetheless, the implied rates of adjustment seem
slow, especially when a four year time period separates the dependent

variable and its lagged value. First order serial correlation in the
disturbances of equations (15) will tend to depress the estimated rates

of adjustment. Moreover, serial correlation will tend to impart
symmetry in the estimated A matrix. Since we have only two points in
time, we cannot test for serial correlation in a distributed lag model.

Nonetheless, we conjecture that a lag model is appropriate, although

serial correlation may be present as well. It would be an unlikely
coincidence to find that the ordering of own adjustment coefficients
is so closely in accord with theory if serial correlation were the
only factor leading to significant coefficients on the lagged variables.

APPENDIX C

In

the text, we present empirical results on the effect of

contractor status on the racial integration of firms. The analysis is
performed using the linear probability model which is known to suffer
from important defects.9

Accordingly, it is of interest to compare results from this
conceptually defective but computationally effective method with results

from a more attractive statistical model. The logistic model is known
to possess a likelihood function which possesses sufficient statistics,

Thus, it is possible to compute efficient and consistent estimates of the
probability of integration.
Since the logistic technique is computationally more expensive,

we randomly selected a 10 percent sample of the firms used to compute

the results from the linear probability model. Those results are
reported in Table A—2. The rows in this table correspond to the columns
of Table 7 in the text.

For our purposes, the most appropriate comparison is between
the coefficient on the variable "government contract" in the linear
probability model, presented on line 4 within each group, and the

implied probability from the logistic model, presented on line 3. Both
results are computed from the identical subsample of 1420 firms. The
estimates from the two models are quite close, indicating that the
results reported in the text may be taken as good approximations to a
more theoretically desirable econometric model.

normal statistic, the third line records the partial derivative of the probability of
integration with respect to the associated variable. This is to be compared with the
coefficient of the linear probability model recorded in the fourth line. The fifth line
shows the t statistic for the linear probability model.

FOOTNOTES

1. The material in the introduction draws heavily from
Chapter 4 of R. P. Nathan's excellent Jobs and Civil Rights, prepared

for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Clearinghouse Publication
No. 16, April, 1969.
2.

It has been estimated that in March 1967 there were 228

fuiltime professional contract compliance personnel in all government
agencies except the OFCC to investigate 225,000 contractor facilities.
CR. Nathan, op. cit., p. 113.)

3. Readers familiar with the work of H. G. Lewis reported in
Unionism and Relative Wages, Chicago, 1963, will recognize the similarity
in Lewis' methodology and our own.

4. See M. Nadiri and S. Rosen, Interrelated Factor Demand,
National Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1974.

5. Adiscussionof this point is giveninAppendix A. Witha fairly
mild assumption, It is possible to estimate A as well. This provides a
further check on the model. These results are reported in Appendix B.

6. This would also be a desirable project to undertake for
the entire universe of firms, since it has been estimated that perhaps

only three—fourths of the firms obligated to submit an EEO—l form
actually do so. A periodic audit of a random sample of firms whose
EEO—l forms have not been tabulated would produce estimates of the
causes for non—response in the overall universe of obligated firms and
might have the additional benefit of producing a higher response rate
in the longer run.

We are thus treating the results in Table 3 as a linear

.

probability function. There are well known statistical problems that
arise from using this procedure. As is also well known, the same
computational results may be interpreted as a linear discriminant

function. Under this interpretation a simple transformation of the
coefficients in Table 3 would make them the weights in a function
that would allow us to predict which of two populations an item had

come from, the matched or unmatched groups. In some ways the linear
discriminant function would be a better way to interpret the computations
in Table 3 for the problem we are examining here.

8. This information appears in a letter dated December 5, 1973,
from George Travers, Associate Director for Plans, Policies and
Programs, Employment Standards Administration, Office of Federal
Contract Compliance, U.S. Department of Labor, to Orley Ashenfelter.
Travers estimates that in 1971, 28 percent of government contractors

were listed as noncontractors. Since similar data procedures were
employed in 1966 and 1970, as in 1971, it is likely that this estimate
applies to our data as well.

1964.
