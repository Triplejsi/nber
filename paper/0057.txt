Abstract
The agrarian unrest in the United States at the end of the nineteenth

century is examined. This unrest is often viewed as stemming from the
inability of farmers to adapt to changing conditions in world agriculture.
This hypothesis is tested in the context of a distributed lag supply

function. Varying parameter estimation methods are used to trace the

history

of the parameters in the supply function and to

decompose

observed prices into permanent and transitory components over time.
The patterns of variation are tested for conformity with a model of

rational price-expectation formation. The conclusion is that farmers
behaved as economic theory would predict, but that neither theory nor
practice gave them relief from the troubles which plagued them,

I. Introduction

Few questions of American economic history are as int'iguing as those
surroundIig the transformation of American agriculture between the Civil War

and World War I. The reversal of the relative weights of agriculture and
industry is well known, with agriculture employing 52.5% of th labor force
and producing 57% of commodity—production value added in 1870 but employing

o.y 3l.% of the labor force and producing 38% of the commodity—production
value
The

added in 1910 [Lebergott 1966,

value added figures are for 1869

p. 119; Galiman and Howle 1971, p. 26.
and 1909.]. But

in addition, this period

seems to have marked a once—and—for—all shift in the consciousness of the
farn4ng population. The years prior to World War I marked the emergence of
the "farm bloc" attitudes which have persisted to the present day. The
Granges, W1eels, Alliances, and cooperatives were proving grounds for the

tactics of special interest politics. Unlike the antebellum prosiavery
minority, the farming minority managed to avoid being swamped in the political

triumph of its rivals. The reason for the farmers' survival as a political
force may originate, paradoxically, in the decisive defeat they suffered in the
Bryan debacle of 1896 and their simultaneous loss of organizational autonomy.

The Repulican victory coupled with the dismantling of the Populist political
machinery guaranteed that the farming interests could never again seriously contend

for national hegemony. Secure in its victory, the business establishment could
afford to grant the farmers special privileges almost as a consolation.

2

Whatever

conclusions might be drawn about the politics of the era of

protest and unrest that began in the 1870's, the sources of that unrest

remain obscure. Because of the deep current of special pleading that flows

through

all the farmers' manifestoes, the modern historian is unwilling

to

accept them at face value. And because of the Populist intellectuals'
ignorance of economics (any doubts concerning this can be laid to rest by

brief attendance at Coin's Financial School [Harvey 1895]), the articulated
grievances of the farmers are similarly suspect. When the viewpoints and
prejudices of the contemporary observers are put aside, most of the alleged
economic foundations of the farmers' uihappiness fail to pass modern tests of

necessary or sufficient cause. Railroad rates, exploitation in the Southern
labor market, high interest rates, and adverse movements in the agricultural

are

terms of trade

of

timing

all inadequate as explanations of either the pattern or

the upheavals [Higgs 1970, DeCanio l974a, Bowman 1965, North 1974].

Even so, it would be foolishly premature to assert that the farmers were not

somehow oppressed in their economic role. To claim otherwise risks being
forced to argue that the entire era of protest and organization, wh1cl left

a permanent imprint on the political style of the agricultural minority, was
nothing

of

but the

product of the fevered imaginations of misfit reformers, or

the systematic
Economic

misperceptions of the farmers themselves.

historians have recently inclined towards the view that

while the farmers were not victimized by trusts and markets in the ways they
thought they were (monopoly exploitation, falling terms of trade, speculation
in futures, etc.), they were nevertheless suffering the burden of adjustments

to

changes in the economic environment. For example, Mayhew has hypothesized

that the unrest of the Grangers and Afliancemen was not so much a response

3

to a worsening of their overa.LL economic position as instead a reaction

to the commercialization of agriculture. This commercialiZat.on probably
increased farm incomes, but it also made the farmers subject to impersoiaJ.

and myterious market forces. Farmers' discçmfort with the demands of

the

market environment was thus the true source of their discontent (Mayhew 1972].

A somewhat different but related view was expressed by Nort!1:

What was fundamentaLLy at stake in the farmer's discontent was,
first of all, that he found himself competing in a world market
in which the fluctuations in prices made no apparent sense to him.
The bottom might drop out of his income because of a bumper crop
at the other side of the world, in Argentina or Australia. When
he suffered a period of drought and, poor crops, the higher prices
he had learned to expect in such a case might still not be forthcoming (if other areas had a good crop year).... [North .I9t].
Implicit in the motivations for Populism proposed by both North and Mayhew
is the idea that farmers' perceptions of the econpmic reality were awry;
that in some fundainentaj. sense the operation of the markets for agricultural

products presented farmers in the ,Late nineteenth century with a puzzle

beyond their ability to solve.
Against this approach may be counterposed the results of recent studies
on the responses of cotton and wheat farmers to changes in the relative

prices of alternative crops in the late n1neteentI century. Although these
supply studies are based on a relatively simple specificatipn of the farmers'

response functions, they do indicate a reasonable degree of flexibility in
the behaviorof' agriculturalists in those regions of the United States where

the great cash crops were grown. price movements elicited output changes in
the proper direction, and the speed of farmers' responses was rapid enough
to guarantee substantial adjustment to perrnanenl price changes In a fairly
short length of time

[Fisher and Temin 1970, DeCanto 1973].

the

revealing those causes. The

of wheat farming and the bitter experience of the sharp

cycles of the 1870's and 1890's may have altered the manner in which farmers
formulated

their expectations. In

the South, a general flexibility

in

switching between cotton and alternative crops may have gradually succumbed

to the demands for cotton by monopolistic furnishing merchants. In either
region, specialization may have required increasing investment in crop—

specific capital, thus reducing opportunities for choice of crop. Changes
in

the relative proportions

of

farmers exhibiting different types of behavior

could change the weights appropriate for aggregation. In any of these cases,
the 1866—1914 average estimates of the price elasticities and speeds of
adjustment could easily reveal normal

responses

by

the farmers for the

period as a whole, while remaining mute on the magnitude and direction of
the all—important changes in

these parameters-

.

S

Recent developments in the theory of models with varying parameters allow
these issues to be attacked directly [Cooley 1971; Cooley and Prescott 1973a, 1973t',
1973c, 19714; Rosenberg

of

1973].

These new techniques not only enable identification

changes in the parameters over time, but

also permit fresh speculation

concern-

ing the origins of the changes. This paper explores the outcome of applying one
such technique to the data analyzed in the previous wheat and cotton supply

studies.

The results

reveal a surprising combination of influences operating

on Merican agriculture at the turn of the century. The farmers seem to

have behaved according to standards of optimal decision-making, but despite

their best efforts their freedom of action was curtailed by the development
of world commodity markets. The farmers' difficuLty was
they

not so much that

failed to understand their condition, but that they were unable to

do anything to alleviate it. In such a situation, the pursuit qf chimeras
may have offered the only hope. Populism and its related organized uprisings
may be seen in this light not as unsuccessflui. attempts to right economic

wrongs, but as doomed efforts by the farmers to deny what could not be

changed. In the dollars and cents matters involving farm management and
crop choice, the farmers behaved as economic theory would have led them to
behave, but neither theory nor practice offered any realistic relief from

the problems which plagued them. They were more successful in adapting to
an inherently unpleasant situation than in proposing or implementing reforms

to change that situation in any fundamental way?

II. The Model.

The model employed by Fisher and Temin [1970] and DeCanio

in

their studies of wheat and cotton is a version of

the

where St denotes the share of acres planted in wheat or cotton in year t,

Pt denotes the relativeprice of cotton or wheat compared to an an index of
the prices of the alternative crops in year t, and the 8's are coefficients
to be estimated.3 The theoretical motivation for this model has implications

about the interpretation of the coefficients 8.. The suppliers are

assumed to base their desired share of acreage (St*) onthe expected

Thus,

even within the context of

received

doctrine

there are strong reasons to believe that the supply functions we are concerned
with are subject to change, over time.
One objective of the present study is to determine empirica.U.y the

extent to which such structural change actually did take place over the
period l866_l9l1. In addition, however, we wish to probe beneath the surface of the
distributed lag supply response model to determine whether or not any changes
which did take place conformed .to

the types of

parameter variation which might be

predicted by economic theory. Theoretical attempts have been made to relate the
parameters

of

distributed lag specifications to optimal decision processes at the

level, both

respect to the formulation of price expectations and the
rapidity with which actual levels of the dependent variable are brought into
micro

with

8

conformity with "desired" levels [Griliches 1967]. While

it would be best

to test both types of structural change hypotheses, the data required to investi—

gtefu1iy the

origins of changes in the speed of adjustment of actual to

desired acreage shares are not available.6 On the other hand, the data
required to compare farmers' behavior against standards of optimality in

price

historical price information is already contained in the price series used
to

estimate the lagged adjustment supply functions.

observed prices and modify their decision rule accordingly. In section IV
we test this hypothesis about farmers' behavior in some detail and find that
the pattern of variation in the coefficients of (5) is quite consistent with
this view of rational behavior.

Equation (5) is identical to the form of the supply functions estimated
by Fisher and Ternin [1970] and

DeCanio [1973], except that (5) does not include

a time trend as an additional variable. The main justification for inclusion
of the trend in the original studies was that it picked up effects of omitted

variables. We feel that a significant time tread may actually be indicative
of the type of structural change which the varying.-parameter estimation

technique is explicitly designed to capture.8 Also, since there are good
reasons for expecting the parameters to vary over time it may be that the
empirical form (as distinct from the structural parameters) of the model

changes over time as well [David 1971]. Tentative results obtained when
we extended the data series through World War

I to

1925 suggest that the

basic form of the relationship may indeed have changed. We found several
instances of negative or statistically insignificant price elasticity

coefficients when the samples were extended to 1925. It was decided to
end the sample in l911 to maintain comparability with the previous studies
and to avoid having to change the basic specification of the estixated
equation.9

III. Estimation Method.
The estimation method used in this study has been developed in
[Cooley 1971; Cooley and Prescott 1973c and 1974]. While theoretical and other
reasons

suggest that the parameters in our relationship are likely to

change over time,

they do not suggest the precise

pattern of the

variation.

For this reason we assume that the parameters are subject to a rather
generaj. process that is capable of detecting parameter variation from

a variety of sources. The coefficients are assumed to be subject to
both permanent and transitory changes over time:

The implication or this assumption is that the 6 coefficients will vary

at

the same rate. The choice of this particular specification of the

covariance structure was essentiaU.y arbitrary, except that all

were allowed

to

parameters

vary and no a priori assumption was made about the relative

magnitudes of the variations. Extensive experiments were carried out
with alternative specifications of

and

E,

including matrices with

unequal diagonal elements and ones with both positive and negative off—
diagnoai. elements. Comparisons of the Bayesian posterior odds [Zeilner 1971,

pp. 291—302] did not indicate that any particular
Z

specification of the

matrices was superior to the others. In addition, the parameter

histories traced out with the alternative specifications were all very
similar, with extremely high correlations between both the values of the
parameters at different base periods (see below) and changes in the parameter
values from one base period to the next, for all the alternative covariance

structures tested. Thus, the analysis presented below is quite robust

with respect to alternative E specifications.

Since we are interested in the permanent component of the parameter

process and, in particular, specific realizations of the process, we

If y were known, estimation would be a trivial application of
Generalized Least Squares. The object of the estimation procedure is to

obtain a consistent estimate of y which wILL yield the asymptotically
efficient estimates of the B'S. The forxnaLL details of the estimation
technique and the asymptotic properties of the estimates are developed fully

in [Cooley 1971 and Cooley and Prescott l971]. In this study we present the

Bayesian estimates of the parameters. We have assumed priors which are
sufficiently diffuse so that the sample Information dominates. Our prior
knowledge (or ignorance) about the parameters is represented by the
independent distributions:

In the subsequent discussion we report as estimates of 8 the
first moment of the posterior density. The parameter y is only estimated
once for each state and the estimates of B at five year intervals are
obtained conditional on y.

variation as measured by , as well as several interesting patterns in

the parameter histories (of which the estimates given

in Table .1. are the endpoints) reveals several interesting findings. Allowing

variation in the constant term is a general way to provide for shifts in the
supply functions. The Fisher and Temin and DeCanio specifications parazneterized

such potential shifts by inclusion of a trend term. Table I reveals that for
the cotton states, the constant increased over the period for all states but

16

Florida

.

and Louisiana. These two states and Mississippi were the only

states whose trend coefficient was negative in [DeCaniol9T3J. For the wheat
states, the constant drifted downward for all states but Kansas, Maryland,

and Missouri. In the Fisher and Temin regressions, the trend was negative for
all states but Kansas, Maryland, Virginia and Nebraska, and in the cases
of both Virginia and Nebraska, they found a negative trend when relative

iield was included as an explanatory variable. It appears that both
specifications indicate similar movements in the intercepts of the supply
functions over the period.

This similarity is reassuring, but there are important differences

between the fixed parameter and varying parameter models' results. In
both the cotton and wheat states, the varying—parameter estimates of
coefficient of the lagged share,

are

,

the

generally lower than the estimates of

this coefficient in the fixed—parameter models. Now it is weLl. known

that

misspecification of either the disturbance process or the explanatory
variables can lead to biased estimates of the coefficient of a lagged
dependent variable Tohnston 19T2].This bias is likely to be positive if the

omitted variables exert an influence on the dependent variable which persists

over several periods. In agricultural supply it seems likely that factors
tending to stimulate wheat or cotton production might exert a persistent

influence over a period longer than one year. Such omitted variables might
include relative prices of crop—specific inputs, forces leading to a revision
of the price—expectation behavior of the farmers, or other factors too erratic
to be adequately parameterized by the trend coefficient in the fixed—parameter

functions. The varying—parameter technique is specifically designed to
capture permanent changes in the structural coefficients which might be

17

associated with movements in omitted variables, and it is also a more general
alternative to the specification of a first—order autocorrelated disturbance

[Cooley and Prescott 1973c, p. 681.

On both grounds then, the varying—parameter

technique is less susceptible to the possibility of a upward bias in the coefficent

of the lagged share. This is consistent with the comparisons between

Leaving aside comparisons with the previous work, the time pattern of
the coefficient estimates leaves no doubt that the conditions of agricultural

supply were undergoing significant modification during the period. Table 4

shows the simple correlation coefficients between the parameter values
calculated at 5—year intervals and a simple trend. The pattern for the

A of equations (9) and (Ii), the implication is that as time

went on the farmers in the wheat states tended to put greater weight
on the whole history of the relative wheat price in formulating their
predictions, while the relative weight they gave to more recent observations
of this price declined.

For cotton the picture is somewhat less clear. Five states of ten

show 82 declining over time, and the correlations seem, if anything,
a bit stronger in the states with increasing 82.

Eight

of the ten states

show a declining 83 indicating an increasing relative weight on recent

prices In formulating the price prediction. The long—run price elasticity
is negatively correlated with the trend in six of the ten states.

{Insert Table 4}

The picture presented by the wheat estimates is one of declining

flexibility on the part of the farmers. Fifteen out of seventeen states
showed a fall in both the long-run and the short—run price elasticity,
and this decline was so severe that by 19124 four states (California,

Illinois, Missouri and Indiana) exhibited negative short—run price elasticities.
(Of course, negative price elasticities are highly implausible, but in no
case are these estimates significantly different from zero.) At the sante

time the price elasticities were declining, the estimates of 83 are
indicative of decreasing reliance on recent prices in forming the forecast

of the relative price. The increasing commercialization of wheat farming
does not appear to have led to more elastic price—responsiveness

.

19

on the part of western and northern farmers.

The parameter trends for the cotton farmers cast further doubt on the
possibility that they became increasingly committed to cotton and unable

to shift into alternative crops [DeCanio 19731. If an increasing proportion
of farmers were "locked in" to cotton production, the aggregate short—run
price elasticity might have declined in reflection of the changing aggregation

weights of the free and constrained farmers. No such uniform decline over

the entire South is observed; five of the states exhibit declining 2'
five increasing 2's. It is difficult to see how the increasing short—run
price elasticities of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Texas could be
reconciled with the traditional hypothesis of increasing involuntary
specialization in cotton throughout the South due to credit conditions.12
These overall trends in both the wheat and cotton parameter histories
should not obscure the fact that there are substantial variations within

the trends. Along the lines of inquiry suggested in Section II, it might
be asked whether the patterns of parameter variation reveal aspects of
farmers' behavior more subtle than the simple response to changes in the

relative price. Nerlove [1958] examined parameter differences across distinct
groups of farmers (defined by the different crops they grew), but our 5—year
interval parameter histories enable us to examine changes in the response
parameters of given groups of farmers defined by their geographical location.
Following Nerlove, we first examine the influence of differing degrees of
price variability.
Obviously, there is no unique way to measure changes in the variability
of the price over time, so the method chosen carries no claim to any ideal

20

properties. With this qualification, define Vt as sample variance of
the price variable computed over the 5—year interval ending in year t.

Denote this Vt as the "temporary variance" of the price. Define v. =

as the temporary price standard deviation over the same period. These
were computed for each state's price series, for each 5—year interval
ending in one of the base years for which the historical parameter values
13
were calculated.

For each state, the first differences of the v. were

correlated with first differences of the 82 and 33 estimates calculated
at the 5—year base intervals. First differences were used to eliminate
potentially spurious correlations due to the presence of common trends possibly
arising from different sources.

The resulting correlations indicate the

degree to which changes in price variability were matched by changes in the
parameter values.

{Insert Table 5)

The pattern of the correlation coefficients is initialLy puzzling. Both
the cotton states and the wheat states show a strong association between

changes in the parameters and in the v. However, the patterns of change
in the two regions are mirror images of each other. In the cotton states,
increases in price variance are associated with increases in 83 and with

decreases in 2' while in the wheat states increases in v are associated
with decreases in 83 and increases in 82. There are only two exceptions
to the pattern among the cotton states, and only three exceptions to the

pattern out of the seventeen wheat states. Before these results are judged

21

of wheat and

farmers (and, by implication, the irrationality of one

group or the other), it is necessary to investigate further the link between

price

variability and the structural parameters which would be predicted by

theory.

in forming the optimal predictor; a high A means

that information from the more distant past is given a relatively

high

in predicting the current price. It can be shown from equation

(10) that A is a decreasing function of p =

a2/a2,

the ratio of the

variance of the permanent component to the variance of the transitory

component of the price. This is plausible, for as Muth states [changing
his

notation

to conform]:

If the changes in the permanent component are small relative

the 'noise," then A wifl be very nearly unity. The forecast
then gives nearly equal weights to an past observations in order
that the transitory couroonents tend to cancel each other out. The

forecasts then do not depend very much on recent information because
it saysvery little about the future. On the other hand, if changes
in the permanent component are large relative to the noise, A would
be small so as to weight the recent information heavily
[Muth 1960, p. 3O].
Decomposition of the price into permanent and transitory components suggests
that the relationship between price variability and

That differences in the source of change in the v. might be

for the cotton and wheat states. This ratio can be estimated for each

were determined entirely by Muth—type considerations. Differences in the
crop mix, aggregation weights, and other underlying conditions of supply

an be expected to condition the values of the structural parameters,
leading to variation in those parameters across states and regions.
The unique advantage of the varying parameter estimation method in this
context is that it allows a test of the Muth hypothesis withIn each state.

25

This is equivalent to controlling for all the other structural differences
between states. Indeed, such strong einpirica.L evidence of the Muth effect
could hard.Ly have been developed without the varying parameter estimation
methods.
It might be thought that the evidence for the validity of the Muth
hypothesis is not overwhelming on the basis of the correlations of Table 7,

particularly for the wheat states. A two—tailed binomial 'test of the null
hypothesis of equiprobability

of positive and negative signs of the

correlations gives the following probability—values:

{Insert Table 8}

The calculated probability—values are low for every sign count, especially
if all

27 states are joined into a single sample. But even in the wheat

states, the probability—values are .Low enough to provide strong support

for the Muth hypothesis. This is particularly so in light of aLL the things
that could go wrong with the test. Consider the following sources of "noise"
in the correlations: (a) There is no a priori reason for choosing a 5-year

interval for the successive estimates of t This choice was made arbitrarily

Thus, as winter wheat became a more important

part of the wheat crop, the specification of the wheat model becomes poorer.

(d) As is obvious from equation (iO), 83 (=x) is not a linear function

of either p or y. This nonlinearity will tend to reduce the linear

(e) In addition to all these difficulties, the correlations are all based on
relatively small samples———eight observations for the first—difference cor—

relations and nine for the undifferenced correlations. Thus, a substantial
amount of pure sampling error might be expected.
Aside from any of these probabilistic points, however, the strongest
support these correlations provide for the existence of the Muth effect is
the way they totally eliminate the need for separate explanations of the

parameter trends and variations for the cotton and wheat states. The results
of Table 7 show that the behavior of both cotton and wheat farmers is
consistent with the same model of price prediction, a model based on a

natural optimal decision rule. There is no need for ad hoc theorizing
concerning the origins of structural variation. Differences in observed

.

27

responses

on the part of the two major groups of farmers may therefore be

identified as stemming from differences in the structure and operation of

the output markets for wheat and

cotton.

Given these strong indications of the presence of the Muth effect and
of the influence of price variability on the decision—making process, two

questions Thmain: (I) Exactly what was perceived by the farmers in their
scrutiny of the price history for their products? (2) Is there any way
to account for the difference in the nature of the relative cotton price

series from that of the relative wheat price series? When these two
questions are answered, or at least when plausible answers are sketched,
it will be possible to draw some final conclusions regarding the origins
and course of the agrarian unrest of the 1880's and 1890's.

It is, of course, patently obvious that no nineteenty-century farmer
spent his time decomposing the time series of relative crop prices into
permanent and transitory components or mathematica.LLy computing variances

and standard deviations of the price over its recent history. However, the
farmers are likely to have been aware of price fluctuations, and of certain
qualities of those price fluctuations which appear in the mathematical

as the permanent and transitory components of variation. Permanent

treatment

changes in the price are just that———changes whose effects persist over time.

A high ratio of the variance of the permanent component of the price to the
variance

of the transitory component represents a relatively large amount

of permanent change in the price history as compared to the transitory
fluctuations. Is it likely that the farmers would have been aware of
this distinction?

28

In

reality, low p would be manifested in a price series that

fluctuated "randomly."

.

Since the variance of the component of permanent

change would be small, almost all price fluctuations would be due to the

transitory

component, the effects of which do not persist. On the other

hand, if p were large, the price series would be characterized by large
shifts that would persist over time, and the magnitude of these shifts
would be large relative to the transitory fluctuations of the price.' One

characteristic of a price series with low p would be that it would display
hardly any autocorrelation of the residuals around its mean value, while a
series with substantial permanent variation would display substantial

autocorrejation of its residuals. In fact, the cotton and wheat price series
exhibit exactly the pattern of autocorre.Lation that would be expected, given

their y I:axid p] values of Table 6. Table 9 lists the Durbin—Watson
statistics computed for the residuals of the relative price series for
each state when regressed on a simple constant.

{Insert Table 9)

It can be seen from this table that only the price series for North Carolina

and Tennessee of the cottonstates show significant autocorrelation at the 5%
level, while only California, North Dakota and South Dakota of the wheat
states fail to show a significant degree of autocorre.Lation.15

How would such price histories appear to the farmers? With small

values of p and slight (if any) autocorrelation, the relative cotton
price would appear to fluctuate randomly. There would be no tendency for
a year of high cotton prices (relative to the long—term average) to be
followed by another good year, or for a year of low cotton prices to be

S

29

followed by another poor year. Any Large

increase

in the variability

of the cotton price would be interpreted (by an observant farmer) as only a

larger—than-average temporary fluctuation. Thus, for cotton farmers the
optimal prediction of the future price would tend to discount the information

contained in recent values of a widely-fluctuating price. The relative price

of wheat, on the other hand, was subject to permanent shifts. A year of
higher—than-average price was often followed by more years of higher-than—

average prices. The observant farmer might welL expect a large fluctuation
In the wheat price to persist, so his optimal prediction of the future price

This pattern of wheat price fJ.uctuations.has been commented upon

before, but the conclusion has always been drawn that farmers were confused

and

bewildered

by the behavior of the prices

given in Section I; Gray and Peterson 1971i,

[See quotation from North 19714

p.

320]. But the existence of the

Muth effect shows that at least a substantial number of both wheat and
cotton farmers were well aware of the price fluctuations for their crops,
as 'well as the pattern of those fluctuations, and acted accordingly. Wheat
farmers did weight current information more heavily just after a large

fluctuation,

and cotton farmers tended to discount such information in

predicting the future price. Both groups of farmers discounted recent
information when the variance of the transitory component of the price was
increasing relative to the variance of the permanent component of the price.
In short, the results confirm that a sizeable number of nineteenth—century
farmers were keen observers of not only the levels of relative prices for

their products, but also of the patterns of price variability. Agriculturalists

30

in

both the wheat producing states and the cotton South were conscious of

far

more of the information contained in the price histories of their

outputs than they have hitherto been given credit for utilizing.
Even if farmers were able to incorporate the information contained in
the price histories in making

planting

decisions, the source of the

difference in the behavior of the relative price series of the two regions

remains to be explained. Why did the wheat price show substantially higher
permanent variation than the cotton price? No final answer can be given
here, but an informed guess is possible. It is first necessary to digress
for a brief consideration of the economic forces affecting the price of an
agricultural

commodity.

For any commodity produced under competitive conditions and traded
a

in

world market (as both wheat and cotton were after the Civil War), the

price

in any given year is determined by supply and demand. For these

agricultural products, supply at the end of any crop year depends on the
price which had been expected to prevail at harvest time (which influenced
the planting decisions of farmers) and weather conditions determining yields

in the current crop year. (We will ignore carry—over stocks and inventories
to simplify the discussion.) The year's crop will normafly be thrown onto
the market and the market-clearing price will be determined by the intersection

of the nearly vertical short—run supply curve with the demand curve. From
year to year, the short—run supply curve will shift according to the forces
listed above but the demand curve will be shifting as well, due mainly to
demographic changes, long—term economic growth, and income variations
associated with the business cycle.

31

Now suppose that one set of price—responsive suppliers produces most

of the world's output of a commodity. An exogenous and unforseen increase
in demand (due, for example, to a cyclical boom) will increase the price in
the current year, thereby stimulating increased production in the succeeding

years. If the expansion in demand does not persist, the observed annual

of the commodity will

fluctuate randomly. Even if demand shifts do

the

some extent cancel

increases in demand. The same

applies to decreases in demand. Thus even persisting demand shifts

will not necessarily elicit large permanent changes in the price of the

commodity. On the

other hand, suppose the subset of price—responsive pro-

ducers contributes

only a small portion of the world's supply. In this

case, persisting shifts in demand would tend to be associated with larger
and, longer—lasting deviations of the world price from its average or trend
value.

Just as the persistence of fluctuations in the commodity's price depends
upon the degree of price—responsiveness of the producers, the volatility of
demand

and

variance of yields will condition the mixture of "permanent" and

"transitory" components of price variation. Rapid and random shifts in
demand will tend to produce transitory price fluctuations, while factors
which reduce the yield variance of the agricultural commodity will increase

the ratio of permanent variance to transitory variance in the price. These
factors provide the key to explaining the difference in the behavior of the
cotton and wheat price relatives.

First, wheat constituted one of the major food crops of the world, and
it is natural to think that demand for it would be less susceptible to cyclical

32

fluctuations in income than would be the demand for cotton products.
Second, wheat was grown aJJ. over the world, while cotton production was

concentrated in the United States and a few other countries. This
geographical dispersion of the wheat crop may have tended to reduce the weather—
associated yield variance of the world wheat crop relative to the world cotton

crop, since cotton production was much more localized. Finally, both wheat and

cotton

producers in the United States were price—responsive, but while U.S.

cotton constituted the majority of the world's output after the Civil War, U.S.
wheat production amounted to only around one—quarter of the world's crop.

{Insert Table .L0}

It is not implausible to think that wheat producers in the other countries

of the world were less price—responsive than American producers. American
agriculture in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was surely
more progressive and commercialized than the agriculture of the non—European
wheat producers.

Even if European producers were as price-responsive as their American
counterparts, European governments began erecting high tariff walls

around

their wheat farmers after 1880. By 1900, the effective levels of protection
in France and Germany amounted to

per bushel, and in Italy to over 2O

per bushel [Malenbaumk3,p. 162]. These tariffs were substantial in comparison
to the wheat price of 62.J. per bushel received by American farmers in 1900

[Agricultural Statistics 1937, p. 9],and France, Germany and Italy accounted
for an average of 56% of total European wheat production (excluding Russia)
over the period 18914—1899

[Computed from Ma.Lenbaum 1953, p. 238—239].

33

Given a specific tariff of ip
world price per bushel

on a bushel of wheat, an x% increase in the

P results in only an x/(l + (ip/P))% increase in the

price in the protected region.16 The tariff therefore is responsible for a

less-than—proportional price Increase In the protected countries. The
effect Is to reduce the magnitude of the supply response from the protected

countries,even if the elasticity of response of the farmers In those
countries were Identicaj. to that of United States wheat producers. This
effect is likely to have been important, since over the years covered in
Table 10, United States wheat production accounted for only an average of

3.8% of European (excluding Russia) plus United States output.
It is highly likely then, that differences in world market conditions
were responsibJ.e for the disparate characteristics of the price histories

of American wheat and cotton. This source of patterns in the price histories
coupled with Muth—optirnal behavior on the part of both cotton and wheat

farmers suggest some new interpretations of the economic basis of Populism
and Its related agrarian distress.

V. Concluding Speculations.

The results of the previous section support the predictions of economic

theory in explaining farmers' response to price. Farmers were neither
unresponsiveto price changes nor insensitive to the history of fluctuations
in the prices of their agricultural

products.

Enough farmers behaved

optimally in the Muth sense to enable their reactions to be detected at the

state—wide level of aggregation. Of course, the rational behavior of a

34

substantial

number of farmers does not preclude bewilderment or sub—optimal

reactions on the part of many other farmers. But in a larger sense, even
the farmers who were fully aware of their situation may not have been
immune from economic distress.
For the wheat producers, the existence of permanent changes in the
price of their cash àróp presented them with unique problems of response.
Autocorrelatlon of the relative wheat price opened the possibility of
obtaining a real advantage by quick action in the event of a price change.
Since price increases could be permanent, a 'bonanza" approach to expansion

of wheat acreage could pay large dividends. On the other hand, not all
price fluctuations were permanent, so some farmers who rapidly revised
their price expectations in response to some of the fluctuations must

have been disappointed. Even if rapid expansion were temporarily successful,
a period of greater—than-average prices could be followed by a period of

less—than—average prices with distressing suddenness. And bad years
associated with worid business cycles might induce acreage contraction
without any subsequent price increase following the reduction in American

supply. The autocorrelated price series indicates that both good and bad
years tended to come in clumps. Painful experiences due to this fact may
have been responsible for the overall decline in price—responsiveness by
farmers over the entire period, but in any case, awareness of these
possibilities and attempts to adapt to them would not necessarily have
guaranteed even the most intelligent farmers security from disaster.

As for the cotton farmers, it is possible that their preoccupation

.

with the issue of cotton "overproduction" [DeCanio, 1973 and l9TlLb] was derived from

35

their awareness of the fact that the South domited. world cotton supply.
Perceptive men must have realized that if only Southern farmers had been
able to act in concert, they could have eliminated the depressing impact
of the increased production that inevitably followed a year or years of

high cotton prices. The very price—responsiveness of Southern farmers
prevented them from realizing the full benefits of demand—induced booms.17

Notes

1. For a discussion of the possible types of structural change in models
spanning extended periods of historical time, see [David 1971, pp. 161_167].
A recent discussion concerning parameter change in agriculture in the
context of a model slightly different from that employed in the present

paper is contained in [Sahi and Craddock l974]. Lucas [1973] argues that
dynamic economic theory implies that macro—economic parameters are
unlikely to be stable over time.

2. In the subsequent section we shall clarify our view of "rational
behavior" on the part of farmers; our on.Ly

purpose

here is to set

the task and to anticipate some of the major findings and possible

interpretations of the statistical results. It goes without saying that

the

econometric results stand independent of the interpretations that

may be placed upon them. The data and estimates derived from them

difference in the data used in this paper and the data used in the previous

studies is thatthe cotton price series was extended backward from 1882
to 1870 by substituting an average U.S. cotton price [Historical Statistics l919,
Series E 220, p. .1.08] for the unavailable state cotton prices used after

1882. The correlation between the U.S. price and the state prices was
quite high after 1882, because of the competitiveness of the national.

cotton market, and it is unlikely that any substantial error is introduced
by use of the national price for the years prior to 1882.

Ner.Love also finds it plausible "that the

elasticity of expectations is

a decreasing function of the typical variance of prices....The result
indicates that the behavior parameter

8 [which is analogous to 0 of

equation (14) in our notation] may be subject to a number of influences

over time some of which are related to the characteristics of the market

under investigation [Nerlove 1958, p. 59]." In addition to citing
confirmation of an inverse relationship between the coefficient of
expectations (8) and the variability of the outcomes found by Modigliani
and Sanerlender [Nerlove 1958, p. 59], Nerlove himself finds the sane
inverse relationship between his coefficients of expectations and the
year—to—year variability of the pricesof the various crops [Nerlove

1958, p. 221]. Nerlove does not explicitly provide an optimizing
theory of this relationship, however.

At a minimum, the required data would include information on changes

the costs of being out of equilibrium and changes in the costs of

shifting from one crop to the other. Furthermore, models relating

adjustments to price changes.

5—year period ending in 1869 were not available.
