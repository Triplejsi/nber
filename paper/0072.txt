The Goodness of Match

I.

Introduction

Statistical matching has received increasing popularity in the last

five years as a method of creating synthetic microdata sets. Benjamin
Okner merged the 1966 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Tax File with the
1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO) by first dividing the two
files into broad "equivalence classes" and employing a distance func-

tion to choose the best record to match (Okner, 1972). Edward Budd and
Daniel Radner matched the Current Population Survey File with the
IRS Tax File by ranking records in each file by income level and

linking similarly ranked observations (Budd, 1971). Richard Rockwell
combined the 1970 Public Use Sample (PUS) with the SEO file by dividing
each sample into equivalence classes on the basis of five common

variables. Horst Alter linked the 1970 Canadian Survey of Consumer
Finances with the 1970 Family Expenditure Survey by using multiple
regression analysis to minimize the "distance" between matched observations

(Alter, 1974). Currently, Nancy and Richard Ruggles are undertaking
a match of the 1970 PUS with the 1960 PUS, the 1969 IRS Tax File, and
the Social Security's Longitudinal Employer-Employee Data File by creating
matching classes on the basis of interval analysis ard combining records
on a stochastic basis within these intervals (Ruggles, 1974).

—2—
Though the statistical techniques vary, the matching problem is
essentially the same in each case and can be stated formally, as

Christopher Sims does, as follows: Given "observations on X,Y from
one sample and on X,Z from another sample, when will it be true that
by matching observations according to X, an artificial Y,Z sample will
result whose distribution is the true joint Y,Z distribution?" (Sims,

1972, p. 355). Though the imputed Y,Z distribution will, in gerneral,
be different from the true Y,Z distribution,1 the closeness of the two
yields a natural criterion of the goodness of match.
By making certain simplifying assumptions, we can make this criterion

operational. First, it can be assumed that the closeness of the correlation coefficient between Y and its imputed Z value to the true correlation coefficient between Y and Z reflects the closeness of the two

joint distributions.2 Though the true correlation between Y and Z is,
in general, unknown, we can determine a lower and upper bound on the
true correlation as a function of the matching variables and use the

range as a measure of the goodness of match. In order to do this, we
must, secondly, assume that for each observation in the first file there
exists an observation in the second file with exactly the same X values,
and conversely.3
1The two distributions will be exactly the same in the special case, which
Sims mentions, when X,Y and Z are mutually independent, and in the special
case when Y is a linear transformation of X and Z a linear transformation of X.
2The covariance between Y and Z, it should be recognized, is only one
moment of their joint distribution. Moreover, it is implicitly assumed
that Y, Z, and X are continuous variables. Furthermore, we shall ignore
the problem of sample estimation of the correlation coefficients and the
discrepancies between sample estimates and populatior values. In a sense,
we shall treat the sample as the full population.
31n practice, the major problem arising from matching two files is that
there rarely is an observation in the second file with the same X values
as a given observation in the first file, and
conversely.

-3The goodness of match depends on how much of the relation between
Y aid Z is transmitted through X--that is, on how X "mediates" between
Y and Z-- and we will therefore call X the mediating variables and Y

and Z the mediated variables.4 Since the functional form the lower
and upper bounds on the true correlation between Y and Z takes depends
on the number of X variables, we shall treat the problem in three stages:

(a) The case of one mediating variable.

(b) The case of two mediating

variables. Cc) The case of n mediating variables.

41n principle there may be more than one Y or Z variable. Without
loss of generality we can assume that there is only one of each, since
the correlation of each pair Yj, Zj can be treated independently of
the other pairs.

II. The Case of One Mediating Variable
Let X, Y, and Z be random variables with zero mean and unit
variance.

Let

q = cor(X,Y)
r = cor(X,Z)

Then,

Therefore,

when q and r have the same sign, the lower bound increases

as either I or ri increases. When q and r are non-negative, the
lower bound is less than or equal to q and r, and equals q when r equals

1, and conversely. The upper bound behaves obversely to the lower bound.

B. Upper Bounds:

q\r

I

-6When q and r have different signs, the upper bound decreases as

either I or ri increases. When q equals 1, the upper bound is
the same as the lower bound, r, and conversely when r equals 1.
When q and r have the same sign, the upper bound reaches its inaxi-

mum value of 1 when q equals r,6 and decreases as q deviates from r,

given r. Conversely, when q and r have different signs, the lower
bound reaches its minimum when q equals -r, and increases as iI

deviates from in, given r.
The upper and lower bounds give the range of values the true

correlation coefficient between Y and Z may have. The size of the
range is the difference between the two bounds and equals 2
Thus, the larger q and r, the smaller the range and the greater the
certainty that the imputed correlation between Y and Z is close to
the true one.

In the special case where q =

r

=

p, the bounds take the following

form:

Lemma 1:

When

1

>

p

>

2p2

- 1

equals 1, p equals l. Since the lower bound is quadratic in P

the range quickly widens as i deviates from 1 (See Figure 1).

6This can be shown by setting V1/q to zero and noting that the second
derivative is negative.
7Ii this case, both Y and Z are linear functions of X, say Y = aX+b
and Z = eX + d. Therefore,

Z =

(..)Y÷
a

(d-.)
a

and Z is a linear function of Y.

The Case of Two Mediating Variables

(a) First term: 3n2-2n is positive for n > 0.
Since C is the swn of the off-diagonal terms of the correlation matrix S,

C < n2-n and 5n2-4n-2C > 3n2-2n > 0.

Therefore, the coefficient of

r is positive.

(b) Second term: r2 < 1 and r2 > 0. Therefore, the second term is
non-negative if:

t =

4C2 + 4n2C + (4n-6n2)D + 2(n3-n4) < 0

To maximize t, it is necessary to maximize C, given D, since all the

Conclusion

The theoretical discussion presented in this paper provides a
guide for the construction of a viable match:

(i) In the case of one mediating variable it was shown that
the range of the correlation coefficient between the mediated variables

decreases sharply as either q or r approaches one. (In the case where

q or r equals one, p is determined with certainty.) Moreover, the range
of p in the case of n mediating variables can be no greater than the

range in the case of one variable. Therefore, X variables should
be chosen that are highly correlated with either the Y or Z variable.

(ii) The upper bound on the range of p declines as the sum of
the correlation coefficients between the X variables declines. From
Tables II and III it is evident that the lower bound on p is very

sensitive to the value of the s parameter. Therefore considerable
gain in the accuracy of the match can be achieved by choosing X
variables that are uncorrelated or even negatively correlated.

(iii) The upper bound on the range of p also declines, given
certain strong assumptions, as the number of X variables increases.

Table III shows that there is a large gain from increasing the number
of mediating variables from 1 to 5 but minimal gain from increasing

it beyond 5. Therefore, at least five X variables should be chosen
in engineering a match.
