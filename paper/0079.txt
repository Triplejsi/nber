ABSTRACT

DARBY,

M. R. --The Consumer Expenditure Function

A consumer expenditure function which integrates pure consumption and
household investment in durable goods is formulated and estimated. Because
of reduced reliance on the official classification of conmiodities as durable

or nondurable, a considerable increase in ability to explain consumer expen-

ditures results as compared to multiequation models. Further empirical investigation provides strong evidence that:

(1) private sector income is

significantly better than disposable personal income for explaining consumer
expenditures,

Introduction and Summary

relationship of aggregate consumer expenditures to in-

variables is one of the central elements of macroeconomic
some time back in the 1950's, consumption theorists seem

have lost interest in this relation and began to concentrate on models

of the pure consumption of service flows. This is not surprising perhaps,
as explanations of pure consumption could be fairly directly derived from

interteinporal choice theory and are sufficient to explain the broad movements of consumer expenditures.' But most cyclical variation in consumer
expenditures

would appear to arise in

the adjustments of the stocks of con—

umer durable and semidurable goods and not in fluctuations in the growth
of pure consumption. So macroeconomists should be concerned with a consumer expenditure

the pure

function integrating the asset adjustment function and

consumption function.

The usual approach of those few

economists

selves with these distinctions has been

vestment

who have concerned them—

to formulate a model in which in-

in consumers' durable goods is estimated in a separate equation

or equations from the determination of pure consumption. Empirically con—
suniption

is estimated

as

consumer expenditures less consumer expenditures

on durables plus the estimated rental value of the stock of durable goods.

—2—
Such an approach depends critically upon the completeness of the empirical

definition of consumer expenditures for durable goods. To the extent that
coods which are behaviorally durable are in fact classified as nondurable,
the model will be miaspecified and omit a portion of the cyclical varia-

tion in consumer expenditures. In my restatement of the permanent income
theory (1974), it was shown that on the order of half of the behaviorally
defined durable goods are classified in the official data as nondurable

goods and services.2 So the standard approach indeed suffers from specification biases.

The most obvious approach is to correct the definition of durable
goods so that the two or more equation approach can be directly applied.
As a practical matter such a correction is impossible because of both a
lack of finely disaggregated data and the generality of durability in a

behavioral sense. To take a simple example related to the concept of
human capital, surely a vacation is a durable good yielding benefits for
nany years in the form both of memories and of inflicting slide shows on

relatives. A more promising approach followed in this paper is to formulate a model in which the role of specification bias Is minimized. As it
happens, an integrated consumer expenditure function not only serves this
role but also refocuses attention on the basic macroeconomic concept.
The integrated consumer expenditure function is derived in Section II
by inverting the standard theoretieal definition of pure consumption so
that consumer expenditures are defined in terms of pure consumption, house—
hold net Investment In durable goods, and the yield on the stock of dur-

able goods existing at the beginning of the period. This definition is
converted into a consumer expenditure function by substitutions based upon
the permanent income theory of pure consumption and a generalized stock

The Theoretical Model

This section presents an elaboration of the integrated vodel. cf cc-

sumer expenditures presented in Darby (1975). First a general franework
is derived suitable for integrating all three—equation models of pure
consumption c, household investraent in durable goods

and the (end—

of—period) stock of consumers' durable goods cit. A specific——but enpiri—
cally quite general——model is then substituted into this frarteworktO obtain the basic equation used in the empirical investirations.

The real stock dt of consumers goods ("the durables stock") at the end
of period •t Is computed by applying a depreciation rate of 6 par period:

Estimation of the Model

i3asic estimates of the model and a comparison with the multiequa—

tiort approach are presented in this section. Discussion of some important empirical issues with respect to the computation of permanent income
and the definitions of income and money is postponçd for fuller consideration in Section IV.

Data Definitions8

A major empirical finding of this paper is that data definitions of
durable goods, income, and money make a real difference in the ability to

explain consumer behavior. So it is necessary to devote particular attention to the precise definitions of date sources used. Some important data
series have been copstructed and are made available in the Data Appendix
for use by others.
Four basic series are available directly:

c

Personal consumption exnenditures in constant (1958) dollars
(quarterly data at seasonally adjusted qarter.1. rates (SAQR)).

c

Personal consumption expenditures for durable goods in constant
(1958) dollars (quarterly data at SAQR).

Annual regressions use the end of the year (fourth quarter) data extracted
from the quarterly estimates.
iwo alternative current income measures are compared in Section IV,

one corresponding to the accrual of purchasing cower and the other to cash

receipts. Each is adjusted for an imputed 10% per annum real yield r on

the beginning durables stock)0 The basic accrual concept of income is
private sector income y——see Darby (1976, Chapter 2)——which is the amount
(iriplicit in the national income accounts) available to the private sector

(ultinately consumers) for consumption or addition to wealth.11 The cash—

receipts concept is based on disposable personal income y". Both series
are deflated by the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures and quarterly observations are at SAQR. Thus, on the accrual def i—
nition current income is

annual level. Since autocorrelation suggest overly optimistic standard
errors, the discussion below will emphasize the more reliable annual regression.

is a meaning—

More useful is the ratio of the

standard error of estimate to the mean value of dependent variable. This
value is 0.58 percent for the annual regression and 0.86 percent for the

quarterly regression. If the consumer expenditure functions were converted to private saving functions by use of the identities (see Darby (1975),
equation (12)), the standard errors would be 5.0 percent of mean private

saving for annual data and 7.5 percent for quarterly data. Further the
annual standard error of estimates is only 34.0 percent of the standard
error for the naive model of footnote 16 and 50.5 percent of the standard
error for a Keynesian consumption function.

In the annual regression, the coefficient of

cause the effect operating through the stock demand for durables Is large

relative to the offset due to the demand for money. The long—run effect
of

permanent income

would include induced effects on the durables and

money stocks. Of special interest are the implied long—run values for
the ratio k of pure consumption to total accrued income and the ratio a
of private saving to private sector income (exclusive of the inmuted

yield on the durables stock). These values are estimated at 0.90 and

O.O respectively on the basis of regression (18).17 In view of the non—
linear

transformations rind auxiliary information used in their computa-

tions, these values arc better regarded as rough checks

on the consistency

of the regression than as good estimates of k and a.

the quarterly regression, the corresponding value is 0.46.

The lower

quarterly value reflects the smaller impact of current income on permanent

income within a quarter as compared to over a year. The estimates of this
E weirht bracket the 0.1 per annum (0.025 per quarter) value which was
estimated in 1)arby (1974) on the basis of pure consumption. They will be

analyzed further in Section IV.

The coefficient of real money balances is quite si!nificant in both
the economic and statistical senses. Its high value would appear to support the substitution hypothesis of the real balance effect. This may be

interpreted in two equivalent ways: (1) Bonds and durables are øubsti—
tutes in the household portfolio and

the

demands for both are affected by

an excess supply of money. (2) oney supply, given its demand, is a good

The coefficient of the relative price of durable goods is insignificant and of the wrong sign. Although not surprising——given that about
half of behaviorally defined thirable goods are represented in the denomi—

nator——this result is disappointing. An unsuccessful attempt was made to
estimate durables stock and price series inclusive of clothing and shoes.
Although the relative price coefficient became negative, insurmountable
difficulties in estimating the initial stock and depreciation resulted in

a slight deterioration in the standard error. Even were a definitionally
Tpure" estimate available, there would be two other factors making for an

insignificant——or even perversely signed——coefficient for the relative

price of durables: (1) The behavior of the relative price of durables is
dominated by a downward trend over the postwar period. Given the costs
of maintaining current price information on infrequently purchased Items,
the price as perceived by consumers not actively in the market would be

better represented by a trend than by the actual price. Since permanent
income is trend—dominated, the high implicit coefficient on permanent income in the durables stock demand will reflect not only the true income

effect but also the effect of the negative trend in prices. (2) If——contrary to the usual macroeconomic assumption——the supply curve of durable
-'oods Is not infinitely elastic at a given price, the relative price co-

efficient would reflect the interaction of demand and supply effects and
be of indeterminante sign.

The nominal interest rate coefficient is slightly positive. This
indicates that the positive effect (from decreasing the demand for money)
slightly outweighs the negative effect (from decreasing the durable stock

demand). Since no attempt was made to adjust for expected inflation, the
nominal interest rate would not be expected to have much effect in the

— 17 —

durables stock demand. It is perhaps surprising then——if money demand

is

significantly interest elastic——that the interest rate coefficient does
not more substantially exceed zero.

The early part of the period, say from 1947 through 1953, appeared

suspect for three possible reasons: (1) the constraint on durables goods
purchases during World War II, (2) possible inaccuracies in the starting
benchmarks for permanent income and the durables stock, and (3) the effect
on the demand for money of the abandonment during 1951—1953 of pegged interest rates on government bonds. The equations were restiinated for 1954—
1973, but there was no hint of a structural change or even a significant

change

in any of the coefficients.'8 So the entire period is retained for

the statistical analysis.
It is customary

to include in consumer expenditure functions——or rather

consumption functions fitted to consumer expenditure data—the lagged dependent variable. The usual justification is the Koyck transformation in

which

lagged consumption serves as a proxy for lagged permanent income.

This justification does not hold for lagged consumer expenditures however,
since

it has been seen above that short—run fluctuations in consumer expen-

ditures are due primarily to fluctuations in transitory income, real money,

and durables stock. Although estimatIon of regressions such as (18) by
a maximum likelihood search routine is somewhat costly, the resulting
standard errors and Durbin—Watson statistics do not suffer from the biases
anticipated in regressions inclusive of the lagged dependent variable.
Where the precise estimate of the weight 8 of current income in permanent
income is not of concern, regressions can be run conditional upon a particular 8 weight.

Disaret1on into Consumption and Durab1esInvesmentjuations

It

serves as a useful check on the derivation and interpretation of

the integrated consumer expenditure function (11) to estimate the underlying pure consumption function (5) and household durables investment

function (10). The difficulty in doing this is that the main reason for
using the inter,rated approach is a lack of good data on household durables

investment and pure consumption. Nevertheless for illustrative purposes,
the official definition of durable goods was used to construct estimates
(as explained under "I)ata Definitions') of pure consurrntion c and house—

number 1 and 4 for annual and quarterly data respectively.

The previous indirect calculation of k as 0.90 corresponds well to the

direct estimate of 0.88. Since it was argued that a pure consumption
estimate based on the official durables definition would in fact include
considerable household investment in misclassified durables, regression 2
and 5 apply the consumer expenditure function to the estimated "pure con—

sumption.' Regressions 3 and 6 apply the household durables investment
function (10) to the estimated net investment in (officially classified)
durables good.

In comparing regressions 2 and 3, it is clear that the estimated net
investment contains on the

behavioral sense.'9 The

order

of half of total net investment in a

significant problem——not present in the

cuarter1y regressions——is the larger coefficient on the lagged durables

regression 2 than in regression 3. This apparently offsets a

regressions 5 and 6 display the opposite bias due to

— 19 —

a

low 8

weight.20 The signs of the coefficients of the relative price of

durables are just the reverse of what would be expected, but not much can
be made of the statistically insignificant results for that variable.
In stun, the disaggregated version of the model is very much as would

be guessed from the derivation of the model and the estimates of the integrated

consumer expenditure function. The only significant divergence

between the annual and quarterly results——autocorrelation aside——are ap-

parently due

to the use of a slightly too high value of 8 in the annual

regressions and slightly too low a value of 6 in the quarterly regressions.
The disaggregation done in Table 1 takes advantage of the estimated
8 weight of current income in permanent income from the integrated consumer expenditure

function. A standard multiequation model

would make

separate estimates of equations (5) and (10) and combine them by use of
the identity (4) if a prediction of total consumer expenditures were re-

quired. The 8 estimate of the durables investment function will be unbiased but imprecise because of the low coefficient of permanent income.
Since the estimates of pure consumption include elements of durables in-

vestment, the demonstration of upward bias of 6 from Darby (1974) applies

directly. Nevertheless the biased permanent income estimates will provide

more accurate predictions of c than regressions 1 and 4. In practice an

Table 2 compares the root mean squared errors of these two disaggregate

for

ciuarterly data, the method utilizing the Koyck transformation does

nearly as well. The quarterly national income accounts data appear to
spread receipts and expenditures over adjacent quarters however, so that
the IZoyck transformation in this case displays a spurious accuracy.

The consumer expenditure function has been successfully estimated in
this section with no significant departures from expected signs or magni-

tudes of coefficients. The estimated coefficients are internally consistent. The disaggregated estimates are consistent with the original
hypothesis that all coefficients other than permanent income enter because
of household investment in durable goods but that nearly half of durable

oods in a behavioral sense are included in the official data on nondurable goods and services. As a result, disaggregate estimates of consumer
expenditures derived from separate models of pure consumption and house—
:o1d durables investment compare poorly with the estimates of the integrated consumer expenditure function.

IV. Analysis

—

of Three Empirical Issues

The consumer expenditure function is used in this section to investi-

gate further three empirical issues: (1) the definition of current income
which best explains consumer expenditures (2) the definition of money
which best explains consumer expenditures; and (3) the value of the weight
of current income in the determination of permanent income.

The two income definitions which are compared are the accrual con-

cept and the cash—receipts concept.21 These two definitions reflect the
two basic alternative conceptions of consumer behavior. The accrual concept is harmonious with a view of the consumer as a rational decision—

maker constrained by total wealth. The cash—receipts concept is sensible
if consumer behavior is more a matter of spending nearly all that is re-

ceived. Until recently, the use of a cash—receipts concept (disposable
personal income) was the standard, traditional practice. A number of
studies in the last decade have moved toward the accrual concept by adding
undistributed corporate profits (as an estimate of accrued capital gains).
There are many other competing income definitions which could be con-

sidered. ror example, Jarro (1974) and Kochin (1974) have recently argued——following David Ricardo——that government bonds are not viewed by
the private sector as net wealth.

Iii that case an accrual definition of

income would be essentially net natJonal product less government expenditures

for goods and services plus the increase in high—powered (base)

money.22 Feldstein (1974) on the other hand argues for inclusion of an

etitate of

increases in

"social security wealth." Another issue concerns

the transfer of purchasing power to the
would suggest subtraction of the
and governiient bonds (if

government through inflation. This

rate of inflation times high—powered money

government bonds are net wealth). In view of the

22 —

hig1 estimation

costs of dealing with many alternative incorie definitions

simultaneously with the other two main empirical issues, it was decided
only to compare the basic accrual and cash—receipts definitions, leaving
for further research comparison of finer differences conditional on a par-

ticular money definition and weight.
section III only discussed the

(currency plus demand deposits) de—

finitic-n of mone'. To other money definitions have received considerable
attention 1w monetary economists: N2 0l plus time deposits at cormiiercial

an:s23) and T3 (M', plus savings and loan and mutual savings hank deposits).
These alternative money definitions are compared with

in this section.

The 2 data used are an average of the monthly data deflated by the

inlicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures. Unfortunately Federal Reserve data for

is available only from January 1959

onward while the Friedman and Schwartz (1970) data contain no series usinc
the official

definition. Monthly estimates of N3 for 1947 through 1958

:ere made on the basis of the Friedman and Schwartz data on savings and
loan and mutual savings bank deposits.

The N3 data used in this series

are averages of this monthly data deflated by the implicit price deflator
for personal consumption expenditures.
In Darhy (1974), removal of the
timated

specification

bias resulted in an es-

weight of 0.1 per annum in terms of an essentially pure consump-

tion model. This section examines whether that estimate stands u for the
consumer expenditure function under alternative definitions of income and

money. Were

not estimated for each combination it could bias the choice

of the best combination of income and money.
These

;ion

three empirical issues are examined simultaneously by

the regres—

The

— 23

—

message of these tables is very clear The accrual income concept and the
money concept do much better in explanatory power (as judged the sum
of squared residuals or standard error of estimate criterion) than the

alternative definitions. Further the

weight of 0.1 per annum previously

estimated on the basis of pure consumption continues to hold up for the
consumer expenditure function.

Consider first the definition of income For each money

definition

and for both annual and quarterly data, the accrual definition of Income
does better than the cash—receipts definition.25 The sum of squared resi-

of the best cash—receipts definition regression exceeds that of the

duals

corresponding accrual definition by 41.8 percent for the annual data and
10.6 percent for the quarterly data.26 It

would have been surprising,

the success of the model which is based on rational consumers faced

given

with a wealth constraint, had the accrual definition not done considerably
better than the cash-receipts definition of income.

As to the empirical definition of money, the results are similar. For
either definition of income, the N1 definition does better than either

or 13. Comparing the best N1 estimate with the best alternative (N3),
the alternative definition's sum of squared residuals is 32.9 percent high-

er for annual data and 11.1 percent

fact that the standard errors decline less rapidly (so tLat t—values fall)

Strong evidence has been presented In this section for the following

empirical propositions: (1) The accrual (private sector income) definition
of income explains consumer expenditures better than the cash—receipts (dis-

posable personal income) definition. (2) The narrow

definition of money

is an important determinant of consumer expenditures and significantly
better in explanatory power than either broad definition

Concluding iemarks

The central theme of this paper is the empirical value of an integrated consumer expenditure function in explaining consumer expenditures.
The theoretical value of the consumer expenditure function is that it concentrates directly on the

variable

of prime interest to macroéconomjsts.

j3ut the alternative treatment of household investment in durable goods as

a component of an enlarged definition of total investment does not lack

theoretical appeal either. The basic attraction is therefore the

empiri-

cal one; The integrated approach is much less subject to biases introduced by the essentially arbitrary classification of coimiodities between
durable and nondurable goods and services.
An empirical question can be answered only by examination of the data.
An unusually clear answer was provided by the research reported here: The
consumer expenditure function explains the data well and significantly

better than the multiequation pure consumption—household investment approach. The reason for this superior performance is found in the fact that
the official data on durable goods expenditures include only about half of
total durables expenditures as defined behaviorally.

sector) definition of income better exi)lains consumer expenditures than a

weight of current income in the formation of permanent income lies somewhere in the range from 0 to about 20% per annum. While there Is no a

underlying the model——that consumers are rational decision—makers con-

strained by total (human and nonhuman) wealth as estimated by permanent

income. The rationality of consumers would certainly be questionable

if

they responded to cash receipts rather than accrued income. A 8 weight
of about 10% per annum——which is the estimated real yield on total wealth——

is certainly more acceptable than the higher weights estimated in many

The

studies.29

empirical advantages of an

integrated consumer expenditure func-

tion seem clear. Future research might be directed at substituting a
life cycle model for the permanent income explanation of pure consumption

to

compare their explanatory powers. Other areas for possible improvement

would be either the generalized stock adjustment hypothesis (6) or the

underlying stock demand functions (7) and (9). A somewhat different line

DATA APPENDIX

Several data series of general applicability were estimated in the

course of this project. In order to make them available for future research by others in this and other areas, the most important are reproduced here with instructions for updating as revised data become available.

Table 5 presents annual data for nominal and real private sector income, the current and permanent (real) income on the accrued definition,

the real durables stock, and the nominal M3 money supply. Table 6 contains quarterly data for the same series. Table 7 presents the monthly
nominal M3 data through 1959 when they tie in with the Federal Reserve
System's published data.

2A rough definition of behavioral durability is responsiveness to

transitory income. Consumer expenditures for durable goods and for clothing
and shoes are about equally responsive to changes in transitory and permanent income, but all other expenditures are only about one quarter as re-

sponsive to changes in transitory income as to permanent income. Thus the
official Commerce Department definition does appear to capture goods significantly more durable than those classified as nondurable goods and ser-

vices (with the exception of clothing and shoes). Given the relative magnitudes, however, the remaining durable elements in "nondurable goods and
services" are nevertheless quite significant.
31n my earlier work (1972, 1975), this adjustment was neglected be—

cause of the small difference from unity for quarterly data (with 5 —

18The estimates of the

-

weight of current income In permanent income

were a bit closer to the value of 0.1 per annum estimated in Darby (1974).
The only other noticeable——though statistically insignificant——changes
were generally higher (in absolute value) estimates for the coefficients

of money and the durables stock. All these changes are consistent with
the hypothesized shift, but the standard errors of estimate actually deteriorated slightly in the truncated period.

'9The smaller coefficient of transitory income Tt in regression 3
than in 2 reflects the larger offset due to the higher money coefficient.

Note that, roundingerror aside, regressions 2 plus 3 less 0.1 dt_l equal
regression equation (18). SImilarly, regressions 5 plus 6 less 0.025
equal regression equation (19).

20 am indebted to Tom Mayer for the observation that for low B
weights permanent income and the durables stock are closely related because of the high correlation between transitory income and fluctuations

in household durables investment. A high estimate of B applies too low a

weight to past transitory income and can be offset by a ire negative coefficient on the durables stock. This correlation is the probable explanation for the relatively flat likelihood function at the low end of the B

range as discussed in Section IV below. In regressions based on the B
weight of 0.1 per annum (but not reproduced here), the coefficient of

d1 is —0.092 for the c dependent variable and —0.102 for the
dependent variable. Consumer expenditure functions for 8
annum and 0.025 per quarter are presented in Section IV.

and 18 for the quarterly M3 comparison are close to a dead heat. That presumably reflects some peculiarity in the data which

also

accounts for the

unusually high estimate of 0.06 per quarter in regression 17.
261fl

comparing definitions such as these, the hypotheses are not

strictly nested and no generally acceptable significance test exists.

Consider the following, however. If the difference between the accrual
and the cash—receipts definitions were allowed to enter with a

weight

u

(to be estimated) between 0 and 1, the cash—receipts definition would be

nested (with the restriction p •

1) in the more general hypothesis that

- 48

income is. the stun of the accrual concept plus j.i times the difference.
For this model, the sum of squared residuals could not be greater than
the sum of squared residuals for 31

0 (the accrual income definition).

If we suppose that this upper limit on the unconstrained sum of squares is
the actual value-—which is favorable to accepting the cash—receipts defini—

tion——the likelihood ratio test could be used. The critical value at the
5% significance level for the excess sum of squares would then be 15.3%

for annual data and 3.6% for quarterly data. So even on this apparently
generous test, the cash—receipts definition is significantly worse than

the accrual definition. The same argument and critical values would apply
to the money definitions discussed below.
