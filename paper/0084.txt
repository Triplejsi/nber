Absact
In this paper we study two methods for finding confidence limits for the
simple median. One method is the new parame1ic procedure based on the

sign test, and the other is derived in the paper. The tv methods are
canpared asmiptoticaily and also for snail samples.

I. Introduction

Recently

of

there has been a great deal of interest

in robust

estimators

location and regression paraneters. Many of the better estimators are

not really suitable for hand calculation (see Andrews et al. (1972)); the
sample median, hever, is a reasonable estimator of location that is
readily computed by hand. Once a point estimate has been computed, it is
natur1 to seek confidence limits for the estimate; the purpose of this
paper

is

to examine two

alternative

methods for setting robust confidence

intervals for the sample median.

II. The Procedures
The first procedure we will examine is the nonparamEtric procedure

based on the sign test. This is a well )<na.n procedure, described in many
places

(e.g. Thompson (1936), Scheffe (1943), Noether (1949), Dixon (1953),

Fraser (1957)). Let

X1,. .. ,X

denote the order statistics of the sample and

the sample median. The nonparanetric confidence interval of level x for X

is (XrX r+l' where r is chosen

so

that the probability of fewer than r

successes in a binomial with paraneters (,n) is less than
Nair (1940) and McKinnon (1964) have
and 1% levels. It turns

out

tabled r as

or

equal to

a function of n for the 5%

that for the 5% level rl until n:9, and for the

1% level r=l until nl2. Thus the nonparanetric procedi.z'e cannot be considered

for n less than 9 or 12 (since gross erors may affect the length of
the interval violently for small n). Incidentally, it is worth noting that

This interval has been studied in the past: Rirnbaurn (1°70) derived distri-

]avid and Johnson (1956) studied this interval when sampling fraTL a nonrial

distribution; and Weisberg (1973) studied generalizations of thic interval.

There are two main problems with this interval: 1) clearly t'(c,n) will vary

from distribution to distribution. In other words a single

distributions. To sie extent Student's interval has the same prcblern

integral, which can pose severe numerical difficulties. Both problems can be

These results suggest that in moderate contamination with fat tails, the interval
(1) is probably

conservative

and

not very inefficient asymptotically, although

for a large contamination fraction it may become very inefficient. (p .25,
k .01 is equivalent to p .75, k 100, fran the definition of the contaminated

Airpng other quantities, he estimated t(ct,n) for a = .05 under various sampling

considered the statistic

of its distribution. From their results, we can derive the values of t'(cx,n)
for a = .05 and a = .02 under normality. These results are given in Table III,

The results presented in Table

5, 7, 9, 11, 21, 41 (I used respectively 6000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000 and
700 replications). Since the results are merely meant to provide a crude
approximation to t(cx ,n), I will not describe the experiment in detail (It was
carried

out in the TROLL system using a Box-Mueller nonnal generator. A standard

variance

reduction techniaue (stinEs referred to as "swindling't) was

employed

(Holland 1975). The results are presented in Table IV, together with the relevant
t values. The irregular behavior as n increases is not due to sampling

error, but to the irregularities in the definition of MS. Eom Table IV we
see that the approximation t'( .05 ,n)

t( .05 ,n) breaks down for n <10, and that

the approximation is never very good for a = .01. We propose the following

rules for t(a,n):

Nai that we have approximate values of t'(a,n) even for small n, we examine

the lengths of the two intervals for small n. As already noted, the 5% non-

parametric interval is robust only for n > 10, and the 1% only for n >

12.

Our

first results for the 5% intervals are again taken from Gross (1971). They are
presented in Table V.

These results suggest that for nl0, the interval (1) may be superior in

further,

we turn to the contaminated normal

statistics for son contaminated normal distributions. The results of Table VI

Again, we see that for small n and contaminated situations, the interval
(1) may be shorter than the nonparanEtric interval.

V. Exanle
As an example, we compute the two intervals for a specific set of data,

together with Student's interval. The data are differences in the weights of
matched pairs of rats undergoing a certain experiment, and were collected at
Harvard. The

It is

necessary to go to a great deal of trouble to get a robust
confidence interval with reasonable properties. For n > 20, the nonparemetric
