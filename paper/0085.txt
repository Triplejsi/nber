Abstract

The identifiability of redticed form econometric models with variable

coefficients is investigated using the control theoretic concepts of
uniform complete observability and uniform complete controllability.

First, a variant of the state space representation of the traditional
reduced form is introduced which transcribes the underlying non-

stationary estimation problem into one particularly suited to a Kalman

filtering solution. Using such a fornoilation, observability and controllability can be called upon to obtain a necessary and sufficient

condition for identification of the specific parameterization. The
results so obtained are completely analogous to those already established

in the econometric literature, namely, that the parameters of the reduced

form are always identified subject to the absence of multicollinearity

(referred to as "persistent excitation" in the control literature). However, now the multicollinearity condition is seen to depend on the struc-

ture of the parameter variations as well as the statistical nature of
the explanatory variables. The verification of identifiability thus
reduces to a check for uniform complete observability which can always
be

affected in econometric applications. Some

1. Introduction
Identification is an issue which arises in connection with all parametric

statistical models. Simply stated, the issue is whether one can infer
from observed samples the existence of a unique underlying theoretical
structure. Econometricians have long concerned themselves with establish-

ing the conditions for the identifiability of structures whose parameters
are assned to be constant. In this paper we address the seemingly more
complex issue of the identifiability of structures when the parameters

themselves are varying systematically or stochastically over time. This
is a relevant problem because in recent years increasing attention has
been focused on the problem of estiuting time varying structures. Although
estimation methods have been suggested by several authors, little attention

has been paid to the space problem of identification or to the asymptotic theory

for these estimators. Many of the issues we address in this paper have
been investigated by others (Tse Anton [1972]

arid

Mehra [19 7L.]

for

example) but the context, as we shall elaborate, is somewhat different.
The identification problem for the traditional linear econometric

model

equations which characterize the structural form parameters in tenns

of the reduced form parameters as manifest by HanrianTs solution.

Rothertherg [1971] takes a different approach in characterizing the

identifiability criteria in tenns of the information matrix of classical
mathematical statistics. Rothenberg' s approach has been nicely extended

to a more general representation by Boden [1973]. It is this latter
approach which is most appropriate to problems we are considering because

of its relative independence from concepts related to stationary
stochastic process theory.
The problem we are addressing can best be illustrated by considering

the state space representation of a model with stochastically varying

structure. We characterize the problem in tentis of a regression relation

The Estimation Theory for Time Varying Structures

In the introduction we represented the problem of time varying structures

in tenris of a single equation regression relationship and an equation

which characterizes the evolution of the parameters as a first order

Markov process. As a point of departure for this section let us consider
how we might generalize this representation. Ideally, we would like to
be able to consider general simultaneous equation regression relation-

ships. In practice, however, we mist restrict ourselves to the considera—
tion of reduced fonn relationships because the estimation theory for the
structural fonns of simultaneous equation systems has not yet been
developed.3 Consequently, the irost general regression structures we

can deal with are of the form

e is an Lxi vector of observa-

errors. This system of equations can be represented more compactly

as

We also want to consider generalizations of the process which

governs

the evolution of the parameters. Our original characterization of the

In many instances, however, one might expect to observe variation

To include these possibilities we modify our state equation to the form
(2.3)

which

admits variation of all

types. If u is equal to zero then

the variation is purely systematic. Thus, if the parameters follow a
time trer1, a sinusoidal pattern, or are correlated with exogenous variables it can be represented in this fashion. Similar models have been

Thus, estimation proceeds by selecting initial values of B, F0,0, e
and using the equations of the KaJ.inan Filter to define the likelihoxl

[1969].

This review of estimation methods for time varying structures high-

lights one of the important features that is useful in the discussion of

the identifiability of such structures. It is that estimation that is a
two-step procedure. In the first step the initial parameter vector
and the unknown covariance elements are estimated. The second step

consists of estimating realizations of the parameter process (bt,t or
bt,T)

conditional on the estimates obtained in

the first step. Thus,

—10—

estimation

of the paranter trajectories is essentially an empirical

Bayesian procedure. Consequently, the identifiability criteria for
such structures may be viewed as having two parts. The first, which

obviously is the crucial part, establishes conditions for the existence
of a unique underlying initial parameter vector. The second part simply

involves the conditions for the existence of a trajectory conditional
on b0

As we shall see &thsequently there is a direct, but by no nans

simple, relationship between the classical identifiability criteria
for constant parameter models and the identiabiity criteria for models
with time varying structure. Before deriving this relationship, however,
we introduce some concepts from the control theory literature which will

be useful in the subsequent analysis.

3. Observabiity and Controllability

3.1

Definitions

The concepts which we shall find useful in studying the identifiability
of time varying structures have evolved in the control theory literature

from an essentially different, but parallel set of concerns. The rapid
development of optimal control theory in the early l96OTs led to a

concern for the qualitative aspects of the optimal control problem.
Naturally, of first concern were questions regarding the existence and

A second qualitative consideration arose from the feedback nature

The results contained in Lemmas 1 and 2 should not be interpreted

as restricted solely to the Kalmari filter method of parameter estimation.

The Kalrnan Filter is a mber of the BLUE class so that any and all estimators that are BLUE must yield the same

matrix. Thus the bounds
presented above remain independent of the estimation method. Indeed,

both O(t,t-N) and C(t,t-N) are defined indeendentlv of the estimator.

it is intuitively clear that uncertainty (as represented by Pt,t) and
information are inversely proportional. Thus in obtaining a priori
conditions which guarantee the positive definiteness pf P1,'

it is

possible to insure, a priori, the identifiability of the parameters.
The relationship between observabiity, controllability, and identif 1ability can be put on a irore rigorous footing by examining the special

it is easy to see that for any variance-covariance matrix R > 0, the
condition of uniform complete observability is both necessary arid

sufficient for classical identification to obtain. These observations

EconOmetric Identification and Cons istency

The results of the previous section are well Icriown in the engineering

literature although they have not, to the best of our kricledge been
der±red elsewhere in the context of the tine varying parameter estiniat ion

problem. Most important, hcx.ever is the fact that the equivalence of the
observability and the information matrix reinforces the generic link
between the econometric identification problem and the properties of the

iKalman Filter. This link provides some insight as to h the criteria for
the identification of tine varting models differ from those of the constant
param€ter problem. In addition, we can more easily explore some of the

asymptotic properties of tine varying parameter estimators.

Thus, the stability of is again only a sufficient condition for the
boundness of the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients.
Whether one should consider unstable transition matrices would appear to

depend on the properties of the inputs (the xt), because the observability
of the system will depend upon these properties. If the system is observable
then it is not clear that one should attach too much importance to the

consistency property. In such instances, it seems that it is more inortant
to worry about whether an estitor is efficient. Cooley and Prescott [1972]
have shn that estimators with = I will be efficient.
The inability of the filter to produce consistent paremster estimates

5. SuirmEry and Conclusions

In the foregoing sections we have used the equivalence of the concepts

of observability in control theory and information in statistics to
establish the conditions for the identifiability of time varying structures in econometrics. Our intent has been to shed further light on
the properties of time varying parameter estimation methods that have

been introduced into econometrics in recent years. Several interesting
albit possibly obvious, conclusions emerge; the requirements for

identification in time varying riodels are not in principle irore stringent
than in the classical constant parameter case and may be less so because

of the additional structte imposed on the problem. The identifiability
criteria arid the asymptotic properties of the estimators suggest that it
may not always make sense to consider processes with unstable transition

structures. This latter caveat is not completely clear, however, because we
have concentrated throughout on sufficient conditions for identification.

Finally, the estimators for models subject to stochastic parameter varia-

tion will not be consistent in the usual sense. It has been shown, however,
that a sufficient condition for them to have stable asymptotic distribu—

tioris is that the transition matrix be stable (have eigenvalues within
the unit circle). It should be noted that in the econometric environment
where all observed data is to be processed "off-line" (i.e. in batch imde),
it is always possible to verify the conditions for observabiity and
controllability.

In

been

assumed throughout that , is known. It should be obvious that there

is a deeper issue of identifiability that should be dealt with and
that is the identifiability of when it is unknown as it is in most
applications. This is indeed a more complex problem which requires

further investigation. It appears at the present tine that a fruitful
approach to the problem is to concentrate on the connection between
