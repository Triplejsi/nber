Introduction and Sunmarv

This paper deals with the links between the
and

development

of new drugs,

particularly of innovative new drugs, and the international activities

of U.S. drug companies. While U.S. drug companies have developed new
production processes--the most notable being the fermentation process for

making penicillin——we concentrate in this paper on new products. Since pro1
duction costs comprise less than LQ percent of the selling price of drugs

and since the person choosing the drug rarely pays for it,2 growth in company
sales and

profits

costs and

prices

comes more from introducing new products than from cutting

of old products.3

The main novelty of our

study

is our examination of "innovative" as

contrasted with "imitative" new drugs. Previous studies have generally
focussed on the total number of new drugs produced each year, but since

1For example, in 1973 materials and production costs were 36 percent

of Merck's sales of $1.1 billion. Marketing and administrative expenses
comprised 29 percent, research and development expenses were 8 percent, and

profits before taxes were 28 percent of sales. Merck g Co. 1973 Annual
Report. Materials arid production costs were 3L percent of Miles' 1973 sales

of $348 miflion. Miles Laboratories 1973 Annual Report. As discussed in
Section III, Merck is a very "innovative" drug company, and Miles is a

is in the causes and consequences of innovation, we have con-

centrated on the products we have rated as innovative. Section I explains
our criteria for this distinction and presents our enumeration of the innovative new drugs for each of the 22 companies in our sample from 1963 through
1972.

In Section II we discuss trends in the rate of drug innovation and the

factors influencing those trends. We conclude that while the 1962 changes
in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act did produce an increase in research costs,

there were other influences acting in the same direction, particularly the

I. Input and Output Measures of the Flow

of Innovation

Any manufacturing firm can be thought of as producing goods of at

least

two

and on

different

kinds: on the one

the other hand,

a

hand, a specific industrial commodity,

flow of minor and

major

innovations which eventually

find their way into the product turned out by the firm or into the produc-

tion process used for such p'poses. This flow

of innovations can be

looked at both in terms of the resources its gestation actually absorbs
or, alternatively, in terms of the specific units of output which emerge

the

from

knowledge-creation section of the firm.1

1The lack of an explicit department engaged in RCD

activities is not

evidence on which to argue that any given firm does not produce any
new knowledge. A great deal of knowledge new to the firm, and subsequent
enough

minor and/or major technological changes at the plant level, emerge either
as

a by—product of production, or as a consequence of technical activities

performed by the engineering sections of the firm which normally receive
names

such as 'Trouble-shooting' or 'Technical assistance to production'

departments. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that a large fraction of
the observed total factor productivity growth of any given plant has to do
precisely

with the application of incremental knowledge coming from

such

sources. See, in this respect: S. 1-lollander, The Sources of Increased

Efficiency. A Study of the Dupont Rayon Plants (Cambridge, 1966; MIT University

in

Pres3); R. Shishko, "Technological Change Through Product Improvement

in the context of the pharmaceutical industry might be:

(1) Number of compounds synthesized, (2) Number of new product candidates,
(3) Patents filed, (4) Written scientific monographs, (5) NDA's (Ne.' Drug

Applications), (6) IND's (Investigative new drug applications), (7) Sales

Conceptual and statistical

field

difficulties in empirical research in this

are: a) Where to draw the line between R&D activities and those

other knowledge-creation activities also performed by the firm1 and b) How
to take into account quality changes which obtain with the passage of time?
The first of these set of problems is associated with input measures of
innovation,

the second set with output

measures. Let us briefly exanine

• some of these problems.

1Surveys on contemporary R&D expenditures in the U.S. and in Eupe
• are currently carried out by NSF and OECD respectively. The instruction
manuals distributed by both agencies indicating what and how to measure as
R&D expenditt'e are far from being conclusive concerning the so-called

"Associated Technical Activities" also performed by the firm. See, for
example,

NSF, a) Research and

Development in Industry (Washington: U.S.

Government Printing Office, June 1968), in particular p. 125 with the
instructions for R&D measurement; b) OECD, Proposed Standard Practice

for Surveys

of R&D, Doc. DAS/PD/62.47, Paris, 1966.

Besides carrying out explicit R&D activities, manufacturing firms

also

perform other technical jobs such as: process development arid pilot

plant production, quality control, clinical evaluation, research and development carried out with the purpose of assisting other areas of the firm

such

as patenting, medical informnatio, etc. The accounting treatment of expenditures in these activities varies widely among pharmaceutical firms. It
'therefore follows that inter-firm differences in R&D expenditure should be

expected and that such data should be handled in a cautious way. The recent
study by the National Economic Development office (NEDO) on the British

pharmaceutical industry presented valuable information on this respect. It
shows that

. .the majority of clinical evaluation was invariably included

in R&D and the majority of quality contl was excluded."' Such uniform
practice, however, was not found to prevail in relation to process develop-

ment and pilot plant production. "Thus, the only really significant variation in accounting practices appears to relate to process development and
pilot plant production. .

. exclusion which could possibly lead a company to

understate its R&D expenditure by as much as 15%.t,2

Moreover, quality considerations are difficult to incorporate when

dealing with input measures of the flow of innovation. Presumably we
could speak of R&D personnel of various different levels and abilities
and about scientists of different calibre, but the economists' tool-box
is still poorly furnished to handle questions of this sort. SurrE'narizing,

test, while yet other firms buy from third parties a great deal of the

be the result of internal R&D activities, but can also be the outcome of
license, thus not being a true indicator of internal knowledge-creation

processes. On the other hand, quality differentials among

products, patents,

scientific papers, etc., are clearly present, making it a rather

this market,

inter-firm

differences in the number of new products brought

to the market might not be a good 'proxy' variable either.

There were large inter-firm differences in the propensity to patent,
with size and nationality appearing as the principal determinants of these
differences.2 Thus, also the number of patents filed by each company should
be

used in a very cautious way as a 'proxy' for the firms' innovative

D. Reekie has recently shown that "Continental and particularly

The new drugs listed in the de Haen sources have been analyzed to

determine if they are innovative or novel products, or if they are imita-

of

through

pre-existing entities already marketed. Innovation has been assessed
an examination of both the pharmacologic action and the chemical

class or structure of the drug. Thus,

the diuretic ethacrynic acid (Edecrin,

Merck, 1967), a new chemical entity, is

classified as innovative because it

acts

on the kidney differently from

the diuretic chiorothiazide (Diuril,

Merck, 1957) even though it produces the same fundamental result, diuresis.
Modifications of pre-existing structures (additions or deletions of

chemical

groups), although marketed as

sarily considered as innovative by

often

new chemical entities, are iot neces-

these criteria. These modifications

enhance a drug's pharmacologic action and therapeutic effectiveness

while decreasing undesired side effects. However, the modified structure
is considered imitative of the original drug if it exerts the same basic

phrmaco1ogic effect and is marketed for the same therapeutic purpose.
For

example, cyclothiazide (Anhydron, Lilly, 1963),

although

a new potent

thiazide—type diuretic, is nevertheless similar in its chemical structure

There are some cases, however, in which pharmacologic innovation can

For exariple,

methotrimeprazine (Levoprone, Lederle, 1966) is a drug similar in structure

and effects to other tranquilizers of the henothiazine

chlorprorrtazine
analgesic

class, such as

(Thorazine, Smith Kline and French, 19514). However, the

properties

that are present to a negligible degree in Thorazine

are greatly increased in Levoprome. Therefore, although of the same chemical

II. Trends

in Pharmaceutical Innovation

Two kinds of observations are

available

for studying drug innovations

and their relation to foreign investment: time series on new products, or
on various types of new products, and cross-sections of pharmaceutical
firms, some of which are active innovators and some of which are responsible

for few, if any, innovations. In this section we discuss the main trends
in the rate of pharmaceutical innovation.

We

shall concentrate here on three types of new products emerging

from drug firms. They are: a) New Single Chemical Entities, b) Duplicate

Products, and c) Combinations. The first item

Both Table 11-1 and Chart ]. provide a distinct impression of a 1ong-ter

tailing off in the rate of new product introduction. This trend is certainly
present in all the series, but is more dramatic in Combinations than in
Single Entities. There appears to be a long-term relative shift away from
Combinations. Thus, we can observe both an absolute fall in the rate of

ni product introductions and a change in relative composition within the
aggregate.

There is another sense in which the aggregate series for new product

is related to the rate of product innovation in specific therapeutic

classes. In many therapeutic areas in which well established arid useful
agents were already marketed, innovation practically dried up in the 1960's.
Comparing the nurr.ber of new drugs introduced in the U.S. in 1957-1962 with

963-1967, one finds a marked

decline for nine categories

(antihistamines,

antitussives, aritispasmodics, muscle relaxants/antiparkinson drugs, thiazidetype diuretics, sulfonamide antibacterials, aritiobesity drugs, corticosteroids,

A similar view is expressed by de Haen. "...traditional methods in new
drug development seem to be impeded and less fruitful....we have reached
a temporary plateau of knowledge in new drug development because so much
has been made in the short span of 30 years."2

A prominent escalation of product research and development costs, b) A

of an eventual exhaustion of an industry's inventive potential-—which in his
view obtains when the industry's techniques aptroach a certain plateau of
perfection——which in turn leads to a retardation of the rate of technical
progress and, eventually, to a tendency for output to describe an S-shaped
curve

through

time.

He called that the Law of Industrial Growth. See, S.

W.E.G. Salter in his Productivity arid Technical

There

that rising U.S. costs of drug development and

affected by such regulations. After studying the British

case, Cooper finds that:

"Since 1951 a six-fold increase in expenditure has

The

European scene in general shows pretty much a similar trend. Data

recently published by Paul de Hacn indicate that: "Marketing of newly

an

eleven-year period. For the period 1960-1965 marketing of 521 drugs

has been recorded, and for the period 1966-1971 only 3 drugs have been

R&D resources are

gradually

being reallocated away from the U.S. and brought

into operation elsewhere, particularly in the UK, France, Germany and Italy.1

The available evidence indicates an upward trend in drug deveLpment
times. At the end of the 1950's, the time span from the selection of

a

product candidate to the filing for regulatory approval was estimated at
about

two

years. By the middle 1960's, this same period had gone up to

about four years, and

frequently used by the industry as an indicator for risk and uncertainty.

While some companies will probably increase their efforts at the marketing
end of the spectrum, reducing their cormnitments to basic research, other
companies will do just the opposite and invest more heavily in more basic
research.1

Some companies might try

to

compensate for their inability to

gri thxvugh new product introductions in the U.S. market by giving priority
to foreign markets, or to industrial diversification. One specifip aspect
of these behavioral differences is to he explored later on in Section IV
of this paper, where :e shall try

As discussed in Section I, our sample consists of 22 U.S. drug

The main characteristics of these 22 companies are described in Table 111-1.
We use as a measure of company size in this industry total U.S. drug sales.
Total U.S. sales of the parent company are included on the possibility that
investment behavior is related to the size of the firm as a whole. The

as a possible alternative or supplement to R&D investment as a

source of sales.

Our use of 1972 sales of new or innovative drugs might be thought to

bias this measre against companies that developed drugs early in our period,
if the use of these drugs had run its course by 1972. Table 111-2 tests
this possibility by comparing 1972 sales for drugs introduced at different

dates. If there is any bias, rather than only chance variation or the
results of a rise in the cost of successful innovation, it seems to be in

the opposite direction. It is the earliest years' innovations that may be
disproportionately represented in 1972 sales.

measures, R&D expenditures and personnel per dollar of new drug sales, are,

possibly, indicators of the efficiency of the R&D effort, or the extent to
which it is aimed at objectives other than innovation or riew.drug production.

- other measures.
With one exception, the ratio of single entities to all new drugs,
the indicators we describe as measuring innovativeness, and the average
ranking of these indicators, vary appropriately with our preferred measure.
*

The firms that are most innovative by that standard are innovative by the
other standards also. The indicators of R&D effort, on the other hand,
show very little relation to the production of innovative drugs. The drug
quality measures, also with one exception, are positively related to innova-

tiveness, as is efficiency. That is, the least innovative cc*panies spent
the most per dollar of new drug sales. Size of firm varied directly with
innovativeness, quality of new drugs introduced, and R&D efficiency.

Of course, these figures and

the

description of the companies is based

on the assumption that R&D has as its only purpose the development of new

or innovative drugs. Since the firms may have other objectives of R&D in
mind (safety, quality, dosage reduction, process improvements, development

of non-prescription drugs), what appears here as inefficiency or lack of
innovativeness may really reflect a smaller interest in innovation and a
concentration on other objectives.

IV. Impact of New Drugs on Foreign Investment

As an innovative drug for a rare disease may be less important to a
company than an innovative drug for a common disease, w

weight each drug

by its 1972 sales in the U.S. Lack of data precludes our looking at sales
in the U.S. prior to 1972. Although cons'ptior. of specific drugs and types
of drugs differs considerably among countries of

similar cliTr.ate and per

capita income,1 lack of data also precludes our looking at foreign sales

of specific drugs.
The empirical work on multinational firms

.haz stressed differences

among industries. Vernon, for example, allocated his 187 multinational
firms among 23 industries and found that

of the entire industry ranged from

their importance in the 1966 sales

85 percent (motor vehicles and equipment)

to

4 percent (pDirting and publishing); the 15 multinational drug firms in

his

sample acounted for 77 percent of all sales in 1966 by U.S. drug com-

panies.2 He ex:ilained these differences by arguing that in comparison with

other firms the multinational firms are "of extraordinary size and high

profitability, corritted to activities that involve the relatively
use of skilled manpower and of

heavy

advertising outlays."3 The pharmaceutical

above the three percent of sales of Vernon's 187 multinational firms.

Preliminary

analysis showed that the Latin American experience was so

that

of the rest of the world that one obtained no signifi-

by using combined data. One might expect that result by looking

at Table IV-l. Latin America has 35 percent of the manufacturing
aries and has more than all of Europe, even though Western Europe

subsidihas a

higher per capita income and a larger population.1 So throughout the regression analysis we report results separately for Latin America and for the
rest of the world.

It is conceivable that total corporate sales might influence a drug

company's propensity to establish foreign drug plants. For example,
Lederle and A.

Robins each had about $100 million of U.S. drug sales

in 1972, but Lederle is part

of

American Cyanarnid, which had worldwide

sales in 1972 of $l.L billion. Lederle may acquire from its parent corporation knowledge about foreign investment opportunities.

are superior arid are both significant at the 1 percent level. The logarithmic regression using the share of innovative drugs is somewhat superior
to the one using the share of new drugs--column (5) as compared to column
(k) of Table IV-8--in terms of

(.52 versus .e2). Throughout the analysis

the coefficients for the importance of new drugs arid the importance of

innovative drugs have been negative, but their significance levels have not

leen overwhelming. In the regressions shown in column (5) of Table IV-8,
the coefficients of the independent variables are different from zero at

the following levels of significance: size of firm—-i percent, importance
of innovative drugs--15 percent, importance

of

antibiatics—-9 percent.

With this sample size, the large degree of multicollinearity (see Table IV-9)
