Abstract: "A Beta—Logistic Model for the Analysis of Sequential Labor
Force Participation by Married Women"

by

In this paper, we discuss statistical problems

that

arise in studying

sequences of quantal responses (e.g., labor force participation) in panel

data on heterogeneous populations (i.e., populations in which there is unobserved

variation in response probabilities). Assuming that response probabilities
are governed by a beta distribution, we derive a generalization of the cross—
section logit model to enable it to deal with sequences of discrete events in

panel data. This model is applied to panel data on labor force participation
of married women. One of our findings is that the distribution of participation
probabilities is U—shaped, indicating that most women have participation
probabilities near zero or one.

1

INTRODUCTION

Many

important

aspects of household behavior involve choices among

discrete alternatives or decisions that lead to discrete outcomes. Recognition of this fact has recently led to a considerable development of
statistical models appropriate to the analysis of such "quantal response"

problems in cross section data.1 Quantal response problems also arise in
the study of life cycle behavior with panel data. The timing or time path
of discrete events or decisions such as school leaving, labor force participation, migration, marriage, divorce, births and death provide examples

of such problems. In this paper we argue that statistical models appropriate
in the analysis of quantal response problems in cross section data are less

useful in the analysis of panel data. We generalize the cross—section logit
model to enable it to deal with sequences of discrete events in panel data.

Our model is then applied to panel data on the labor force participation
of married women.

The basic reason that the conventional logit model is misleading in the
analysis of panel data stems from the so—called 'mover—stayer" or "hetero-

geneity" problem. In a pioneering paper, Blumen, Kogan and McCarthy (1955)
found that the conditional probability that a "representative" individual
moves from a given occupation decreases with the length of time he has stayed

in the occupation. They also found that individuals who changed occupations
most frequently in the past were more likely to change in the future. One
explanation for this phenomenon is that the population is heterogeneous in
the sense that some individuals have persistently higher propensities to

change occupation than do others. That is, some individuals are "movers"

2

and others are "stayers". As time passes, stayers tend to become a larger
fraction of the sample remaining in a given occupation. Hence, a group's
conditional probability of changing occupations appears to decline with
duration of stay even if each individual's transition probability is con-

stant. Similar patterns are observed in data on the monthly probability
of conception, marital instability, geographic mobility and other types of
sequential quantal response.

Statistical models such as the logit model that may be appropriate
for the analysis of quantal response problems on cross—section data are

less appropriate in an analysis of sequential responses in panel data
from heterogeneous populations. We demonstrate below that the reason for
this inadequacy is that the conventional logit model estimates parameters
that generate the mean response probability conditional on the values of
exogenous variables, but gives no information about the higher moments of

the distribution of probabilities among individuals in the sample. Under
the heterogeneity hypothesis, however, it is the higher moments of the distribution of response probabilities that provide the observed patterns of
sequential response.

In this paper, we extend the conventional logit model to deal with
quantal response problems in panel data from heterogeneous populations and
apply our model to data on sequential labor force participation of married

women. Our interest in applying the model to labor force participation was
stimulated by Ben—Porath's (1973) observation that cross—section estimates
of labor force participation functions are inherently ambiguous with respect
to their implication for lifetime attachment to the labor force because a
sample mean conveys no information on higher moments of distribution.

3

Consider the following example, due to Ben-Porath. Suppose that a
group of women are found to have an average yearly participation rate of

50 percent. At one extreme, this might be interpreted to imply that each
woman in a homogeneous population has a 50 percent chance of being in the
labor force in any given year, while at the other extreme, it might imply
that 50 percent of the women in a heterogeneous population always work and

50 percent never work. In the first case, each woman would be expected to
spend half of her married life in the labor force and half out of the labor
force and job turnover would be expected to be frequent, with an average job

duration of two years. In the second case, there is no turnover and current
information about work status is a perfect predictor of future work status.
There are, of course, an infinite number of intermediate possible interpretations of the cross—section participation rate.
In addition to their different implications for life cycle labor supply,
these two extreme interpretations have different implications for other aspects

of life cycle behavior as well. For example, in the homogeneous case, married
women and their employers have lower incentives to invest in human capital,

both general and specific, than men because of high job turnover and a smaller
amount of time in the labor force over the life cycle to capture returns on

investments. As the average level of female participation rises, investment
incentives increase. In the second case, however, the investment incentives
of married women who work are identical to those of men.

If such

women can distinguish themselves to prospective employers, their wages should

be identical to those of men. Growth in average participation rates simply
increases the fraction of women who have these incentives. Put differently,

4

relationships estimated on aggregated cross—section data for the Marshalijan
"representitive (or average) women" will have no relationship to the true
relationship for every individual in the case of a heterogeneous population

but may closely reflect the true relationship for all women in the case of a
homogeneous population.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section I, a simple model of
sequential labor force participation is presented. In Section II we show
that heterogeneity among women arises if there are unobserved permanent components that affect the probabilities of participation and which persist

through time. The implications of these sources of heterogeneity for the
distribution of participation probabilities and for observed patterns of

sequential participation are explored. In Section III, we assume that participation probabilities are governed by a beta distribution. Under a
plausible parameterization of this distribution, we derive a likelihood
function for sequential participation which reduces to the likelihood function of the conventional logit model in the case of cross—section

data. For this reason, we call our model a "beta—logistic model". Empirical estimates of the labor force participation model are presented and

analyzed in Section IV. Some remarks on the limitations of the beta—logistic model and a summary conclude the paper.

I. A Model of Sequential Labor Force Participation.

Labor force participation decisions are one aspect of the more general
problem of household allocation of time among competing market and non—

market uses (Becker, 1965). In each year of marriage, a woman must choose
how much time to allocate to market work and how much to allocate to house-

work, child care, leisure and other nonmarket uses. These time allocation
decisions are the outcome of the household's attempt to maximize a well—

behaved lifetime utility function defined for its time and goods consumption
constraints (see, e.g., Heckman, 1974, and Ghez and Becker, 1975).

Given the assumption of maximizing behavior, the supply of labor for
each household member may be derived as a function of the household's prices,

wages, assets and other constraints. In particular, for horizon T an optimal
time path for the wife's hours of labor, h ,

t = l,...,T is associated with

the constrained utility maximization. The wife's optimal sequence of labor
force participation may be represented as the binary variable, y, where

*

[1

if h*>O
(1)

if h=O

Following conventional labor supply theory, a woman's labor force participation decision in year t depends on a comparison of the marginal bene-

fit and marginal cost of taking a job. Marginal benefit of an hour of work

is measured by the woman's market wage, w. The marginal opportunity cost
of the first hour of work is measured by the woman's shadow price of time,

6

*

*

evaluated at zero hours of work. Put differently, w is equal to the
subjective marginal rate of substitution between the woman's nonmarket time
and market goods when the woman spends all of her time in nonniarket activities;

If w exceeds w, the woman will take a job and if w exceeds

she will

stay out of the labor force. Hence, we may express the optimal labor force
participation sequence as

*

*

where S(.1=

If we could observe both w and w, equation (2) could be tested directly. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The shadow price of time cannot be
observed and the market wage cannot be observed for women who do not work.
While it is possible to utilize sample information on working and non—working

women to form consistent estimates of functions determing w and w (see Heck—
man, 1974), we shall pursue a simpler "reduced form" approach by deriving a
labor force participation function in terms of observable variables and Un—

observed components that determine w and w.
The market wage a woman may command depends on many variables including
education, training, intelligence, motivation, local labor market conditions

and chance events. In a given body of data, let us assume that we observe
for the ith woman in year t a subset of these variables designated by the

vector z and that the remaining unobserved variables and chance events

7

contribute a percentage amount

to the woman's wage. We may then write her

wage function as

in w =

f(zi)

÷

nit.

(3)

A shadow price of time function is associated with the household's. con-

strained utility maximum. Thus, w may be written as a function of household
parameters such as assets, the husband's wage rate, market prices of goods,

the rate of interest, and expected values of future wage and prices. It is
also a function of other constraints reflecting past choices and chance events
including the number and age of children, etc.. Again, some of these variables
can be observed, but others, especially those reflecting a given household's

tastes, technology or expectations about the future are not observed. Thus,
in analogy with the market wage function, we shall write the shadow price
function of the ith woman in year t as

ln w =

g(z) +

contribution to the shadow price of unobserved variables and chance events.

The unobserved component St may be viewed as a random index function, so
that the probability that a woman worker works in year t is

may be written as the ].ogit function

Similarly, we may think of the sequence of unobserved components S1, S2,..

a sequence of random index functions. For example, the probability

that a woman works for three years may be written as

Pr(y = 1, y2 = 1, y3 = 1) = Pr(xj8 >S1, * '> S2. x8 > S3).

(9)

If we assume that the S(t=l,2,3) are independently and identically distributed, then equation (9) may be written as

Pr(y1 =

Pr(x S1)Pr(x

(10)

Assuming that the St are independently, identically logistically distributed, (10) may be expressed simply as the product of three independent

logit functions. The parameters of these functions, the vector ,
estimated by maximum

likelihood

could be

methods from a single year of labor force

participation data. The predicted probability of working in each of the
three years would then be estimated by using the values of the x in each
year to evaluate (1 + eCt)l. If these probabilities are w1, it2 and

then

the probability of working in all three years is l23 The predicted probabilities of other possible participation paths are, of course, equally easy
to compute.

10

II. Heterogeneity and Its Implications

The assumption that the random indices S1, S2,... are statistically
independent makes little sense on theoretical grounds and implies patterns
of labor force participation that are dramatically different from observed

patterns. Turning first to empirical evidence, consider some data on labor
force participation paths for two years, 1967 and 1968, for a group of 1583

married women from the University of Michigan Panel Study of Income
Dynamics.2 In 1967, 41 percent of the women participated in the market.
Assuming independence, we would expect that (.41)2 = .168 of the women would
work in both 1967 and 1968 while, in the sample, 35 percent worked both

years. Similarly, assuming independence, we would expect (•59)2 = 0.348
of the women would not work in either year while, in the sample, 50 per cent

did not work in either year. Looking at these results another way, the
conditional probability of working in 1968 was 0.86 for those who worked
in 1967 and 0.15 for those who did not work in 1967, in contrast to a
probability of 0.41 that would be expected for both groups under the
independence assumption.

One possible explanation for the discrepancy between predicted and
observed behavior in this example is that our theoretical model of labor
force participation fails to specify the appropriate stochastic process

followed by each individual. For instance, the evidence that conditional
probabilities of work in 1968 depend on work status in 1967 might suggest
that each person in the sample follows a two—state Markov chain with transition

probabilities given by the observed conditional frequencies. While we cannot
rule out the possibility that individuals follow a stochastic process involving

11

state dependendence, we pursue another approach in which individual transition probabilities are independent of initial state but aggregate transi—
3

tion probabilities are state dependent.

It is not plausible to assume that the random index functions S1, S2,...

are independent. Recall that the S measure the impact on a woman's market
wage and shadow price of time of unobserved variables, as well as chance

events. It is reasonable to suppose that many of these unobserved variables
remain reasonably constant over time, but differ considerably among women.

For instance, among the factors determining a woman's market wage, variables
such as ability, motivation and labor market structure are likely to be

unmeasured and to remain essentially unchanged over time. Similarly, unmeasured factors which affect the shadow price of time such as the household's
wealth, its preference function and household technology tend to remain stable

over time. This implies that random sequence S1, S2,... will tend to be serially correlated rather than independent.

Following a convention in the analysis of covariance, we decompose the

S for the ith woman in year t

into

a "permanent component," , and a "trans-

itory component," U1. Thus, let

Sti = Ut1

(11)

where U is a random variable with mean zero and variance

Thus St is a random variable with mean

Thus, the correlation coefficient between the S in any two

If intercorrelation caused by persistent unobserved variables is
present, the probability that a woman works for three years cannot be
written as the product of the probabilities that she works in each year,
as it was in (9). However, conditional, on a given value of the permanent

We are now in a position to investigate the implications of serial

assume that we observe a sample of women in a stationary environment in

One implication of correlation in the random sequence S1, Si,... due
to unobserved components is that participation probabilities differ among

women who are homogeneous in terms of their observed characteristics. To
see this, consider a sample of women who are observationally identical in
the sense that they share a common value of the vector of observed exogene—
ous variables, say, x =

x.

The probability density function of participa—

tin probabilities in the sample, f(Tr), may be written:

First

consider the implications for the distribution of participation

probabilities in the two extreme cases of zero and perfect serial correla-

tion. Recall that the serial correlation coefficient is p =

independent, each woman in the sample has an identical

probability of participation in each year. At the other extreme, if there
are only permanent differences among women (i.e.

In this case, the fraction of women for whom x$ —

0 will never work.

We call populations characterized by zero serial correlation "homogene
ous" because, conditional on the observed characteristics measured by x, all

women in such populations have identical participation probabilities. In
effect, the only source of variation in participation for women in a homogeneous population is caused by transitory shifts in their budget constraints or
indifferences curves measured by

Populations in which p

is greater

than zero will be called "heterogeneous" because participation probabilities

differ among women who are observationally identical. As we have seen, perfect
serial correlation implies an extreme form of heterogeneity in which individual

women have either zero or unitary participation probabilities. In this case,
although each household's indifference curves and budget contraint remain
perfectly stable over time, there are unobserved differences in preferences

or constraints among observationally identical households. The correlation
coefficient is a measure of the relative importance of unmeasured permanent
and transitory differences in preferences and constraints among households.

In the general case, the distribution of probabilities depends on the

relative size of transitory variance (a) to the permanent component (a),

and on the value of 3. In the appendix, we demonstrate that if
(p <

1/2),

the density of the population probabilities is a unimodal distri-

bution while it is' "U shaped" if a < a

is uniform over the unit

interval.

These cases are illustrated in Figure 1,

which graphs the density of probabilities against the probability for the

special case of x = 0.
We have shown that an observationally homogeneous group of women will
be heterogeneous in labor force participation probabilities if there are
wage unmeasured permanent differences among these women in either market

wage rates or shadow prices of time. The distribution of participation probabilities depends on the relative importance of variation in permanent and

transitory components as measured by p, the relative importance of transitory
and permanent factors as measured by the serial correlation coefficient of

We now investigate the implications of heterogeneity for the

observed time path of labor force participation.
In a heterogeneous population, it is important to distinguish a model

of the behavior of individuals from a model of the average behavior of a

group of individuals. For Instance, our model of labor force participation
behavior implies that the probability that a woman works in a given year is

independent of her prior work experience. However, In a heterogeneous (but
observationally identical) group of women, average behavior appears to con-

tradict this model. In a heterogeneous population the conditional probability
of remaining in a given state tends to increase, the longer the group has been
in that state.5 Thus, the conditional probability that a "representativet'

woman works appears in increase the longer she continues working. Similarly,
the longer a representative woman has been Out of the labor force, the more

likely she is to stay out in a given year. A corollary of rising conditional

probabilities of remaining in a given state is apparent state dependence

of participation probabilities. That is, of otherwise identical women,

those women who worked in year t—l are more likely to work in year t
than are those women who did not work in year

The reason for the apparent contradiction between individual and average

behavior in a heterogeneous population is due to a selection process. As
time goes on, the women who have the highest (lowest) participation probabili-

ties are most likely to be found in the subsample of continuous workers (non—

workers). Accordingly, as the sample composition of the group of working
women changes, the conditional probability of participation (nonparticipation)

appears to rise. Similarly, apparent state dependence in participation probabilities arises because the probability that an "average" individual will

occupy a given state depends on his transition probability. Note that the
line of causation here is just the reverse of that postulated in Markov chain
models in which the transition probability is assumed to depend on the state
an individual occupies.7

18

The Beta—Logistic Model

III.

One way to deal with heterogeneity empirically is to assume a
functional form for the distribution of participation probabilities
and estimate the parameters of this distribution from panel data.8
The beta distribution with the probability density function

where

f a_l(l_)b_ld = r(a)r(b)

(23)

an attractive choice of functional form for several reasons.9 First, as is

appropriate for a distribution of probabilities, the range of the beta
distribution lies in the unit

interval.

The apparent state dependence

induced by heterogeneity may be seen by comparing the conditional probability

women who did not work in t—l:

holding a/(a+b) constant) to unity under extreme heterogeneity

(i.e. ci2 + 0

as a,b + 0

holding a/(a+b) constant). It uiay also be

shown that the conditional probability of working rises as the duration

of time in the labor force increases. Thus,

Pr(y=lIyi=l

p(yt—l, nt—l)

=

a+t—l

a+b+t—l

(28)

which is a positive monotonic function of t that approaches unity as t
approaches infinity. A similar expression may be derived showing that
the conditional probability of not working increases with the duration of
time out of the labor force.
The model of equation (24) would be appropriate if the only factors
causing differences in labor force participation among women were unobserved.

However, we argue that the theory of labor supply suggests that
a number of variables such as wife's education, the number and ages of
children, husband's income influence participation and are typically observable.
If there were a limited number of such variables, it would be possible to
partition a sample to allow separate estimation of the parameters of the
distribution of participation probabilities for groups of women with different

values of the exogenous variables. However, if there are many exogenous

21

variables or many values of a given set of variables, partitioning may be impractical.

An alternative approach that we pursue here is o postulate that

the parameters a and b are functions of the vector of exogenous
variable, x, as follows:

a=e
b=ex'B

xt ct

(29)

where c and 8 are column vectors of coefficients. This parameterization
assures the non—negativity of a and b, as is required in (22).
The mean probability of participation, obtained by substituting (29) into
(25), is

E[p(14)] =

e+ eX' 1+ —x'(a—8)

(30)

Note the (30) is nothing more than a logit function with coefficient

vector y= —8 .

With cross—section data (i.e. data on participation for

only one year), 8 and ci.

cannot be identified separately. Hence, the

ordinary logit function can be used only to predict the mean participation

rate in a population conditional on the x's, but cannot determine the higher

moments of the distribution of participation probabilities. However, with
participation data on the same individuals for two or more

8 can be identified.

In this section, we present estimates of the model of sequential labor
force participation of married women presented in section I based on data

from the University of Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1968_1972)2
Our sample consists of 1583 white women who were continuously married to the

same husband during the five—year period of observation, 1967—1971. In
each year, we define a woman to have participated in the labor force if the
respondent answered affirmatively the question: "Did your wife do any work

for money last year?" This measure differs from the usual census in two
respects: (1) we treat women who experience only unemployment as nonparticipants
(2) the time frame is a year rather than the usual Census week.

Over the five—year period of observation, a woman may have followed any
of 32 (

2)

possible participation paths. Assuming that participation

probabilities among women follow a beta distribution, equation (24) in
Section III implies that the contribution to sample likelihood of a woman

who works j(0, 1, ..., 5) years and does not work k = n—j years (n1,. . . ,5) is

Given a vector of independent variables,

x', the coefficient vectors, c and ,

are

estimated by maximum likelihood.

The independent variables, their mean values and the estimated values
of c and

are presented in Table 1. Since the likelihood function in (31)

assumes that each individual has a constant participation probability over
time, the values of the independent variables pertain to 1967, the initial year

of observation. This is not a problem for variables such as education which

-23

remain constant over time, but is an undesirable restriction of the
model for time—varying variables such as income and the number and age of
children.

13

As discussed in Section I, we take a "reduced form" approach to the
estimation of the labor force participation function in terms

of

variables

that determine the market wage (w) and/or the shadow price of time ().

For

instance, the wife's education is known to be positively related to her market

wage, and therefore, is expected to have a positive effect on her probability

of labor force participation.'4 The presence of children, especially young
children, tends to increase the shadow price of time, thereby reducing the

participation probability. Similarly, increases in family income (excluding
wife's income) raises

and reduces partipation. Finally, the wage of unskilled

labor measures the cost of substitutes for the wife's housework and is expected
to have a negative effect on participation.

Maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficient vectors, o and ,

of

equation (31) together with associated asymptotic normal statistics are present-

ed in columns (2) and (3) of Table 1. Of the sixteen parameter estimates,
eleven are statistically significant at conventional levels (i.e., "t" >

1.9).

The only variable that fails to have any appreciable effect on participation

is husband's education. The other variables have effects on mean yearly participation in the hypothesized directions. To see this, recall that
are related to the parameters of the "cross—section" logistic function

coefficients associated with the th independent variable, x. These effects
are presented in column (4) of Table 1. As expected, wife's education has a
strong positive effect on participation while children (especially young
children), the county unskilled wage rate, and family income have negative
effects on participation.

The empirical results indicate the presence of a considerable hetero-

geneity. To show this, we evaluate the parameters of the beta distribution

e

using mean values of the exogeneous variables to conclude that a = eX

andb =

= 0.232

= 0.294 which Implies that the distribution of participation

probabilities for women with "average" characteristics Is U—shaped. That is,
in a hypothetical population with a mean participation rate of .44, relatively
few women have a probability, of participation near the mean. This conclusion
is essentially unaltered when we evaluate ai =
the I =

l,...,N women

eX1 and b eXi for each of

in the sample. About 96 percent of the women have values

of a and b less than unity. Thus, it appears that the distribution of participation probabilities is U—shaped for women of almost all socio—economic characteristics.

The total variance in participation probabilities across women in the sample is the sum of the variance in probabilities caused by differences in

25

measured characteristics and the variance caused by unmeasured permanent com-

ponents. To see this, let

The variance in the predicted probabilities, Var[E(rr)] = [E(ir.) — ir]2/N is

The variance of the unobserved component, Var(Vi) =

obtained from direct application of equation (26), is 0.1489. Hence, an estimated

for our model is

Var[E(ir

This

I)}

+ Var(v1)

= 0.097

implies that over ninety percent of the total variation in participation

probabilities in the sample is due to unmeasured permanent components. Put
differently, the empirical distribution of expected probabilities based on
measured characteristics is unimodal, with most women having expect probabilities

near the mean for all women. In contrast, as we have seen, the distribution
of actual participation probabilities, holding measured characteristics constant,
is U—Shaped.

26

The high degree of heterogeneity in participation probabilities that is

indicated by the small estimated values of the parameters a and b implies a
correspondingly high degree of selection of women into "working" and
"non—working" categories according to their participation probabilities.

Thus, the predicted conditional participation probability in year t of a
woman with average values of the exogenous variables who worked in year t—l
is (a + l)/(a + b +l)=0.82, while the conditional participation probability

of a woman who did not work in year t—l is a/(a + b ÷ 1) =

0.15.

These estimates imply that knowledge of a woman's current work status
is of considerable value in predicting the amount of time she is likely to

spend in the labor force in the future. For instance, the estimates imply
that a woman with average characteristics who is currently working will spend
about eight out of every ten years in the labor force while a woman who is

not currently working would be expected to spend only about one and one—half

years out of ten at work. The accuracy of such predictions can be checked
in the data for the four year period from 1968 to 1971 for women whose work

status is known in 1967. The predicted mean years of work during this period
for women who worked in 1967 is 4 x 0.81 =

3.24 years, and the actual average

years worked is 3.19. Of the women who did not work in 1967, the predicted
mean years worked is 4 x 0.15 =

0.60 years and the actual value is 0.89 years.

The fit of the estimated model may be examined by comparing the sample
frequencies of possible labor force participation paths from 1967 to 1971

with the predicted probability of each path both of which are presented in

Table 2. The actual frequencies are the numbers above each horizontal line.in the

For example, 36.6 percent of the women worked in 1967 and 1968, 26.9 percent

The mean and standard deviation (in

parentheses) of the predicted probabilities are presented below each horizontal line in the tree diagram.

Visual inspection of Table 2 suggests

fairly close agreement between actual and predicted participation probabilities, especially for continuous participation and continuous non-

participation. The latter probabilities, extracted from Table 2, are tabulated for convenience in Table 3..

However, on the basis of the chi—square

statistics presented in Table 4, the hypothesis that the observed participation
frequencies were generated by the beta—logistic model must be rejected for
all but the first year.

Another way of examining the fit of the model is to compare the predicted and actual distributions of years worked by women in the sample.

These distributions, based on information in Table 2, are presented in Table 5.
Both the predicted and actual distributions are concentrated in the continuous

work and continuous non—work categories with the remaining portion of
both distributions nearly uniformly distributed across one to four years

of work experience. Again, however, a chi—square test indicates that the
discrepancy between predicted and actual years worked is statistically
significant.

Both a priori considerations and evidence of systematic patterns in the
deviations between actual and predicted participation probabilities indicate
that the beta—logistic model fails to capture all the forces that generate the

observed pattern of sequential labor force participation. In the economic
theory of labor force participation presented earlier, we assumed that a woman
would work if her market wage exceeded her shadow price of time, and, otherwise,

that she would not work. This theory leads us to formulate the statistical
model of participation at the individual level as a Bernoulli process in which

the probability that a woman works in year t is independent of her labor
force status in the previous year.

It is more realistic to assume that there are transactions costs in
taking a job that result from the costs of search incurred by the job seeker

and fixed hiring costs incurred by the employer. To the extent that such
costs exist, the condition that the market wage exceed the shadow price of
time becomes a necessary but not sufficient condition for a woman who is out

of the labor force to take a job. In particular, the woman (and her prospective employers) must expect that the total benefits of taking the job

will exceed these fixed costs. This total condition is more likely to be
fulfilled, the greater Is the excess of the market wage above the shadow
price of time because, the greater the excess, the longer hours per year
and the greater number of years the woman will expect to work given that she

takes a job. Once a job has been taken, however, these fixed costs are
sunk and the condition for remaining on the job is simply that the market

29

wage exceeds the shadow price of time4

Hence,

the existence of trans-

actions costs leads us to expect that a given woman is more likely to participate in year t if she worked in year t—l than if she did not work in year

t—l. This, in turn, implies that there may exist true state dependence in
Individual labor force behavior in addition to the apparent state dependence
caused by selection in a heterogeneous population.

Although it is not easy to modify the beta—logistic model to allow
direct estimation of the extent of true state dependence, an informal test

for its presence is available. Let

be the predicted conditional

probability of working in year t + n given that a woman worked in year t.

Similarly, let q(n) be the predicted conditional probability that a woman

works in year t + n given that she did not work in year t. The predicted
n—step transition matrix is then

(n) =

It can be seen that, contrary to the constancy of

logistic model, the value of

decreases and the value of q increases

systematically as n increases.

One explanation for such a pattern is that the true process

at the individual level is Markovian rather than Bsrnoulli. If there

were no heterogeneity, the observed probabilities p = .859

than the empirical rates of change in

is symptomatic of heterogeneity in Markov chains (see Blumen,

Kogan and McCarthy, 1955 or Goodman, 1961) caused by the tendency of those
with high probabilities of entering a given state (i.e. work or not work)

being observed in that state in the initial period. The rates of change
of p

(n)

and q (n) are not significantly reduced when variation in individual

transition probabilities resulting from variations in observed independent
16

variables (i.e. the variables listed in Table 1) are taken into account.
Hence, it appears that the data on sequential labor force participation
reveal the coexistence of state dependence and heterogeneity caused by
unobserved permanent differences among women.

31

Concluding Remarks
The main lesson of this paper is that a complete study of quantal response
problems in panel data requires that explicit attention be given to the
distribution of response probabilities in a sample, not just the

mean response probability. Heterogeneity in responses will be present if
all sources of persistent variation in the determinants of behavior cannot

be held constant by the introduction of exogenous variables. Since exogenous

variables in cross—section studies typically "explain" only a small

fraction of the total variance in

behavior, it is

clear that there is plenty of

for individuals to be persistently different from one another. How-

scope

ever, it is obvious that "permanent" and "transitory" components of unex-

plained variance cannot be distinguished in a single cross—section. Hence,
it is neither necessary nor possible to deal with the entire distribution
of response probabilities in cross—section data; only the mean probability
is of interest.

In panel data, however, the existence of unobserved permanent components
of variance leads to serially correlated responses, a distribution of response
probabilities with positive variance, and associated phenomena such as apparent state dependence and apparent time trends in response probabilities.
In the paper, we assume that each individual has constant, state—independent
response probabilities over time and that the distribution of response prob-

abilities across individuals is a beta distribution. Given a particular
parameterization of the exogenous variables, this model teduces to a
conventioual univariate or multivariate logistic model in the case of

cross—section data. Accordingly, we have called this the beta—logistic
model.

32

In our empirical application of the model to panel data on labor force
participation by married women we found evidence of aonsiderable heterogeneity.

According to parameter estimates, the distribution of participation prob-

abilities is U—shaped. Thus, loosely speaking, there tend to be two groups
of women in the sample: "workers" whose participation probabilites are near
unity and "non—workers" whose participation probabilities are near zero.
Relatively few women in the sample have probabilities near the mean participation rate of 40 per cent.

In terms of the economic theory underlying the statistical model, this
finding implies that unexplained variation in the budget constraints and indifference curves of individual women displays a high degree of stability

over time. The empirical results also suggest that sample selection by
work status is an important phenomenon. Those women who are working in a given
year have a predicted participation probability of about .82 while those

who are not working have a predicted probability of .15. In effect, the
sample of currently working women is largely composed of "workers" and the

sample of non—working women is largely composed of "non—workers." An implication of this is that knowledge of current work status is of considerable
utility in predicting a woman's future labor force behavior.
Certain limitations of the beta—logistic model should be recognized
explicitly in judging our empirical results, their implications, and the
usefulness of the model in analyzing other types of quantal response problems.
The two most important limitations are 1) the assumption that individual
reponse probabilities are constant through time and 2) that response probabilities
are independent of the current or past states occupied by an individual.

33

Clearly, in the case of labor force participation, some of the significant

determinants of participation such as number and age of children, family

income and so on do, in fact, vary over time. The beta—logistic model does
not allow for the effects of such variation and is, therefore, misspecified.
Analysis of the participation data also suggests the existence of true state
dependence in addition to apparent state dependence caused by heterogeneity.
Again, this indicates that the beta—logistic model is not a completely cor-

rect specification of the stochastic process generating the data. Despite
these limitations, the empirical fit of the model appears to be quite good.
Thus, we have some confidence that a major component of observed variation
in sequential labor force participation rates is the result of heterogeneity.

Given the result that conditional probabilities of remaining in a given

state increase, the proof of this proposition is quite simple. In an observa—
tionally homogeneous group of women with a constant xt, the average probability
of participation in year t—l is

If they are, an appropriate model might be, say, a Markov chain in which

individuals have different transition probabilities. Stayer—mover models
originated by Blumen, Kogan and McCarthy (1955) and elaborated by Goodman
(1961) Spillernian (1972) and others represent attempts to deal with hetero-

geneity in Markov chains. Apparently, however, these writers have not
noticed that the iarkovian (i.e., state dependent) appearance of their data
may itself arise from heterogeneity.

37

8 alternative method pursued in Heckman and Willis (1975) is to assume,
as we did for illustrative purposes in the previous section of this paper, that

U and c are normally distributed. In this approach, the probability of a
sequence of events is represented as a bivariate normal distribution with a con-

stant correlation coefficient p =

+

o2).

9The beta distribution is widely used as a "mixing distribution". (See,
for example, Johnson and Kotz, 1969, pp. 78—79 and Sheps and Menken, 1973.)

'°It is important to emphasize, however, that if U and c are assumed to
be normally distributed the resulting distribution of participation probabilities

is not a beta distribution. (See the Appendix for a derivation of the distrib-

ution under these assumptions.) Thus, if the assumption that U and

are

normally distributed is maintained, the beta distribution may be regarded as an

approximation to the true distribution of participation probabilities. Alter-

natively, it may be assumed that the distribution of U and c are such as to
lead to a beta distribution of participation probabilities. Unfortunately, we

have been unable to find functional forms for the distributions of U and c
that lead to this result.
11

This model may be readily generalized to extend the multinomial multi—

variate logistic model discussed by Goodman (1970) and Nerlove and Press (1973)

to panel data on heterogeneous populations. This generalization and other methodological issues related to quantal response problems in panel data are

discussed in a forthcoming paper by the authors. Essentially, the beta density
is replaced by the Diricheler density, with a parametization identical with that

to prove concavity of the likelihood function and to prove asymptotic normality

of the estimates. See Heckman and Willis (1976).

may be the case that education also affects the wife's productivity

in home production. However, even if it does, it is uncertain whether the
shadow price of time is increased, decreased or left unchanged by an increase

in education. For example, if education increases the productivity of time
and goods in household production by the same proportion and the income elasticities of demand for goods and leisure are unitary, education has no effect on
the shadow price of time.

16The adjustment referred to follows the suggestion of Spillerman (1972),
Hall (1973) and Boskin and Nold (1974) who use the independent variables to
estimate regression or logit functions of the form

=

g(x)

p9 f(x) + u and

+ v which are used to predict the transition probabilities of each

individual in the sample. Then the predicted n—step transition matrix is simply

T =

1

N
T, the mean of the individual n—step matrices. From our previous

discussion, it is clear that this procedure will solve the heterogeneity problem

only if u and v are not serially correlated. This will be the case only when
the set of independent variables, x, include all persistent determinants of

39

labor force participation. The failure of the adjustment to substantially modify
the predictions of the homogeneous Markov model indicates that most hetero-

geneity is the result of unobserved components. This is consistent with our
finding reported earlier that the measured variables account for less than 10%
of the total variance in participation probabilities.
