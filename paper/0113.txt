Abstract

This paper uses the concept of the triad census first introduced by Holland
and Leinhardt, and describes several distributions on directed graphs.
Methods are presented for calculating the mean and the covariance matrix of

the triad census for the unifonn distribution that conditions on the number
of choices made by each individual in the social network. Several complex

distributions on digraphs are approximated, and an application of these
methods to a sociogram is given.

1. Introduction
This paper discusses some recently developed methods for the analysis

of social networks. The directed graph, or more briefly "digraph'T, a set
of "nodes" or "paints" and a set of directed "lines" or "edges" connecting

pairs of nodes, is the basic mathematical concept in this paper.
This paper utilizes concepts of graph theory which have been found

useful in discussing social networks. Recently, many structural models of
social science have adopted the graph theory notation. These concepts will

be introduced as needed in this paper, without going into a full exposition.
Those readers unfamiliar with these ideas will find Harary, Norman, and

Cartwright (1985) a valuable reference.

In a digraph, node i. and node j are connected with a directed line

running from i to j,

if and only if person i chooses person j according to

the sociometric choice criterion employed. Note that the d.igraph defined

here is a "binary" directed graph. The "strengths" attached to individual
choices are irrelevant. A binary digraph does not allow signed choices

(each line is designated +1 or -1) or multiple choices (each line receives

a value). It is also iortant to note that a directed line from node i to
node j does not rule out the possibility of a directed line from node j to

node i.

The central analytical tool in this presentation is the triad census,
introduced by Holland E Leinhardt (1970). The main interest in this paper

is the random directed. graph distribution obtained as a result of conditioning on the number of choices made by each person. Under this distribution,
all social networks which have exactly the specified number of choices for

each person are equally likely.

—2—

Sections 3 and L of this paper are devoted to brief discussions of

various random directed graph distributions and the triad census. Section
5 shows how to calculate the first two nnnents of the triad census under
the digraph distribution mentioned above. An example of a social network

is given in section 6, and then analyzed with the distribution.
2. Notation and Definitions
Let g denote the number of members in the group. Order the individuals

in the group from 1 to g in an arbitrary manner. Define the (gxg) sociomatnix

as a representation of a labeled binary directed graph. (A different ordering of the individuals produces a sociomatrix which differs from ) by a simultaneous row-column permutation.) The notation i -* j imples that in the digraph

there is a directed line from node i to node j. Let the (i,j) entry of X be
defined as follows:
X

Self-choices
i

are

1,2,... ,g,

_{lifiJ
0, otherwise.

not allowed; consequently, the diagonal elements of X,

remain empty, or conveniently are set to zero.

sets of quantities associated with X are of particular interest to
the investigator of the group. The outdegree of node i, written X5, is the
nunber of lines in the digraph originating at node i. The indegree of node j,
written X1, is the number of lines in the digraph tenninating at node 5. The
R'o

row sums and column sums, respectively, of the sociomatrix give the outdegree

and indegree of each node. These two sets of quantities {X+} and {X+5} may

be calculated as follows:

E N.. ; il, 2, ...,
and

g

—3—

E X.. ; jl, 2, ...,

g.

In a group of size g, the rnther of choices made by each person and the
niriber of choices rece:i.ved by each person, the outdegree and inde'ee,

respectively, take a value between 0 and (g-l).
A mutual relationship between person i and person j exists when i
and

j

•i

in the digraph. The mutual bond is denoted by i

sociorratrix N, this situation occurs when

relationship occurs if and only if i

j or j

j

l and x..rl. An asyimietnic

i but there is no mutual

relationship present. A null relationship between i and j

occurs

if there

is neither a mutual nor an asyretric bond between these persons. Let N,
A, and. N, respectively, be the niinber of mutual, asyimietric, and null

relationships in the group.
It is possible to represent each of these three relationships graphically. These representations of pairs of nodes are conunonly referred to as

dyads. Each pair of points, and the lines connecting then, are isomorphic
to one of these three representations; consequently, the three dyad types

are often referred to as isorrorphism classes. The classes are named null,
asynirnetric, and mutual to correspond to the sociological concepts. Figure

2-1 illustrates the dyad types.

Now

or

consider all possible isorrorphism classes of triples of points,

triads. By enuneration, it

is

easy to show that there are 16

classes.

These are illustrated in Figure 2.2. The naming convention employed in
the figure was introduced by Holland and Leinhardt (1970),

and

uses the

nuther of mutual, asy7nnetnic, and null dyads within each triad as its
basis.

In a digraph with g nodes, there are () triads formed by selecting
each triple of nodes and all lines connecting them. Suppose each of these
tria.ds is examined in turn, and the isomorphism class of each recorded.

Let Tu denote the nuiriber of triads of type u Cu ranges over the 16 triad
types shown in Figure 2-2). The triad census T is the 16 component vector
defined by
T z CT003,

T012, ..,

Adhering to an established convention, the ordering of the components of T

is as follows:

B. The UJIL4N Distribution

The U Mm, Ama, N=n distribution is the conditional uniform distribu-

tion which puts equal probability on all digraphs in Dg with Nm mutual,
Ama asymmetric, and Nm null dyads. Note that unless m+a+n(), the
subset

of digraphs of Dg with the given values of N, A, and N will be

empty. The U MAN distribution has been popularized by Holland and Leinhardt.

It provides a large aiicunt of conditioning, and calculations are made more

• easily than under other conditional distributions.
To find the probability mass function of X under U MAN, number the

pairs of nodes corresponding to the chosen numbers. From the remaining

is

decided randomly (e.g., by tossing a fair coin). The remaining pairs

Each

values between 0 arid (g-l). Sociometric interpersonal preference data may

be collected under either a "fixed choice" cr a "free choice" procedure.
In a fixed choice experiinent, the investigator may instruct each member in

the group to "Name your four best friends in the group". If each group
member fully cooperates then the outdegree of each node is fixed at a

specific value. A free choice experhnent places no restrictions on the
number of individuals chosen by each group member. In either situation,

the UI {X.÷} distribution is very useful in calculations because it allows

the investigator to "control' for the outdegree of each node. This outdegree
adjustment removes the effects of the procedure used to gather the data.

E.

Complex Conditional Distributions

There are several highly important conditional unifom distributions
that are so complex that no simple way exists for generating random digraphs

with these distributions. This section briefly discusses several of these.
The U{X1},{X÷.} distribution simultaneously conditions on both the

indegrees and the outdegrees of the digraph. All digraphs with the speci-

fied values of {X.} and {X. } are equally J.i]cely. This distribution is
extremely important in sociometric data analysis, since it controls for both
the choices made by each group member and choices received. Ford and

FuTherson (1962) give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence

of at least one element in Dg with the specified outdegrees and indegrees.
Unfortunately, no one has been able to develop a sophisticated technqiue to

simulate this distribution.
Also worth noting is the U N, {X1} distribution.. Since E
and C-.2M = A,

C

this distribution also controls tile total number of choices

made and the number of asignetric choices. Little is known about

even though it is important.
Perhaps the most important distribution in sociometric data analysis

is the UM,{X.},{X.} distribution. Its value derives from the fact that
it controls for choices-made, choices-received, and mutuality. As with
UjM,{X+}, and U{X+} {X+} there is no sophisticated way to generate
random

sociomatrices under this distribution.

To reiterate, there are many possible distributions on Dg• At the

present time, only a few of these distributions are fully understood. The
UIMAN distribution was chosen by Holland and Leinhardt (1970) because it

best approximated the UN,{X+}, fX.} distribution. Unfortunately, it does

-11--

not control for either the set of indegrees or outdegrees in the digraph.
The attitude taken in this paper is that although UI MAN is the most complex

uniform distribution in use at present, sociometric data analysis should
not overlook the information to be gained from considering the
UI{X.} and
4.

distributions.

The Thiad Census

The triad census has been effectively used in the analysis of sociometric

data, reducing the entire socionatrix X to a set of 16 surruary

statistics. In sections B and C, sunmiarizing some of the earlier work of
Holland and Leinhardt, various aspects of the triad census are discussed.

A. Naming Conventions
The U MAN distribution has been the only distribution employed for

computing the first and second moments of the triad census. Holland and
Leinhardt (1971), Davis (1970), and Davis and Leinhardt (1972) have used
the first 2 moments of the triad census for testing structural hypothesis

concerning social networks. Consequently, the convention for labeling the
16 components of the triad census utilized in Figure 2.2 is well established

{X+} distribu-

in the literature, but impractical in the discussion of the UI

tion. The labels should corrniunicate the outdegree of each node in the triad,

rather the number of mutual, asyimetric and null dyads. Figure 4.1 illustrates
the 16 isomorphism classes for 3-subgraphs with both the UIMAN

designations.

and UI{x+}

The trailing letters in the figure, N, A, C, and T, respectively,

stand for mutual, asyninetric, cyclic and transitive.

So as not to confuse the reader familiar with the UI MAN naming convention,
the UI {X1÷} labeling scheme will not be employed in this paper. However, a

Icowledge of this new scheme will aid in the interpretation of the calculations in section 5.

—12--

The label directly under each triad is defined by the number of rnutuals,
asymnetric, and null dyads in the triad (see Figure 2.2). The label in
parentheses is based on the outdegree of each node in the triad: first
digit nunber of nodes with outdegree equal to 2; second digit = number

of nodes with outdeee equal to 1; third digit number of nodes with
outdegree equal to 0; trailing letters further differentiate triad types.

C. Testing Structural Hypothesis

Perhaps the nrst inportant use of the triad census is testing
propositions about local structure in a sociornatrix. Holland and
Leinhardt originally proposed the triad census to test the proposition

that interpersonal choices tended to transitive; i.e., if person
i chooses person j

and

person j

chooses

person k, then person i should

choose person k. In their 1970 paper, the following triads were classified
as "intransitive": 02lC, 030C, 1llD, 111IJ, 120C, 201, and 210. The

triad

occurrence of any of these 7

types indicated that the group violated

the transitivity hypothesis, since each of these triads had at least one
intransitivity. Holland and Leinhardt developed a ireasure, r(
was

2i, which

used as a "transitivity index".
They define t(9,) as follows:
VT—
-

T

Vp

(.5)

where L is the weighting vector that counts the number of intransitive

triads, and T and

are the mean and covariance matrix of T as computed

—16—

using the U NAN distribution. A computer simulation showed that for

large g, r ( i) was approximately distributed as a standard Gaussian random
variable.
Holland and Leinhardt (1978) generalize this procedure so that any

structural hypothesis may he tested. The triads that will inviolate
the hypothesis in question merely need to be discovered, and the conesponding weighting vector found. Mazur' s (1971) proposition concerning

"close friends disagreeing" is discussed and

computed for 408 sociomatrices.

in Section 3 as too difficult to work with.
A. Notation and Few 1rivations

There are () triads in a digraph with g nodes. Let K and L be subscripts that refer to the () distinct triads of a given digraph. The
letters u and v will refer to two of the 16 isomorphism classes of the
triad census, discussed in Section 4—A. This section concludes with the

formula to be used in section C for calculating the variances and covariarices

of the 16 triad types.

Formula (5.7) is important for calculations involving variances and covenances.

B. Expressions for Means, Variances, and Covariances

Holland and Leinhardt (1976) give formulae for the first two moments

of the triad census under a general disfribution using the average values

of Py(U) p(u,v), p(u,v), p(u,v) and p(u,v). The ments
also be given in terms of summations, which defines the U {X+ distribution

more easily. Theorems 1 and 2 given in this paper are equivalent to Corollary
1 presented in Section 5.A of Holland and Leinhardt (1976).

0. Derivations of Probabilities Under UI 0<.1+}
_________________________________

A

random digraph with the UI MAN distribution is characterized by

certain properties that greatly simplify the calculation of the quantities
(5.8)-(5.12). Consider the triad 030T illustrated in Figure 5.la.
The 3 nodes of this triad have been Labeled, in a clockwise manner

beginning at the lower left vertex, node I., node j, and node Ic. Note
the same triad 03 OT in Figure 5. lb where the nodes j arid Ic have been

interchanged. Under the UI MAN distribution, the only relevant features

of this triad, arid in fact all triads, are the numbers of null, asymmetric,
and mutual dya.ds. Thus, the two triads in Figures 5. la and 5. lb while

distinct by a permutation of the labels attached to the nodes, are considered
identical by the UI MAN distribution. The U MAN distribution on a digraph

is "homogeneous" in the sense that it is invariant under permutations

of the labels given to the nodes.
Now, consider the outdegree of each node in the two triads shown in

Figure 5.1. The two triads have one node with the same outdegree (node i).

In the top triad, node j has outdegree 0 and node Ic, outdegree 1. In
the bottom triad, node j has outdegree 1 end node Ic has outdegree 0.
These triads, under UI fxi. }, are obviously not invariant under permutations.
In general, the outdegree of each node changes with a rearrangement of the
node labels.

Due to the lack of homogeneity of a digraph under UI {X+} it is

necessary to examine every triad, and every pair of triads with 0, 1, and
2 nodes in common,

to compute each term of the sums (5.8)

-

(5.11). This

is in stark contrast to the same calculations under UI MAN given by Holland

arid Leinhardt (1974). With the UINAN distribution, the probabilities

defined in (5.3) •and (5.6) do not depend on Kbr L. so that

11 Moments of a Triad Census under

the same first two xicments under the U CX. } distribution. Take the set
of indegrees of the digraph which are to be regarded as fixed, and assume

that this set of g numbers is actually a set of outdegrees of the digraph.
With the above assumption, three pairs of the 16 isonorphism classes

will have to be interchanged. The other 10 triads are invariant under this
forced reversal of all directed lines. The three pairs are
O2lD and 021U,

Holland and Leinhardt (1974) suggest a "partial conditioningt' scheme

approximating

the more complex distributions via

ships. The lack of 0300 triads is also of interest because the number of 0210
and 111U triads, each with two—thirds of a complete "cycle", would suggest the

opposite. The abundance of asyirmetric choices and 012 and 0210 triads can be

easily seen by examining the sociograsn in Figure 6.1. The small group size

aids in drawing conclusions from this figure. (As g increases, so does the
complexity of the group' s sociograin, and the triad census becomes more import-

ant in understanding group structure.)
An examination of the expected values reveals that the partial conditioning slightly reduces the differences between the census and its expected values.
The distributions based on uJ MAN have expected values which fit the data more

closely, in that the absolute differences between the expected and observed
quantities are smaller than those found using distributions based on Uj {X1÷}.
It also appears that the differences between UI MAN and UI {X+} decrease when
examining T computed under UIMAN,

I tested the structural hypotheses of transitivity and intransitivity
by computing r (s.) for th of these hypotheses using the six random digraph
distributions and the & vectors given in Holland and Leinhardt (1976).

Table 6.3 presents these results.
The T values decrease as I partially condition UI MAN, and increase as

I partially condition UI{X.+}. This may be due to the previously mentioned
fact that T computed under the approxiirate distributions based on UI MAN

provide a better "fit" to the observed triad census.
The example demonstrates the phenorlEnon that different conditional

distributions may produce differing T and T An investigator using the
triad census to test structural hypotheses should compute the relevant r ( L)

under a variety of distributions, and then seek an explanation for the apparent

differences or similarities of the r values.

Suirirary

Figure 7.1 sunlnarizes the relationships of the random digraph distributions

and the partially conditioned digraph distributions studied in this paper.
With the addition of the UJ IX) distribution, the network becomes quite
intricate. Note that the digraph distribution network is ordered so that
as one moves from the bottom to the top of the figure, the amount of condi-

tioning in each distribution increases. I have purposely left out the dis—
tributions based on UI (X+1 } in order that the network remain comprehensible.
This paper has introduced two random directed graph distributions and
has given the methods needed to compute the first two moments of these dis-

tributions. Individuals interested in the analysis of social networks now
have powerful mathematical tools at their disposal to aid in their analyses.
The example discussed in Section 8 demonstrates some of these. These methods

show how statistical analyses can be applied to a specific field of study in
the social sciences.
