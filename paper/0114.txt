Abstract

The validity of using local market data to measure the benefits associated

with policies

adopted in an urban

area is investigated.

It is shown that

rest of the rld is affected by taxing decisions undertaken in a single
urban area, so that local data cannot perfectly measure the welfare effects
of a policy change. Specifically, the fact that the willingness to pay for
the

a tax increase is positive in the rest of the world suggests that costbenefit analyses which do not account for the rest of the world may be
biased.

I. Introduction
Numerious attempts have been made to utilize rrarket data to measure the

benefits associated with public policy changes in an urban

area.

The

majority of these studies have attempted to determine the relationship

between

property values and certain policy-related variables, such as

local taxes, expenditures, and environmental quality, in order to obtain

an estimate of the willingness to pay for changes in these variablesJ
Recent analysis of property value studies have been critical of them,

pointing to the fact that a correct measure of the benefits associated
with a change in public policy must take into account the willingness to

pay of all relevant economic actors in the urban area.2
Fecause these methodological discussions focus on the measurement of

benefits within one urban area in a large system of urban areas, it is
usually assumed that the price of capital is unaffected by any local change

in public policy, so that capital owners have a zero willingness to pay for
the policy change. Such an assumption can be quite misleading, however,
because

the assumption that the price of capital changes insignificantly

(so that it may be assumed constant), does not alli one to conclude that

is reasonable to assume that the value of capital (price tiiis quantity)
the system of urban areas has changed negligibly. In fact, it seems

To explore these issues, we utilize a model in which capital and land
are inputs in the production of a homogenous good in a system of urban
areas. Land. is fixed in each urban area, while capital is perfectly mobile

among urban areas. The model is used to analyze the consequences of newly
inposed tax on all capital utilized in one urban area. We find that thile the
price of capital may change only slightly, the tax increase will, in general,

result

in a large decline in the value of capital in the system of urban

areas, and consequently, a large negative willingness to pay of capital
owners in the "rest of the world." However, we also find that the willing—

his paper strongly suggests that in the context of such a model it would

strictly correct to assume that all of the welfare changes associated
with a tax increase occur in the taxed urban area. In discussing the
be

case of a tax on capital used in the corporate sector, Harberger asserts
(1971, p. 79L) that:

it is essential to recognize that the X1 refer to activities,
not

just products. In the case just mentioned the tax would be

The

activities of producing and

consuming a given good should be kept analytically separate whenever the distortions affecting them differ; likewise, a given

of activity which is affected by different distortions in
different regions should be broken down into as many separate

activities

as there are different distortions. (Italics and the

In Section II of the paper the model of production in a system of urban
areas is formally presented. In Section III willingness to pay is defined in

the context of this model, and the questions raised above are reformulated in
terms of the model. The model is then used to analyze and at

least partially

answer the questions. In particular, 1-larberger's statement that all of the
welfare change occurs in the taxed area is seen not to hold in general. Section
III ends with a detailed explanation of the apparent conflict between Harberger' s

description of the conventional wisdom of applied welfare economics and the

results of our paper. Section IV contains some conclusions as well as
suggestions for extension of our analysis.

II. The Model
The following model is admittedly unrealistic, but is structured so as to
capture those features which are crucial to the cost-benefit issues raised in
Section I. Consider a set of N urban areas ,

where q1 is the output of the i urban area, 1< is the capital (or perfectly

and a fixed supply of land, L/N in each urban area. Since land is fixed we

assume further that owners of capital and land have identical utility

functions, with utility monotically increasing in output. In this situation,

The assumption of competitive behavior in factor and output markets
requires that the portion of output not claimed by capital owners be received

by the landlords. Given our honogeneity assumption, this implies that:

the following discussion.

Now consider the impact of a newly imposed tax at rate t on the use of

capital in urban area l. To simplify the exposition which follows, we shall
use two conventions; first, we associate upper case letters with the aggregate
of the remaining N-l areas, and second, we associate variables with primes

the after-tax equilibrium. After

imposition of the tax, the first
order condition for the first urban area differs from the conditions for the
remaining urban areas. In particular, for the first urban area:

rather than an increment to
existing tax to simplify the analysis which follows. Our nodel yields
substantively the same results as a model which analyses the impact of a
marginal (rather than a discrete) increase in preexisting tax. (For an
alternative discussion of the relationship between marginal and nonmarginal
changes, see }aus (1972).) However, in the special case of a marginal
change in the tax rate from a point of global optimality (no tax), there
is no deadweight loss, and the willingness to pay for the tax change is
zero in all urban areas.

to Pay

Each economic actor's willingness to pay is defined as the maximum anount
output

per year which could

be taken

of

from him after the imposition of the

tax in the first urban area and leave him no worse off than before. For
owners of land willingness to pay is simply the aggregate change in output

received as land rentals, while for the owners of capital, it is the aggregate change in output received as capital rentals.
Using the model stnicture presented in Section II, the willingness to
pay of the relevant economic actors can be expressed analytically as

shown

in Table 3.1. We continue with our notational convention by using w to

represent willingness to pay in the taxed area, and W to represent willing-

ness to pay in the rest of the world.

gains (or losses), since capital users must pay a competitive price Cs')

for any capital employed. Analogously, capital owners in the taxed area do
not obtain capital gains or losses because they receive the world competitive
price s' for use of their capital.
Equations (3.2), (3. Li.), and (3.7) follow from the first order conditions

yields (3.7) directly.

Equation (3.2) equates the willingness to pay of land owners to the
difference between the total willingness to pay in the urban area (3.Li)

—9—

and

the

willingness to pay of capital owners (3.1) and

the

government (3.3).

This result follows directly from our assumption that land owners receive

the residual gains and losses associated with the -tax change.

The willingness to pay results are intuitively appealing. Equation
(3.7), for example, states that annual willingness to pay in the rest of
the world is equal to the increase in output due to the capital inflow minus

the annual rental value of the new capital. If this last tenn were not
subtracted, double counting would be involved, since the new capital had to

be rented at the competitive world rental price,

and

did not provide a capi-

tal gain to the capital owners in -the rest of -the world. Si.nilarly, equation

(3L.) states that annual willingness to pay in the taxed area is the loss of
output plus the annual rental value of the capital outflow. The value of the
capital outflow measures the portion of the capital loss which capital owners

in the urban area are able to recoup by renting their capital at the world
price.
Analysis

of Cost-Benefit Issues

The equations listed in the willingness to pay accounts provide the
basis for an analysis of the cost-benefit issues described in the

introduc-

paper. Specifically, we wish to show that:
(1) The change in the annual rental value of capital in the rest

tion to the

of the world may not be small.

(2) Willingness to pay of the rest of the world is small relative

to the

willingness to pay of capital owners in the rest of
the world.

(3) Willingness to pay in the rest of the world is positive, implying that a cost-benefit analysis associated with the imposition
of a tax in one urban area is always biased so as to understate
the true benefits to society of the project.

(3.5) as follows:

exactly N+l tines the magnitude of willingness to pay in the rest of

the world. This estimate is useful because it provides a lower bound for

the true ratio of w to W in the case where f> 0. In this case the
marginal product of capital increases at an increasing rate as capital

flows out of the taxed area. When compared to the case

in which

the mare-

ginal product increases at a constant rate (in equation (3.18)), the

lower

bound result becomas clear.

An illustration of this is given in Table 3.2, which presents the
values of key variables of the irodel for a Cobb-Doublas production function

associated with different tax rates. The third partials of a Cobb-Douglas

are, of course, positive, and it

is readily seen that the ratio of wi

to

wi is greater than N+1 in all cases.
There is nothing in neoclassical production theory, however, which

assures that f1< is everywhere positive. For example, it can be shown
that

a

C.E.S. production function with an elasticity of substitution less

than .5 will have negative third partials at some factor ratios. By the
same

IQKK

logic that makes N+l a lower bound of the ratio of Jw to W where
is nonnegative over the relevant range, it is clear that N+1 is an
I

bound for that ratio where f< is nonpositive.
The situation in which the ratio of I wi to I wJ is smallest occurs when
the marginal product of capital rises negligibly in the taxed urban area as
capital flows out, although it falls non-negligibly in the rest of the

upper

world.

(in response to a tax increase in one urban area) will be positive. The
apparent conflict between this result and the outcome of Harberger' s formulation arises because Harberger is unnecessarily vague when he defines
tortion

as "the excess of marginal

social

benefit over marginal

social

dis-

cost

per unit of activity" (1971, p. 789). If Harberger's definition of distortion
(as applied to our model) is taken to be the difference between the marginal

product of capital at the social optimum (before the tax) and the marginal

product of capital in actual use (after the tax), then our formulation can
been seen to be consistent with that of Harberger (1971, p. 789, equation (6)).

However, if this definition of distortion is chosen, Harberger's conclusion
(described in

the introduction) that

all of the welfare effects can be measured

within the taxed urban area does not hold. This result follows immediately

because the capital tax causes the marginal product of capital in the rest
of the world to deviate from the social optimum. Thus, a capital tax in one
urban area causes the capital market throughout the world to be distorted.

If one does not accept the proposed definition of distortion, then the
model presented here stands as a counterexaile to the validity of Harberger' s
formulation. Our model suggests that despite Harberger's claims, his measure

of welfare change is strictly valid only for small changes fran a global optimum, and therefore does not possess the simplicity and robustness which has

been claimed for it (1971, p. 796).

derived in Section III establish

the following:

(1) When the measurement of benefits is restricted to the irrmediate

urban area, the results of the cost-benefit analysis will, in
general, be biased, in that a project which taxes a mobile
factor in one urban area will (due to the outflow of that factor) lead to positive benefits in the rest of the world. However, the magnitude of that bias is likely

to be

small.

(2) A project which is financed through a tax on a mobile factor
will have inportant distributive implications in the rest of
the world. Holders of the taxed factor in the non-taxed areas
will experience capital losses several orders of magnitude larger
than the net welfare gain experienced in those areas. fljrther—
more, holders of other factors will receive capital gains
slightly larger in magnitude than the capital losses experienced
by holders of the taxed factor. Thus, although the a.llocative
bias deriving from a project undertaken in one urban area may

be small in the rest of the world, there can be a significant
change in the functional income distribution of an entire

system of urban areas due to the taxing policy of one urban
area.9
(3) While the allocative bias in cost-benefit analysis will always

will not necessarily be small relative
to excess burden in the taxing jurisdiction itself. Indeed,
if the production function has a negative third partial with
respect to capital, as much as one third of the total welfare

directly on the first urban area. For a

nonmar-

ginal change in the tax rate, however, it is necessary to examine the impact
on the entire capital market to correctly calculate willingness to pay. This
follows

because the tax

in the first

urban

area results

in an outflow of capi-

tal to the rest of the world, with only the last unit of capital being paid
its marginal product. Since all of the infranrginal units, of capital flowing
into the rest of the world have been paid less than their marginal product,
there is a net positive willingness to pay in the rest of the world. Of course,
the world
from

willingness to pay is simply the net loss in real output resulting

the tax. Thus,

our concern lies with

the problem of the distribution of

benefits among urban areas, a perspective which is somewhat different from

that of most cost-benefit analyses.
The central purpose of this paper has been to investigate the validity
of using local market data to measure the benefits associated with policies
adopted in a given urban area. While a more elaborate model, including more

than one product, price changes, and a mobile labor force, can be expected

to yield further insights into this question, the model presented here does
provide a beginning. In brief, the rest of the world is affected by taxing
decisions undertaken in a single urban area. Thus local data can never perfectly measure the welfare effects of a policy change. However, the magnitude

of

the welfare change

in the

rest of the world is

likely to be quite small, as

a result of offsetting changes in factor returns that may be quite large. Thus,
local policies can have important implications for income distribution in a
large system. Finally, in what may be a special case, but a special case -that
cannot be ruled out on theoretical grounds, the rest of the world may have
good reason to be concerned with the tax policy in Peoria.
