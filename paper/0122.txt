The purpose of this paper is to analyze the market for optometric
services

in the United States. This is done primarily by specifying and

estimating

a market model for optometric services. Within the context

of the model marty of the more interesting questions relating to the prac-

tice of optometry can be considered. Some of these are: What factors

influence the location decision of the optometrist? What effect does
advertising

have on the

demand for optometric services? To

what extent

is the interstate mobility of optometrists inhibited by restrictive
licensing

arrangements? To what degree are

gists

opticians

and

the services of ophthalmolo-

substituted for those of the optometrist? What

role

do price and income play in determining the demand for optometric ser-

vices?

This paper is divided into seven sections. In the following section
an

overview of the practice of optometry is presented. This is succeeded

by an examination of the distribution of eye health professionals in the
United States. In sections 3—5 a market model for optometric services

is specified and discussed. Next, estimates of the model are presented.

Finally, the implications of this research are considered.

implying

that upwards of

$800 million are spent

annually on

the services

of self—employed optometrists.1 Optometrists are engaged primarily in
solo practice. About 17 percent of self—employed optometrists are in
partnerships or group practices.2 Most optometrists are general practitioners. Only about 3.5 percent of optometrists specialize in contact
lenses, vision training, industrial vision or other fields.3
Besides optometrists, two other eye professions are involved in the

delivery

of eye care services in the United States. The ophthalmologist

diagnoses eye disease, administers medical treatment, performs surgical

operations, and prescribes eyeglasses to correct refractive error. The
primary

role of the optician

is the fitting and dispensing of eyeglasses

to prescription. There are approximately 8,600 active ophthal—

mologists and about 11,000 active opticians in the United States.4

Services is low are in poorer health as a result.8
Because of the concern over the "maldistribution" of health professionals, an important emphasis of this research is an examination of the

location decision of the optometrist. The market model discussed in the
following section is specified so that the location decision of the
optometrist comprises one of the structural equations.

3. pecification of the Model

A

fully

specified model of the market for optometric services must

describe both the demand for and supply of optometric services. The
model estimated in this paper consists of a demand equation, two

tions which

equa-

together describe the supply of optometric services and one

4. The Data
The model is estimated across states by combining several data sources

from the mid—1960's. Two of these sourtes are used to compute the quantity
measure of the per capita consumption of optometric services by state.
This measure is calculated by multiplying the annual averaqe output of
optometrists in each state by the number of practicing optometrists per

100,000 population. The latter figure is taken from the 1968 National
Vision and Eye Care Manpower Survey of the National Center for Health Sta-

tistics.1° The average output figure is derived from data collected in the
1964 American Optometric Association Survey of Optometrists. In this national survey data were collected from over 4,000 optometrists on the wholesale value of lenses, temples, and frames purchased by the optometrist in

1964 and on the annual number of visual examinations provided. These output measures can be converted into a single output index by deflating the
wholesale value of eyeglasses to physical units and then combining the
number of eyeglasses and eye examinations provided into a single measure
by using the respective prices as weights.11
The 1964 average output of optometrists by state is determined by
averaging the output indexes of those optometrists who responded to the

AOA survey. Those states where less than forty optometrists responded to
the AOA

survey

were excluded from the data base.

Thirty-two

states had

forty or nre respondents. These average output figures are then multiplied by the number of practicing optometrists per 100,000 population in

1968 in order to compute the quantity measure of the consumptin of
optometric

services per

100,000 population for each of the 32 states.

idea of the substitutability of the services of competing eye professionals for those of the optometrist by entering the number of ophthal—

that the relationship between the number

serve

A dummy variable

is included in the demand equation which takes on

a value of one for those states that did not restrict the advertising of

optometric services. The advertising of optometric services should reduce the cost of these services to consumers. Search costs are reduced
because the price and terms of sale as well as information on the sup-

pliers identity, location and reliability are, often provided. Lee
Benham has shown that advertising also lowers the price paid by consumers for

eyeglasses because it stimulates price competition among

sellers. 12 Holding price constant, the effect of advertising should be
to shift the demand curve for optometric services to the right because
it lowers the information Costs faced by consumers and may also enable

optometrists to more effectively compete with ophthalmologists for

patients seeking visual examinations and corrective lenses. Ophthal—
mologists,

like all physicians, cannot advertise as a condition of

license.

Those states not restricting advertising were determined from Lee
Benham's classification of states in accordance with the restrictions

placed
by

on the advertising of eyeglasses. Benham constructed the series

examining state

state optometry

laws, by interviewing optometrists and members of

boards, and

by searching newspapers for eyeglass adver-

t.tsements.

Several socioeconomic variables have been specified in the demand
equation.

The age distribution variable, percent of the population 65

—8—

and over, was included in the demand relation because the need for and
utilization of corrective lenses increases dramatically with age. Near
vision generally deteriorates auite rapidly after the age of 35, with
90 percent of adults between the ages of 45 and 54 having visual acuity

of less

than 14/14.

13

The same pattern holds for distance vision, al-

though the rate of deterioration with age is not as great. With this
background, it is not surprising to find that the utilization of
corrective

lenses increases markedly with age. About 90

percent of

have eyeglasses by the age of 60) Consequently, the older the

adults

population the optometrist serves, the greater should be the demand for
his services.

The race variable, percent non-white, is included as an independent
variable because of evidence that blacks have stronger vision than whites.

For

example, at the age of

50, about 90 percent of Negro males

have

un-

corrected distance vision of 20/30 or better as compared to less than 75

percent of the white male population of the same age)5 To test whether
inter—state differences in racial composition actually translate into
differences in the demand for optometric services, the percent of the
population that is non—white is entered into the demand equation.
Income and education may also play a role in determining the demand

for optometric services. The utilization of corrective lenses is posi—
tively correlated

of families where the head had less than 13 years of schooling had correc-

tive lenses'6 it is not evident from these figures whether the income
effect results from the higher educational levels associated with higher
income individuals, or whether the educational effect actually reflects
a positive income elasticity for corrective lenses. In order to separate

out

the

effects of income and education on the demand for optometric

services, the state per capita income and

the

percent of the state popu-

lation with 1—3 years of college are entered into the demand equation.
Although the utilization of corrective lenses increases with income

and education it is not clear, ajriori, that the partial effects of income and

education

on the demand for optometric services would be posi-

tive. This is because the higher the income and

education

of an .individ-

ual, the more likely he is to use the services of an ophthalmologist

instead of an optometrist to obtain an optical prescription. Twentyfive percent of those individuals with family income under $5,000 who

had

5.2 The Supply of Optometric Services.

The determinants of the supply of optometric services are examined

by the estimation of a location equation and an average rkload equa-

tion.
5.2a The Location of Optometrists

Price is included in the location equation and is expected to be
positively associated with the number of optometrists per 100,000 popu—

lation.

With price held constant, the per

capita

income variable in

the location equation must be interpreted as a proxy

for

the cultural,

educational and other environmental advantages of a state which are

correlated

with per capita income.

The number of graduating students in optometry schools is entered
into the equation to test whether graduating optometrists have a propensity to remain in the state where they receive their professional edu-

cation. One reason why this should be the case is that optometry

is

interesting to note that in most cases it is the professions that have

demanded that their members be licensed. Consumers, who supposedly

need

to be

protected from malpractice, have been less concerned about

professional licensure.

There is evidence that the licensing arrangements of some profes-

sions have been used to restrict labor mobility between states. Holen
found that interstate mobility in law and dentistry was low

relative

to

medicine because of the structure of licensing arrangements ... (and)
because of the exclusionary practices of various state licensing
boards. ,,20

She found that those states in which lawyers or dentists

enjoyed high incomes also tended to have high failure rates among

candidates for license. This was not true for the case of physicians,
where restrictions on interstate mobility are small because of

— 12 —

reciprocity agreements and the use of national boards. Maurizi has pre-

sented regression results that support the hypothesis that state licensing
boards adjust the pass rate on licensing examinations in order to protect
the incomes of those already licensed.

6.1

The Demand for Optometric Services

The second stage estimates of the demand equations are presented in

Table i.22 All variables are in logs with the exception of the adverUsing dummy. The per capita income coefficients (elasticities) vary
from .34 to .59 in the demand equations. This range is high relative to
the

income elasticities of demand estimated for physician services by

Fuchs and Kramer.

23

A relatively higher income elasticity of demand for
.

optometric services is not unexpected. A good portion of optometric

services, such as tinted glasses, re expensive, stylish frames and
extra glasses, would seem to fall into the luxuryM category. In fact,
the income elasticity of eye health services could be substantially greater
than .5. The income elasticity of demand for optometric services would

The

but becomes positive in regressions 5 and 6 when the education and adver-

tising variables are excluded from the estimated demand equations.

The coefficients and statistical significance of the race and age
variables remain fairly stable in the estimated regression equations.
The positive association between the demand for optometric services and

the percent of the population 65 and over is an expected result given

the increased utilization of corrective lenses with age. The age elasticity is approxin%ately.5. The percent of the population that is nonwhite is negatively related to the quantity of optometric services
demanded. The negative association can be explained in part by the
stronger vision possessed by Negroes. Perhaps an equally important

explanation, however, is the higher price of securing optometric services that Negroes probably confront because of higher transportation

and search costs. Many Negroes live in urban ghettos or rural areas in
the South where optometric care is relatively scarce.
The regression results provide no decisive evidence on the extent
to which the services of ophthalmologists and opticians are substituted

for optometric services. This is true because of the inconclusive regression estimates as well as the considerations discussed above (see
pp. 6—7). The optician. variable is highly significant and negatively
related to the demand for optometric services when the ophthalmologist
variable does not appear in the demand equation. When the two competing

eye professional variables are entered together, however, the optician

— 16

—

variable is significant at only the 30 percent confidence level. The

ophthalmologist variable is always statistically insignificant, even
when the optician variable is excluded from the demand models.

26

The "better performance" of the optician variable may indicate that
competitive with those of the opopticians offer services that are more

tometrist than

is

true for the eye care services provided by ophthalmolo-

gists. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the dispensing portion of the optometrist's practice comprises the major portion of

tions in

supply of physicians reported by

Optcmietrists may be more sensitive to interstate varia-

price because they are more

likely to migrate (interstate) than

physicians. This conclusion is based on the assumption that migration in
both

the

these

professions is undertaken predominately by recent graduates of

professional schools. The established practices of older practitioners

should make thest reluctant to migrate. Recent graduates of optometry

schools should be more prone to migrate than their physician counterparts

— 18 —

because of the much smaller number

of optometry schools.

There existed

only ten optometry schools in nine states in 1968, while medical schools

were located in nearly every state. The national board dummy

state

indicates that

licensing examinations are

an

coefficient

effective means of

restricting entry, given the assumption that states which do not accept
the national boards in optometry have the more stringent licensing requirements. The duxriny coefficient indicates that states with more

restrictive licensinq requirements have 15 percent fewer optometrists
per 100,000 population, holding other variables equal,

than

those

states with less restrictive licensing arrangements. To put this
another way, consumers in those states with restrictive licensing
requirements could have a substantially larger stock of optometrists
from which to choose if these entry restrictions were eased.

The graduating optometry student coefficient demonstrates that

optometrists

have at least a slight rrooensity to remain in the state

where they receive their professional education. The elasticity of
the number

of

optometrists per 100,000 population with respect to the

nLmther of graduating optometrists inherent in the regression results is

very small, approximately .03. A small elasticity is to be expected because only nine states have optometry schools in the United States, so

a

significant aunt of

outmigration must

take

place

by optometrists

from the state where they receive their professional training, or optometrists would be much less evenly distributed around the country than they

presently are.

The attraction of optometrists to high per capita income states,

location decision. This finding is discussed in more detail in
Section 7.

The t—statistics are in parenthesis. The obvious explanation of the negative price coefficient is that optometrists are on the backward bending

portion of a labor supply curve. The price coefficient shows

that an

instate price increase of 10 percent should reduce the average workloads

of optometrists by about 10 percent. The supply of optometric services

within the state would remain about the same, however. The regression
results

of

for the

location equation indicate that the per capita number

optometrists would increase by approximately 10 percent as a result

of a 10 percent price increase.

Implications of the Research
At the outset of this paper a brief discussion was provided of the

concern of many health economists over the uneven distribution of health

professionals, particularly between urban and rural areas. Optometrists,

as well

as physicians, were seen to be relatively scarce

in

rural areas.

—20-

I

The estimation of the market model

for

optometric services in this study

provides some insight into the reasons for the uneven distribution of

health manpower. The estimation of the equation describing the location
decision of optometrists revealed that price, per capita income and the
stringency of

minants of

variables

The mean number of optometrists per 100,000 population.in the

nineteen urban states is 9.71. This is 15 percent greater than the
mean number of 8.45 optometrists per 100,000 population in the

thirteen rural states. The price coefficient in the estimated loca-

tion

equation indicates that if the price of output in rural states

increased to the urban state mean, or by 5.5percent, the mean number

of optometrists per 100,000 would increase by the same percentage.
The price effect, therefore, does not account for the major portion of
the discrepancy in the per capita number of optometrists between urban

and rural states. Apparently, the environmental and cultural attributes
