matrix of rank at most 2 to a matrix approximating some quantity A of

updates as the BFGS and DFP; Davidon [1975] recommends that such a factored

representation be used with his optimally conditioned update. (See Davidon's
[1975] paper for another view of such factored representations.)

Despite the above, it may

sometimes be desirable to maintain A explicitly.

Moreover, there exist situations in which the approximation A must be

allowed

to be indefinite; this happens, for instance, in certain algorithms for solving
the nonlinear least squares problem, in which a quasi-Newton approximation

is made

to only one paxl of the Hessian [Dennis, 1975]. Thus it is natural

desirable to choose M A1 in (1) and express the update A = A +

in

a form (with

approxima±ion A. It should select L.
