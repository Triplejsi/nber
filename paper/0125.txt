ABSTRACT
We show that if a certain nondegeneracy assumption holds, it is possible

to guarantee the existence of a solution to a system of nonlinear equations
f(x)

0 whose Jacobian matrix J(x) exists but may be

singular.

The

main idea is to modify small singular values of J(x) in such a way that

the modified Jacobian matrix (x) has a continuous pseudoinverse J(x)
and that a solution
asymptote

x of f(x)

0

may be found by determining an

of the solution to the initial value problem x(0)

x(t) = -J(x)f(x). We briefly discuss

practical (algoritl-unic) implications

of this result. Although the nondegeneracy assumption may fail for rrny
systems of interest (indeed, if the assumption holds and J(x*) is non-

singular, then x

is unique), algoritl-ffns using

Introduction

In various settings it is necessary to solve a system of nonlinear
it is necessary to find
equations. Thus, given a mapping f: ff'-'a point x c R" such that f(x*) 0. Often f is continuously

differentiable, i.e., f C1( iR'), as we shall henceforth assume.
Frequently certain features of the environment in which f arises,

such as physical features, imply the existence of a solution x.
However, it is of theoretical interest to determine conditions on f
which imply the existence of a solution without employing "outside"

considerations. Both constructive and nonconstructive approaches are

possible. For example, degree theory represents a nonconstructive
approach (see Chapter 6 of [Ortega C Rheinboldt, 1970]). Particular
algorithms usually underlie constructive existence theorems. Newton' s
method, for instance, underlies the well known Kantorovich theorem

(see below). In this paper we present a "semiconstructive" existence

theorem based on integrating a certain differential equation. Our
assumptions are weaker than those in the Kantorovich theorem and they

allow situations in which a continuum of solutions x* exists.
In the next section we introduce some notation and, for reference,

state

several theorems.
