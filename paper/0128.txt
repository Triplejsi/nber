which provides a complete solution to

optimal estimation problem for time-varying parameters when

specified.

The key ideas involve

combination of the infonrtion— form Kalman filter with the

produces efficient estintes of the parameter trajectories over

1. INTRODUCTION

In recent years a significant body of literature has appeared which
is addressed to the problem of estimating time varying regression

coefficient
Cooley

(Pagan

and Prescott

[l97],

Rosenberg [1973a, 1973b], Sarris [1973],

[1973, 1976]). The most fashionable approach to

these problems has been

to apply Kalman filtering theory to the

estimation of the coefficient trajectories. The application of
filtering theory, however, requires either a priori knowledge

or

and present

for the terminal period "smoothed" estimates of the

coefficients 1 His results are incomplete, however, in that they
do not contain equations for obtaining the smoothed coefficient

trajectories with their associated variance covariance matrices.
These estimates cannot be obtained from Rosenberg's analysis for

two reasons. The first is that he does not provide estimates of the
variance-covariance matrix of the initial parameters. The second,
and more important, reason is that the form of the smoothing equations

he presents are inappropriate because they rely on corrections to the

filtered traj ectories which in themselves are nonexistent in the

absence of proper prior distributions for the initial coefficients.
One approach to the starting problem is to use an empirical
Bayesian technique like that suggested by Kaminsky et al. [l97]
or Garbade [1975J.

This

approach involves selecting a subsample
