A SURVEY OP RECENT RESEAH IN HEALTH ECONOMICS

Michael Grossman

In

this

survey of recent research in health economics, I concentrate on

studies that have appeared since 1971 or are in progress. The survey reflects

in part my own research interests and biases and is not meant to be cotnr,rehen—
give.

Four topics are covered:

(1) demand

for adults' health and medical

care; (2) effects of health on labor supply and wage rates; (3) demand for

children's

health and medical care;

and (4) selected topics pertaining to the

supply side of the medical care market.

I.

Demand for Adults' Health and

Medical

Care

Most recent studies of the demand for adults' health and

have

medical care

adopted the model that I constructed to study this subject (12, 13]. A

of this

model is that what

on this proposition, one should derive the demand curve for medical care

fr the interaction between the production function of health and the
curve for

health. Within the context of Becker's household production func-

tion framework

Direct inputs into the production

gross investments in health include the n time of the consumer, medical

care, proper diet, exercise, recreation, housing, quality of the environment,
and other factors as well.

In the model, consumers

demand health for t reasons. As a consumption

dity, it directly enters their utility functions, or put differently,

of

time available for work

in

the market sector of the econ-

where consers produce money earnings, and for work in the normiarket or

household sector, where they produce coodities that enter their utility
functions. The investment motive for demanding health is present because an

increase in the stock of health lowers the amount of time lost from market

and nonmarket activities due to illness and injury. I develop in detail two
extreme versions of this general demand for health model: a pure investment
version and a
the

pure consumption version. In the former, health does not enter

utility function directly, while in the latter, the monetary rate of

return on an investment in health equals zero.
One of the main advantages of the model is that it makes strong pre-

dictions about the effects of shifts in variables other than income and the
price of medical care on the. quantities of health and medical care demanded.

These predictions are based on the proposition that the shadow price of
health

depends on many

the shadow price rises with age if

the rate of depreciation on

stock of health rises over the life cycle, and it falls with years of

formal schooling completed if more schooling makes a person a more efficient

producer of health. In general, an increase in the shadow price of health
vould lower the quantity of health demanded. If, however, the price elasticity of demand for health were less than one, then the quantity of medical
care demanded would rise. Thus, in using this framework to study the demand

for medical care, an economist does not have to ignore variables, such as
attitudes, perceptions, demographic characteristics, and schooling, that non—
economists might consider to be important. Rather, one can make predictions

about the effects of these variables in an economic context.

In my

initial empirical application of this approach [13], using data

for individuals who had finished

their

formal schooling, I estimated gross

investment production functions and diand curves for health and medical
care.

The data source was a 1963 health interview survey conducted by the

National Opinion Research Center and the Center for Health Administration

Studies of the University of Chicago. I measured health capital by individ-

uals' self-evaluation of their health status as excellent, good, fair, or
poor; and I measured the healthy time output of health capital either by the
complement of the number of restricted—activity days due to illness and in—
jury or by the complement of the number of work—loss days. To check the

results obtained with these indexes of health, I also examined variations

rates across states of the Un.ited States. In my empirical work, I

focused on the effects of age, schooling, the value of time (measured by the
wage rate), and property income on the quantities of health and medical care

demanded. Although not all its theoretical predictions were fulfilled,
enough were to suggest that the model provides a viable framework for under-

standing variations in health levels and medical care utilization.
During the past few years, several other persons and I have extended the
above framework both theoretically and empirically. One class of extensions
deal with the properties of the demand function for medical care. Using my
basic approach, Phelps (26] has developed a model of the joint determination
of the demand for medical care and the demand for health insurance under tin—
certainty (random illness). He shows that the introduction of uncertainty

does not alter the basic properties of the demand curve for medical care that
I derive from my model. Newhouse and Phelps [22, 23] employ my pure invest—
ment framework as the point of departure for estimating demand curves for

various types of medical care. In their model, the ncminal price of care

of this study, I formulate a recursive system whose principal equations are
demand curves for children's health, schooling, and adults' health. I then
show how this system generates causal relationships from schooling to health

and from health to schooling. In addition, this system generates relationships from third variables, such as genetic endowment, physical and mental

ability, aridparents' characteristics, to both health arid schooling. Existing
estimates of the effect of schooling on health are based on data sets that contain information on current health of persons who have completed their formal

schooling. These data sets do not, however, have measures of health at early

stages in the life cycle and have only limited information on potential third

variables. My theoretical analysis stresses that current and past health
should be positively correlated and that healthier students should have an incentive to attend school for longer periods of time. Therefore, the coefficient of schooling in a regression with current health as the dependent variable would be biased upward if past health were

option to trade quality for visits, these effects are somewhat different
than those discussed in other studies of the demand for medical care with
..icrodata sets. It is shown that the price of quality relative to the

price of visits (the relative price of quality) is directly related to the
quality—adjusted price of a visit and inversely related to the Ufixedu

costs of a visit. Fixed costs are costs that are independent of quality
and are defined as the sum of (1)

visits as quality—adjusted price rises. Although visits need not rise abso—
lutely, the ratio of visits to quality should be positively related to

price. Since the relative price of quality is a negative
function of fixed costs of a visit, an increase in these costs would cause
quality-adjusted

consumers to substitute quality for visits. In suxrrnary, fixed costs and
quality—adjusted price should have opposite signs in the demand curve for

quality. In addition, visits should be more sensitive to
fixed costs than to variations in quality—adjusted price.

variations in

The empirical work in the paper is based on a special sample of New
York City residents conducted by the New York City Department of Health in
1965—66

(the Mindlin-Densen survey). Estimates of quality and quality—

adjusted price of pediatric care are obtained from an ordinary least squares
regression

analysis of the usual fee of pediatric services rendered by

pri-

aary care physicians in private practice in their of fices. These fees were
reported by mothers of children in the sample, who also were asked to identify by name

all primary care physicians in private practice who examined

their children during the survey period. Characteristics of these physi—
ciazis were obtained from the American Medical Association or New York State

Medical Directories.

Differences in characteristics among physicians are assumed to reflect
differences in quality or productivity. Therefore, by regressing usual fee

on these characteristics, we

obtain

an estimate of quality from the predicted

value of usual fee for a given observation and an estimate of quality-adjusted

price from the regression residual. These estimates serve as inputs into the
Ccutation of demand functions for visits and quality.

by ordinary least squares. Second, our preliminary estimate of quality—

adjusted price is likely to contain errors of measurement. By introducing a
set of instrumental variables (equivalent to estimation by two—stage least
squares), we reduce these errors. In addition to the exogenous variables in
the demand

and

functions,

the instrumental variables include proxies for search

information.

The major empirical results are as follows:
(1) Variations in usual fee associated with physicians' characteristics
are

consistent

with the hypothesis that these characteristics reflect differ-

ences in quality. In particular, non—board certified pediatricians charge

II. Effects of Health on Labor Sutly and Wage Rates
Several persons have tested the

hypotheses

that exogenous improvements

in health should raise market produetivity, measured by the wage rate, and
hou1d also increase the amount of time allocated to work in the market.
Grossman

and Benham [14), for example, estimate the effects of health on

supply and wage rates in the context of fully specified structural
quations for these two components of earnings. We also examine how the

plan were followed, then
the ratio of consumption time to market goods would rise, which would cause
a

Based on this argument, health should have a positive effect on the amount of
time supplied to the market.

then its effect on

Supply reflects a pure income effect. With the market wage rate and non—
