Price Behavior in Primary Manufacturing Industries, 1958_73*

Joel Popkin

Introduction

The U.S. economy is still feeling the consequences of the sharp

acceleration of inflation in 1973—74. While the rate of increase in prices
slowed considerably ——

by half ——

in

1975, the reduced pace is still high

by historical standards and is having a significant effect on the speed

with which policies to reduce unemployment are being adopted. There is
concern that if policies designed to reduce unemployment promptly and
significantly are adopted, they will push inflation rates quickly from
their already high levels back into the double—digit range.
It is widely accepted that the acceleration of inflation to

rates above 10 percent is attributable directly to the sharp rise in
prices of primary commodities ——

food,

fuel and basic industrial materials.

Studies by Nordhaus and Shoven [1976] and Popkin [1974] show that most of
the acceleration in the Consumer Price Index and GNP deflator during
1973 and 1974 is attributable to the pass—through of the rise in prices

of primary commodities. Such attribution can be accepted regardless of
one's view about the basic causes of inflation. It could be that the
overall price level is not independent of a change in relative prices,

such as that which occurred when prices of primary commodities rose

relative to those of other goods and services. Or it could be that
monetary policy was geared, at least at first, to the validation of the
sharp rise in primary commodity prices, rather than to risking a
decline in output and employment that typically occurs when monetary
tightening is significant.

Forecasts of a return to double—digit inflation are usually
based on the assumption that commodity inflation will reemerge, rather
than that unit labor costs and unit profits will accelerate.

The term

commodity inflation as used in describing the 1973—74 experience is

loosely applied. In fact there were three components of inflation each
of which is attributable to a different cause. The most widely remarked

component is the rise in prices of farm foods, retail food purchases of

which have a very large weight in the CPI. Based on the 1967 Input—
Output Table, the agricultural industries producing these products have a

weight of 7.1 percent in GNP. The sharp increase during 1973—74 is,
like most large movements in farm prices, attributed to changes in

supply. In 1973—74 worldwide supply of grains was down markedly and
this affected directly, and indirectly through animal feed costs, the
prices of foods as they left the farm.

The successful imposition of cartel pricing is the reason for
the sharp rise in the price of imported crude oil and competing fuels——
the second component of the 1973—74 commodity inflation.

The domestic

crude oil and natural gas industry and coal mining have a weight of 1.2
percent in GNP; the importation of crude oil and refined petroleum

products increases this percentage when domestic consumption rather than

—3—
production is considered.

The third element of the recent commodity inflation is concen-

trated in primary commodities other than food and fuel. The composition
of this group requires definition. If defined similarly to food and
fuel, the group would consist of raw commodities like ores, quarry

products, cotton and trees. Many such commodities are owned by firms that do
the initial processing of them, i.e., they are owned by manufacturers of

primary commodities. Few such commodities are priced for the wholesale
price index, and except for a few items, like cotton, for which supply
shifts are important, the prices of the mineral and forestry products re—

flect the derived demand for them. What is in fact meant when reference is
made to the nonfood, nonfuel component of commodity inflation, is the

behavior of those commodities that are produced In the first stages of the
processing of the raw commodities. Such commodities can properly be termed
primary manufactures.

They consist of items like industrial chemicals,

woodpulp, lumber, cement, and steel and aluminum ingots. Their production
requires real fixed capital of which there was some indication of shortage.

The shortage of capital input rather than of the basic raw materials input
is central to the distinction and led to the characterization of the

Industries producing many of these primary manufactures as bottleneck
Industries.

In 1967 the value of shipments In these Industries was 13.1 percent

of GNP. That their importance exceeds that of raw farm products and raw
fuels reflects the fact that to the value of the raw materials these
Industries consume is added payments to labor, capital and other factors

comprising value added. In 1967 value added accounted for one third of the
value of shipments In these industries.

—4—
It is the price behavior in these primary manufacturing industries
and its implication for general inflation that is the subject of this

paper. The industries comprising primary manufacturing are quite diverse.
They differ with respect to labor and capital intensity, domestic and
—— consumer
international market structure and the markets that they supply
goods manufacturing, producer goods

manufacturing and construction. To

shed light on the price behavior of the group as a whole it is necessary

to disaggregate the total somewhat. In this study they are broken down
into eight separate industries. The exact definition of each, both in
terms of 4—digit SIC industry and 1—0 cell, is available on request. In
general, the eight separate industries

consist of the primary manufacturers

producing (1) textiles, (2) wood, (3) paper, (4) chemicals, (5) fertilizers,
(6) stone, clay and glass, (7) iron and steel, and (8) nonferrous metals.

The Model Framework
This paper is concerned with the dynamics of price movements in

certain industrial markets; focus will be on the rate of change of prices.

In the simplest case it can be assumed that a change in price reflects the
movement from one equilibrium price to

another. In other words it is entirely

explained by shifts in supply and demand curves.

There are many factors

that cause shifts in demand curves. In most empirical work such shifts are
attributed to changes in relative prices and income. In a smaller but
important number of studies changes in stocks of real and financial assets

have been added. In still more complex descriptions of demand shifts,
usually associated with demands for durable goods where intertemporal
considerations are relevant, rates of Interest play a role.

—5—
The specification of the supply function is less clear cut,
particularly with respect to sorting out the various hypotheses about

the structure of markets. The variables that enter the supply function
under the assumption of perfect competition are known because the function

is derived by positing short—run profit maximization. In imperfect markets
the variables that enter the supply function, and the form of their
functional relationship, cannot be determined unambiguously because for

one reason or another, firms in the industry may not be establishing supply
schedules with the objective of achieving short—run profit maximization.

The variables that enter supply functions under both profit maximizing
and nonprofit maximizing assumptions may look similar, so it becomes
difficult to reject many of the hypotheses about price formation.

When the notion is introduced that any kind of market need not be

in equilibrium, the problems of identification intensify. Upon comparison of
price equations that purport to reflect competitive markets that are not
always in equilibrium because of (1) uncertainty (Arrow [1959] and Debreu
[1959]), or (2) search costs (Phelps and Winter [1970] and Okun [1975]),

with those reflecting full cost pricing hypotheses in which markups vary
to achieve a target return, it becomes even more difficult to reject hypotheses

about the nature of markets. What follows is a discussion of the determinants
of price behavior in two kinds of markets and how equations that look alike
under various assumptions about market structure may nonetheless be
distinguished, albeit, in most cases, weakly.

Diagram 1 depicts price changes in a market that behaves compe-

titively and is always in equilibrium. Demand shifts may be attributable

—6—
to factors discussed above. Changes in factor prices shift supply curves
when the market is competitive and the analysis takes place over a time

period long enough for factor inputs to vary. If there are three factors
of production, labor, capital and materials, changes in the position

of the supply curve in price-quantity space will be determined by w, the

change in straight—time labor compensation per unit of time, pm, the
change in materials input prices, and r, the change in the rental price
of capital.

Diagram 2 depicts a competitive market in which price is not

always in equilibrium. That disequilibria arise is usually attributed to
variable lags on the part of sellers in changing prices. The same variables
shift the supply and demand curves, but price may be other than at

equilibrium. To pursue this case further it is useful to define the
demand curve as reflecting a schedule of orders that will be placed at
various prices and the supply curve as a schedule of production that will
be undertaken in response to various prices.

In equilibrium, production

is equal to incoming orders, and price changes occur as the production
and orders curves shift.

But if price departs from equilibrium, if, for example, it fails to
rise promptly in response to an increase in demand, orders (net of cancella-

tions) will exceed production. The short run result is some combination of
a build—up in unfilled orders and decline in finished goods inventories

(Eckstein and Frômm [1968]). Prices, of course, would rise. The degree of
disequilibrium is measured by the magnitude of the changes in unfilled orders
and finished goods inventories. The relationship between the degree of
disequilibrium and the amount of price rise needed to eliminate it includes

supply and demand elasticities. If demand and supply curves are characterized
by constant price elasticities (cz for demand,

for supply) the relationship is

finished goods inventories. The smaller the elasticity of demand and/or supply,
the larger the gap between the equilibrium and actual price for any given size
of A.

In deriving the relationship between demand and price change it

was assumed that the elasticities of supply and demand are fixed. In a short
run model of a competitive market such an assumption about the supply curve

is subject to question. A competitive supply curve with a constant elasticity
implies marginal cost is always proportional to average variable cost.'

typical case, because of the law of variable proportions, it is usually

assumed that the short—run supply curve becomes increasingly
as full capacity is approached (Arrow

[1959]). There has been much debate,

based on empirical results, about the way in which capacity utilization
should enter price equations ——

level

or change, and the expected sign

of the coefficient. For the competitive case the level is relevant in
explaining price change and the sign of the coefficient should be positive.-'

For a more general discussion of the appropriate dimensionalitY
of excess demand variables in price change equations see Laidler and
Parkin [1975].
The foregoing suggests that to explain price change in a market

that behaves competitively requires three sets of variables: (1) changes in
income, relative prices and other variables that effect changes in the orders
(demand) schedule; (2) changes in the prices

of the variable factors of

production that cause repositioning of the production (supply) curve; and
(3) a set of variables, frequently termed excess

demand measures, that

reflect the magnitude of disequilibrium and the price adjustment required

to eliminate it. Changes in unfilled orders and finished goods inventories
determine the magnitude of the quantity gap at any price.

The rate of

utilization of capacity must also be included as an explanatory variable
to put the gap into perspective with respect

to the utilization level at

which it is occurring, to test the assumption that the elasticity of the
supply curve decreases as production approaches capacity.

Unlike competitive pricing, there is no unambiguous way to describe
of
pricing under conditions of imperfect competition. A typical description

such behavior is that firms in the industry are assumed to calculate the

S

—9—
normal or standard total cost per unit of producing in the range of demand

they experience normally. If such a basis for pricing is to be practicable
to the firm, the actual unit cost of producing in this range should be fairly

constant. This requires that marginal costs be falling and rising slowly
and that when they are rising, their contribution to raising total unit
costs is at least partly offset by declining unit fixed costs.

To normal unit cost is applied a markup..Y Since standard unit
1/ The introduction of the word "markup" in a discussion of imperfect
competition should not be interpreted as implying
markup pricing is a
hypothesis relating to behavior in such markets. Markup pricing is, of
course, simply a rule used by firms in the absence of information. What
distinguishes perfect from imperfect markets, as has been most recently
demonstrated by de Menu [1974] is whether price is a markup over marginal
costs (competitive) or average costs.
costs are'likely to vary among firms while price must be roughly similar
among sellers (particularly in homogeneous oligopolistic markets), normal

markups will vary among firms. On average for the industry they will
probably be set so as to achieve some target rate of return on investment.
It is when price behavior appears geared to the achievement of some target
rate of return on Investment that the inference is usually drawn that perfect competition does not obtain.

As long as demand remains In the range consistent with normal unit

costs, price (markup) will not change. When demand moves outside the range
there are three basic possible kinds of behavior. The first is that markups
always behave procycllcly, that they rise when demand exceeds the output
on which normal unit costs were calculated and that they fall when demand

—10-drops below normal output. A second possibility is that markups remain
constant even when demand deviates from the normal output range

——

markups

are neutral cyclicly. The third possibility is that markups rise when
demand is below normal output but fall when demand exceeds normal output;
in other words markups behave anticyclicly.

There are, of course, variants of these three behavioral possi-

bilities. One may obtain when demand exceeds the normal output range, another

when demand falls below it. Such combinations of behavior are usually referred
to as asymmetries (Schültze and Tryon [1965]). In all there are nine
combinations of the three basic patterns.

The connection between the achievement of a target rate of return and
the various types of markup behavior needs to be touched upon.' In situations
in which demand exceeds normal output, the selection of procyclical, anti—

cyclical or cyclicly neutral markup behavior depends on the differences
between the elasticities of total revenue and total costs with respect to
changes in volume.

The elasticity of costs with respect

to volume can be

assumed to be greater than one for changes in volume beyond the normal output

range. The size of the elasticity will depend on the size of fixed costs
relatiVe to variable costs.

If fixed costs are large, their decline will

likely offset more of the rise in variable costs than if fixed costs are

small. The elasticity of total revenue with respect to volume will depend
on the price elasticity of demand.

If it is greater than one a rise

In total revenue will be associated with an expansion of sales volume.
Therefore if the price elasticity of demand is large in the range beyond
normal output and the total cost elasticity, though greater than one, is

—11—
small (because fixed costs are large relative to variable costs), it may
be that a reduction in markups will cause absolute profits to be maintained

or even rise. In that case constant or declining markups will be consistent with the achievement of target returns. If total revenue is
inelastic, or less elastic than total costs, a rising markup is required
to achieve the target.

%hen demand falls below the normal output range it is likely that
average variable costs, and of course, average fixed costs, are rising

with each unit reduction in output. However, total costs may be rising
or falling. Total revenues may also rise or fall in response to a reduction
in sales volume depending on the elasticity of demand. Again it is possible
that procyclical, anticyclical or cyclicly neutral behavior of markups will
be consistent with maintaining target returns.

The foregoing analysis has assumed that firms continue to strive
for target returns even when demand falls outside the range of normal out-

put. However, if firms in an industry regard such demand shifts as cyclical
and are striving to earn a long run target return, they may not change markups
at all, regardless of the relationship of demand to normal output. In such
instances markups would be cyclicly neutral, but would vary secularly with
changes in the target and the capital—output ratio.

-1Nordhaus and Godley [1972] found that for the UK manufacturing
sector (excluding food, beverages and tobacco) markups were cyclicly neutral.
There is no single variable uniquely appropriate for explaining

changes in markups. But any such variable should reflect the relationship of
demand to potential supply. Potential supply can be represented by

To test the hypothesis that the behavior of markups depends on
whether demand is greater than or less than normal output, markups could be
posited as a third order function of ED:

But such a form is difficult to test in a meaningful way because of multi—

collinearity among the three variables, all of which contain dED. A more
promising avenue is to construct two different variables. One would measure

dED when ED is less than its mean, or less than a range around its mean,
dt
and be set to zero otherwise. A similar variable would measure dED above the
dt
range of normal levels of ED.

In summary it appears that nthtcompetitive and competitive disquilibrium

price change models can be distinguished in two ways. The first is with
respect to the way in which excess demand is introduced and the expected sign

of the coefficient. The target return model appears to call for variables
measuring the change in excess demand. By using such variables, separated
to test for asymmetries, or along with level variables to test for non—j

linearities, the broad spectrum of noncompetitive hypotheses can be evaluated. In
competitive markets price change would appear to be positively related to the
change in unfilled orders and the level of capacity utilization and negatively
to the change in finished goods inventories.

The second respect in which the models differ is in the form the

supply shifters take. In competitive models, changes in wage rates and

—14—
material prices perform this function. In the model of imperfect competition
described above, the role is assumed by changes in standard unit costs,
perhaps separated into unit labor and unit materials cost)' The methods

usually used to estimate changes in standard unit costs are tantamount to
subtracting from the changes in the various factor prices, say, wage—rates,

the trend rates of change in productivity. If the trend in productivity is
constant, the resulting series resembles the wage rate series itself.

Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish markets based on the alternative
uses of factor prices and normal unit factor costs in industries in which
the trend growth of productivity is constant.- Because of this, and the

Explicit demand shifters are not specified in the equations.

However, in the competitive case, shifts in demand, when there are no
disequilibria, are reflected in the numerator of the capacity utilization

variable. The new orders variable plays a similar role in the target markup equations.

The Data

The data are taken from five primary sources: Censuses and Annual
Surveys of Manufactures (Census Bureau), monthly series on manufacturers'
inventories, shipments, new and unfilled orders (Census Bureau), component
series of the monthly wholesale price index (Bureau of Labor Statistics),

— 16 —
of Labor
monthly series on employment, hours and earnings (Bureau

Statistics) and components of the monthly idustria1 production index
(Federal Reserve Board). Data at the three and four digit SIC level (six
and eight digit wholesale price index categories) are combined to form
aggregates for each of the eight primary manufacturing sectors. The
four—digit composition of each of the eight sectors is available on

request. For flow variables, the monthly series is seasonally adjusted
and quarterly averages are formed. For stock variables, monthly series
are seasonally adjusted and the observations for the terminal months

of each calendar quarter are used. The series have been constructed for
1958—75 and most are available monthly.
Some special series and methods of construction of particular
series require further amplification.
Prices —— The BLS concordance between its eight—digit WPI commodity

codes and the Census Bureau's seven—digit codes is used to select the index
components for each of the eight sectors.

The indexes are combined using

1967 shipments weights from the Census of Manufactures. Shipments among
the four—digit industries in each sector are netted out of the weights,
using Information on Interindustry sales from the 1967 Input—Output table.
A number of series have some missing monthly observations within the length
of the series and/or either begin or end within the sample period.

Missing

monthly observations are interpolated. When a series ends within the sample
period, a substitute is linked in. When a new series is introduced after
the beginning of the sample period, a weight is allocated to it (by splitting

a relevant weight) and the new series is linked in. To avoid this procedure

— 17 —

as much as possible, six and sometimes four—digit rather than eight—digit
indexes are used; the higher the level of aggregation, the fewer the

discontinuities. When this is done, advantages, both computational and
with respect to introducing judgments about which series are substitutes
for others, are offset to some extent by the Imprecision stemming from
the fact that the four— and six—digit indexes that are used have been
aggregated by BLS, using 1963 rather than 1967 weights.

Capacity utilization —— The method is that originally used at

the Wharton School. FRB monthly production indexes are plotted and linear
trend lines fitted to their peaks. The trend lines are assumed to reflect
output at capacity in each period. Some judgment Is introduced in setting
the trend line prior to the first peak in the production series and after
the last one.

Finished goods inventories —— The Census Bureau's monthly survey

of inventories, shipments, new and unfilled orders does not provide data on
inventories by stage—of—fabrication in the detail required by this study.
Such data are available for the end of each calendar year from the Censuses

and Annual Surveys of Manufactures. So, too, are annual data on shipments
and the value of production (shipments plus change in inventories of

finished goods and goods—in—process). Annual shipments data are interpolated
monthly by using the monthly shipments data. The annual value of production is Interpolated monthly, using an index that is the product of the
monthly FRB production indexes and the price indexes described above. The
year—end stock of inventories of finished goods and goods—in—process is
then moved forward a month at a time by adding the value of production
and subtracting shipments.

— 18 —

Because annual control totals from the Census and Annual Surveys are used,
the resulting stock at the end of year t + 1 ties into the Census data.
Since the production and shipments series used are seasonally adjusted the
implicit seasonal in the derived inventory series is December

= 1.00.

The measure just described is of inventories of finished goods and goods—
in—process because only that total can be interpolated by shipments and
production data.

Average hourly earnings —— These are data for production workers,
and are adjusted by BLS to exclude the effect of overtime and interindustry

shifts. They have been adjusted further for purposes of this study to
incorporate fringe benefits; the average hourly earnings series are multi-

plied by the ratio of labor costs to payrolls for production workers.
These monthly ratios are the linear interpolation of similar ratios,

obtained annually from Censuses and Annual Survey for the years 1957 and

1967—71. The ratio of labor costs to payrolls does have a cyclical
component because fringe payments are related to the number of production

workers employed (full time) rather than to hours worked. The use of the
annual average however appears to eliminate much of the cyclical component.

The basic straight—time wage data —— so adjusted ——

are

published at the two

digit level only. Accordingly the particular series used for each of the
eight sectors had to be estimated based on average hourly earnings and hours
worked and overtime hours data at the three and four digit SIC level.

Haterials prices —— With the exceptiono the price of cotton in
the textile sector, phosphate in the fertilizer sector, iron ore and coal
in the steel sector, and sand, gravel, and stone in the stone, clay, and
glass sector, the only prices that enter are those of commodities purchased
by the eight sectors from each other and from utilities and the petroleum

—19—

industry. Prices for some of the forestry and mineral products purchased
by the eight industries —— copper ore, trees, etc. ——

are

not available;

many forests and mineral deposits are owned by the manufacturers that pro-

cess them. Even if prices for a broader range of crude industrial materials were available it is likely that, in the absence of cartel arrangements, they would move primarily with demand (derived demand case)

because supply is relatively fixed. Of course, this is not true of
cotton; there are substantial fluctuations in each year's crop. Prices
of purchased services other than labor are ignored as are purchases of

intermediate and finished manufactured goods. The latter are very small,
a reflection of the fact that the 1—0 structure of the U.S. economy is
nearly triangular.

Deflation —— Each quarter's new orders are deflated by that quarter's
price index, since the WPI components more nearly reflect the prices at
which orders are taken rather than those at which shipments are made. Both
unfilled orders and inventories (finished goods and goods—in—process) at
the end of each quarter are deflated by the average price index for the

quarter. The ratios of unfilled orders and inventories to new orders
are almost always less than one, except in the case of steel. Therefore
the stock of unfilled orders at the end of a quarter reflects primarily
orders placed during the quarter and the finished goods and goods—in—
process inventories, production undertaken during the quarter.

Some Preliminary Quantitative Analysis

The sharp increase in prices of primary manufactured goods that began
in the second half of 1972 amounted to 27 percent before it ended in April

1974. This increase together with those in farm and crude oil prices
comprise the commodity inflation that wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy,
as well as those of other industrialized countries of the free world. One
can argue that because of the exogenous nature of the events in the farm

and crude oil sectors, the tools of economics are not geared to predict

the resulting inflation in those sectors. The same cannot be said of the
rise in prices of primary manufactured goods. It was the unpredicted
nature of this development that would appear to be a major element in the
recent criticisms focusing on the shortcomings of economics.
It is the purpose of this paper to determine whether, with the help

of hindsight, the inflation in the primary manufacturing sector can be explained through the use of econometric models.

But not all economic

analysis, particularly forecasting, is based on econometric method. So it
is useful to see whether a less formal analysis of relevant data provides
any hints of the emergence of the inflation in prices of primary manufactured
goods.

The rate of capacity utilization is usually a key variable in price
forecasts for specific commodity—producing sectors of the economy. Capacity

utilization rates rose to very high levels during 1973—74 ——

but

virtually

they had done so in 1965—66 as well, without producing a

cribed above, and those for total manufacturing, as measured by the Wharton

—21—

index. Both series plotted on the chart are deviations from trend calculated
by regressing the log of the capacity utilization rate on a linear time trend.
These data confirm that trend deviations of capacity utilization in primary

manufacturing were only slightly larger than those for total manufacturing
in 1973—74; in 1965—66, trend deviations in both series were about the same.
In both 1973—74 and in 1965—66, trend deviations in both series were positive
and large.

It Is clear that the full capacity rates of utilization alone cannot
explain the differences in the Inflation in primary prices between 1965—66

and 1973—74 experiences. When capacity utilization nears 100 percent it
will fail to capture the full extent of excess demand, if demand exceeds

potential output. When this happens one would expect inventories of primary
materials ——

finished

goods Inventories of primary producers and materials

and supplies inventories of users of primary materials ——

to

decline, and/or

unfilled orders placed with primary producers to rise.
In Charts 2 and 3 are plotted trend deviations of unfilled orders—ship-

ments ratios and inventory—shipments ratios (based on finished goods and
goods—in—process inventories of primary manufacturers) for primary manufac-

turers and for the total manufacturing sector. Inventory—shipments ratios
of primary manufacturers show much larger negative deviations from trend in
1973—74 than 1965—66, both absolutely and vis—a—vis manufacturing as a whole.

They were the largest for the entire sample period except for one quarter in
1959 in which steel producers' finished goods Inventories were drawn down by

orders In anticipation of a strike. It is also interesting to note that
while capacity utilization was high in manufacturing as a whole in both

—22—

periods, negative deviations from trend in the inventory—sa]5ratios were
no larger on average during 1973—74 than during 1965—66, so manufacturers
of goods beyond the primary stage were able to keep up with demand without
drawing on inventories.
Similar signs of the high degree of excess demand facing primary manufacturers are found in the behavior of the unfilled orders—shipments ratios

in Chart 2. Except for the effect of the steel strike in 1959, the size of
the positive deviations (from trend) during 1973—74 of the unfilled orders—
shipments ratio for primary manufacturers its trend is unparalleled in the

sample period. Again it is of interest that for manufacturing as a whole
deviations of the ratio from trend were no larger in 1973—74 than in 1965—66.
When capacity utilization, inventory—shipments ratios and unfilled
orders—shipments ratios are considered jointly, it is clear that in 1973—74

demand for primary commodities exceeded supply by substantially more than
it had at any time during the 1958—72 period.

And it also appears that

data are not available that would permit this kind
of analysis for the Korean War period.
i-"

Unfortunately,

in 1973—74 excess demand for primary products was far greater than for other

manufactures —— a situation that was not attendant to the high rates of
capacity utilization in 1965—66.

The analysis that led to these conclusions could not have been carried
out with data on inventories, shipments and unfilled orders at the level at

which

they

are published by the Census Bureau. The closest one can come to

—23—

approximating values for the primary industries, as defined in this study,
is to analyze the behavior of shipments, inventories and unfilled orders
for published market classification groupings "construction, ... and other

materials and supplies." These categories are very broad, covering all
manufacturing except finished goods production. And

only

total inventories,

not finished goods inventories, are available for the groupings. Use of
these data, such as they are, to infer behavior in the primary industries
that are included in these broad aggregates turns out to understate the
extent of excess demand primary producers faced.

The data indicate that

the magnitude of the rise in unfilled orders—shipments ratios and decline

in inventory—shipments ratios were only half as large during 1973—74 as
those that obtained for the primary groupings.

Regression Results

Two general comments are appropriate at the Outset —— one about the

sample period, the other about lags. The data required for the analysis
are available beginning in 1958, the first year for which detailed data on
orders, inventories and shipments are obtainable.

The first observation,

however, reflects the lag terms used for the variables in each sector,
with the result that the sample period begins in 1959 in most industries.

The terminal point is l973—IV. The reason for ending the sample period in
1973 is to provide extra actual observations with which to compare forecasts generated by each of the four equations for each sector. Thus, conditional forecasts will be reported for 1974 and 1975, admittedly a rigorous
period over which to test price equations.

24

With respect to lags, two different strategies are employed. The first

relates to the input price variable. The current output

frequent price changes are

changes in factor prices for various reasons:

not costless; firms may not mark up existing materials' inventories when
prices rise for materials ordered currently; etc. Indeed wage rates and
materials prices may have different lag structures.

Accordingly, the input

price change variable was inserted as a second order polynomial running
from "t"

to

"t—7". Examination of these Almon lag coefficients, some of

which were negative, and their stability over various time periods, led to

negative or small positive weights were dropped.

In two industries, fertil-

izers and nonferrous metals, separate lag structures were developed for

materials price and wages. Once the lag terms and their weights were so
decided, they were combined into one variable.
The excess demand variables are all measured in t1t11t except for the

lumber industry. The underlying assumption is that the bulk of the adjustment to excess demand is based on what has been perceived in the recent

of the excess demand variables. A distributed lag is not deemed

appropriate.

Current values of excess demand variables are used in the

case of lumber, prices of which appear to adjust very quickly.

—25—

The results obtained upon estimation of the competitive disequilibrium
and the three target markup models for each of the eight industries are

found in Table 1. Pn analysis of those results by industry follows.

Textiles

Textile prices appear to be explained best by equation three. All three
variables in the equation are significant at the five percent level. Mark-

ups are procyclical and nonlinear. The markup rises at ancreasing rate
which suggests some underlying target return objective. Over the observed
range of ED it adds between 0.50 and 0.63 percent to price changes, at an
annual rate, accounting on average for one—tenth of the average absolute

change in price. The regression coefficient of the variable measuring
wages and material's prices is less than unity. When the industry is In
equilibrium, with the ED variable at its mean level, prices drift up about
two percent per year, perhaps reflecting increases in the capital—labor

ratio; industry analysts have noted increasing use of capital in textile
manufacturing.

Lumber

Prices fluctuate more in the lumber industry than in the other seven

primary sectors. Input prices are not significant.

Capacity utilization

-'The input price index consists only of wages. Tree prices are not
available and their meaning would be unclear since many large lumber companies own their own natural resources.

is clearly significant in the competitive disequilibrium model, while the

disequilibrium measures ——

inventories

and unfilled orders ——

are

not

—26—

significant at the five percent level. None of the excess demand variables
are significant in the other three equations; the input price measure is,

although it has an unacceptably large coefficient. These results suggest
that lumber prices behave quite competitively and are usually close to being

in equilibrium. Over its observed range, capacity utilization contributes
between 0.9 and 1.2 percent to price change, at an annual rate, an average

about one—tenth of the average absolute change in price. The range of contribution is quite small which is reflected in the rather low percentage of

variance explained by the equation. In equilibrium, with capacity utilization
at its mean, prices drift upward at a rate of almost one percent per year.

Paper
Prices in the paper industry are positively related to input prices,

unfilled orders and capacity utilization in the best result which appears

to be given by the competitive disequilibrium model. A one percent rise in
unfilled orders when capacity utilization is at its observed peak causes
prices to rise at a 0.5 percent annual rate; a one percent decline in
orders when capacity utilization is at its observed low results in virtually

no price change. On average, the demand—related variables account for one—
tenth of the average absolute change in price.

Chemicals

Chemical prices respond positively to input prices and the level of

ED in the best result which is for equation 3. The level of ED over its
observed range contributes between 0.29 and 0.34 percent at an annual rate,
accounting on average for one—fifth of the average absolute change in

—27—

price. But the range of contribution is obviously quite small so the

result

is similar to a cyclicly neutral outcome. However, prices of many basic
industrial chemicals during most of the sample period were obtained by the
BLS from trade journal sources and may not reflect transactions prices.

Fertilizers

The best explanation of changes in fertilizer prices is obtained from

equation 3. Input prices are not significant but the change in ED has a
significant negative sign, the level of ED, a significant positive one. The

implication is that the markup rises at an increasing rate. However, contributions of the variables over the observed range of ED are in a very

narrow range either side of zero, so the result is close to cyclicly
neutral price behavior.

Stone, clay and glass

The results for the stone, clay and glass industry give the most clear

cut outcome of cyclicly neutral price behavior. The only significant variable explaining price change is input price change (the regression coefficients of the Input price variable in all four equations are not signif-

icantly different from unity). Of course, this conclusion refers to the
three component industries as a whole and not to any one specifically.

Steel

The steel industry Is the only one in which the percentage change in
excess demand is significant with a negative sign —— a strong suggestion of

target return pricing. This result is consistent with the findings of
others. The change in ED is negative and significant at the ten and five
percent level in equations 2 and 3 respectively. In equation 4, the sign of

—28—

the change variable at below_normal—demand levels is negative. However,
the decline in markup for increases in ED over their observed range is

quite small. While the

R2 in the competitive disequilibrium equations are

slightly higher than in the target markup version, the structural estimates

are subject to question, particularly the significant negative sign of the
coefficient for unfilled orders.

Nonferrous metals

Nonferrous metals prices behave competitively and are best described

by the competitive disequilibrium model. Changes in finished goods inventories are negatively related to price change while the level of capacity

utilization is positively related. A one percent decline in inventories
when capacity utilization is at its observed peak causes prices to rise
at a 0.7 percent annual rate; a one percent rise in inventories when
capacity is at its observed low results in virtually no price change.
*

****

The foregoing analysis of results in each of the eight sectors has
focused on the findings with respect to structure. The findings are supported by, in addition to "t" statistics, relatively high R2's for
quarterly price change equations and, more importantly, by standard errors
that are about equal to or less than the average absolute price change
during the sample period in half of the industries analyzed.

However,

structure may change. An important indicator of the stability of structure
is the results obtained when the equations are used to produce forecasts
outside the sample period.

—29—

The "best" equations in Table 1 for the sample period ending in l973—IV

were used to make conditional forecasts of 1974 and 1975. The results are
found in Table 3. Viewed in the absolute the results are disappointing.
But in the context of the size of the price increases that occurred, the

results are encouraging in one important respect. They indicate the equation structures, as estimated through 1973, were adequate to forewarn of
price increases in 1974 that were clearly much higher than any that had
occurred during the sample period; in every industry in which "double—digit"
inflation occurred in 1974, double—digit inflation was predicted.

There is undoubtedly room to improve the analysis reported in this

paper. Further experimentation can be undertaken with respect to the lag
structures and the way in which nonlinearities are introduced. World—wide
demand, real and speculative, for the products of many of these industries

was said to be very strong in 1973 and 1974. It might be fruitful to
include some additional measures of this demand, such as orders for these
products placed abroad by U.S. firms or the price of the various commodities

Care must be taken,

Orders placed by foreigners with U.S. firms are already reflected
in the orders variables in the equations.

commodities in the U.S. and the rest of the world and the effect of such demand on price in 1974 not be taken as the sole basis for inferring a structural relationship between U.S. and foreign demand during the entire period

Equations have been estimated by Cooper and Lawrence (1975) for
1950—74 in which the percentage change in world prices of nonferrous metals

world exports of manufactured goods. The authors conclude that demand can
go a substantial way in explaining the commodity price boom of 1972—74. But
it does not appear from the sketchy statistics they report that by incorporating world demand factors they can explain more of the price boom than
has been explained in the regressions reported abovewhich rely only on demand
variables for the U.S.

too—distant future.

Summy
The findings reported here indicate that changes in prices of primary
industrial commodities are positively related to changes in demand in six

of the eight industries studied. In the stone, clay and glass sector,
pricing appears to be completely insensitive to demand, while in the steel

in excess demand. In

industry price changes vary inversely with changes

these two industries, the results support the acceptance of the target

return hypothesis. In three of the industries ——

textiles,

chemicals and

fertilizers, one of the target return equations fits best but the behavior

of markups is procyclical. In the remaining three

industries ——

lumber,

paper and nonferrous metals, the competitive equation provides the best

fit. The variables that enter the competitive and target return models,
and the form in which they enter, differ mainly with respect to whether
capacity utilization enters price change equations in level or change form.
But, there is enough similiarity among the variables to preclude rejection
of either hypothesis when the target return model yields the result that the

markups behave procyclicly.

—31—

The results indicate that quantitative analysis ——

or

could have pointed up the impending large rise in the

prices of primary manufactures, if the relevant data for the manufacturing
sector had been available by stage of process classifications, and in par-

ticular for the primary processing stage. The high levels of capacity
utilization for primary processors in 1973—74, accompanied by data reflecting the unprecedented (for 1958—73) rise in unfilled orders—shipment ratio
and decline in finished goods inventories—shipments ratio, seems adequate
to have warned the noneconomettic forecaster that demand was unusually

strong vis—a—vis supply. When these variables are introduced formally,
together with input prices, into equations estimated through 1973 they provide forecasts of price increases in 1974, which, while considerably below
actual increases, were larger than those of the preceding 15 years by
enough to suggest an unusual burst of increase among prices of primary
manufactures was imminent.
