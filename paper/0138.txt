Introduction

This paper is concerned with the growth of individual earnigns over

time. Four aspects of time are distinguished: experience, age, vintage and
calendar year. The first and most widely studied is accumulated work experience, i.e. time spent earning and learning on the job. The second is the
process of aging, which occurs even if the worker is out of the labor force.

Vintage represents the time in history during which the individual was being

educated. The general advance in knowledge implies that more recent cohorts
(especially Ph.D. scientists) may enter the labor force with greater earning

capacity and/or greater learning ability. The final aspect is the point in
time in which the individual's earnings are observed. The passage of time
brings changes in market conditions which may represent trends in supply or
demand, business cycles and special circumstances relevant only to a partic-

ular year. Each of these aspects has different implications for individual
earnings growth, which shall be explored in this study.

The first section of the paper provides a brief outline of a theory

of planned growth in earnings. As in the works of Becker (1964), Mincer (1962,
1974), Ben Porath (1967) and Rosen (1972, 1973), the emphasis of the model is

on investment in on—the—job training. Ours is a generalization in which the
roles of age, time and vintage are discussed separately from experience.
The second and main section of the paper is devoted to an empirical
attempt to estimate the role of experience, vintage and age on the growth
in earnings and to separate these effects from exogenous changes in market

conditions. A fundamental problem arises in the identification of the separate effects on earnings of each of the various aspects of time. The source
of the difficulty is that causal factors which vary with time and experience,

2

such as market conditions and the individual's allocation of human capital

to the market, are not measured directly. When the various dimensions of
nominal time itself are used as explanatory variables, some obvious identi-

ties emerge. For instance, over time the change in time equals the change

in experience and age of fully employed scientists for each cohort. Similarly, at a point of time an additional year of experience implies a year

older vintage for continuously employed scientists. We present a detailed
specification of the earnings function which accounts for the inherent multi—

collinearity between variables such as time, vintage and experience. One
of our main objectives is to point out the implications of this identifica-

tion problem for the analysis of earnings data. Though we cannot completely
eliminate this difficulty, longitudinal data, which follows the same individuals over a period of time, allows us to identify more aspects of time
than one could obtain from a single cross section.

Our data source is the Longitudinal File from the National Register

of Scientific and Technical Personnel. Most of our results relate to scientists with a Ph.D. who reported continuously at two—year intervals during

the decade 1960—1970. The real earnings of these scientists grew by an
average of 4.7 percent per annum. We estimate that at most two percentage
points of this rather substantial annual growth rate in earnings is due to

exogenous time effects. At least 2.7 percentage points can be attributed
to the accumulation of experience. The contribution of experience is shown
to depend negatively on age and positively on vintage. These results are
in the direction predicted by our theory. There is also a positive effect

of being male, of graduating from a top—ten—ranked school and of being

employed 1 academics.

3

A special emphasis is given to the rather novel finding of a positive

vintage effect on the growth of earnings. (This should be distinguished
from the vintage effects on the level of earnings which were first discussed

by Welch (1973].) It is shown that this effect leads to a systematic divergence between cross—section and actual lifetime earnings profiles. Specifically, previous estimates, based upon cross—section data, tend to underestimate
the true effect of experience and schooling on earnings.

We provide a descriptive analysis of the exogenous changes in mar-

ket conditions occurring during the period. No attempt is made to relate
them to causal changes, such as past and expected future enrollment and

government research grants. We find two basic tendencies: (1) Over the
decade as a whole, scientists in academic institutions enjoyed better market
conditions and thus a higher growth rate than those employed in private

industry. (2) Toward the end of the d'cade1 there is a marked reduction
in the market's contribution to the growth rate. In some fields, such as
physics, we note an actual reduction in the real earnings of new entrants.
We conclude with a brief discussion of the changes in relative earn-

ings over the decade by field and type of employer. These results summarize
the combined effects of experience and time. Both worsening market conditions and lower experience—related growth caused the difference in earnigns
between private industry and academics to fall from 32 percent in 1960 (for

the 1958 cohort? to 12 percent in 1970 (for the same cohort). We also find
that strong experience effects helped in some cases to mitigate the reduc-

tion in earnings in fields which suffered a relative decline in demand. For
instance, while real starting salaries in physics grew at a considerably
lower rate than those for scientists in general during the decade, the relative earnings of cohorts which entered prior to 1960 were only slightly
affected by the changing market conditions.

I. A Model of Earnings Growth
In this section we present a simple model of investment in human
capital from which we derive an optimal rule for the growth in earnings.

AnalyticallY, the novel aspect of the model is that the rate of growth in
earnings is Independent of initial conditions, so that the analysis of factors determining the level of earnings can be separated from those affect-

ing its growth. This feature is convenient for an empirical analysis which
focuses on differences in earnings growth. We specify the channels through
which vintage and age may affect the growth in earnings.
Consider an individual who enters the labor force at time i.

He is

endowed with an initial level of human capital K(O) (i.e., earning capacity)
and a production function for new human capital which depends on his vintage

and age. The production function is most conveniently defined in terms of
"time," i.e., the proportion of earning capacity which is sacrificed to

obtain a given rate of growth in his capital stock. Analytically,

(1)

y =

dK 1

G (—j t)

where 0 < y <

1 is the proportion of earnings capacity retained,

is the

rate of accumulation of human capital, K, and tisage. We assume that both
partial derivatives of C are negative. Thus at each age a larger sacrifice
of current earning is necessary to acquire a higher rate of accumulation.

This is a restriction imposed by equilibrium wage structure. As the individual
becomes older, it is increasingly difficult to obtain additional knowledge

for a given investment of time. Notice that the production function is
assumed to be independent of time.

5

The individual forms expectations on future prices which will obtain
at time t =

i+

r. On basis of these expectations he chooses an investment

plan which maximizes the expected present value of his real lifetime earnings.

We assume that on average his lifetime expectations are correct so that no

revision of the optimal plan is necessary. We can thus view the development
of earnings as consisting of a permanent part which reflects the optimal plan
which the individual chooses upon entering the labor force and a transistory
part which reflects unexpected changes in prices, or technology.
Earnings

can thus be written as

K*(j,.r) Y*(M,T)R(t)D(t)

where R(t) =

is the rental rate of human capital,1 Re() is the

expected rental rate and D(t) denotes unexpected deviations which reflect

unforeseen changes in demand or supply. K*(p,T) denoted the optimal level
of capital which is controlled by the individual through his choice of y*(p,T).

A specific solution of the individual optimization problem requires

the specification of the trade—off functions C (.). In general there will be
different production functions associated with school and on—the—job training.2

For the sake of brevity, we shall consider only post—school investment. We
assume that the trade—off function for such an investment is:

where 8(t) is an efficiency parameter which depends on age, and 6(t) is

the rate of depreciation of K, which also depends on age. The fixed parameter

6

a

governs the concavity of the trade—off function. Concavity is assumed to

avoid jumps in the level of investment. The specification (3) is in the
spirit of Blinder and Weiss [1976] and Rosen [1975]. It assumes a different
type of neutrality from the one first suggested by Ben Porath [1967]. In

is indepen-

dent of K0 in the Ben Porath formulation. The multiplicative model (2) and
(3) leads naturally to log earning as a dependent variable. In this sense
it is more consistent with empirical practice.

The model leads to the following differential equation for planned

Equation (4) shows quite clearly the effects of the various exogenous

factors on the planned growth in earnings. A permanent increase in the interest
rate or the depreciation rate will lead to a lower growth rate. A permanent
increase in the xpected rate of change of the rental rate g leads to a
steeper earnings profile. For example, a 1 percent increase in g produces a more
than 1 percent increase in the growth of observed earnings. This reflects
the increased profitability of investment in human capital when the rate of

growth in productivity Is higher. When the rate growth or interest is expected
to vary, an Individual will shift his investment so that higher growth In
earnings will be observed when the real interest rate Is low or when the growth

In the real rental rate, g, is high. Diferences in 8, the efficiency parameter,

may

arise

from differences in individual ability. A person with greater learn-

ing ability will have a steeper log earnings profile.

The effects of age are reflected in the dependence of productivity and

depreciation on age. Generally speaking, they tend to introduce concavity in
the log earning profile. In the special case in which learning efficiency 8
is independent of age while the depreciation rate 6 increases linearly with
age or experience, the log earning profile will be quadratic in experience.
This is the form popularized by Mincer [1974).
The effect of vintage on the rate of growth in earnings is through

its effect on the efficiency parameter 8. This effect should be distinguished
from the possible effects of vintage on the level of earnings through increases

in the Initial earning capacity K(O). A potential systematic source of
vintage effects is a process of learning by doing. In the simplest case each
generation can be viewed as starting with a higher initial level of human
capital, thus embodying the knowledge accumulated by past generations..3

8

Within our model such an increase will not affect investment behavior and
later vintages will have uniformly a higher level of human capital throughout

their life. If the initial human capital stock of each vintage grows at a

constant rate, so will the aggregate over all age groups. The model then
becomes identical ot one in which a population grows at a constant exogenous
rate.

It seems clear that past knowledge is not transmitted in such a cost-

less, one—shot fashion. In fact, schools and firms serve as a vehicle for the

intergenerational transfer of knowledge. The embodiment of past knowledge
requires the investment of time on the part of the individual and is, there-

fore, spread over a considerable part of his life. As general knowledge
accumulates, recent vintages benefit more from the investment of their time

In school. It seems plausible that they also become more "efficient" in
terms of their learning on the job. Put differently, the rate of transmission
depends jointly on the stock of existing knowledge as well as on the amount
of time (and other resources) that each individual spends learning, and on

the amount of resources which are spent teaching him. It is obvious that
such a trend of increasing learning efficiency is not neutral with respect

to its effect on the shape of the investment plan. Other things being equal,

new vintages will tend to invest more in human capital. They will spend
more time in school and their earning profiles will be steeper.4
For the purpose of empirical implementation, it is important to distinguish between two alternative specifications of the increase in Individual

learning efficiency. We may assume that the parameter

depends simply on

the chronological time of investment. Thus, Independently of the date of entry

into the labor force all Investors at time t have equal learning efficiency.
Under such circumstances there will be a motivation to postpone the investment

9

in human capital. It is possible, for instance, that individuals will decide
to enter or re—enter school at later stages of their life.

An alternative

view which is perhaps more plausible is that at each point of time the general
advance knowledge affects individuals differentially depending upon how recently

their human capital was acquired. The reason is that new knowledge is often
different from past knowledge. For example, a different technique, a different
theory, and occasionally a different language may be used to present it. Therefore, recent vintages will find the general advance of knowledge to be more

complementary to their human capital and will be relatively more efficient in
producing new human capital than older vintages at any given point in time.
An extreme version of this view, one that allows us to retain the simple
structure of the individual maximization problem, is that each successive
vintage is endowed with a superior production function (i.e.,higher

B as

well as higher 1(e) for new knowledge which remains fixed throughout life.5

II. Empirical Implementation

A. Specification
In order to apply the model to data, we need to specify the exogenous

variables which appear in equation (4). The basic simplifying assumption is
that the effects of age, vintage, and other causal factors, such as sex, level

and quality of schooling and type of employer, are linear. We further assume
that the rental rate is expected to grow at some constant rate, while the

interest rate is expected to remain constant. Planned earnings then satisfy
the equation:

where T is age, j.i

is

vintage and x,, j3, J, are other factors which affect

growth.

Rather than estimating equation (6) direct1y using first differences
in the log of individual earnings, we shall estimate its coefficients from a

corresponding level equation. The reason is that we want to estimate the
exogenous time effects on the level which would allow us to separate unexpected
changes in demand from more systematic causes of the growth in earnings.
Using equation (2) and integrating equation (6) for every individual
from

(7)

to t, we obtain the earnings level equation:

In Y(t,p) =

in Y + a0(t-) + a1[T2(t) -t2()] + a2(t-) + E a.x.(t-p)
+ in D(t).

The function D(t) is specified by a dummy variable for each year of observa-

tion. The initial level of earnings is given by

Substituting from equations (8) and (9) into (7), we obtain the basic functional form which we shall estimate.

One important aspect of this final specification needs to be con-

sidered further. The following identity is satisfied for every observation
on each individual:

(10)

Year of highest degree + Experience = Year of observation, or
u

+ t—p

t.

This identity implies an exact collinearity which forces one of the three
variables —

vintage,

experience or time —

to

be dropped from the regression.

The coefficient of t'he two remaining variables will then incorporate its

effect. We omit the effect of vintage on starting salaries, i.
the coefficient of experience will be (a0 —

'), while

Therefore,

the year dummies will

include the effect of
Notice that no information is lost by estimating the model in a

level form. In particular, a0, the cohort average rate of growth over a
given period (with all other variables being zero), can be estimated by
adding the coefficient of the appropriate year dummy, divided by the length
of the period, to the experience coefficient.
By using data on the level and not merely the growth in earnings, we
can, to some extent, break the total cohort growth into experience, time and

vintage effects. The level equation also measures the growth in earnings
between any pair of years net of the effect of experience. The crucial issue
is whether this growth is due to the difference in time or is due to the
difference in vintage between the observations for which experience is the

same. One extreme possibility is that all growth is in starting salaries

12

and is thus vintage specific. Thereare no changes in the rental rate
for human capital and thus no further exogenous effects on the cohorts' earn-

ings. Hence, all further growth is attributed to additional experience acquired

by the cohort. The true experience effect (evaluated at zero level of experience) is in this case a0. The other extreme possibility is that the growth
in starting salaries reflects the general growth in the economy which, at a
given point of time, benefits identical members of the labor force equally,

irrespective of experience. In this case the true experience effect (evaluated at zero level of experience) is a0 —

Since in general

will include

some presumably positive element which is vintage specific, we shall identify
a0 as the upper bound on the experience effect and a0 —

as the lower bound.

In order to complete the empirical specification, we must consider

the error term in the log earning equation. We may distinguish two components
of the error term: pure chance elements which are independent across observations, and unobserved persistent level effects. Individual differences in
the initial level of human capital, K0, and the initial investment in on—the—

job training, y0, are among the unobserved level effects. Under the present
model, K0 is unrelated to the investment pattern of the individual, and its

omission causes no bias. On the other hand, if we assume that more recent
vintages start their working life investing a larger proportion of their earnings capacity, the omission of y0 will cause an overestimate of the experience

effect and an underestimate of the growth effect. We use a generalized
least square estimation method which incorporates the individual level com-

ponent of the error structure as a random variance component. By using
repeated observations for each scientist, efficiency is enhanced, and this

source of heteroscedasticity is eliminated. (For more details, see Lillard
and Weiss (1976].)

13

B. The Data
Our source of data is the National Science Foundation's Register of

Technical and Scientific Personnel. We use a longitudinal sample of Ph.D.'s
in which each scientist reported continuously at two—year intervals over the

decade 1960—1970. The sample is composed of six fields: biology, chemistry,
earth sciences, mathematics, physics and psychology.8 Separate G.L.S. regressions were estimated for each field and for the aggregate of all fields and
are reported in the Appendix.

The dependent variable is the log of basic earnings9 in real 1970

dollars (observations with zero basic earnings were eliminated). Scientists
who were employed in academic institutions could report tehir annual income

on a 9 to 10 or 11 to 12 months' basis. All observations were transformed
to a full—year basis.'° In order to separate investment in on—the—job training from Investment in schooling, we eliminated all students from the data.
Scientists who were not fully employed were also eliminated.11
The Independent variables are:
1.

Age is broken into three parts: age at highest degree

(measured from age 22), work experience, and break. Break is defined as
the difference between years since degree and the reported years of work

experience. All

three

components of age and their interaction with experience

ar used. Since the longitudinal data indicated reporting error in the experience variable, the experience measure is calculated by year from the average
reported during the decade.
When data on both experience (i.e., years of professional work exper-

ience) and years since highest degree are available, total experience Is broken
into predegree and postdegree experience along the lines suggested by Johnson

and Stafford (19741.12 In the fairly large number of cases (a maximur of

14

15 percent, in 1970) in which experience is not reported, (1) postdegree

experience was set equal to years since degree and (2) predegree experience

was set at the mean of the corresponding group with complete information
on both experience and years since degree.

2. Time and Vintage. Year dummy variables are used to indicate the
year of observation. This allows year to affect only the level of earnings.
Reported year of highest degree is used as a measure of vintage. It is allowed
to enter regressions only as an interaction with experience. These restrictions are imposed to avoid the identification problem which follows from
equation (10).

3. Sex. In subsamples with a sufficient number of females (at least
a hundred13), a dummy for sex was included and allowed to interact with experience.

4. Type of Employer. For scientists whore employed continuously
by the same employer, we use dummies for the following types of employment:

academic institutions, private industry, government. Those who changed
employer during the decade are classified as unstable. The type—of—employer
du=ies are allowed to interact with experience and with the year of
observation.

5. Quality of School. Data on the ranking of the school from which
the scientist obtained his highest degree allowed use of a dummy variable to

indicate whether the school is ranked in the top ten)4

The sample means for the independent variables are presented in

Table 1. There is considerable variation in some of these across fields.
The proportion continuously employed in private industry varies from 1% in

psychology to 57% in chemistry. The proportion of scientists with unstable
type

of

employment is fairly high and reaches 36% in physics. This, however,

is an overestinate of,mobility, since those persons not reporting type of

employer in any year are also included in this category. The proportion
of female scientists who are continuously employed is quite small. The
highest proportion was 8% in psychology. The proportion of scientists with
a Ph.D. from a top ranked school varies from 24% in chemistry to almost 50%

in earth sciences. There is an inverse relation with the size of the field,
suggesting that a more standardized measure of quality Is necessary.
There is considerable variation in the age at degree within fields.

The standard deviation is about 4 years, which is more than half the standard

deviation in the chronological year at which the degree was obtained. The
average age at attainment of Ph.D. is 30 years and almost 3 years of predegree

work experience is reported. Partially due to our procedure In choosing the
data, the mean break in experience (which is admitted only if it occurred prior

to 1960) is very low. The mean post—degree experience is about 10 years,
reflecting the relatively large proportion of young scientists in the sample.

Vintage, Experience and Time Effects: Some Empirical Results

This section begins with an analysis of sources of differences in

earnings growth among scientists over the 1960—70 decade. These sources include
field, type of employment, quality of Ph.D. granting institution, and sex as

well as vintage, experience, and time. The results are based on the parameter
estimates reported in the appendix. Due to the large number of interactions it
is more revealing to describe the results in terms of predicted growth patterns

rather than in terms of the basic coefficients. The predicted growth rates
are based on the average time trend, i.e. the 1970 year effect (relative to

1960) divided by-ten. Unless otherwise stated the individual year effects are
15
ignored.

1. Experience, Age, and Vintage
Observing each cohort over a period of 10 years allows a separation, to
some extent, of the effects of vintage from the effects of experience on the

growth of earnings. Total mean annual growth rates by level of experience and
vintage for all scientists in academic employment are presented in Table 2.

The rate of growth in earnings declines with increased experience for a given

cohort. A ten year difference leads to a rather large 1.2 percentage points.
reduction in the annual real growth rate. It is important to distinguish this
finding on the concavity of the log earning experience profile from previous

cross section findings. Concavity of actual cohort earning profiles neither
implies nor is implied by concavity of cross section profiles. In fact, if
individual earnings profiles are linear (i.e. the absence of age effects) but
vintage effects operate linearly on the slope of the earning function, the crosssectional log earnings function is a concave quadratic function in experience,

such as estimated by Mincer (1974) and his students. This, however, would be a

purely cross—section phenomenon reflecting vintage rather than experience
effects.

We interpret the concavity of the earning function as reflecting the

role of age in reducing the productivity of producing human capital. There is,
however, an identification problem which arises from the fact that holding
age at highest degree constant, experience and age move collinearly. It is
quite possible that the mere accumulation of experience (or more generally

human capital) is the cause of the observed reduction in growth rates. Fortunately,
the N.S.F. data which we use allow us to separate age and experience effects
on the growth in earnings. The effect of age, given experience, is represented

by the age of highest—degree experience interactions. This is a significant and
fairly large effect. For instance, a scientist who obtained his Ph.D. at age 30
rather than age 26 will for every level of experience have a rate of growth in

earnings which is lover by .4 percentage points. This result supports the
notion discussed in the theoretical analysis, that age per se increases the
depreciation of earning capacity or alternatively reduces the capacity to
acquire new human capital.

Our results indicate that differences in vintage have a significant effect

on the rate of growth in earnings. Table 2 illustrates that more recent
vintages have, for the same level of experience, a greater rate of growth in

earnings. The effect is, however, smaller than that of the concavity of the
log earning profile. For example, a ten—year difference in vintage leads to a
difference of .4 percentage points in growth.
Before we proceed, however, an alternative interpretation of the patterns

in Table 2 must be noted. The interaction between experience and the year of
observation was omitted from the regression because of the identification

18

problem discussed earlier. Thus a scientist of 1958 vintage with 12 years
of experience is observed in 1970 while a 1948 vintage scientist with 12 years

of experience is observed in 1960. Shifts in the relative earnings of all
scientists, by the same percentage irrespective of their experience, are
accounted for; but the possibility that changing market conditions affect
scientists of different levels of experience differently is not considered.
More specifically one may expect that newly hired scientists will suffer more

during a downturn and gain more in the upswing. If this were the case we would
expect to find individual year effects on the slope which would be significantly

different from a pure trend. This possibility was tested for physics which
underwent the sharpest changes in market conditions during the decade. We
found no significant departure from trend. This provides weak support for the
vintage interpretation of the positive interaction between year of degree and

experience, and for the concavity interpretation of the negative experience
squared effect.

An Important implication of finding greater experience related earnings
growth for more recent vintages is that cross—section data systematically

underestimates the true contribution of experience. For Instance, for the 1958
cohort with 12 years of experience in 1970 the cross section estImate is 3.2

percent while the true effect is at least 3.6 percent. This basic finding Is
brought out more clearly in diagram 1 where the predicted earnings profiles of

selected cohorts and two predicted cross—section profiles are graphed. A cross—
section prediction Is obtained by varying experience with vintage while holding

year of observation constant. Since scientists with less than 10 years of
experience In 1970 are not present in the sample, that part of the profile is

a pure extrapolation for this sample. It is worth noting, however, that this
prediction Is very close to the actual 1970 cross—section profile from iide—

pendent data which include scientists of all experience levels (see Lillard

and Weiss [19761). Notice that the 1960 and 1970 cross sections tend to

diverge slightly at high experience levels. This reflects the positive
interaction between experience and year of highest degree and may be inter-

preted as follows: either younger cohorts are more productive at on—the—job
training investments or older cohorts experience greater productivity shifts
during the decade.

A cohort prediction iA obtained by varying experience with the year of

observation while holdingyearaf}b.D. constant. We shall first consider such
predictions within the sample period. The solid lines connecting the 1960
and 1970 cross sections show the average development of the cohort's earnings

over the decade. They reflect both experience and time effects and can be
viewed as the upper bound estimate of the experience effect during the decade.
The dashed line represents the lower bound of experience effect,' i.e. the growth

in earnings which the cohort would experience in the absence of any exogenous

growth in earnings. This line is above the cross section due to significant
interaction between experience and vintage mentioned previously. There are thus
these two extreme alternative interpretations for the development of cohort

earnings over the decade. (1) The profile represents the true experience
earnings relationship for the corresponding cohort resulting from accumulation

of human capital. The cohort profiles differ due to initial endowment differences.

And

(2)

the cohort profile represents the movement of individuals along

experience earnings profiles which are being continuously shifted over time

by changes in productivity, and more generally, market conditions. Under
thisinterpretation, there are no vintage effects on the initial level of
earnings. Rather than attributing all growth to experience, as we would do

20

under the first interpretation, the share attributed to experience is now
given by the dashed lower bound estimates, while the remainder (i.e. the
difference between the solid and dashed lines) is attributed to exogenous
time effects.

To further dramatize the difference between cross—section and cohort
estimates, consider prediction out of the sample for the 1970 Ph.D. vintage.
One

prediction,

of course, can be extrapolated from the 1970 cross section in

Figure 1. This prediction is valid only in a perfectly static economy. The
dashed and solid profiles represent the lower and upper bound estimates for

the future development of earnings in a growing economy. The lower bound estimate
is based upon the assumption that in the decade 1960—70 all exogenous growth

reflected changes in market conditions common to all vintages and that from
1970 on no further growth in the real rental rate for human capital is expected.

The upper bound estimates assume that all past growth is due to vintage effects
which continue at the same rate for the 1970 cohort or, alternatively, that the
average trend in the rental rate for human capital which existed during the
period 1960—1970 will continue in the future.

A striking aspect of these predictions is that even under conservative
assumptions we still predict that older scientists will enjoy an increase in

their real earnings. This is in contrast to the observed downturn in cross—
section profiles which tend to peak after 26 or 27 years of experience and are

considerably flatter than the projected profile of any given vintage. More
generally, due to effects of vintage on the growth in earnings, the cross—
section data will tend to overestimate the concavity of true lifetime profiles.

The effects of vintage on the growth in earnings are not uniform across

field or level of schooling. The interaction between year of highest degree

21

and

experience

tends to be strong in physics, mathematics and biology

and weak in psychology. The vintage effect also appears to decrease with
the level of schooling. Estimates of the same earnings function for scientists
with only a B.A. or LA. degree from pooled cross sections of the years 1960,
1966, and 1970 shoved no significant interaction between year of highest degree

and experience. This difference in the interaction effect by levels of
schooling means that the cross—section earnings profile underestimates the
cohort experience effect to a greater degree for scientists with Ph.D.'s

than for scientists with only a B.A. or M.A. degree. Therefore, cross—section
comparisons by level of degree will uidLerestimate the true contribution of
schooling to lifetime earnings.

Given the rather strong implications of our finding a positive interaction between vintage and experience—related growth in earnings, it Is
important to note that this interaction is quite stable under several alternative specifications of the earnings function and in different data, i.e.,
independent pooled cross sections — 1960, 1966, 1970 (for details see Lillard

22

and Wei8s [1976] and Weiss [1975]). This leads us to conclude that, at least
for the population under study, the vintage—experience interaction is robust.

Needless to say, further tests based upon a longer time period and more direct
measures of the causal factors which are captured by the year of highest degree
are necessary before accepting the hypothesIs of nonneutrality in vintage
effects.

2. ua1ity of Schooling, Sex, Type of Employer and Field
Scientists who obtain their Ph.D's from a top—ranked Institution were

found to have a lsightly, but significantly, higher rate of growth in their

earnings. This may indicate greater learning efficiency, probably due to
self—selection, and thus more on—the—job investment. This result seems to
be consistent with the finding of higher experience—related growth at higher

levels of schooling. We found that for the 1958 cohort evaluated at 12 yaers
of experience the lower bound on the experience—related growth in private
industry was 4.2 percent for Ph.D.'s, 3.2 percent for M.A.'s and 3.1 percent
for B.A.'s,

In psychology (where a large number of females are concentrated) there

is a significant difference in the growth of earnings between females and

males. The earnings profile of a woman has both a lwer level and a flatter
slope. Similar results, based on cross—seciton data, were reported by Johnson
and Stafford [1974]. It is interesting to note that this difference persists
for women who participated continuously over the decade, controlling for past

breaks in experience. Of course it is still possible that the risk of future
breaks diminishes the profitability of investment and leads to flatter profiles.
The discussion of experience effects is concluded with a description

of the cohort rates of growth by type of employer and field. Since we allow

23

-

year effects to differ by type of employer and field, it is more difficult
to determine whether differences in the rate of growth reflect differences

in investment behavior or in market conditions. Estimated average growth
rates in starting salaries (vintage or time level effects) as well as total

cohort growth rates are therefore presented separately. The estimated (lower
bound) experience effect is then given by the difference between the cohort
growth rate (Table 3) and the appropriate growth rate in starting salaries
(Table 4).

Generally speaking, the experience effect appears to be weaker in
private industry than in academic institutions, possibly indicating less

investment on the job. Except for biology, however, the interaction between
experience and private industry was not significant in the separate fields.

(See Appendix Table) The effect of experience tends to be large in biology,

physics, and chemistry and relatively small in psychology. Psychology provides a clear examply of the trade—off between future and current earnings in

that high starting salaries are associated with low experience effects. It
appears that fields differ in the trade—off s between current and future earnings

which they offer. In fields with considerable amount of joint research, where
highly experienced scientists and new entrants can combine their research
effort, there is more opportunity for young scientists to invest in job train-

ing. This is reflected in the relatively large numbers of young scientists

who

report

research as their primary work activity in fields like chemistry,

physics, and biology.16 Such fields are likely to have a larger experience
effect.

Though we cannot specify their source, we nevertheless point to some

of the patterns in estimated growth rates in starting salaries (Table 4). As

already indicated, they include both vintage effects specific only to the
entering cohort and general shifts in market conditions common to all cohorts.

It is most likely that some of the differences in these rates (as distinguished

from levels) reflect differences in demand (and/or supply) conditions. This
source of growth was generally greatest in psychology and least in physics.

It was low for those employed in private industry, as illustrated by the
marked 1.6 percentage point difference in growth rate (1.1 vs. 2.7) between
scientists employed in private industry and those employed in academic insti-

tutions. It appears that for the decade under discussion, demand conditions
shifted in favor of academics. Most of the shift, however, occurred during
the early part of the decade. (This can be seen from the individual year
effects in the Appendix.)

In private industry a relatively low experience effect combined with
the low growth in starting salaries produced a large two percentage—point
difference in the total growth rate relative to academics (from Table 3).
Comparison across fields, on the other hand, frequently indicates that a
large experience effect is compensated by a low growth rate in starting salaries.

This reduces variation in cohort total growth rates across fields. The growth
of academic starting salaries is 1.6 percent in physics, for instance, vs. the

2.7 percent for all academics. The total cohort growth rate in phsycis is,
however, only slightly less than average. These results clearly indicate that
movements In starting salaries, may be misleading estimates of the actual
development of earning differentials.

In summary, the following patterns In the cohort total growth rates
during the decade were noted:

(1) A high growth rate for scientists of recent vintage: growth rates
for the 1958 vintage In academics range from 6.3 percent in earth sciences to
7.4 percent in biology.

25

(2) Considerably lower growth rates for scientists of older vintages:
for the 1928 vintage, in academics, these range from 1.7 in physics to 2.2

percent in mathematics. Note that due to differences in the vintage effects
and the concavity of the earning profiles across fields, there is a change in
the ranking of the fields as we move across cohorts.

(3) In private industry there are considerably lower growth rates.
The youngest cohcfrt (1958) in private industry grew by only 4.8 on the average,

and the older vintage (1928) experienced virtually no real growth.

The differences by field are somewhat larger in private industry

than in academics. For the youngest vintage (1958), there is a range from
4.4 percent in earth sciences to 6.0 percent in biology. This range narrows
for older cohorts.

(4) Scientists in the government enjoyed real growth rates which
are similar to those in academics. The noticeable exceptions are psychology
and biology. Psychologists employed in the government experienced less growth

than scientists in academics. The opposite is true for biologists. These
differences, however, are much smaller than the differences between private
industry and academics.

3. Some Implications for Changes in Relative Earnings Over Time
To obtain further insight into the implications of the size and
pattern of real growth rates just discussed, let us conclude with a brief
description of changes in the level of real earnings and the distribution of

these changes by field and type of employer. These changes, presented in
Tables 5 and 6, summarize the combined effects of the various vintage, time,
and experience effects.

26

First, the annual rate of growth of 6.8 percent for the recent
(1958 vintage) cohort implies that their real level of earnings almost doubled

over the decade. In fact, it increased (for all scientists in adademics)
from a mean of about $9,200 (in 1970 dollars) in 1960 to $18,100 in 1970. The
oldest (1928) vintage had a much lower, but still substantial, gain from $15,500
(1970, dollars) in 1960 to $19,000 in 1970, an increase of 23 percent.

There were some noticeable changes in the relative earnings of the

various cohorts by field. Biology, mathematics, and psychology improved
their position relative to all fields while chemistry, physics, and earth

sciences lost ground. There also was an increase in the range in earnings
differentials between the lowest extreme, chemistry, and the highest extreme,

psychology. Depending upon the cohort, the difference in earnings rose from
12 to 20 percent in 1960 up to 17 to 25 percent in 1970. The tendency for
the difference between these two fields to be lower for the more recent cohorts
reflects the stronger vintage effects on the growth in earnings in chemistry.
As one would expect from our discussion of the growth rate by type of

employer, there are marked changes in earnings differences by employer. For
the 1958 vintage, for instance, the monetary advantage of private industry
relative to academics reduced from 32 percent in 1960 to 12 percent in 1970.

This pattern is uniform across fields. In contrast we do not find a system-

atic reduction in the differences between the earnings of scientists in
government and in academics. Again it is interesting to note that the difference between earnings in academics and in private industry is larger for the

younger cohort. This is a reflection of differences in the experience effects
which were already mentioned. Lifetime profiles in private industry tend to
be flatter, and consequently, earnings differences among experienced scientists
are lower than earnings differences among those with less experience.

27

Conclusion

The main conclusion which emerges from our study is that growth in earn-

ings is not uniform or neutral. There is, therefore, no simple mechanical
method by which individual actual life—time profiles can be inferred from a
single cross section of data. Though much of the variance in- growth is due
to changing market conditions which were specific to the period under discussion there still remain systematic, and to some extent predictable, differences

in growth due to levels of experience, schooling and vintage. An attempt was
made to relate such differences in growth to differences in investment behavior
which are to some extent voluntary.

The emphasis on Investment behavior Is helpful in focusing attention on

some apparently systematic aspects of the earnings profile. In particular,
the positive interaction between the date at which the degree is obtained (i.e.,

vintage) and the slope of the earnings profile admits a natural Interpretation

within the investment model. The same is true of the negative effect of age
on the contribution of experience to earnings. Whether these phenomena can
also be explained byan alternative or more general model is an important unresolved Issue.

It should be noted that differences In planned earning profiles were ex-

plained within the limits of a rather narrowly specified model. It was assumed
that individual earnings capacity, though not directly observable to the research—

er is known

to

employer and employee, that

markets

are sufficiently competitive

to make general training a feasible alternative, that individuals can borrow
freely on account of their future earnings, and that the effects of uncertainty

and nonmonetary differentials are negligible. Most likely the relaxation of

28

some of those assumptions would lead to better understanding of the role of
individual characteristics in earnings growth.

Our empirical work did not incorporate market information, and therefore
left unanswered the question, "What are the true underlying causes which oper-

ate under the heading of time and vintage?". Identifying the causal forces
underlying these significant nominal differences would be a natural and important next step.

29

Footnotes

implicit assumption in this formulation is that individual with dif-

ferent levels of skills are perfect substitutes in production. There is thus
a single rental rate.

2This will in general lead to a discontinuity in investment just upon leav-

ing school. See Weiss [1975].
31f the state of knowledge is a function of past Investment of all generations, then this process implies a discrepancy between the private and social
returns for investment In human capital (see Arrow [1962] and Levhari[l966]).
Thus, even if one may express doubts as to the importance of educational externalities within a generation, they are probably important with an intergenerational
context.

4

It

.

is, however, not clear whether other things can in fact remain constant.

For Instance, if a larger initial segment of life is spent investing in human
capital, the demand for borrowing by the young vintages will increase, and older

vintages will be Induced to provide the necessary transfer only at increasingly

higher interest rates. The increase in the interest rate will provide a check
to the tendency for increased investment. Note also that we ignored in the
analysis the direct costs of the training process. If all costs are the oppor—
tunity costs of the individual (e.g., a new worker in the firm observes the
others work without affecting their productivity), then changes in the rental

rate of human capital will not affect Investment decisions. In the more realistic case with direct costs the reduction in the rental rate will also put a

check on the tendency for increased Investment. The probable increases in the
marginal cost of teaching will provide a further check.

30

5it should be pointed out that vintage or cohort effects may

specific exogenous factors, such as

trends other than the general advance in knowledge.

Specifically, we would expect the average ability (or productivity) of scientists
who obtained their degrees during World War II to be lower than that of vintages

of more normal times. More to the point, if there is in fact a trend of decreasing school admission standards, then such a trend would mitigate (or possibly offset) the effects of the advance in knowledge on the level and slope
of the earnings profiles.

6(c) and 8(c) in equation (4) depend only on age, then a restricted

form is implied such that a1 =

= 82

. But we

shall not incorporate this

restriction allowing for the possibility, for Instance, that the rate of depreciation depends on the number of years since degree rather than on age.

7This identity is not strictly correct due to possible breaks in the accu-

mulation of experience. In the empirical analysis we shall control for such
breaks.

8Scientists were allocated into fields on the basis of highest specialty.

Only those with stable highest specialty were included in the sample; i.e.,
it was required that the highest specialty in each year equaled their Ph.D.

major. The percent of reported years in which highest specialty was not equal
to specialty of major degree is: 17.6 in Biology, 11.4 in Chemistry, 9.2 in
Earth Science, 6.1 in Mathematics, 9.6 in Physics, 8.1 in Psychology.

This number is an upper bound on the proportion of scientists eliminated
on the basis of occupational mobility, since some probably changed specialty
more than once.

31

9me data also contained information on gross earnings, which include
consulting fees, honoraria, and the like. Though conceptually superior, this
measure of income has not been used by most researchers using the N.S.F. data.
A reason is the probable errors of measurement which arise when the reporting

scientist estimates his gross earnings. To allow comparability to other studies,
we present earnings functions only in terms of basic earnings.
10The adjustment factor in each field is based upon a previous estimation

from independent 1966 and'1970 cross section data in which a du=y variable
for a 9 months salary was put on the right hand side of the regression equation

(see Weiss [1975]). These correction factors are 1.086 for Chemistry, 1.149
for Physics, 1.178 for Biology, 1.142 for Psychology, 1.193 for Earth Sciences,
and 1.099 for Mathematics.

In order to be included in the sample, all individuals had to report their
year of highest degree, year of birth, major of highest degree, first specialty,
basic earnings and employment status.
Individuals were eliminated from the sample if they did not report a basic
salary for all six years, if they had not received a Ph.D., and if their Ph.D.
major differed from their reported first specialty in all six years.

Predegree experience is defined to be experience minus years since degree

if the difference is positive. It is defined to be zero otherwise. It should
be pointed out that in the cases in which the difference is positive but there
is a break in career after the acquisition of the degree, then we in fact obtain
true predegree experience minus break rather than predegree experience alone.

We cannot discover the existence of such breaks from the data. The only case
in which a break is revealed is when reported experience is less than years since
degree.

3More precisely, at least one hundred women had to be present prior to
elimination on the basis of other criteria.

'4For each scientist we had information on the name of the institute which

awarded the degree. The rank of the institution is based upon the rankings
provided by Cartter for 1964 and 1969, Keniston for 1957, and Hughes for 1925.
See Johnson and Stafford [1974].

15Unless otherwise specified, the reported growth rates assume: males with
no breaks in experience, no predegree experience, not from a top school, and
age at highest degree equal to twenty—six.

'6The proportion of scientists with less than 10 years of experience, who

in 1970 reported their primary work activity as research are (by field): .485
for Biology, .494 for Chemistry, .235 for Earth Sciences, .244 for Mathematics,
.581 for Physics, .290 for Psychology.

Appendix

The purpose of this appendix is to prove equation (4) in the text which
describes the optimal planned growth in earnings.

The maxtmization problem faced by a person of vintage i can be written
as

such that K(O) K; where T is the exogenously given length of working
life. We shall consider here only the phase in which an iterior solution with
respect to

occurs. We shall thus ignore the constraints which are implied

Then, under the functional
