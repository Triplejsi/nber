of education than actual level, one could con-

The wealth-maximizing framework allows one to distinguish between labor and capital market differences as explanations for differential schooling levels. A simple regression
of schooling on independent variables where nonwhite mean
levels of the independent variables are multiplied by white
regression coefficients will not distinguish the two. (See Gilman (1965) for an analysis along those lines.)
This amounts to assuming that additional years of schooling produce slightly more units of human capital where a unit

The assumption that Ps(S) is not a function of E is essential
for identification. This potentially verifiable assumption cannot be independently tested in this model and remains one of
its shortcomings. An entire life history of earnings and labor

force participation appears necessary to answer that question.

added. They did not enter significantly. Nor did coefficients
differ significantly between whites and nonwhites other than
the intercept. The reader should not be particularly disturbed
by the meaning of the price of time for young children and the
necessary extrapolation to estimate it. Since all individuals in

the sample have completed at least ninth grade, costs of
previous years of schooling, even if estimated incorrectly, are

approximately constant across individuals. Stated in other
terms, it is marginal cost that does the work in this model
rather than total cost; and marginal cost should be estimated
accurately by this method, even if total cost is not.

In column 3 of table 3, TB is assumed to be 0.15
for the low-income group and 0.10 for the higher
income group. As predicted, the mean of the residuals is positive and large for the low-income
group and negative and large in magnitude for the
high-income group. This implies that we can re-

ject at all conceivable levels of statistical significance that the borrowing costs to the poor are
five percentage points higher than they are to the
higher income group. The same is true when interest rate differences are assumed to be 0.1, 0.5,

lower returns to blacks are more than offset by the

lower costs.'8
Some of the specifications were altered in order

to test the robustness of the model. The most
important change was that the wage rate used in
the calculations was altered to include the value of
on-the-job training using the method of Lazear
(1976, l977a, and 1979). The main effect was an
increase in (I-'E); the behavior of the residuals was
not significantly altered. I.e., the difference between implicit borrowing costs for rich and poor
