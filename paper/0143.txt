I. Introduction
The availability of longitudinal microdata on earnings and on other
aspects of personal histories provides a new range of opportunities to improve our understanding of the interpersonal structure of earnings.
Recent research on the determinants of earnings, especially the human
capital approach, stresses the whole life—cycle earnings stream as the basic

unit of analysis rather than a single period observation. Indeed, by
emphasizing individual accumulation of earning power, the analysis directly
focuses on the longitudinal dimension, albeit one that is rather abstract,
since all economy—wide trends and fluctuations in prices and productivities

must be removed from it.
In the cross—section studies of Census and other data, earnings of
different individuals are analyzed as if they were pieced together around a
single synthetic earnings profile, typical for all groups or distinguishable

for groups classified by school education. The profiles so obtained slope
upward through most of the working age, decelerating after some initial
interval, and levelling off at a later stage.1
In the human capital interpretation of the earnings profile,

is

its level

of market skills, its rate of growth is a positive function of current investment in such skills or earning powers, and the deceleration reflects

the declining rate of investment over the life cycle. It is understood
that the term "investment" covers a broad range of activities such as
schooling, occupational choice, job training and learning, job and geographic mobility, job search and acquisition of information, work effort,
and so forth.

This interpretation is summarized in the following model:2

Note that B may also be expressed as - , where T is the investment period.
When applied to a cross-section, equation (3) may be augmented by information on personal, background, or regional characteristics of the

individuals. We shall have a look at these personal characteristics later
on, but will direct our attention first to the application of equation (3)
both in time series and in the cross-section.
In this equation there are only two schematic variables, years of

schooling and years of work experience. Perhaps surprisingly, these two
crude but readily available variables contain relatively sizable explanatory

power. This has been shown in Census and other cross—section microdata which
cover complete ranges of schooling and of working ages.4

3This is a single term Taylor expansion of the term in (l_k). The de-

gree of approximation seemed to make little difference in our empirical
applications.

4For references see the bibliography in Mincer (1976).

—4—

The coefficients of the variables in (3) represent rates of return

and investment ratios, and the intercept in E reflects endowment. These
parameters obviously vary among individuals, but aside from schooling and
working age no such variation is observable. Distributional analyses,
therefore, miss a potentially important source of interpersonal variation
in earnings.

We take advantage of our longitudinal data to explore individual variation in the parameters of individual earnings functions.

(1) For this pur-

pose we fit an earnings function to each of the individual histories in the
sample.

(2) We then try to ascertain the extent to which the estimated vari-

in individual parameters helps in explaining the cross—sectional vari-

ation

ation in earnings. (3) we further inquire into the relation between the
individual parameters and a vector of personal characteristics, as well as

(4) into indirect (via variables and parameters) and direct effects of these
characteristics

on earnings.

The analysis was carried out on the Coleman—Rossi Life History data, •a
sample

of

males aged 30—39 in 1968 who were

residing in households in the

U.S. The data contains information on the starting and ending dates (month
and calendar year), earnings and hours worked for every job the individual
held from the time he first entered the labor force until the date of inter-

view in January 1969. Thus we have a job history for the individual, and
for every job we have at least two earnings points: initial and ending
wages or salaries. Respondents also provided a lifetime family and educational history, as well as all the characteristics listed in our notes to

Table 5 below.

—5—
The sample contains 1,589 men of whom 739 are black. Data requirements and omissions reduced our sample almost in ha].f.5 As the information
was collected retrospectively, we caution ourselves and the readers that
large memory errors may exist in such data.6

ii. Longitudinal Earnings Profiles
We estimated individual earnings functions [using equation (3)] for

each of the 884 men in the usable sample. The data for the dependent variable are logarithms of price—deflated monthly earnings. Table 1 presents
the average intercepts and coefficients of equation (3) together with their
standard errors for all men, each of the two race groups, and four educa-

tion groups. In the individual regressions schooling is a constant, so the
intercept is (b0 + b1s) of eq. (3). The coefficient of t (working age, or
experience) which is b2 in eq. (3), we call

and it equals Cr k0 +

B

+

g),

where g is the economy-wide rate of growth of productivity per worker,
assumed fixed over the period and net of the contribution of human capital.

The coefficient oft2 is b3 of eq. (3), which we call B2.

-

A similar set of regressions was performed using hourly wage rates
rather than monthly earnings. The results were quite similar. We decided
to continue our analysis with monthly earnings only, especially since we

believe these to be more reliable than retrospective data on hours of work.7

5The sample was restricted to 884 males who reported at least three earnings points, who never held multiple jobs, and who provided all the necessary basic information.
6We have the reassurinq statement from James Coleman that a cross—check
of the earnings and employment data with the Social Security file showed
"rather good conformity."
7Evidently, the source of similarity is that very little variation over
time was reported by individuals in their histories of hours of work.

—6—

The standard errors in Table 1 are actually upper limits since each
individual regression utilized more than one degree of freedom.8 At any
rate this statistic indicates that, on average, the longitudinal earnings

profiles has an upward slope. This is true also when the economy—wide rate
of growth g is subtracted from the coefficient at t. The annual rate of
productivity growth was estimated to be 2.5 percent. It was found as the
average rate of growth of wages of men age 25—35 at fixed levels of educa-

tion for the period l956-66. Thus, in Table 1 the coefficient of t which
includes g, for all men, is .077; excluding g it is .052. The coefficient
of t2 is —.0014 and the small standard error indicates a significant deceleration of earnings over the observed working life.
Given these coefficients it is possible to analyze the rate of growth
of earnings at any working age by including and excluding g.

dinY
Since

dt

=

-2

82t, we find that two-thirds of the growth of earn-

ings with working age is accounted for by individual progress and one-third

by economy—wide progress at the start of working life (when t = 1).

The

contribution to growth are reversed one and a half decades later (at t =

15),

and they are about equal after a decade of work experience (at t = 10).
The important conclusion to be drawn from Table 1 is the concavity of

the typical earnings profile revealed in these longitudinal data. This
shape,

heretofore observed only in

cross—sections cannot, therefore, be

viewed as an artifact of the cross—section. It characterizes both races in

the sample and all education groups, with an apparent exception of the

highest education group. However, a significant degree of concavity is
evidently not apparent until after a decade of work experience, and the

most educated group in this sample does not have more than a decade of

work experience. Given the relatively narrow age range in the sample,
work experience is inversely related to years of schooling. Therefore,
the less schooled the group the more clearly discernible is the shape

of its earnings profile.1°
There is, of course, a great deal of individual variation in the
slopes and curvatures of this early segment (an average of 16 years) of

the earnings profile. While the standard errors in Table 1 are small
enough to lend significance to mean values, the standard deviations in

the sample are larger than the means. This is perhaps not surprising
since the individual profiles are fit to a few observed points only, so

a great deal of instability can be expected. In addition, lack of reliability of the individual regression is attributable to a certain de-

gree of arbitrariness in the timing of initial earnings: We defined
initial as the first full time job after completion of schooling, but
many persons worked before on a part— or full—time basis.

While Table 1 depicts the typical longitudinal earnings profile,
Table 2 takes account of the individual variation around the average

profile. It measures the importance of that variation in inducing a
corresponding variation in earnings of individuals in the cross section.

10Weiss and Lillard (1976) find a concave longitudinal profile among
Ph.D's in science. Their sample (NSF) covers one decade in a wide

spçtrum

of

ages.

Specifically,

we observe the effect on R2 of introducing the individual

longitudinal parameters 8 and 82. into the earnings function (3) applied to the cross—section. In column (1) of each panel we show the
usual cross—section regression for the 1968 survey data. It includes
the variables schooling (s) and years of work experience (t and t2).

The parameters are some sort of average of individual parameters. In
this sample these are rather unstable and the signs appear perverse,
compared to previous studies based on much larger samples.11 At any

rate the replacement of variables t. and t by estimated (8

t).

and

(82t2). in column 2, more than doubles the explanatory power of the
cross—section regression.

This is not to say that we have managed to explain more, but simply
that if the information underlying the slope and curvature parameters of
individual earnings functions were available to analysts, an additional
20—25 percent of the relative variance of (monthly or weekly) earnings

could be explained. The information in these parameters pertains to the
unobserved individual variation in volumes of postschool investments and
in their efficiencies.

11The coefficients of t and t2 acquire the proper signs in our own
sample when experience is defined as total number of months ever worked
(rather than time elapsed since the start of a full—time job after completion of schooling), and when earnings (in logs) are averaged over
several years.
'2We postpone the discussion of variable v in columns 3 and 4 of
Table 2.

III.

Estimating Individual Investment Parameters
With very few degrees of freedom and less than a complete life—cycle

available, the individual longitudinal earnings regressions are far from

being reliable. But even if they were reliable, it is not, in general,
possible to solve the estimated coefficients for the component investment

parameters which are of interest: These are: the vectors of postschooi
investments indexed by k. (the initial investment ratio), the (average)
rates of return to postschool investment (r), and individual "endowments"

or "initial earning capacities," in E..
It is tempting, nevertheless, to use the concept of an "overtaking
stage" in the life—cycle of postschool investment for a procedure which
is somewhat better than guesswork.

The "overtaking stage" is the workinq age t at which observed earnings

reach equality with initial postschool capacity earnings E. Note

that initial earnings Y = E — C ,

stage the growing positive second term on the right begins to outweigh the
declining (in absolute value) negative third term. This happens at about

years of experience.13 The ratio of

to Y does, therefore, provide

estimates of k. The overtaking stage differs among persons as does
but we do not know the latter either. A guess about the average r,, which
judging from past studies, is probably not too far away from 10 percent,
may serve the purpose.

13

The proof is on p. 17, Mincer (1974).
.

— 14 —

Alternatively,

we may locate an average overtaking period t by study-

ing the correlation between schooling and earnings across all persons in

the sample for sequential years of experience. Presumably the highest
simple correlation is between schooling and earning capacity E, that is
earnings unaffected by subsequent investments. A common overtaking stage

would produce, therefore, a clear maximum correlation at t. This need not
happen in practice, if the central tendencies in r or in the rate of decline of investments (B.) are not well defined. In that case, the "over
1

taking

stage" may be quite diffuse. When "random shocks" and data errors

are superimposed on such data, a monotonically declining pattern of correlations may be observed in them.
In cross—section Census data the correlation has been found to decline
clearly and strongly only after a decade of experience.
In our sample the correlation does, indeed, increase from an initial
.40 to .47 at 10—13 years of experience, and declines continuously there-

after. This pattern is due mainly to the correlations in the sample of
white men which rise from .39 to .50, while a very weak but persistent de-

cline is observed in the sample of black men. We use the tenth year of

experience as the common "overtaking" period. We then estimate k. as the
percent differential between initial earnings (Y) and earnings one decade

later (Y10 E), after deflation for the 2.5 percent annual rate of the
productivity trend. The means and standard errors of k by race and schooling group are shown in Table 3.

According to Table 3 the average "initial investment ratios" are about
one—third of the initial earning capacity and they increase with schooling

starting

with S = 12.

The dispersion in k. across individuals is large and

appears to be inversely related to education: Recall errors may be larger
at lower levels of education, since work experience of persons with lesser
schooling starts early and requires, therefore, a longer memory span.

The black sample shows smaller average k in each schooling class, and
the white—black differences appear to increase with schooling level. The
implication that relative black—white differences in earnings grow over the

life—cycle are confirmed in our data: Where the initial earnings differ by
5—8 percent in the various schooling groups, the percent differential increases several fold by the time 15 years of experience have elapsed.

The

k. estimates enable us to attempt the estimation of the rates of

return r.. This successive step compounds the preceding errors and inaccuracies,

but hoping that some fraction of the estimate is "true" we

follow our curiosity. We use every individual longitudinal earnings function for this purpose.14

individual's earnings profile. These estimates are shown in Table 3.
The "rate of return" coefficients increase

with schooling level in

both race groups. They are only slightly lower among black than
among
white men. Hence, the main reason for the flatter profiles of blacks is
the lesser volume of job—related investments

as measured by k.7

The remaining parameter which the assumed overtaking point allows us

to extract from the data is in E, the "endowment" or "earning capacity"
which exists apart from measured investments. In contrast to the

k. and

which affect shapes of earnings profiles, the
endowment component is a shift factor which creates differences in levels
of individual earnings profiles in addition
parameters

r.

to those created by differ-

ences in individual accumulations of investments.

The cross—section dis-

tribution of earnings should therefore contain the endowment capacity E.
as a persistent factor at various

stages of experience. it can be esti-

mated very roughly as the residual from

the cross—section regression of

earnings on schooling at the overtaking stage. The estimate is rough,
because it assumes the same rate of
uals and the same period of

return to schooling for all individ-

overtaking (i.e. the same rate of return to

post school investments). Of course, differential rates of return to
schooling, all the unmeasured components of

investment, such as quality

of schooling, aspects of work experience, efficiencies of various
sorts,

17To the extent that these are firm—specific,
they are jointly determined by employers and workers.
The greater job turnover and shorter
job tenure of blacks is consistent with this interpretation.

— 18 —

not

to speak of errors and of transitory factors, all of these are impounded

in the residual v. For all these reasons the residual variance overstates

the variance of endowments. We estimate the residual v. from the overtaking regression:'8

The

residual variance of earnings at overtaking is large (74 percent
for whites and 89 percent for blacks). For reasons discussed above, of
which

measurement error is not the least important, the residual variance

02(v.) overtakes the variance of endowments a2(ln E.) perhaps significantly.

In columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 we show the effects of v in the current
1

(survey)

cross—section of earninqs.

Despite large errors in v. as an estimate of in E. indicated partly
by the attenuated coefficient of v. (it is much less than 1) the transplanted residual is a strong "explanatory" factor in current earnings.
Whether fixed (column 3) or variable (column 4) experience coefficients are
used, the introduction of v. "explains" an additional 20—30 percent of the
cross—section inequality in earnings.

An interesting conclusion based on Table 2 (column 4) is that the
understanding and measurement of factors underlying individual postschooi—
investments and their efficiency would contribute nearly as much as the

understanding

of the factors impounded

in the residual category.

18We also included calendar year of entry into the
labor force in the
equation in order to standardize for productivity growth in the economy.

— 19 -

The

fact shown in Table

that this conclusion does not survive the
attempt to decompose the experience coefficients into parameters
and
4

does not mean that it is wrong. The decomposition

ki and

r.,

function,
proceed

compounds the

errors in

reducing their explanatory power in the cross—section earnings

while v.
is unaffected. It is nevertheless
2.

of some interest to

with a step-wise introduction of the r., k., and v parameters

into the cross—section. If not entirely attenuated by error, at least
their qualitative conformity to the human capital model can be observed.

The steps are shown in Table 4. In column 1 we have the standard
function

that the experience coefficients acquire "correct" signs after r. has

been included and that the coefficient of (r.t2) is not far from half the
size of the coefficient of t (in absolute value).

Some increase in R2 is

also observed. In column 3 we allow k in the coefficient of t to vary:

3. mY t = (mE0 —k)
0 +r S s+r (k 01.t) +8t_!t2

The signs of t and t2 remain perverse (or

non—significant) but k.t is

positive and strong. Indeed the effect of k. on R2 appears stronger than
that of r..

When both k . and r. are introduced in column 4 including k

We then find that k. becomes negative and strong, and the other signs are
mostly correct (in the sense of the model) as well.19
Errors in the decomposed investment coefficients k
and r. weaken

their measured effects on earnings (compare Table 4 with Table 2). At the
same time these errors cause an inflation of v , since v. contains Un—

i

measured

components of k .,

from true endowment. Conse-

contribution of v. to R2 is over 30 percent in Table 4, when

it was over 20 percent in Table 2, while the experience coefficients

appear to contribute less than 10 percent in Table 4, but were adding about
20 percent to R2 in Table 2.
As already remarked, the patterns of observed sizes and signs of the
investment parameters are not inconsistent with the human capital inter-

pretation. The coefficients of t and r.t2 (in column 2) are consistent

191n the white sample the size of the coefficient k is —.5, of
V. is

deviation of these coefficients from unity represents a measure of
the importance of error in the data or concepts.

a linear investment decline described by coefficients 8 and —

tively. More basic is the strong negative effect of ki in step 5, an
observation for which, short of econometric sins, it would be difficult to
find alternative explanations.

IV. Individual Parameters, Personal Characteristics, and Earnings

The potential explanatory power of the usually unmeasured individual
variation in endowment, in postschool investments, and in investment eff i—

(or abilities) was

ciencies

demonstrated

in Tables 2 and

4.

The Coleman—

Rossi

survey provides a great deal of information on

ioral

characteristics of respondents which may affect earnings indirectly

personal and

behav-

by influencing the magnitudes of endowments, investments, and efficiency,
or directly, that is net of these variables and parameters.

As a first step in exploring this matter we relate the individual
parameters k., r., V.., and s. to a vector of personal characteristics

in Table 5. One subset of these variables represents information

described

on human capital investments; such as:
completion
set

the job, and job mobility. A second

represents background characteristics: parental education, number of

siblings,

the

of schooling, training on

education, work experience before

and whether or

age of

not both parents were present in

the household at

14.

Other variables such as age and marital status do not necessarily fit

into these categories. One important variable which straddles the human
capital and the background characteristics is "verbal ability" measured by
a score on a test administered at the interview.

'-I'

— 25 —

The regressions in Table 5 tell a striking story: At least
in the
white sample, schooling levels are easily and powerfully "explained" by
the four family background variables by pre—graduatjon work experience,

and by verbal ability CR2

.50 in the white sample, and .28 in the

black sample). These variables have the expected effects: Father's and
mother's education, previous experience, and verbal ability affect son's
education positively; number of siblings and broken home negatively. Of
course, the verbal ability may be an effect of schooling rather than a

background variable.20 Verbal ability is probably a mix of both: Without it R falls to .28 and the coefficients of the background variables

become attenuated. At any rate a range for R2 from .28 to .50 represents
very strong explanatory power.

In contrast, the k, r, and v parameters are barely affected by a
dozen or so variables, even though some of them are statistically sig-

nificant. We also regressed the longitudinal

coefficients 8 and 82

(first shown in Tables 1 and 2) on the same battery of variables, again

with little success. In the white sample R2 was .04 and .08, respectively. The black sample, however, shows R2 of .12 and .14 respectively.
This finding is due mainly to the "training" (apprenticeship or other
formal job training) variable which was not significant in the separated
components k . and r..
01
1

One might argue that the reasons
ki, r. and v., are not really ex-

plainable

is because of the overwhelming amount of error attached to them.

20The regression of verbal ability on schooling and
family background
yields an r2
.43, on schooling alone R2 = .31.

If

this were true, but personal characteristics that we used in Table 5 are

nonetheless relevant to earnings even if only indirectly (and certainly if

directly), they should show up as significant when entered in the earnings
regression.

This we do in three steps shown in Table 6: First we add to schooling (s) and

experience

(t, t2) the subset of personal characteristics

which represent additional information on postschool human capital, in-

cluding "verbal ability" and marital status among them. The results are
shown in column 2. The second subset, of family background variables, is
then added and shown in column 3.

Finally,

the estimated parameter k.,

r,, and v are included in column 4.
i

3-

Generally, the results are negative. The personal characteristics
on the whole do not substitute for parameters k01
.,

r.,
1

and v., nor do
1

they have net direct effects on earnings when these parameters are in-

cluded. Actually, the first subset of personal characteristics especially verbal ability, marital status, and job mobility (or tenure) do
supplement the experience parameters—— R2 does increase from the first

to the second column of Table 6. However, there is no increase in
due to family background variables at any stage, while k,, r,, V. and
education remain very strong (column 4), as they are without the vector

of personal characteristics (Table 4). Indeed, comparing the last

significant. But the introduction of the ability variable de-

tracts from the education variable and does not provide an independent
explanation.

We believe it is fair to conclude from Tables 5 and 6 that background, especially family characteristics of persons, affect their

schooling

attainment quite significantly, but have little if any effects

on postschool investments, or on

earnings, holding investment variables

and parameters constant. Their indirect effects work almost wholly
through educational attainment and almost not at all through postschool
investment behavior or efficiency.
The hiiman capital model which served as a guide appears to have

survived the reported experiments. There does remain a challenge of
measuring behavior expressed by the variables k, r, and v, whose role
in earnings is undiminished even after the application of so many rarely
available personal characteristics to the earnings function.

V. Summary
1. In this paper we analyzed the distribution of earnings histories

of 884 men aged 30—39 in 1968. On average, the longitudinal profiles of
earnings covered the first sixteen years of work experience. Deflated
for price—level changes and for economy—wide growth, the profiles showed
pronounced individual growth as well as individual differences in the

growth of earnings. Typically, the profiles were concave with respect to
experience, confirming the general shape suggested by cross—section data.

2. The distribution of individual earnings profiles shows a great
deal of variation in levels, slopes, and curvatures of this initial part

(about one—third) of the earnings profile. The individual variation in

— 35 —

levels

is interpreted in human capital terms as reflecting differential

endowments at the time of entry into full—time work. These endowments
consist of schooling levels, of rates of return to schooling, and of

capacity levels independent of (or predating) schooling. The variation
in slopes and curvatures reflects differential volumes, timing, and

profitability of "postschool investments." These cover a broad range
of activities such as occupational choice and progressions, job training and learning, job and geographic mobility, job search and acquisi-

tion of information, work effort, and the like. Since only variation
in schooling and in years of work experience can be observed in cross—

sections, analyses of the distribution of earnings miss a great deal
of individual variation which we just described. In this paper we
attempted to quantify this variation in a schematic fashion:

(a) As

variation in the coefficients (slopes, curvatures, and levels) of the
earnings profiles, and (b) as variation in the parameters of the earnings function which represent postschool investment ratios, rates of

return, and levels of endowment, aside from levels of schooling. The
investment ratios and rates of return enter as multiplicative compo-

nents of the coefficients of the earnings function and we attempted to
decompose these coefficients in order to analyze the parameters.

We find that if slopes and curvatures of individual trajectories
were available to analysts, an additional 20—25 percent of the relative
variance of (monthly or weekly) earnings could be explained beyond the
usual power provided by the cross-section earnings function approach.

The decomposition of the slope and curvature coefficients into investment ratio and rate of return parameters provides a smaller increase in

— 36 —

explanatory power because of errors introduced by the procedure. However,

the estimated parameters are of reasonable magnitude and acquire the

appropriate signs in the cross—section regressions.
We estimated individual capacities within schooling
groups as the

residual from the schooling regression at the "overtaking stage" (at

about ten years of experience). We then find that individuals with
greater investment ratios grow more rapidly than others, and——holding

capacity constant——have lower initial earnings. Finally, in terms of
the potential explanatory power, variation in earning capacity is at
least as important as variation in slopes and curvatures of earnings
in the residual left over by the usual earnings function in which only
years of schooling and years of experience are specified.

3. Our next step was to explore which of the many personal and
background characteristics of individuals appear to be related, perhaps as determinants, to the slopes, curvatures, and human capital

parameters implicit in the individual earnings profiles. The characteristics were (a) education, "verbal ability" measured at time of
interview, work experience prior to completion of schooling, training
on the job, job irobility status, age, and marital status; (b) parental

education, number of siblings, and whether or not both parents were

present in the household at the age of 14. Set (a) may be viewed as
additional measures of the person's human capital stock, set (b) as his
family background variables.
We found that, overall, the individual coefficients and parameters

of the earnings profiles are very weakly, if at all, associated with the

personal and background characteristics. Education, verbal ability, and

— 37 —

job

training appear to be of some significance, but family background has

no effect at all on the postschool earnings trajectory. In constrast,
education of the respondent is quite strongly explained by the family
background variables and by verbal ability which is probably more an effect

than a determinant of schooling. In human capital terminology,

family

background appears to affect schooling but not postschool invest-

ments.

4. It is possible that postschool investment parameters are in fact
affected by the background variables, but we find no relation because our
estimates of the human capital parameters (k, r, v) are largely in error.
If so, the personal and background variables would show up as "direct"
determinants of earnings, without or with the (k, r, v) parameters in the

earnings function. The results of the test are negative: While verbal
ability, marital status, and job mobility appear to supplement experience
coefficients prior to inclusion of k, r, and v, the family background
variables have no effect before or after the inclusion of k, r, and v.
In sum, while the role of postschool investment Darameters in earnings remains strong even after all the available personal information is
utilized additionally, the latter show little or no relation to the

personal accumulation of postschool human capital. Nor, less surprisingly,
do they show "direct" effects on earnings. The indirect effects which
do exist are almost entirely achieved via family investment in schooling

of children. It is surprising, however, that no relation can be traced
between (preschool?) earning capacity (v) and family background in our
sample.

The findinqs and surprises in this study will call for replication
on longitudinal data which are current rather than retrospective before
they can be generalized.
