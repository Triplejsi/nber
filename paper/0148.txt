HOME PRODUCTION—A FORGOTTEN INDUSTRY
Reuben Gronau*
I.

Introduction

R ECENT years have witnessed an awakened
interest in the economic activity taking
place outside the market, and in particular the

activity taking place at home. This interest
spurred by the new consumption theory of Beck-

er and Lancaster and by the estimates of the
Measure of Economic Welfare of Nordhaus and

Tobin (1973) has taken two distinct forms: an
increased number of studies on the economics of
household behavior and a renewed effort to place
a money value on the household home activity.
However, while the major thrust of the first type
of studies is in the field of microeconomics, the
estimates of home production refer, in general, to
the economy as a whole. These estimates, crude
as they are, indicate that home production is far
from being a negligible part of the economic activity. Even in an advanced economy such as the
United States the value added generated by the
home sector seems to account for over one third

determining the wife's productivity at home?
What is the value of home production and how
does it compare with the family's money income? How does the value of home production
differ among families with different socioeconomic backgrounds? How is it affected by the
wife's labor force participation and by the existence of young children? How does it change
over the family's life cycle?
It is found that the value of home production
associated with the work at home of U.S. wives
in 1973 exceeded 60% of the family's money in-

come before taxes, and 70% of the family's
money income after taxes. It was lower for families with no preschool children and almost equal

to the family's money income after taxes when
the family had young children. Home productivity increases with education but at a lower rate
than market productivity. Home production is.

II. The Estimation of Home Productivity

Following conventional theory, it is assumed
that welfare (U) is a function of consumption (X)
and leisure (L),

U = U(X,L).
(1)
Goods can be either purchased in the market
(XM) or produced at home (Z). Measuring the
home-produced goods and services in terms of
the price charged for them in the market,

X=XM+Z.

(2)

Home goods are produced using market inputs productivity of time in home production, and
(XH) and time inputs (i.e., work at home H),
generate the value of home production by integrating
the marginal productivity function.
Z = f(XH,H)
To estimate the marginal productivity function
subject to decreasing marginal productivity f > fH one can proceed in one of two ways: assume a

productivity in the market. Children increase the
value assigned to the wife's services and, hence,

Still I feel that the method described in this
paper provides a powerful tool to identify and
estimate the value of household production. My
first attempts in this area are highly encouraging.
At this stage I have focused on married white
families. A lot still has to be done. One should be
able to extend this work to compare the home
production of married and single persons, whites
and nonwhites. More important, the household
sector (or the nonmarket sector) plays a much
more important role in the less developed countries than in the developed countries. The application of the method to less developed countries
should yield better measures and understanding
of the process of growth and the gap in material
resources between the developed and the less
developed states.'°
Finally, the focus of this paper was on produc-

ket but preferred not to do so, either because it
found their prices too high, or because it found
their quality wanting. The "opportunity costs"
approach, on the other hand, ignores the fact that

a person working at home is, in essence, self
employed, contributing to the production process both his labor services and his entrepreneurial capacity. The "producer surplus" generated
by homemakers is ignored in the conventional
"opportunity costs" calculation.
To what extent can our estimates improve current estimates of the value added? The contribu-

tion of this paper to the improvement of the
aggregate estimates can be only modest. To obtain estimates of the value added generated by
the home production process, one has to subtract

from the estimates of total output the value of
market inputs. These inputs are, however, unknown. Still, for comparative reasons I listed in

The difference between our estimates of the
value of home production and the labor inputs
can be attributed to market inputs, the capital
services of consumer durables and to the wife's
entrepreneurial capacity. Casual observation indicates that the variability in market inputs with
age of children and education is relatively small,
the differences in home production originating

presumably in the other two factors. Conventional measures tend, therefore, to understate

To illustrate, assume that market inputs into home production are represented by the family's consumption at food,

Under this assumption, when food and labor inputs are sub-

tracted from home production the residual would, on the
average, come to about one fifth of our estimate of home
production: for a mother of preschool children the residual is
around 30% (irrespective of education and employment
status) and it is about 10% for women whose youngest child is
aged 6 or more (the percentage increasing slightly with wife's
education). Ignoring the services of consumer durables, this
would imply that entrepreneurship at home is more important
when there are young children, and the more schooling the
wife has.

predicted values (equation (A8)) to generate a powerful test
for the validity of the estimates and our assumption concerning the functional form.
