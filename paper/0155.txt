FOREIGN COMPETITION AND THE UK PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY

1. Introduction
a) Basic Issues and Approach. The British pharmaceutical industry has had
an enviable record of innovation throughout the post—war period.' Nevertheless,

review of British innovative activity is contained in NEDO [1973, U.

a substantial number of new ethical drugs issued in the United Kingdom have
arisen from research of foreign companies who by their operations have in-

fluenced British firms.2 The stimulating effects of transnational market—entry

activity on British companies in the industry have contributed substantially

to its structural change and growth. It is thus of interest to economists to
inquire how much competitive pressure is put on host—country firms, how they

respond, and with what speed they can enter newly emerging markets. This
paper, which seeks to identify factors contributing to the rate and character
of technical transfer and to assess host—country research and development
effort in response to foreign competition, is one of three examining the im-

pact of technically—advanced companies, particularly American, on British

industries.3 Beginning first with an analysis of imitation cycles in

31n this connection, the reader may find it useful to read he first
study of the series, which covers the British semiconductor industry, Lake

[1976). The paper by Cohen, Katz and Beck [1975] is also very relevant in
this regard.

pharmaceuticals and making use of a model of these, the study proceeds to
examine the transnationa]. operations of American and other foreign companies,

showing the connection between company size, sales and new product introduc—
tions.

The competition among firms selling ethical products, which form the most
technically advanced part of the pharmaceuticals market, is based primarily
on new product introductions consisting of new chemical entities and permuta-

tions of the specific qualities or combinations of drug components. Research
activity in the post—war period appears to have concentrated primarily in the
creation of new and substitute products with less attention devoted to the
improvement of the economies of manufacture as through automation in order to

reduce costs.4 Manufacturing economies frequently have been achieved not so

4McDonald [1973], pp. 23—27. Only a few of the very major products are

manufactured in bulk form, such as the antibiotics, penicillin, the tetra—

cyclines, neomycin, and the cortisones. Thus among ethical products only a
small percentage provide scope for substantial economies of scale. In the
case of over—the—counter proprietary products the proportion of the total
-

number is much larger.

much by mechanization or scaling—up production throughputs, but by the creation
of new material sources for chemical entities or the replacement of natural

sources with synthetics.5 These technical advances in their final useful forms

associated with the development of synthetic substitutes for natural products.

constitute new products. Our approach is to treat them individually, placing
them within the time scale and competitive situation of the imitation cycle.

b) The Data. Considerable time has been spent in the collection and
classification of data and information for the studies undertaken. The work
was divided into four groups: 1) individual pharmaceutical products, over one
thousand in all, 2) companies introducing pharmaceutical products into the UK,
numbering in excess of one hundred and fifty over the twenty—three year period,
3) company patent rights over the sale of individual pharmaceutical products,
including products patented before 1950, in order to ascertain how "new" the
medicinal substances were, and 4) classifications of medicinal substances into
therapeutic groups, into chemical—action groups, and into families of chemical

substances. The data are employed to establish imitation cycles as outlined
in Tables 1 and 2 and as described in the following section 2c. Table 4 gives
the original therapeutic classes, used. Information on products introduced
into the UK covered the period from January 1950 to December 1972. The study
made use of standard references such as the Martindale Extra Pharmacopea, the
Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMS), the NEDO (Centre for the Study of
Industrial Innovations, CSII) list of 466 new chemical substances 1958—70,

journals such as the Pharmaceutical Journal, the Chemist and Druggist, and
standard texts.6 We also employed information for American products given in the

déHaen lists for the period January 1963 to December 1972. Data on patents
were obtained through the Merck Index. Data on individual companies were
derived from annual reports of individual companies, through telephone calls,

and publications such as Standard and Poor (America), and Dun and Bradstreet

(United Kingdom). Ownership of companies was derived from Who Owns Whom for
the UK and Europe. The most complete coverage of company data relates to the
year 1971.

The products of the ethical drugs group of the pharmaceutical industry may
be classified in a number of ways dependent on the forms in which individual

substances are marketed. In the deHaen index pharmaceutical products are
grouped according to chemical form: 1) single chemical entities: new drugs
marketed for the first time in America by any manufacturer; 2) duplicate
products: single entity drugs that have been previously sold by another
manufacturer in America; 3) combination products: containing more than one

active ingredient; and 4) new dosage forms. The deHaen type of index is inadequate for use as an index of innovation since such lists frequently contain
minor new drug improvements, or competitive introductions, weighted equally,

i.e., numerically, with the major new drug discoveries representing significant

therapeutic advance. A genuine index of innovation should include only new
drugs of major medical importance, hence "unculled" data, such as provided by

deHaen, needs to be whittled down according to strict exclusion rules. The
classifications employed in this study used forms of both "raw" and "culled"
data.

Table 3, which follows, outlines the main therapeutic groups that formed

the first classification of the data. Tables 7, 8, and 9 identify

the princi-

pal American, British and European firms included in the data sample. Appendix
Table A6 lists other firms operating in the United Kingdom.

2. Characteristics of Imitation Cycles in Pharmaceuticals
a) Competition and

Research

Plateaus. The nature of rivalry in the pharina—

ceuticals industry, particularly in ethical drugs, is such that economists are
consistently in the dark or in disagreement about the extent of competition or

monopoly actually prevalent. The objectives and strategy of research and development activity towards new products and product differentiation are
somewhat different from those underlying the price competition in nonresearch—

intensive industries. For example, the ethical drug company may enhance its
competitive position with the exchange of the use of a discovery for a cross—
licencing agreement if it is not directly interested in exploiting its dis-

covery.7 Because the activity of product introduction is so important, we have

7Writers such as Steele [1964] suggest that the extent of competition

amongst drug companies is much less than generally thought.

established a framework by which new product competition can be examined and

which easily relates to the analysis of transnational market entry. The result
of our work is the concept of the imitation cycle, which is based on the frequently observed pattern of competition within ethical product groups.

The term imitation is used principally to denote the competitive activity
within a commercial or scientific area that appears to be directly in response

to, or related to, a major advance in knowledge. As the term imitation cycle
suggests, the competition between companies in the period following a major
discovery often takes the form of a burst of rival activity.

The speed with which firms can respond to the commercial possibilities

opened up by the discovery can determine their share of the eventual markets
created. Once the leaders have introduced a wide range of new products making

—9—
use of the new technology, subsequent firms may increasingly find that
technical limitations are obstacles to profitable market entry. Furthermore,
once the leaders have taken the easier markets, the pool of potential new

entrants may become smaller. These and other factors often lead to a slowing—
down of the pace of imitation and to a progressive diminishing of the numbers

of new entrant firms. The period over which the slackening of the pace of
market entry takes place can be referred to as the plateau period. Generally,
an imitation cycle, if measured in terms of new market entrants or with respect

to time, will, in its cumulative form, tend to level off, and to form a plateau.
This gives the imitation ttcycl&t a characteristic "S" shape as illustrated In

Figure 2. The independent research and development efforts which lead to market
entries may also, If aggregated, be seen to plateau.
The imitation cycle in pharmaceuticals constitutes a set of new products

which are substitutes in therapy or in usage. Although no actual measurements
of this substitution have been undertaken we have tried to establish what drugs

were most frequently prescribed within therapeutic areas. This was done with
the aid of the Nartindale Extra Pharmacopea, the Monthly Index of Medical

Specialties (NIMS), and other publications. In the course of this work, it was
found that very important chemical groups frequently overlapped each other in
their therapeutic applications, or that they developed into chemical or

therapeutic branches which could be examined on their own. The classifications
eventually arrived at Involved a judgment concerning the type of imitative or
innovative activity most probably undertaken by firms that entered the markets

defined by the groups. Three main types of imitation cycle emerged which are
described in a later part of this section.

— 10 —

Pharmaceutical companies go to great lengths to protect their monopoly
advantages. The very successful company may be able to limit the numbers of
rival entries significantly. Our analysis shows the importance of technical
advantages reflected in the number of firms eventually entering therapeutic,

chemical, or market groups. To understand the industry more fully the economist may seek to disentangle whether limits to the number of entrants are the
result of physical factors, monopoly advantages, strategies or collective

welfare decisions. This is not a simple task.8 Our examination of imitation

Some of the problems are mentioned in the paper by Steele [1964].

cycles covers those regions of competitive activity where many of the monopoly
advantages, for the most part, have broken down.

Our work revealed considerable cross—licencing between companies, sometimes

rivals in similar markets. It may be prcposed, though by no means established,
that such activity amongst larger firms, especially the international ones, con-

stitute the bargaining and exchange of concessions between rival companies for

"safe" markets. Such arrangements could operate providing competitors hold key
patents to rivals' markets or areas of prospective expansion.
The licericing of British companies was found to be very significant. The

impact of the licencing of smaller British companies needs to be considered
within the market framework of their competitive activity. The concept of
the imitation cycle assisted us in analyzing licencing activity on this basis.

Various explanations of the plateau pattern, that is, the deceleration in the
rate of introduction of new chemical entities following an initial burst

of activit

have been put forward in the literature.9 The particular case of the

pp. 19—26.

antihistamine—based family of drugs is worth special attention in this regard,
since it represents one of the most fruitful sources of new drugs of the post-

war period. It is also a key to understanding various competitive aspects of
the pharmaceuticals industry. The following part looks briefly at the antihistamine group and its bearing on developments in the industry.

b) The Antihistamines. One of the most prolific chemical groups of the
post—war period for new drugs has been the antihistamines. By the early 1960s
most of the new chemical entities derived from this group, in excess of five

hundred in number, had been tested. Those of therapeutic value, about fifty
in total, had been patented. The imitation cycle of antihistamine drugs contains chemical entities of the same basic family. The antihistamines have a
number of actions on living organisms branching into a wide range of therapeutic

ones as shown in Figure 1. They exhibit the properties of local anesthetic,
adrenergic blocking, antispasmodic, sympathomimetic, analgesic, cholinergic

blocking, and quinidine (like))°

10See Wilson, Grisvold and Doerge [1971].

To examine the imitation cycle of this drug group it is necessary to treat
all its members as part of a flurry of research activity that in this case has

been international. Having done that, it is then possible to consider the

sub—groups of chemical entitles which go to make up the whole imitation cycle.
The sub—groups will often display a particular chemical, as well as therapeutic

property, and so a sub—imitation cycle neatly follows. The phenothiazine subgroups can be considered in this way. The competitive cycle in any one
therapeutic group may not be dominated by a given family of chemical entities,
and in such cases the term imitation Implies competitive activity in the search
for chemical entities with certain therapeutic properties, but of a different

chemical make—up. Such imitation cycles do not display the same consistency
in the pattern of new product timing as cycles within a chemical group, but
greater consistency if found if the size of end market is substantial than if

It is small. A large market attracts greater numbers of companies to search
for new drugs over a wider range of chemical groups, and to concentrate efforts
for a solution within a shorter space of time.

The imitation cycle of antihistamine drugs marketed in the States is reflected in the timing of patents issued for the drugs as represented in Figure 2.
It is apparent that while patent data on Its own may be of limited value, it can
be useful when supplemented, and culled, by data on the drugs actually marketed.

One of the interesting aspects of the cycle represented In Figure 2 is that the
plateau in the discovery of new antihistamines was reached well before the 19 62—

FDA rule changes. In fact the plateau effects were really being felt as early
as 1953. Data art the introduction of new antihistamine products for the post—62
period would, nevertheless, catch the plateau period of antihistamine derivatives,

perhaps, as part of the "legislative" effects (i.e., in terms of new drugs introduced).

c) Types of Imitation Cycles. An imitation of a new chemical entity means
that the same new substance may be introduced into the host—country by more than

one company. Such imitations, identical imitations, are to be distinguished

— 15 —

from imitative substances, that are part of the same chemical family, but
whose chemical makeup is slightly different. Imitations can be derivatives
of an original substance, which when modified through chemical change, lead

to a new substance. They can be analogs of an original discovery, and this
means that, though chemically different, the original substance and its analogs

have similar structure, or parallel structure. Analogs often show similar
chemical activity so that a rival firm, that finds an analog to another company's
drug, may have the key to a better or equal substitute for its product.

The flurry of competitive activity to find substitutes within a chemical
group or across groups tends to display cycle characteristics, i.e., the move-

ment towards a plateau following a rapid period of discoveries. The plateau can
frequently be explained as a saturation effect. If a chemical family yields
relatively few new drugs, but these are sufficient therapeutically, progress

within the therapeutic group may be dominated by the one chemical family, with

its best derivatives accounting for the greatest share of the market. A larger
market and a less satisfactory therapeutic solution can result in a search for

new substitutes in other chemical groups. Then again, a chance discovery in
another group may lead to competition In the search for and testing of new
derivatives.

Three types of imitation cycle are included in our analyses. The first
involves the single chemical entity that is widely imitated. This imitation
might be facilitated because there is no patent protection to any particular
company, or the discovery is freely licenced by a company that has the patent.

Generally when such a cycle is large the scope of the market for which the

chemical entity is used is also large. For an example of this type of imitation
activity consider Figure 3, which illustrates the imitation cycle for prednisolone,

brief coverage of the corticorteroid hormone discoveries is given

in Henry Steele [1964], PP. 202—212. For a more detailed examination see
Applesweig [1962], pp. 9—52.

The second type of imitation cycle studied is that of closely related

derivatives of a newly emerging chemical group. A good example of such a
cycle, illustrated in Figure 4, is that of the thiazides, developed for both

hypertensive and diuretic treatment. All the thiazides belong to the same
chemical family, and many of the analogs of the thiazide molecule represent
little structural change, but the dihydrochlorothiazide derivative has a

stronger potency (10 times more than chlorothiazide) and less toxicity. The
benzothiadjazjne derivatives, as otherwise known, are a substitute for meralluride,

a parenteral drug developed in the early 1940s. The thiazide drugs owe their
discovery to research carried out on sulfonamides of which they are a subgroup.
Like the antihistamine group the sulfonamide group has been a prolific source
of new chemical entities, but in both the pre— and post—war periods.

The third type of imitatinn cycle includes new chemical entities of more

than one chemical group, but having similar therapeutic value. The MAO inhibitors are just such a collection of drugs. The original impetus to discovery
of this group came from the drug iproniazid, studied for its anti—tuberculosis

activity. A related drug isoniazid was found to be more suitable for tuberculosis treatment, since iproniazid tended to have the side effect of exciting

patients treated. This stimulant quality of iproniazid was researched at greater
depth, and the drug was found to be very useful in psychotherapy applications.
The drug is a member of the hydrazine group, and other hydrazines were explored

for the same use. The chemical process by which these hydrazines have their
stimulant effect was termed MAO inhibition. In a very short time drugs outside the hydrazines were found that could act in the same way, and in the

early 1960s several non—hydrazines were tested. The imitation cycle of the
MAO inhibitors introduced into the UK is shown in Figure 5.
All three of the above types of imitation cycle are amenable to experiments using the smooth time profile created with the lognormal model which

is developed in the next section. The patent protection offered to new chemical entities can, however, lead to a slightly different pattern of imitative

activity. This can occur because of a chemical structure that is not easily
imitated, or to which there are few analogs or readily obtainable derivatives.
Occasionally, all the derivatives that are found are much less effective than

the innovator's patented chemical entity (les). Once the patent of the drug
expires, i.e., after sixteen years in the UK, and if the market for the drug

is very large, then a period of intense

competitive activity normally results.

During this period host—country firms, where the innovator is a foreign company,
can share in the drug's market through close imitation.

Nothwithstanding this

fact, the innovating company may have a reserve strategy, or contingency plan,

already in motion. One such strategy involves

delaying of the patenting of

the original drug's successor, which can be both a costly and risky process.

The firm has first to find a superseding drug, and then to delay the patent
so as to derive a continuous form of protection for

its proprietary expertise.

The tetracycline group of drugs illustrate the intense competitive acti-

vity following the period of patent protection. A number of tetracycline drugs
have been marketed in the UK by

American—owned companies, i.e., Lederle of

Cyanamid, and Pfizer. Carlo Erba, an Italian company, has also marketed a drug

of the tetracycline family. The period of Intense competitive activity following
the period of patent protection is shown in Figure 6. It would appear that the

expires. The imitations, as represented in the graph, do display a

pattern similar to the cycles already discussed, but with the monopoly (or
oligopoly) period preceding.

d) Technology Transfer and Transnational Market Entry. It becomes
apparent from our analysis that the rivalry between leading pharmaceutical
companies in the postwar period was rarely confined to national economies.

For competitive reasons, many of the leading companies have operations in
more than a dozen countries, often marketing on a worldwide basis, and frequently creating new technology or improving existing processes in more than

one country. Progressive drug companies, developing new markets or technical
areas, often established foreign subsidiaries or made supply and licencing

arrangements with foreign companies. Furthermore, very novel pharmaceutical
products tended to require a significant marketing and therapeutic effort,
which normally called for an increased local presence.

Some of the key factors behind the transfer of drug technology between

the United Kingdom and the United States are discussed in section 4. The
important aspects of technology transfer considered relate to the direction
in which it takes place, the lead or lag between market entry in source and
recipient countries, and the firms responsible for technology transfer and

creation. A sample of 74 new drug products is used.

3. A Model of the Imitation Cycle
a) Methodology. The experiments carried out on the imitation data are
of

three basic kinds. The first examines the overall time pattern of market

entry

taking

the imitation lags MS

as

observations. These are the lags found

between the date of the first introduction of a drug into the UK and introductionS
by imitating companies, and are measured to the month. The lognormal model is
used for estimating the characteristics of the time pattern of market—entry

— 23 —

introductions

MS. The regressions for the model are based on the following

formulation where MS takes its natural log form:
in MS

e =

terms

Each equation estimated thus has two parameters, mu and sigma, which vary
from cycle to cycle, and are indicative of the time pattern of each imita-

tion cycle. Variations in mu generally are indicative of forward or backward
shifts in the average timing of market entries, while variations in sigma are

indicative of bunching or clustering of imitative market—entry activity. A
low value for mu thus tells us that firms are generally early in their introductions (the imitation lags on average are short), while a low value for
sigma suggests that firms tend to enter together rather than being spread out

over the imitation cycle. These parameters of the lognormal model have several

other useful properties)2

more detailed explanation of the model is given in Lake [1976].

The second kind of experiment is designed for the purpose of assessing

individual company positioning within the cycle. Three types of index are
used for this purpose, and all pertain to the individual company's activity.
The first index, the unweighted index, is a count over all the imitation cycles
of the numbers of chemical entities that the particular firm has introduced.
The second index, a weighted index, assigns a weight to the participation in
individual cycles depending on the positions held by drugs of the company.

If the position held is 1st then the weight value (w1) assigned is 12, 2nd is 11,

— 24 —

and so on to the 12th, which, along with subsequent introductions, is weighted
by 1. The index for the jth company thus is compiled as follows:

w1m

+

w2m2

+ ... +

+
w3m3j

wm

(2)

1,...,

= number of cycles in which company j was in rank i.
= weight value assigned to rank I (w1 = 12, w2 = 11,
w3

10

1, q13 1 ...).
The final value of the index is W. The weighted index gives an estimate of
the timing of new chemical entity introductions that is characteristic of

the company involved. A company that is consistently first to introduce new
drugs in new chemical areas will have a high index value.

A further refinement, index three, makes use of the weight values

described above. The sum of these for an imitation cycle k, which is (Ewi)k,
can be used to "normalize" the weights for individual market entries, the Vjk•

Aggregation of these "normalized" values, i.e., the XK for the firm, provides
us with another measure of performance of the firm for the imitation cycles

in which it has participated.13 Moreover, this "normalized" performance index

13For example, a firm that is second in imitation cycle three and ninth

in imitation cycle twenty—five, receives the index three value: 11/81 + 4/93
=

.179.

Imitation cycle number three has fourteen participants, and number

twenty—five has twenty—six participants; thus (lw1)3

81 and (Ew)25 93.

takes into account the eventual number of firms participating in the imitation

cycles where market entry is made. Computation of index three is as follows:
Index three

ZXk =

1[ik/(i)k

(3)

— 25 —

Furthermore, a measure of average performance can also be derived based on
the average values of the "normalizedtt weights comprising index three. This

measure, denoted as ,

is

derived as follows:

Ex/N
where,

Xk =

wikWi)k

N = the number of market entries made by the firm.
Associated with the average performance of the firm is the standard deviation

value s, of the consistency with which the average x was maintained. It
enables us to examine another important aspect of the individual firm's performance.

The third set of experiments makes use of the dates of market entry
within imitation cycles for each company to build up a performance profile
based on the imitation lags

(for ith company), of the jth imitation cycle.

The formulations employed are as follows:

Lii =tii —t oj
=

imitation

lag for the ith company within the jth imitation cycle

where:

date that the first product of the jth imitation cycle was introduced into the UK (month/year)
date the product of the ith company was issued (month/year) in
the jth imitation cycle.

The average imitation lag for each company i over the imitation cycles is
then:

n

i= j=l
EL1,
n = number of imitation cycles

The

are then used to compare differences between companies

or scope of operation.

b) Estimation and Results. The results of the first two

sets

of experi-

ments are summarized in this section and those of the third set make up the

analysis of section 5. The new drugs covered represent the glamour markets
of the pharmaceutical industry. The analysis that follows examines the participation by host—country and foreign—owned firms in these markets in the UK.

The companies of the study have been divided into three groups: American—
owned companies, British—owned companies, and companies of other nationality

of ownership. Where possible an attempt has been to take the original company
rather than the merged enterprise in attributing product introductions, e.g.,
drugs introduced by Parke Davis are attributed to that company, and a final
picture brings together all the drugs under Warner—Lambert with those of

William Warner. The sample of imitation cycles covers most of the pharmaceutical markets since an attempt was made to get as complete a coverage as possible
given time and resources.13

13Where omissions have occurred, as in the cases of cancer chemotherapy,

metal antagonist, and virus drugs, this has been partly due to insufficient
data and partly because of the extremely specific nature of the therapy areas.
Furthermore, many of the products excluded do not represent profit—making introductions.

The results of the lognormal estimation of imitation cycles given in
Table 4 show great variation in values of mu and sigma.14 It became immediately

'4Norrnal curves were also estimated, but are not presented in this paper.

A modified lognormal model with the base observation, i.e., the first observation, given the values ranging from in 2, i.e., 0.693, to in 4, i.e., 1.386,

was tried with improvements to the regression coefficients resulting in many

cases. These results are also not given in this paper so as to keep the re—
suits along the line of the usual lognorrnal experiments with in 1, i.e., 0.0,

as the base observation. This viii permit comparisons to be made with results
for imitation cycles estimated in other industries.

apparent that the analysis of the pharmaceutical industry would have to differ
in important respects from that of other industries because of regulations

governing a large part of its competitive behavior. At an early stage the
cycles for the post—62 period were examined to see if fundamental differences,

such as a marked slowing up of imitative behavior, were characteristic. No
definitive conclusion could be reached, but it did appear that new imitation

cycles for the post—62 period were remarkably few in number: the oral contraceptives, the post—thiazide diuretics, non—narcotic antitussives (to a limited
extent), cancer chemotherapy, the prostagiandins, drugs for rheumatism and

arthritis (still few real successes), are some of these. It was also thought
that the post—62 period might show itself with an effect on the mature phases
of the imitation cycle, making the slowing—up period of new introductions more

pronounced, but on this point no definitive answer came. It appeared that no
discernible effect of the post—62 period could be found on the imitation cycles

already in progress, even for the tranquilizer group. The answer must most

lie in the numbers of really new chemical groups being tested, fewer

in number, and tried with more thoroughness.

The parameters estimated by the lognormal model were used in a regression
analysis with selected variables measuring market participation to ascertain
whether an association could be found between the shape of the imitation cycles
(as measured by mu and sigma) and the composition and numbers of firms making

them up. Would, for example, a larger number of American firms making up an
imitation cycle significantly determine its characteristics? The results of
this regression study, though inconclusive, suggest that competition between
companies may marginally shorten the time profile of imitation cycles through
competitive pressure, with a clustering of introductions reflected in a negative

sigma coefficient. This has happened when relating numbers of the ten American
firms with the largest foreign sales that have entered the market, or numbers

of the world's largest twenty pharmaceutical firms, to sigma as follows:'5

When the composition of firms making up the imitation cycles included larger

numbers of British or foreign companies, this tended only marginally to lengthen
the imitation entry period, thereby influencing mu.

None of the independent variables showed significant associations with either

p or a at the 5% level. The results are therefore only suggestive.
The second approach to the analysis of the impact of foreign firms on
the UK industry makes use of the indices, already described, for participation
frequency, i.e., number of new chemical entities, and imitations, and timing

of introductions within imitation cycles. Taking the sales of individual
companies in the UK for 1971 as the dependent variable and the indices as
independent variables, the regression results given in Table 5 were obtained.

The relationships in all cases between sales and the indices individually are

significant at 5%; however, in no cases were the constants significant. The
strongest association between innovative activity, as measured by the indices,

and sales was found for the European and other foreign company groups. The
t statistics suggest a more consistent relationship in the case of the indices
weighted by the position the firms hold in introducing products within the
cycles, than for the unweighted index

Nevertheless, both types of index

illustrate the importance of innovative activity to market performance

A comparison of the performance of the leading US, UK and European firms
over the 40 Imitation cycles, can be made by taking the index averages for the

10 firms scoring highest in each category. The results of this computation for
the three indices are presented in Table 6. The group averages of three in-

dices give US subsidiariesthe highest scores in each case. Furthermore, as
indicated by the standard deviations for each group average, the 10 leading US
subsidiaries have tended to have a high consistency of performance.

The market entry activity of US subsidiaries is illustrated in Figure 7

by means of the cumulative frequency distribution based on the positions of
entry in UK imitation cycles. Although comprising a smaller group in terms
of numbers of firms, US subsidiaries made more market entries and held more
of the leading positions than UK firms.

In addition to the three indices of the total performance of individual
companies, two measures of average performance were calculated and are pre-

sented in Tables 7, 8 and 9. The first is the ratio, index two/index one,
and is a measure of the average weight assigned to the market entries of an

individual firm. The second, , was described in section 3a, and has the advantage that it also takes into account the eventual number of participants
of those imitation cycles in which the firm participated, assigning a higher
weight where this number was lower.

The measures of average innovative performance were used as independent

variables in regressions which are presented in Table 10. Since the variables
for average performance tended to be correlated with those of total performance,

the regression analysis of these was conducted separately. Furthermore, an
association between company size, as measured by UK sales, and average performance

became apparent from the regression results. Thus, average performance, as an
explanatory variable of company sales, could not be used generally, its usefulness
as an explanatory variable itself tending to increase with the size of sales.

Those large firms, which not only tended to make more market entries, but
were also more consistent in leading within imitation cycles, tended to

have larger sales. Notwithstanding this limitation, average performance
was a most useful explanatory variable in the case of the US subsidiaries.
The factors influencing their participation within UK imitation cycles are
considered in the following section.

.

— 43 —

4.

Market Entry Activity in Pharmaceuticals
a) Transnational Operations of American Conpanies.

A number of factors

go to make the foreign investment activity in the pharmaceutical industry a
special case even though much of its patterns are similar to other research

and marketing—intensive industries. The special qualities of the industry
derive primarily from the extent to which it is regulated. The food industry,
e.g., sausage making, is regulated internationally by laws of individual
countries, or trading areas, to control qualitative aspects of manufacture,

and indeed, qualities of the final product, e.g., permitted amounts of food

preservative or meat substitute. The pharmaceutical industry, however, is
remarkable in the extent of regulation.
International differences regarding the character of the restrictions
and requirements for production, testing, and sale of pharmaceutical products
are probably an important explanatory variable in the levels and qualities of

activity in different countries. Marginal differences or changes in legisla—
tion can influence company behavior in a number of ways: cause a company to
devote more expenditure and manpower to certain aspects of drug research,
development (testing), or manufacture; influence the timing of activities

by the company, the extent to which it can simultaneously carry out several
aspects of drug introduction; influence the type of companies that will be
able to innovate successfully, e.g., by raising standards and costs of research.
Three kinds of tests were carried out on data collected on the product—market

activity of US subsidiary firms in the UK. The first considers various aspects
of technology transfer within and between US companies, and between US companies

and ather foreign companies. The channels of technology transfer used by companies can be assessed on the basis of the frequency of use, direction, and the
lags involved.

— 44

—

The second set of tests relates to the pecking order of companies making
new product introductions, or imitating within an imitation cycle. Do the
more research—intensive firms tend to introduce products earlier within the

cycle? Since size may be an important determinant of the level of activity
of an individual company we assessed whether larger firms tended to imitate
earlier.

By these tests the consistencies of patterns within the imitation

cycle are made clearer.
The third set of tests is related to the second, but makes use of the
indices of innovative and Imitative activity to analyze participation of com-

panies within the imitation cycles. Along these lines we examine the relationship between imitative activity and a range of variables reflecting characteristics of the firms.

Where have American firms tended to innovate earlier, the UK or America?
To answer this question the dellaen list of 154 new chemical entities introduced

into America over the period January 1963 to December 1972 was used, with the

omission of some items. The deHaen list contains chemical entities that, while
slightly different in structure from previous entities, are not sufficiently

different to produce imitation cycles, e.g., certain salts. Furthermore, a
list of all the new chemical entities introduced into the UK will not be the
same as that for America, e.g., .although Beecham introduced a number of semi—
synthetic penicillins into the UK, only a

proportion have been sold in America.

Of the list of 154 new drugs approximately 50 have not been introduced into
the UK either because alternatives have been available, because of toxicity,
because introduced in other forms, or because introduced later (than December

1972). Twenty—five others have been introduced into the UK, but at the time
of writing the exact dates have not been determined. The remaining 74 new
chemical entities form a very good base sample for the test. Two drugs were

found to have been introduced simultaneously. A list of the 74 innovations is
presented in Table A2 of the appendix.

— 45 —

A new chemical entity introduced into the UK earlier than into America
represents a lead for the UK. Of the 74 drugs comprising the test, 52 were
found to have been introduced into the UK earlier than into America. Of
the remaining 22 drugs, 20 were introduced earlier into America while 2 were

introduced simultaneously. This timing of new chemical entity introductions
is further illustrated by Figure 8, which divides the timing of introduction

according to half—yearly intervals. The leads of market entry in the UK prior
to introduction in America tend, on occasion, to be substantial, e.g., twenty—
one percent of the drugs have been introduced with a UK lead of greater than

3 1/2 years. The overall average lead (all drugs) to the UK has been 1.34
years (16 months).

An analysis of the drug introductions In the US and the UK,presented in
Tables 11 and 12,reveals that a major share, 49%, of the transfers between

countries were made within US companies, a further 6% between, and another

18% to US companies. Of the remaining drugs, 27% were transferred outside
US companies, 24% were exchanged within or between European companies, and
only 3% were exchanged within UK companies.

The figures given in Tables 11, 12, and 13 suggest that transfers within
and to US companies were generally more rapid than In the case of European

companies. Transfers between companies tended also to be slower, particularly
in the few cases between US companies where introduction of a new drug is first
made in the UK.
Given the lead that the UK has had for the introduction of new drugs,
apparent from Table 13, it might be suggested that many of the transfers of

technology occur from the UK to the US. However, while some US firms are known
to conduct research and development in the UK, it is more likely that the market
entry there was more for marketing reasons than because the original research

was carried on in the UK. Nevertheless, it is apparent that US companies have

The channels, direction and lags of technology transfer may have changed

over the period 1963—72. An examination of the results of an analysis for two—
year periods is given in Table 14. It is readily observable that the numbers
of drugs transferred within the sample has tended to fall. Moreover, the
leads enjoyed by U.S. and other foreign companies introducing drugs first into

the United Kingdom have tended to fall. It would thus appear that the disparities of leads or lags of drug introduction have tended to decline, as well
as the frequence although the latter may be a general effect of fewer drugs,

as measured by the sample, being transferred. However, it may be a limitation
of the sample that more transfers for the most recent years were not found.

What characterizes the American companies that innovate or lead within

the imitation cycles in the host country? Those American coipanies that
have subsidiaries in the UK represent only part of the U.S. pharmaceutical

industry. By the fact that they have foreign operations they are already a
select group.

This second test of American companies operating in the UK pharmaceutical

industry involved ananalysis of those imitation cycles where the proportion
of American companies was sufficiently high for the methodology adopted, i.e.,

six or more U.S. companies. This criterion resulted in a sample of thirteen
imitation cycles.

The positions of individual American companies within the imitation cycles

were determined according to the products introduced by the subsidiary. The
ranks so derived were suitable for rank correlation analysis with other variables.
In selecting the variable to be tested, a number of variables such as the foreign
sales of American companies and their total r and d spending were found to be

correlated

with Index Two (part of the third type of tests carried out), and

are thus related to an American subsidiary's innovative activity in the UK.

Research intensiveness, as measured by the ratio of r and d expenditure to
total company sales, was found to be very poorly related to Index Two, and

was therefore not used. However, an alternative variable, the quality of research
effort for the period 1963—72, was used, and was defined as the number of r and d
personnel (1969) in the U.S. per new drug introduced in the U.S. during 1963—72.
Furthermore, total company r and d spending in 1971 was eventually chosen as a

variable. The reason for this choice in preference to the foreign sales variable
comes from the analysis of the timing of innovation between America and the U.K.

above. Foreign sales would reflect innovative activity, and so are probably
best represented as a dependent, rather than independent variable, in relation

to innovative activity. A company's r and d spending, though related indirectly
to sales, i.e., through profit savings, provides a better independent variable
for innovative activity.

The ordinary rank correlations derived from rankings of r and d spending
in 1971 and the quality of r and d with respect to company positions in the
imitation cycles are given in Table 15. They show a tendency for those firms
leading in r and d spending and in the quality of r and d to be early within

the imitation cycles. Two contrasting reasons for this pattern might be

offered. The first is that r and d spending and a high quality of r and d
reflects the companies' desire not only to introduce a new product, but to

introduce it earlier. Increases in r and d spending can be reflected in the
numbers of new products introduced, but it can also be reflected in the timing

of the introductions. A company's savings, and future r and d spending, are
probably related to the timing of its introductions. This leads us to the al—
ternative reason for the pattern to be observed, as in Table 15. The r and d
figures for spending relate to 1971, and may therefore reflect the performance

of

the company in introducing products earlier. The earlier a firm introduces

an innovation the higher its profits and saving, and hence the higher its
future r and

d spending.

The, circularity between r and d spending, the timing and numbers of the

innovations, and the extent of the foreign sales of American companies operating
in the UK is again seen in the following tests, using indices of innovative be-

havior to reflect the timing and numbers of innovations. In the discussion so
far the qualitative aspects of the products introduced have not been related

to the timing of product introductions. Two assumptions have been made. The
first is that the products of late entrants may be qualitatively better than
that of the innovator, but where the qualitative difference is substantial we

have a beginning to a new imitation cycle. Put together the two imitation
cycles form a double cycle or "wave." This effect can be seen in Figure A4,
where the imitation cycle of oral contraceptives has been drawn. The beginning
of a second cycle in the autumn of 1972 is clearly apparent. The new products
introduced then were the single hormone contraceptives. Earlier pills consisted
of two hormones.

The second assumption relates to the definition one assumes for assessing

the quality of a product. An innovation has the quality of being available
early, rather than late. In a commercial sense this quality of the good can
enable profits and savings to be made by a company even though later products

may be superior in other qualitative features. This time—related quality
of pharmaceutical products is an important element in company research strategy,
not only in terms of where a product is introduced first, but how soon.

What structural patterns can be detected_ben4oyy_prformance

and a corn ants_production and sales n the host_count? We have already
been reminded that the relationship between sales and research activity is
circular. A high level of r and d, relative to other firms and absolutely,
when judiciously spent, tends to reflect itself in innovative performance,

more new products, and earlier market entry. This can mean larger sales,
and more foreign sales (perhaps as a necessary rather than sufficient condi-

tion). Larger sales can mean greater corporate savings, which can lead to
higher r and d expenditure, and so on. This pattern may be termed as "benign."
The indices of innovative performance have been designed so as to permit

an analysis of the "benign pattern" by means of regression tests. Additional
data used for this purpose were based on information on individual companies
giving total expenditures on r and d, foreign (outside USA) sales, UK sales,

total company sales, employees in the UK. All data, as presented in Table 16,

apart from the indices and employment figures, were for the year 1971. From
these basic variables composite variables were derived: 1) r and ditotal
company sales, a measure of research intensiveness, 2) UK/foreign (outside
USA) sales, an estimate of the relative importance to the company of UK sales

compared to other foreign markets, 3) Tj}(/ company sales, giving the
relative importance to each company of UK sales. Apart from the two indices
of innovative performance by each company in the UK market, the variables and

derived composite variables were employed as independent estimators. In a
structural sense the first index, that describes the numerical value of new

product introductions (as well as the second index measuring the timing of
company product introductions), forms an interdependent relationship to many

of the variables mentioned above. Thus r and d spending can be thought of
both as a result of innovative performance and as an important determinant
of future innovative performance.

A virtue of presenting all the non—performance variables as independent
variables lies in the fact that It permits a quick assessment of the strengths

of relationships between the two groups of variables. The regression results
for a sample of 17 American companies operating in the UK are presented in

Tables 17 and 18. The first point to be made is that r and d expenditure,
UK employee numbers, and company foreign sales, all show a consistent relation-

ship with both indices of Innovative performance. There are very good reasons
along the lines of the "benign pattern," above, as to why they should. The
relationship between UK employees numbers (both scientific and manufacturing
staff) and innovative performance is an interesting one, and deserves further

study In another paper. The composite variables, especially the one to reflect
each research intensiveness, i.e., r and d/total sales, did not display strong
consistencies, but the variable measuring the relative importance of UK sales

is suggestive. It implies, but only, that companies selling a higher proportion
of their total sales to the UK tend to be more Innovative, or perhaps as a
condition of these sales need to be more innovative, i.e., both in numbers of
products and the timing of their introductions within the imitation cycles.
In addition to the regression analysis already described, further regressions
were made using the variable measuring the quality of research effort in the

United States during 1963—72 as an independent variable. The analysis when conducted on a sample of 11 U.S. companies resulted in the following equations:

A number of firms, particularly

Pfizer, William Warner, and Sterling—Winthrop excluded from equations (9) and

(10) above, appear to have been highly innovative despite a significantly lower
quality of research effort as measured by the variable QRE.16 The results

otherwise support the conclusion that a high quality of research effort in

with
the United States is associated/ better market entry performance in the United
Kingdom.

In summary we can say that the evidence tends to support the concept of

the "benign pattern." American firms tend to introduce products into the
UK earlier than into the USA. Companies with a higher relative expenditure
on r and d and a higher quality of research effort in the United States tend
to be the leaders in introducing products within the UK imitation cycles.

b) The Competitive Response of British Companies. In what ways does the
entry of multinational companies into the host—country industry influence the

strategies or native companies? One possible view is that the large international company is primarily responsible for all the really major innovations

in the industry. This can be explained on the basis of their size, their
access to investment or research capital, the proprietary skills they possess
in marketing, in organizing for successful research and development, and in
carrying through the whole tangent of activities that go to make for commercial

— 61 —

success.

Along these lines of thinking the host—country firms are generally

characterized as being responsive to the initiatives taken by the innovators,
the large international firms, who are very large because they know how to inno-

vate. An alternative view is that the large international companies, while
they hold a major share of the commercial markets in the host country, do not
necessarily lead it with their innovations, but in contrast make great use of
local initiatives taken to stimulate their own research and marketing efforts.

Along this argument the host—country firms could be the innovators from which

the large companies get their inspirations. Taken one step further, an argument might claim that when the larger firm innovates it is because it is led
rather than leader, but owing to its superior resource capabilities, power to

acquire, as well as develop, an idea, it has the greater ability to follow
through with commercial products at an earlier date.
It Is apparent from the figures of total r and d activity in the United
Kingdom that the British pharmaceutical industry spends considerably less

than the U.S. In 1972 it amounted to only L28 million compared to a U.S.

figure of $726 million or approximately ten times that amount.'7 Several

17See Wood [1973]. Direct comparisons of research expenditure are apt
to be misleading. In real terms UK spending is higher than implied. See
MacDonald [1973], pp. 477—494.

American companies, Lilly, Merck, Sharp and Dohme, Warner—Lambert, allocated

almost as much individually on r and d as the UK industry as a whole. In
1973 Roche claims to have spent $280 million on research and development,

and recently opened a 2 1/2 million UK research facility.

market—entry would appear to be by reciprocal investment in source—country
markets, particularly in the case of America. Many view the international
deployment of activities as a basic aspect of surviving, given the lead of

foreign competitors. Host—country companies, especially those that are not
capable of mounting a large research program, can eventually make use of a
proportion of the products originally introduced into the UK by foreign firms
for which patents have expired, but which have not been totally superseded.
Our work suggests that in the later stages of the product cycles (which make
up the imitation cycles), manufacturing cost and marketing tend to become increasingly important aspects of competition while the uniqueness of individual
chemical entities is diminished through the increasing availability of combinations and permutations of existing drugs representing no significant medical
advance.

The analysis that follows suggests the means toinnovation available to
the host—country firm. Let us suppose, for the moment, that because the costs
of developing really new chemical entities, i.e., those that would form the
basis of an imitation cycle, and that would go on to take a large share of
the relatively large markets, are very high, these are largely the prerogative

of the large international company. It is now fruitful to speculate as to
what products the local industry can survive on, or if fortunate, grow on.
By and large, we are probably forced to accept that host—country firms, at
least the bulk of companies, will be resigned to follow the lead of the inno-

vators, which, we assume, tend to be the larger firms in any significant product
area.

There are at least four types of imitative activity that can be undertaken
by late—corners. The first is the easiest, and involves simply finding those
products for which patent protection has run out, i.e., over 16 years old in the.

sulfa drugs, and a few of the

post—war synthetics, and there are other possibilities. The imitator "simply
ascertains a more economical means for manufacturing or distributing these

products. In recent years, firms

that

have adopted this approach to market

entry have sometimes made use of the slow speed with which officialdom can

force the infringer of a patent to stop production. An imitator, of the less
scrupulous variety, can, if it wants, begin production and sales of a product

still under the legal protection of the patent. It needs only to calculate
the speed with which the courts can operate to stop its production, and to
see if this is longer than the duration of patent protection.

The second method of imitation is more resourceful, and requires that
the firm have sufficient know—how to be able to produce an already successful,

or tested, product, and in exceptional cases, an untried product, under a
ilcencing

agreement. Such firms may

The third form of imitative activity requires a fairly high level of research and development capability. This is to scan the existing range of manufactured products, preferably those that are in large markets and are selling

well (under the patent period). It involves the firm deriving the same chemical
entity, but by a new chemical route, and a patentable one. Since many of the
larger firms try to guard against this type of imitation by finding and patenting
all the easy routes, the small firm that engages in this type of imitation needs

to know what it is doing, for the risks are great. Some of the products introduced
by BritIsh—owned companies involve this kind of imitative or innovative research

and development. Beecham, for example, was able to come up with the synthetic
penicillin, Penbritin, i.e.. ampicillin, and this involved finding the synthetic
route to penicillin.

The fourth form of imitative activity can require almost as much technical
skill as a major innovation, but generally represents a mid—way house between
the research of completely unchartered areas, and areas that are fairly well

known. It consists primarily in carrying out parallel research to that already
performed elsewhere and already resulting in a major innovation.

The research

is based on the hope of finding a derivative or analog to the entity that has

been found (and probably tested before it is revealed). The "imitator" may
attempt to find a substitute for the discovery by means of a chemical entity with

the same site of action but of a dissimilar structure. This is not always
possible, depending on the uniqueness of the innovation.

Firms embarking on the fourth form of imitative research strategy will

usually have strong research teams competing with them. They may find nothing
of use, and a great deal to go through. Even when a suitable chemical entity
has been isolated, the firm will need to keep its momentum. When competing
against a larger firm in the same area, it may find the task of protecting its
discovery and creating a market for its product a major challenge.

— 67 —

Many of the innovations introduced by British

companies have been by

research of the fourth type of "imitative activity described above. In Table 19
the numbers of new chemical entities introduced first by a British—owned company

are outlined. The success of host—country firms is noticeable in the infections
and infestations groups, i.e., antibiotics, antimalarials, anthelmintics, anti—
tuberculosis drugs.

Licencing has been an important means whereby British—owned companies introduce a new chemical entity first into the UK market; however, the more important

route has been that of internal r and d. The greater use of licencing has come
with product introductions by British companies for chemical entities already

issued. A number of the new drugs introduced first by British companies have

not been under patent. These are rediscoveries of new uses for chemical entities
that are known, or chemical entities for which patent protection adds nothing
to the market life of the chemical entity,

since, for example, it competes against

other readily available substitutes possibly superior, or it is of relatively
minor medical importance and small commercial value.

We now turn to the product—

market activity of American companies in the UK pharmaceutical industry.

had a value of 15 or more for Index One, measuring the frequency of imitation
activity, and 110 for Index Two, measuring the weighted total for each company's

market entries within imitation cycles.22

22As calculated according to the formulation in section 3a.

Entry Concentration. Of the 431 chemical entities introduced by the
leaders, 187 (43%) were from American subsidiaries, 131 (30%) from British

companies, and the remaining 113 (26%) from European firms. CIBA alone intro—
duced 23, almost one—fourth of the total number from European companies. Together the three companies CIBA, May and Baker of Rhone Poulenc, and Roche
have accounted for almost 60% of the introductions from the leaders of European

firms. The contributions by American and British firms were more widely distributed with the largest values for individual members of each group being

not much greater than 10% of the American and 15% of the British leaders. The
concentration of market entries measured by Ipdex One suggests that European
firms were the most concentrated and American firms the least concentrated of
the groups.

Enty Positioning. The aggregate value of Index Two for the 35 leaders
was 2,468 and when divided according to nationality of ownership came to 1,081
(44%) American, 854 (35%) British, and 533 (21%) European. The concentration
of the European group was again apparent with CIBA, May and Baker of Rhone

Poulenc, and Roche comprising two—thirds of the European value. The three
leading American and British firms took 34% and 36% of their totals respectively.

— 70 —

Imitation Lags.

Earlier we considered leads and lags associated with the

introduction of the same chemical entity into the United States and the United

Kingdom. In this section we consider for individual firms the lags that occur
following a major innovation in the UK and which leads to subsequent imita-

don within what we have defined as imitation cycles. Discussion of how these
lags are calculated has been given in section 3a.

The average imitation lag, which is measured according to the valuation

of ,23 of the 35 leaders given in Table 20 was 5.37 years. Of the same group

23See the note in section 3a, equation 4.

of firms the 14 American subsidiaries averaged 5.62 years, higher than either
of the British or European groups, with averages of 5.05 years and 5,02 years

respectively. The shortest average lags for individual firms were recorded
for Distillers, 1.27 years; British Drug Houses, 3.07 years; Organon, 3.09 years;

Crookes Labs, 3.51 years; The Welicome Foundation, 3.57 years; and Squibb, 3.67

years. As expected, the companies with lower values of Index rwo

had

longer

imitation lags on the average. The mean for the first ten leaders was 4.86
years, second ten, 5 57 years, and last 14 companies, 5 62 years, I e ,
Distillers.

excluding

24

24lncluding Distillers the figure was 5.33 years.

Taking just the first five leaders of each nationality group, the British

companies did well with a mean of 4.62 years. The average lags for the first
five of American and European groups were 5.24 years and 5.19 years respectively.

— 71 —

Average

Performance. Where the average performance of the leaders was

measured by the values for x, the measure of average performance weighted by

company positions within the imitation cycles (and accounting for the total
number of market entries),we found an overall average value of .0703. In the
case of the ten leading U.S. subsidiaries the average value was .0729; (higher
than the UK average value of .0705 (including Distillers) or .0650 (excluding
Distillers), but lower than the average value for European subsidiaries which

was .0734. Although it can be said generally that the larger leading firms
would tend to have better average performance values, it is also apparent that

small companies have innovated or led in imitation cycles. However, company
with
size is associate&/consistency of the firm over the longer period whereby previous successes are the basis for a growth in company sales.

b) American and Host—Country Comparisons. The analysis of this section
compares two groups of ten leading firms, one group American and the other

British,25 and is partly based on results given in Table 6. It was found that

25

They are the ten leading firms in Tables 7 and 8 and as measured by

Index Two (see section 3a).

the average value of Index One for the American group was 15 and for the British

12.3. The American firms thus tended to be more active in introducing new
products into the IlK ethicals markets.26 Similarly, in the case of Index Two,

was also apparent that more of the American introductions were based
on internal research rather than licencing compared to the leading UK companies
(however, no data are given here).

— 72 —

American firms outperformed their British rivals with an average of 91.0
per firm; that of the host—country group was 65.4 per firm or 39.1% lower.

Leading American firms thus not only entered the markets with more new
products, but also tended to have better positions (numerically) for entries,

than British companies. The average lag for the ten leading American companies,
overall, was approximately 5.33 years, compared to 4.83 years (including Distillers) or 5.45 years (excluding Distillers) in the case of the leading UK
companies.

c) Positions of Other Foreign Copanies. The following analysis is based
primarily on the results for ten leading European firms operating in the United

Kingdom.27 The average value for Index One of these companies was 11.9,

27

Aspro—Nicholas, which deserves special mention, recently decided to dis-

continue r and d activity in the UK. Its values for Index One and Two were 6
and 25 respectively, and its subsidiary, British Schering, 3 and 18.

marginally lower than that of the ten leading host—country firms. However,
the mean value for Index Two of this European group was 68.5 or 4.7% higher

than the ten leading UK firms. The average lag was 5.12 years, representing
the shortest for the three nationality groups.

The performance of this group of ten European firms representing four
countries was slightly better than that of ten leading UK firms (in terms

of numbers of introductions, positioning (numerically), and average imitation

lag. However, the concentration of activity by a few firms is more pronounced
within the European group.

Summarj and Conclusions
The influence of American and other foreign companies on the UK pharmaceu—

tical industry as a whole and on the performance of individual UK companies, has

been considerable. With its estimation and analysis of imitation cycles, our
study shows that the transfer of technology at the market level has stimulated
UK companies both to conduct research of a high quality and to perform competi—

tively within a very wide range of new drug technologies. Moreover, at the
production level, British companies have made great use of licenses from American
and other foreign companies in order to participate earlier within imitation
cycles, although the results of domestic research and development generally have

been adequate to meet the

challenge

of transnational market entry. Despite the

fact that leading American companies have on average performed better than their
UK counterparts, a number of British firms have maintained very high levels of
performance and have remained competitive.

The study succeeded in developing and estimating three types of imitation

cycle characteristic of ethical drug markets. It was marginally successful in
establishing an association between the composition by nationality or size group
of firms making up the imitation cycles and the time profiles of market entry.
In the case of the largest U.S. firms with foreign sales and the largest 20
international companies, there was a slight association, but not significant,

between numbers of these and the clustering of drug introductions. Larger
numbers of British and European companies had the effect, but not significant,
of lengthening the time profile of market entries.
A strong association was found to exist between innovative activity in

the UK and company sales. In the case of Index Two accounting for the frequency
and timing of new drug introductions, significant associations were also found
between it and size of U.S. r and d programmes measured in millions of U.S. dollars

and size of operation in the UK measured by UK employment. Furthermore, a variable

— 74 —

measuring the quality of r and d effort in the U.S. was strongly associated with
innovativeness in the UK.

American companies thus have been very active in the UK pharmaceuticals
industry, and for the post—1962 period, at least, they introduced many new

products into the UK market prior to market entry in America. Moreover, from
an analysis of 74 new chemical entities, it was discovered that the number of

drugs transferred appeared to have fallen as well as the length of the UK
leads for transnational market entry by U.S. and other companies (introducing

first in the United Kingdom). Various estimates of lags associated with inter—
firm and intra—firm technology transfer were made and it was concluded that
intra—firm transfers, as expected, generally were shorter.

Our study established that British companies have tended to rely fairly
heavily on foreign technology, both as a stimulus to domestic r and d activity

and as a source of know-how for marketable products. Moreover in terms of the
composition of the 35 leading firms in UK ethical markets, British companies

were not exceptional (34% being British). American and European companies
on the other hand were highly competitive. However, the activity of continental
European firms was concentrated in a few very substantial companies. It could
be concluded, nevertheless, that British firms were capable of carrying out the
full idea—to—market cycle necessary for independent market entry, and were also

capable of a quick response to innovationthrough the development of a competitive
product (or imitation).

The pressure on host—country firms to undertake research and development was

considerable. Local firms which were not innovative quickly lost their position
within the ethicals market. Competition between drug companies appears to be
intense though only a "moderate" proportion of market entry activity was truly

innovative. Rivalry between U.S. companies and other foreign companies as well
as host—country firms accelerates the rate of technology transfer within imitation

— 75 —

cycles.

Although the overall number of new imitation cycles being created

appears to have diminished a few major companies are innovative despite the
general trend for a slower pace of new drug introduction.
