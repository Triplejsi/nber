Since the early sixties, students have been attracted to the study and

to the practice of law. The number of lawyers increased by 33 percent between
1960 and 1970 after growing by just l4 percent during the previous decade.

Interest in the law has not declined since 1970. The annual number of new admissions to the Bar was higher in 1975 than in 1970 by 91 percent. This rapid
growth, while unusual, is not unprecedented in the United States, as witness the

30 percent increase in the number of lawyers (and judges) from 1920 to 1930
(Table 1, nor is it limited to the United States, as witness the increase in
the number of lawyers in Canada and in England during the sixties. Table 1
also shows the United States has been historically more lawyer intensive than
Canada

and England.

The renewed interest in the practice of the law andthese international
comparisons,

crude as they are, raise several questions about the underlying

determinants of the demand for lawyers. The prosperity of the twenties and sixties

indicates the level of economic activity is an important determinant of the demand

for laywers. The role of government regulation is less obvious and more difficult
to detect. It is often said the social legislation of the sixties, the expanding
scope of government regulations and judicial rulings are responsible for the

increase in the number of lawyers. Those who advance the regulation hypothesis
often support it with evidence from the sixties. The appeal of the regulation
hypothesis is reduced if a longer span of time is studied. The regulation
hypothesis does not explain why the U.S. has been historically more lawyer
intensive than Canada and England and cannot explain the rapid growth in

lawyers during the twenties. Nor does economic theory unambiguously predict
an increase in regulation will increase the number of lawyers. At least some
types of regulations of industry simultaneously raise the cost of production

and increase the use of lawyers. Regulations of this type, e.g. noise or
pollution control, encourage a more intensive use of lawyers, but also reduce

industry output and employment because of higher product prices. whether this
type of regulation increases the number of lawyers, depends on the strength of

these two opposing forces.!' Economic theory and some of the empirical evidence
suggests that government regulation may not be an important a determinant of

the demand for lawyers. Clearly some additional evidence on the comparative
effect of income, regulation as well as other variables on the demand for
lawyers is called for.

Professional training in law often requires three years of schooling.
Specialized training could lead to oscillatory or "cobweb" patterns in earnings
and numberof lawyers if prospective entrants fail to correctly forecast future

demand and cost conditions. Recent concern has been expressed that the current
large enrollments in law schools will depress earnings in law as the market

.

adjusts

to the large graduating classes. Freeman [l97!+] provides some results

suggesting that such oscillations are an important characteristic of the market

for lawyers. There are, however, several reasons to suspect that oscillations
due to systemmatic forecast errors cannot be of great importance in the market

for lawyers. The training of lawyers is sufficiently general that recent
graduates could and have substituted into other business occupations if and

when earnings in law are unduly depressed. In addition, systematic forecast
errors committed by prospective law students imply the periodic existence of

profitable investments in legal education. These reasons suggest a reconsideration of the legal market to determine if cobweb patterns are in fact an
important phenomenon of the market for lawyers.

!'If new legislation or administrative rulings reduce uncertainty at a
lower transaction cost than would occur within the existing legal system in
the absence of the new legislation, then the demand for lawyers may decline
with added regulation.

Another objective of this paper is to investigate the speed of adjust-

ment of law schools to shifts in the demand for lawyers. Law schools are
members of private nonprofit and public educational institutions. A large
proportion of law schools are approved by the American Bar Association (ABA).

Profit making law schools are excluded from the market and have been opposed

by the A.B.A. The organization of the legal education industry and the effect
of this type of organization on property rights and on the speed of adjustment of enrollments to shifts in demand have not been given serious attention.
Section I presents a theortical model of the demand for and supply of

lawyers. The empirical counterpafts of the variables are introduced in Section
II. Section III presents the results of the estimation and Section IV compares
the actual number of lawyers with the number that would have existed if lawyers

earned a normal return on their investment in legal education. Section V
presents other evidence of an excess demand for lawyers and offers several
explanations for the speed of adjustment of enrollments in law schools to shifts

in the demand for lawyers. The paper ends with a summary of the major findings
of the paper.

I. The Theoretical Model
The number of practicing lawyers in year t equals a fraction of the
number practicing in year t - 1

plus a fraction of new admissions to the bar

in year t.
Not all new admissions begin the practice of law. While the depreciation rate of new admissions may differ from the rate for existing lawyers, it
could be higher or lower. Older and more experienced lawyers have greater
investments in on the job training and would have lower depreciation rates to
offset the higher rates due to retirements, etc.

The quantity of legal services supplied, LS is assumed to increase

where Vt is a disturbance term. Under this formulation an increase in
earnings outside of the legal industry does not have an immediate effect on
the supply of legal services but reduces the supply of legal services in the
long run by reducing the number of lawyers. Given the stock of lawyers,

Since

In long run equilibrium the number of lawyers is determined so that
prospective law student anticipates a normal rate of return on the investment

in legal education. If the number of lawyers is less than this equi1ibrum
number, the anticipated rate of return on the investment in legal education wi1
exceed the normal rate of return. The number of' first year law students will

increase and three years later the number of lawyers will increase. This
adjustment to long run equilibrium may

be

described with the aid of'

graphs.

Let the demand curve for legal services be given by DD in Figure 1. If the
current number of lawyers is L1, the supply curve of legal services is given

by SS. Assume a college graduate can earn U dollars per year.

the college graduate must forego U for three years while attending law
school, the graduate will enter law school only if LE > (1 +

the anticipated rate of return from legal training

exceeds the normal rate of return, r. Law school enrollments and the number of

lawyers increase. The supply curve shifts to S'S'. The number of lawyers
increases to L2, earnings decline to (1 + r)3U

and the quantity of legal

services increases to LS2. The market is now in long run equilibrium since a
normal rate of return is earned on the investment in legal education
In long run equilibrium the annual earnings of a lawyer may be expected

to exceed (1 + r)3U.

The probability of completing law school and passing the

bar examination within three years of beginning law school has been appreciably

less than one, varying from an estimated low of .26 in 1938 to a high of .7

in 1969 over the l925-l94O and 1951-1970 periods.' Embarking on a legal
career has been a somewhat risky endeavor. It is iossible to derive an estimate
of long run equilibrium earnings that reflects the probability of failure.

that would exist if the first year class equals Ft_3. In the empirical work
reported below the observed completion rates are substituted for the completion
rates that would be observed if a long run equilibrium was continuously achieved.
However, completion rates will in general depend on relative earnings and therefor on the size of the first year class, Therefore, some measurement error is
introduced with this assumption. A more general formulation would make the
completion rate endceneous.

Equation (13) requires that new admissions in period t equal the difference

per laywer (the expression in the square brackets) and the expected number of

lawyers in t as projected in t - 3

in t -

from the size of the entering classes

and t - 5.

The actual number of first year students may be less than the long run

equilibrium number during periods of growth. Entry by profit making law
schools is prohibited and entry by nonprofit law schools is regulated by

minimum

requirements

established by the A.B.A. Within the nonprofit sector

the incentives for growth are attenuated. Tuition does not differ appreciably between
departments or professional schools and is independent of demand conditions.

In many law schools tuition could have been increased in the last ten years or
so without reducing enrollment but with a lowering of the quality of student.

Yet, some law schools act as if any increase in the net income of the law
school due to an increase in tuition or enrollment will be taxed at a high

marginal rate. In particular, the incentive to increase enrollment is reduced
if the use in net income reverts to the central administration. The degree
of attenuation of property rights is not random across law schools. In his
pioneering study of law schools in the twenties Reed [1928] distinguished
between law schools in universities with extensive private endowments or
public support and those in universities with little private or public support.

1j4

Law schools in universities with little private or public support were in
fact virtually independent operations whose net revenue depended on their

ability to attract tuition paying students. These law schools placed relatively
low prerequisites on prospective students requiring none or one year of college.

Well endowed law schools placed higher prerequisites on prospective students

by requiring a college degree. Differences in this type of behavior can be
explained by differences in property rights. While changes have occurred
since, the distinction between higher and lower quality schools remains a useful

one. In summary there are two reasons for expecting a slower response to a
shift in demand for lawyers: restrictions on the formation of new law schools

and the attenuation of property rights in existing law schools.JJ
If these arguments have some validity, the actual number of first year
students may at times differ from the equilibrium number.

The speed of response

by the legal education industry to shifts in demand can be estimated and the
model has been formulated to provide some estimates of this response rate.
it is assumed that the number of places in law schools for first year students
is always large enough to satisfy replacement demand due to retirements, etc.

The number of first year students required to satisfy replacement demand equals

(dt3Lti)/(ct(l_d)). A second assumption is that places for first year
students expand so that a proportion, w, of the discrepancy between the

equilibrium

number of lawyers in t and the projected number of lawyers in t,

attenuation of property rights should also exist in other fields
as well, e.g. business. If the legal education industry respondçs less rapidly
than the business education industry, it is presumably because of differences
in the cost of entry.

II. Discussion of Selected Time Series, 1920-1970

A. Number of Lawyers, New Admissions and First Year Law Students
A continuous time series of lawyers from 1920 to 1970 does not exist.

The decennial census estimates of the number of lawyers may be combined with
the annual number of new admissions to the bar to produce an estimate of the
depreciation rate for each decade from the expression

where Lt and Lt10 are Census of Population estimates of practicing lawyers1

and NAt. is known for i = 0

which satisfies the equality during each decade from 1910 to 1970. The

decennial estimates of d are shown below.

IlEquation (16c) could be estimated by using

Dt/c and L1/ct

as independent variables. However, accurate estimates of c. are difficult
to obtain without separating full time from part time students. Some preliminary results were not promising, perhaps because of the measurement errors
in

JMore precisely, the Census combines lawyers and judges.

Comparatively low depreciation rates were experienced from 1910 to 1930

and from 1960-1970. The highest depreciation rate occurred in the decade from

1950 to 1960. It

is likely that trends in the depreciation rates accurately

reflect the level of prosperity in the legal service industry. By this test
the periods from 1910 to 1930 and 1960-1970 were prosperous ones for the legal
profession.

Once the estimate of d is known for each decade, the number of
lawyers in each year of the decade may be estimated. As Table I indicates
the number of lawyers grew rapidly during the 1920's and in the l960's. This
may be seen even more clearly by examining the time path of new admissions

to the bar in Table III. New admissions increased rapidly after 1920 and
peaked in 1930. It is revealing that new admissions to the bar remained at
comparatively high levels during the first half of the thirties, averaging

9,)77 per year from 193019314. New admissions declined after i93L but still
averaged 8,772 per year from 1935-1939 compared to 9,132 per year from 1925-1929.
Given the large decline in real income from 1929 to 193)4, the modest decline

in new admissions over this period suggests that relative earnings of lawyers

remained high during the first half of the Depression. In the immediate post
war World War II period new admissions surged and then remained relatively
constant throughout the fifties at a level slightly higher than the late

twenties. New admissions have grown rapidly since 1963.

B. Actual and Equilibrium Earnings of Lawyers
No continuous series of lawyer earnings exists and those that do exist
are limited. From 1929 to l95)- the Department of Commerce surveys estimate

the income of lawyers in individual practice. The Internal Revenue Service
(I.R.S.) provides tax

return

data of the net income of sole proprietors sub-

mitting Schedule C and informational return data of partners in 19-9 and 1953

and annually since 1957. The two

series

were spliced together by (l inter-

polating the I.R.S. data from 1953 to 1957, and (2) adjusting the I.R.S.
series upward by 27 percent since the Department of Commerce data exceed the
I.R.S. data by an average of 27 •percent in 19b9 and 1953, two recent years
.
.
1/ A more detailed
where a comparison is possible.—
discussion of the income

data is presented in Appendix B.
Real lawyer earnings from 1929 to 1970 (in 19117 prices) are shown by

the series marked I in Figure II. Real earnings of lawyers remained fairly
stable from 1929 to the middle fifties and increased markedly thereafter. The
right hand side of equation (6) may be used to calculate an estimate of equi-

librium earnings of lawyers. Because a long time series of earnings of college
graduates or of high school graduates does not exist, annual earnings of full
time employees were adjusted upward to derive an estimate of the earnings of

high school graduates (see Appendix B). r was arbitrarily set at .10, an
estimate close to other estimates of the rate of return on education. The time

'The I.R.S. estimates are below the Commerce estimates because a
lawyer who is a member of a partnership but also has some independent practice
will submit a Schedule C (as a single proprietor) and will also be included in
the information return of the partnership. A salaried lawyer with a practice
on the side will also submit a Schedule C return. Because of the method of
reporting, I.R.S. estimates of net income per lawyer should be biased downward.

series of estimated equilibrium earnings of lawyers is shown by the series

marked by 0 in Figure II.

The actual earnings of lawyers exceeded equi-

librium earnings by decreasing amounts from 1929 to the early fifties. The
discrepancy disappears in the early 1950's but reappears and increases throu,gh-

out the 1960' s. The ratio of actual to equilibrium earnings is shown

in

Figure

III. This ratio equaled 1.67 in 1929, declines, hovers around unity throughout
the early fifties, rises during the sixties and equaled 1.29 in 1970. This
review of the earnings data suggests the market was adjusting to long run

equilibrium between 1929 to the early fifties. Real lawyer earnings remained
flat from 1929 to the mid-fifties while long run equilibrium earnings continued

to increase. New admissions remained relatively high throughout the thirties
because of the relatively favorable earnings of lawyers although the decline
in new admissions in the late thirties is not explained by the relative

earnings data. During the fifties the market for lawyers appears to have been
in long run equilibrium, and the approximate stability of new admissions

during this period is consistent with this conclusion. The rise in new
admissions since 1963 is consistent with the rise in the relative earnings of

lawyers. A surprising finding of this historical review of relative earnings
is that the speed of adjustment to long run equilibrium has been low since the
excess of actual over equilibrium earnings has persisted for relatively long
periods of time.

C. Exogeneous Determinants of the Demand For Legal Services
Given a body of law and current interpretations of this body of law,
increases

in

transactions

the level of economic activity will increase the number of

between consumers and firms and between firms and presumably raise

the demand for lawyers. Given the level of economic activity, an increase in

the number of regulations will also raise the demand for lawyers. The purpose
of the econometric estimation is to quantify these two effects)1
Consumers, firms and governments are the major users of the services

of lawyers. Recent surveys do allow some perspective on the relative importance
of consumers and firms as contributors to revenue of the legal service industry,

i.e. single proprietors and partnerships and certain nonprofit firms. In
19)48 the Department of Commerce reported consumers accounted for 52 percent

of total billings of the legal service industry [Winfield, 19)49]. The 1972

Census of Selected Services reported consumers accounted for 53 percent

of total billings. Individuals appear to produce about the same dollar volume
as firms do and somewhat surprisingly, the consumer share has not declined
over tinie./

Several proxy variables have been used to identify those transactions
where the services of a lawyer are likely to be used. The variables and the
symbols used are discussed below.

!JTime series analysis may be a superior way of measuring the adjustruent to equilibrium while a cross state analysis may be a superior way of
identifying the separate effects of each of the variables on the demand for
lawyers since the variables in the demand equation tend to move together
through time.

'In house council and government lawyers would be excluded from these
figures.

'If the burden of the increasing scope of regulation has been placed
on firms, it should have caused a relative rise in the use of the legal service
industry by the business sector. If this effect is operating, it has been
offset by a corresponding rise in the services demanded by consumers.

-

25

1. Consumer
Besides the level of real income, certain transactions have been
singled out for analysis.

a. Real Estate Transactions (MORG): A continuous time series real
estate transactions does not exist. Nonfarm housing mortgage loans made by
savings and loans deflated by the rent price index were used as a measure of
the volume of transactions in the real estate market):!

b. Divorce (DIV): The total divorce rate per 1000 population was
used.

c. Automobile Accidents (LOSS): Real dollar losses paid by insurance
companies for auto insurance (property and liability) divided by total motor
vehicle registrations was used.

2. Business
Transactions among firms create a demand for legal services. The volume
of transactions among firms in an economy will be directly related to the size

of the economy. Given the size of the economy, the number of transactions
requiring legal services will depend on the average size of the firm.

If there are relatively few firms in the economy so that the average size of
a firm is relatively large, the demand for legal services should be smaller
since the number of nonmarket transactions increases, i.e., transactions within

the firm will be larger. As the number of firms increases, the number of market
transactions will rise and with it the demand for legal services. Still further

I/Shorter series of the volume of mortgage recordings do exist. By
combining these measures, a-time series of mortgage recordings can be constructed. No change in results was obtained with these alternative measures.

26

increases in the number of firms may reduce the demand for legal services since

smaller firms are likely to use other less costly methods of resolving and

enforcing conflicts. Given the size of the economy the demand for legal
services is likely to rise with increases in the size of the firm up to a
point and thereafter decrease because more nonmarket transactions occur.
The proxy measures used to represent business demand for legal services are:

a. Real Gross National Product (RGNP): The number of market trans.actions among firms and the demand for legal services is expected to rise
with real gross national product.

b. Number of Firms (AC): Because a continuous series of the business
population is unavailable, the number of active corporations as reported by
the Internal Revenue Service was used.

3. Judicial and Regulatory Activity
The central difficulty in measuring the effect of government regulation
on the number of lawyers is that the available measures of regulation are

deficient in one or more ways. Some new laws or regulations create legal
uncertainties which are resolved through court activity. Measures of court
activity are available and may be used as a proxy for government regulation.
However, some new laws are sufficiently precise and some judicial interpretations
are so clear that the amount of subsequent judicial activity will be negligible

even though the effect on the demand for lawyers can be large. A new tax
law may increase the demand for (tax) lawyers without an appreciable

increase in subsequent court activity. While, the effects of regulation are
large, they would not be reflected in court activity. Hence, court activity
is an admittedly imperfect proxy for the scope of government regulation.

27

Rules promulgated and

enforced

by regulatory commissions raise

similar issues. On the other hand the scope of activity of regulatory
commissions cannot be independent of the available resources. The number and
thoroughness of investigations and the level of enforcement of regulations

depend on the size of the budgets of these commissions. It is assumed that
the scale of activity of regulatory commissions is directly related to resources
available to these agencies.

The proxy variables for regulatory activity are

a. Court Activity (TCA). Number of Federal District court cases
commenced plus the number of bankruptcies filed is used. It should be noted
the

judicial activity at the state level has been ignored.
b. Regulatory Commission Activity (BEG). The total real budget of

•

15 federal regulatory agencies was

used

as the measure of regulatory activity

[see Stigler, l972]. It is worth examining the behavior of this measure
over

time relative to the size of the economy to see if it conforms with con-

ventional views of changes in government regulation. Regulatory expenditures
per $10,000 of gross national product for selected years are shown in

Table IV. Relative to the size of the economy, regulatory input declined
during the late twenties, rose during the thirties and reached a peak by 19110.

An erratic pattern followed with a decline in the middle fifties. Regulatory
expenditures have increased relative to the economy since the late fifties so

the

ratio was approaching the high of the late thirties. This

series suggests that the scope of regulation was widest in the late thirties

and late sixties during the 1925-1970 period. It should be noted the rate
of growth of lawyers was declining in the late thirties, while increasing in

the late sixties. Further, the decline in the scope of regulation in the
late twenties was accompanied by a continued growth in new admissions. This

profession reduces the number of lawyers. REA measures long run

equilibrium earnings and is derived from real annual earnings of full time

workers in the private sector. RGNPP measures real per capita gross national
product. Given BEA, a rise in RGNPP is thought to reflect an improvement in
employment opportunities in the private sector and, for this reason, leads to

a reduction in the number of lawyers)1
The most important determinant of the demand for legal services and

for lawyers is real gross national product. Shifts in the demand for lawyers
are due for the most part to changes in real income. On the other hand, the
form in which wealth is held appears to have little differential effect on the
demand for
losses

lawyers. No consistent effect of real property and

paid

liability

by automobile insurance companies or of the measures for the turn-

over of the housing stock were observed. It appears that increases in real
income increases the number of transactions, a fraction of which require
consumers and firms to use the services of lawyers.

The time series results do indicate the divorce rate is a significant
but quantitatively small determinant of the demand for lawyers. So, marital
instability does increase the number of lawyers but this effect is small
compared to a comparable increase in real income.

RGrPP varies more over time than REA and is more sensitive to
cyclical changes. REA is a measure of opportunity cost assuming the worker
is employed full time in the private sector. On the other hand, fluctuation
in RGNPP appear as a proxy for employment conditions in the private sector,
improving when RGNPP rises. While other methods of adjusting for changes in
employment conditions have not been explored, an alternative is to adjust
REA directly for under and unemployment.

.

33
The effect of the size of corporation on the demand for lawyer is
unclear. Columns (2) and (1.) indicate an increase in the size of corporation

increases the number of lawyers. However, this result is sensitive to the
inclusion of real per capita income (columns 1 and 3). Great reliance cannot
be placed on this result.

Different

effects are observed for the regulatory variables. Total

court activity is positively related to the demand for lawyers and
admissions if per capita income is excluded. Column

to new

(l) suggests that the

number of court cases and not the number of bankruptcies is

important. If

court activity is a measure of the increasing scope of government regulation,

then there is some support for the hypothesis that regulation increases the

demand for lawyers. However, this effect is quantitatively small (see
below). The budgets of regulatory commissions have no significant effects on
the number of lawyers and are inversely related to new admissions. Hence,
this measure of regulation does not suggest that the legal profession benefits
from regulation.

In summary the

number of lawyers appears to decline with increases

in the foregone earnings

legal

of becoming a lawyer.

The quantity demanded of

services appears to increase with the level of economic activity,

the divorce rate, the scale of judicial activity and may decrease with
the

scale of regulatory activity.
The quantitative effect of a one percent change in each variable on

the long-run number

of

lawyers is shown in Table VI. These elasticities

The elasticities of the other variables in the demand curve are

decidedly lower with the divorce rate elasticity around .3. It is apparent

that

the major variable increasing the demand for lawyers has been the

increase in real gross national product. A 10 percent increase in long run

'If a profession maximized the total wage bill of its existing
members, the salary per member would be determined so that salary elasticity
equals -1. The results suggest the salary (earnings) elasticity is less
than -1. This evidence does not indicate the pass rate on the bar examination
has been determined so as to maximize total earnings. It should be noted
on the assumption that the actual number
of lawyers equals the equilibrium number. Since the actual number has often
been less than the equilibrium number,

the elasticities are calculated

the actual elasticities will differ

from the elasticities shown in Table VI.

and dividing the r.h.s. of (16a) by one minus the coefficient of

Lti. The estimated coefficients have been used to derive L€ in equation
(17). The estimate of the equilibrium number of lawyers in a given year
assumes (1) the exogenous variables remain constant thereafter,

(2) the

equilibrium rate of return on legal education equals 10 percent, and (3) the
completion rates of law students are exogenous.!" By comparing this time
series of the equilibrium number of lawyers with the actual time series of

lawyers,

on

is possible to determine the time periods when the rate of return

education exceeded 10 percent. Whenever the actual number of lawyers

is less than the equilibrium number, it may be inferred that the actual rate
of return on legal education exceeded 10 percent.

was

from the coefficient estimates (column 2 of Table V); the regression

with the smaller residual standard error. Table VII shows the ratio of equilibrium to

earnings

actual number of lawyers and the ratio of actual to equilibrium

for selected

years.

The ratio of equilibrium to actual number of

lawyer is largest in the mid-twenties and declines thereafter and approaches

one in 19110. After the post war adjustment, the ratio hovers near but somewhat aboveunitythrou.ghout the nineteen fifties and then rises from 1960 to
1970 and was in the 1. 17-1.19 range in 1970, not

reached

far different from the value

in 1929. The time series pattern of the ratio of actual to equilibrium

earnings shows a similar pattern except for one major exception. The ratio

.i/'Completion rates are positively correlated with the rate of return
to the investment on legal education. If the rate of return to legal education
fell to 10 percent, the completion rates would decline, equilibrium earnings
of lawyers would rise, and the equilibrium number of lawyers would decrease.
Hence, the estimates of the equilibrium number of lawyers are biased upward
when the completion rates are considered exogenous.

37

of

earnings is largest in 1929 and declines throughout the thirties. However,

the ratio of earnings far exceeds unity in l94O while the ratio of equilibrium
to actual number of lawyers is near unity in 191lO. In the post war period the
ratio of earnings remains near unity throughout the fifties and then rises

from 1960 to 1970 and equals 1.29 in 1970. The two independent tests, the
ratio of earnings and the ratio of numbers suggest the rate of return to
legal education exceeded 10 percent throughout the twenties, most of the
thirties, and throughout the sixties.!/
Figure IV reveals why an equilibrium was finally achieved in the middle
fifties. The equilibrium number of lawyers grew by only •14 percent per year
from 1925 to 19)40 and by about .6

percent

per year from 1925 to 1956.

Changes in real income, divorce rates and other determinants of the demand
for legal services were on balance offset by increases in the opportunity cost
of legal education, so that the equilibrium number of lawyers demanded at
long run equilibrium earnings did not increase appreciably over a 30 year
period ending in the middle fifties.
Given the low speed of adjustment in the production of lawyers, a

long run equilibrium was not achieved until the late thirties. After the
post war adjustment a long run equilibrium was reestablished throughout the

This comparison of the ratio of earnings to the ratio of numbers
indicates the actual earnings of lawyers reported by the Department of Commerce
during the thirties are probably biased upward. The ratio of equilibrium to
actual number of lawyers suggests the market was close to equilibrium by 19)40.
The depreciation rate of the stock of lawyers was relatively high for the
decade of the thirties compared to the twenties. These two sources of information raise the suspicion that the earnings of lawyers reported in the surveys
conducted by the Department of Commerce during the 1930's are biased upward.
The surveys conducted in the post war period do not indicate the same degree
of bias. No explanation can be offered for the apparent improvement in the
quality of the data.

fifties. Increases in RGNP and other demand determinants throughout the

1960's have increased the demand for legal services. Once again, the low
speed of adjustment of places in law schools created a gap between the actual

and equilibrium number of lawyers. By 1970 the ratio of equilibrium to
actual number of lawyers was between 1.17 to 1.19, not far different from
the ratio in 1929.

V. Other Evidence

Other evidence indicates a widening discrepancy between the actual
and equilibrium number of lawyers throughout the sixties and into the early

seventies. Table VIII shows the number of (LSAT) tests administered to
prospective law school students relative to first year law students and the

mean score on the tests administered. Comparable data are shown for prospective
graduate students in business. In both law and business there has been a rapid
rise in total tests administered. However, the trend to testing occurred
earlier in law than in business so that a smaller proportion of the increase
in testing intensity (columns 3 and ti-)

is

due to the rise in the number

of law schools requiring testing.1 The evidence suggests that there has been
an increasing interest in entering law school and probably an increase in the

quality of law students.1 In contrast the mean score of prospective business

'The number of schools requiring the test is unknown. However, conversations with informed individuals suggests that most law and business schools
were requiring the test by the middle sixties.

'The number of tests administered differs from the number of individuals
taking the test since some individuals repeat the test. The repeat rate appears
to be higher in law than in business. The higher repeat rate in law than
business is consistent with a larger discrepancy between the actual and equilibirum stock in law than in business.

quality variation presumably also exists in other fields, e.g. business.

A detailed study of business education has not yet been undertaken. However
supply response of the business education sector is not likely to be as slow.

A major difference between law and business is the ease of entry into the

education sector. A comparison between law and business is instructive.
While both sectors have experienced a rapid increase in the demand for professional education, they differ in the number of new schools entering the

market. The number of business schools offering graduate programs increased
from 183 in 1960-61, 254 in 1966-67 and 360 in 1972-73. Similar counts
of the number of law schools are 158 in 1960-61, 166 in 1966-67 and 190 in

1972-73. The number of business schools increased by about 97 percent
since 1960 while the number of law schools has increased by 20 percent.
The comparatively modest expansion in the number of law schools may explain
why the ratio of tests administered to first year students has increased
more rapidly in law than in business since the middle sixties (when realistic
comparisons are possible) and why the mean score of prospective law students
has increased relative to mean score of prospective business students.
A further test of the regression results is to explain behavior after

1970. The empirical results suggest that the rate of return to legal education exceeded 10 percent in 1970. The ratio of equilibrium to actual number
of lawyers was between 1.17 and 1.19. The subsequent behavior of first year
enrollments and new admissions is consistent with this evidence. Table X
shows first year students enrolled in law schools and new admissions, the
equilibrium and actual number, and the estimates of the number of lawyers

from 1970 to 1974. The equilibrium number of lawyers is estimated with the
actual or extrapolated values of the exogenous variables from 1971 to 1974.

Table X shows first year students increased somewhat from 1970 to
197)4 and remained at relatively high levels between 1973 and l974. If the
difference between the equilibrium and actual number of lawyers had declined
from 1970 to 19711., the number of first year students should have declined.

The evidence suggests that the gap between the equilibrium and actual number
of lawyers increased from 1970 to 1973 and then declined in 197)4 and helps

explain why the size of the first year class has not declined appreciably.
Nevertheless, the large number of new admissions in 1973 and 197)4 has sub-

stantially increased the number of practicing lawyers and a subsequent decline
in the size of the first year class would not be surprising.

Conclusions

During the last half century the legal profession has experienced

two extended periods of prosperity. The first period covered the twenties
and the early thirties and the second the sixties and the first half of the

seventies. Both periods correspond to periods of rapid growth in real gross
national product, the major determinant of the demand for legal services. The
length of these prosperous episodes appears due to the slow adjustment of

places in law schools. The slow supply adjustment causes the rate of return
to legal education to rise when demand increases and to remain above a normal

rate of return for extended periods of time. The existing stock of lawyers.
has gained from the slow supply response in the legal education industry.
A more rapid supply adjustment would shorten the number of periods when the

rate of return exceeded a normal return. Some tentative explanations for
the slow response have been considered. The slow response may be due in part

to the nonprofit character of the suppliers in the legal education industry.
Higher quality law schools act as if a high marginal tax rate is placed on the

net income of the school. In addition entry in the legal education sector
appears more difficult than in business education sector. These arguments
imply that the supply response would be faster if the legal education industry
was organized with profit maximizing suppliers or under the apprenticeship
system.

The importance of cobweb oscillations in the market for lawyers can

be best assessed after study of an extended time series. During the last
fifty years the market for lawyers has been marked by two extended periods of
adjustment to long run equilibrium and one extended period in or near long run
equilibrium. Cob'web oscillations due at first to "too many" and then "too few"

lawyers do not describe the market for lawyers in the last fifty years. The
slow supply response and the ease with which lawyers may shift into other

occupations mitigate against cobweb type oscillations. While many believe
the number of lawyers is excessive, the historical evidence suggests that there

have been on balance too few lawyers. The current wave of warnings of a future
glut of lawyers should also be evaluated in light of the historical record.
The findings of this study suggest the economic status of the legal
profession is closely tied to the performance of the economy and not to scale

of government regulation. Consequently, additions to the stock of lawyers
should decline in the future unless there is an unexpected increase in the

rate of economic growth. At the present time the earnings of lawyers appear
to be abnormally high. A decline in the relative earnings of lawyers may be
expected to accommodate the decline in the rate of growth of' lawyers.

APPENDIX B

Appendix

B displays lawyer income data from four different sources

and briefly describes the methods used to calculate long run equilibrium
earnings.

I. The Net Income and Earnings of Lawyers

The net income data for lawyers for selected years is shown in Table Bi.
In 197)4 and 1953 the Department of Commerce estimates exceed the Internal Revenue

Service estimates (column (1) compared to column (5)) by about twenty-seven
percent. Median earnings reported in the 19)49 Census of Population are not outof-line with the 1949 Department of Commerce estimate of mean income, given the
skewness of lawyer income distribution.
Column (6) displays the Internal Revenue Service estimate adjusted upward

by twenty-seven percent. The adjusted estimate in 1959 is less than the 1959
Census of Population estimate of mean earnings by 19 percent, a relatively large
amount, but exceeds the 1969 Census of Population estimate by only 4 percent.
While a changing proportional upward adjustment of the I.R.S. figures would have
been preferable to a fixed upward adjustment of 27 percent, the Census of
Population figures do not reveal a systematic upward or downward bias in the

adjusted I.R.S. estimates. Some further support for the upward adjustment
comes from a special tabulation of the 1971 income tax returns. For returns
with a Schedule C, the amount of other sources of income in 1971, e.g., wage

and salary income, was reported. If lawyers operating single proprietorships
also obtain considerable wage and salary income, the income estimates based
solely on the Schedule C reports will seriously underestimate total income from

practice. When wages and salaries, partnership income and loss from

proprietorships in other industries are added to income reported on Schedule C,

the 1971 income per proprietor increases from $l)4,170 to *22,710. The income
per lawyer (including proprietors and partners) rises from *22,030 to $26,570

which is only 5 percent less than the 1971 adjusted value of $27,978. This
test also suggests the 27 percent upward adjustment is not in great error.
The mean annual salaries of lawyers employed by firms in the private
sector reported by the Department of Labor (column (7)) are near the combined
I.R.S. estimate but less than the adjusted I.R.S. estimates and less than the

Census of Population estimates of earnings. The Census of Population figures
generally show the wage and salary income of wage and salary lawyers is less

than

the earnings of all lawyers and this may account for the lower salary

estimates reported by the Department of Labor.

II.

The Calculation of Long Run Equilibrium Earnings

The estimation of long run equilibrium contains the following steps.
The ratio of annual earnings of high school graduates to average annual earnings
of all full time working in private industry was regressed on time for selected
years when annual earnings of high school graduates was available (1939 in the

first such year). The coefficients of this regression equation were used to
convert the average annual earnings of full time workers in private industry
into estimated average annual earnings of high school graduates for the period
l925-194O

and

1951-1970.

The estimated annual earnings of high school graduates in each year

was multiplied by (i + r)ED

where ED represented a three year moving average

of the mean years beyond high school required for completion of law school.
The series for mean years beyond high school to complete law school was
obtained by taking a random sample of law school and calculating a mean value

for each year. The result of this product was then multiplied by

(equation 7) where p equals the proportion passing the bar in t
equals the third year students in t - 1
t -

5.

divided by first year students in

h was arbitrarily set at .05 and r

.10 was considered a normal

rate of return on the investment in education.
