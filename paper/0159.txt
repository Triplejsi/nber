A new algorithri for the group nthiiiidzation problen (GP) is proposed. The

algorit1n can be broadly described as follows. A suitable relaxation of
(GP) is defined, in which any feasible point satisfies the group equation

but may ve negative canponents. The feasible points of the relaxation ar
then generated in der of ascending costs by a variant of a well-3ciown

Actually, this is the essential idea behind a method for solving the
group min:iinization problem, proposed by Glover 17). This author suggests an

elegant and simple algoritlti for ranking the vectors in Z in order of
ascending costs, provided that the cost vector c is positive. Such an
algorithn will be reviewed in the Appendix. Glover also describes a more

sophisticated version of the algoritl-m, in which only the vectors of a

However, the above approach has the inherited inconvenience that

The first non-negative xk discovered is an optimal solution of our problem.
The method just described presents a basic advantage and a basic disadvantage
with respect to the naive version of Glover' s algorithm (NG), discussed in
Section 2. The basic advantage is that (C) generates only vectors in L,

where h is the r-th colnn of H.
The basic disadvantage is that (C) is subjected to the initial handicap
to get started at a point q which may be considerably far fran the feasible set

X. It is clear that, the closer is q to the non-negative orthant, the smaller
is the initial handicap and the nore efficient is (C). In Section 6 we shall
be able to derive an explicit formula for the point q which belongs to L, is

such that (q) T and has least distance frau R. It is also apparent that
(C) is sensitive to the tightness of the upper bound z to the true optimum z.
In Section 8 we shall describe a technique for iroving at low cost the
available upper bound, once the non-negative matrix H has been built.

Dropping the integrality requirements on t and s, one obtains a linear
progranning problem (LP). Let us partition its matrix [A Im] as [B N], where
B and N are formed, respectively, by the basic and by the non-basic colnnns

of [A1m] in an opt3.inal basic solution of the IF. Accordingly, we partition

where a. is the j-th column of N.

Next,

let us define an nxn

matrix F as follows. Each row fh of F corres-

ponds to the non-basic variable Xh. If Xh is a stnictural variable t, we
define f' to be the row unit vector uT; if is a slack variable
we

Q

are unimodular, their product PQ is urdmodular as well. It follows that,

since F is a bas.s for K, also H is a basis, and is therefore the matrix
we were looking for.
The above procedure has been presented mainly for expository purposes,.

and should not be regarded as the most efficient one for converting F into

a non-negative equivalent matrix H: thus it is not really necessary to go
through the intermediate stage of an hermitian matrix.

6. Finding a Starting Point
In this section, we are faced with the problem of finding a starting
point for the conic algorithn. Namely, we want to solve the following:

Problem 1: Find a qcL such that (q)D T and q has least distance from R.

Since H is non-negative, one nust then have y<q, which inplies dist(y,R)>

dist (q,R) II.

As expected, the point

q depends on

the upper bound

: q:f( z), and

the

function f is non-decreasing. This confinris the gonetric intuition

that, the tigher is the upper bound z, the closer is the point q f(z) to
the non-negative ortTharit.

7. Improving the Initial Upper Bound
As we have seen in Section

4,

the effectiveness of the conic algorithn

is enhanced by the knowledge of a good initial upper bound z. Fortunately,
once a non-negative basis H for k is available, it is usually possible to

improve at low

cost

the upper bound by a simple steepest descent procedure.

If x, yEX, define y to be a predecessor of x whenever

x y+h.
where

for sane j,

l<j<n,

h is the j-th column of H. Since the vector c = oH is positive, we

always

have cx>cy. The above-mentioned steepest descent procedure can be

described as follows. Starting fran the known feasible solution p, we look,
among the feasible predecessors of p, for the one, x, with minimal cost cx.
Then we replace p with x and go on, until we find an y without feasible predecessors.
Alternatively, the procedure can be described in the following way.
Re-number the variables x1,. . . ,x in

such a way that

Cautational Conplexity of

the Conic Algoritl-un: A Theoretical Estimate

In this section we shall give a theoretical estimate for the number of

points which need to be generated by the conic algoriti-in ) before finding an
optimal solution for (2.2). The number of such points is approximately equal

to the density of L in

Review of Glover's Rn)dng Algorithm

The method described in Section requires a procedure which, for

a given

positive cost vector c, ranks the vectors of Z in order of ascending costs

0 cx°cx...
In this appendix we shall review an algorithm due to Glover t 7], which
acccanplishes such a task.

The first element x° of the sequence is obvisiy the 0 vector. Each
in the sequence is obtained by increasing sane canponent r of a previous vector

x by one unit:

x+u]

0p<k,

l<rn.

and rrk. During the k-th iteration,
and rk are generated by means of t auxiliary vectors,
and

Of course, p and r depend on k,

The vector tk, which mey be called the transition vector, is built in such
a way that in its rth canponent tkk we are always certain to find the correct
index p

Accordingly, the vector ck, which may be called the next-cost vector,

is built in such a way that c cxk. The vectors tk and c are obtained
from tk and

respectively, by modifying only the rk_th canponent of such

vectors.
