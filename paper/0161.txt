MIDDLE—AGE JOB MOBILITY: ITS DETERMINANTS AND CONSEQUENCES
Ann P. Bartel and George J. Borjas*

It is well known that job mobility is an important characteristic of

the working life histories of individuals. Labor Department data indicate
that on the average a young man at age twenty can expect to have 6.6 job

changes during the next forty years of his working life. While the expected number of job changes declines over the life cycle, it is interesting to note that men aged 45—54 still exoect to change jobs an addi-

tional 1.4 tines prior to retirement.1 Due to lack of microdata, earli
studies of job mobility were unable to analyze individual mobility
patterns; rather, these studies examined the determinants of inter—
industry job separation.2

The recent availability of longitudinal data on earnings and job
histories has allowed researchers to significantly expand the study of

job mobility. For examole, Parnes and Nestel (1975) studied the

determinants arid conseauences of job changing using the National Longitudinal

Survey of Mature Men (NLs). Their most ixnoortant findings were that the

probability of quitting a job was systematically related to job tenure, job
satisfaction, the existence of private pension plans and the individual's

current wage. Using the same data set, Borjas (1975) analyzed the effects
of differential lifetime mobility patterns on the current earnings of mature
men by estimating a "segmented" earnings function——that is, relating the

individual's earnings to his job history. The study suggested the existence of a strong positive relationship between human

capital

investment

and job duration. Finally, Bartel (1975), using the Coleman—Possi Retrospective Life History Study, was able to decompose post-school earnings

growth into gains occurring on the job and gains due to job mobility. It
was shown that while inter—firm mobility had a positive effect on earnings
growth through the wage gain obtained across jobs, the more mobile individuals had significantly lower wage growth per time period within the job.

The use of longitudinal (life—cycle) data, therefore, has provided economists with new insights into an important characteristic of labor markets,
namely job mobility.

Our paper uses the wealth of information available in the NLS to ex-

pand on previous work in several ways. First, we investigate whether there
is a meaningful distinction among types of job separations. Traditional
analysis has categorized job separations as either emnloyee—initiated

(quits) or employer—initiated (layoffs). We question whether this
dichotomy is correct. For example, a person who quits his job for personal (exogenous) reasons, such as health, has a different motivation

—3—

than a quitter in search of a better job. This argument would suggest the
need for a more detailed breakdown of quits. On the other hand, it has
recently been argued that it is irrelevant which party to the "contract"

initiates the separation.3 A job can be viewed as a match (or marriage)

between employer and employee. Since the separation is solely determined
by the existence of an improper match, it is unnecessary to know which
party initiated the separation in order to know the factors determining

the separation. This line of reasoning would, of course, lead to the
conclusion that the quit—layoff breakdown is meaningless and that seara—
tion rates should be the focus of the analysis.

The National Longitudinal Survey data is especially useful for
studying the relationshin between wages and the probability of quitting.
Most theoretical work on the determinants of job separation concludes
that the probability of changing jobs is related to a reservation wage.
The NLS data set allows us to test this relationship since it includes
information on the individual's "hypothetical wage"-—that is, the wage

required to induce the individual to accept another job. Given this in—
formation, we are able to compare the effects of different measures of
the individual's price of time (e.g. the current wage and the reserva-

tion wage) on the probability of quitting. In addition, we analyze the
role of human capital variables, job related characteristics and family

The

analysis of the determinants of job separations in the cross—

section naturally leads to an investigation of the relationship between
previous separations and future separations. In particular, we consider
whether

such a relationship exists, and whether the nature of previous

separations is a good predictor of the nature of future separations.

Finally, we analyze the effects of job mobility on earnings and on

job satisfaction. We distinguish between the immediate gains to mobility
and

the

future gains to mobility, and also consider whether the nature of

the separation is an important determinant of the consequences of job
mobility.

Part II of the paper presents a brief framework for the analysis of

job mobility. It will review various theories that have been presented
in the literature to explain quit—layoff phenomena. In Part III, we
conduct an empirical analysis of the determinants of job separations

and consider whether the distinction between quits and layoffs is indeed

appropriate. Part IV analyzes the effects of job mobility on wage growth

both in the short— and long—runs. A susary of the empirical results is
presented in Part V.

I. A Framework for the Analysis of Job Mobility

Economic theory predicts that an

individual will attempt to sell

his

services in the market which offers him the highest return. This simple
concept was first applied by Sjaastad (1962) to the analysis of labor

mobility in his study of internal migration in the United States.4 The

calculation of the discounted net returns from leaving his current job.

Hence for the th worker, the probability of quitting in his th year of
job tenure, q.., will be positively related to the gains from

(1) the

higher the value of the current job, the less likely the individual is to
quit his job; (2) the better the alternatives available to the individual
relative to the current job, the more likely a quit

will

take place; (3)

We now turn

in

to an analysis of the process by which the differentials

equations (1) and (2) lead to job separations.

A. The Matching Hypothesis
One approach to the study of a job mobility is to view turnover as

the result of an imperfect match between employer and employee.8 According to this hypothesis, the worker and the firm learn about each other

the firm during the worker's tenure. Similarly, w,. can be interpreted
as the discounted stream of all labor costs (e.g. wages, fringe benefits,
etc.) Note that the worker's perception of the value of the job, Y..,

—7—

during

the first few years of the worker's tenure. If they determine that

they have been imperfectly matched with one another (i.e. the worker is

not suitable for the job), a separation will occur. Thus this aptroach
predicts a negative relationship between job tenure and separations.
In the matching model developed by Jovanovic (1976), the employer adjusts

wages to the

worker's

productivity as he learns about the latter over

time. If the worker's productivity (and hence the wage) falls below the

level which is attainable in other firms, the worker will quit. Since
those employees that remain at the firm will be those whose productivity
(and hence wages) are high, there will be a positive correlation between

wage levels and

job

tenure. Thus the matching hypothesis predicts a

negative relationship between wages and

searations,

not holding job

tenure constant. Once tenure is held constant, we would expect this
negative relationship to be weaker, since for a given tenure level there
will be a smaller variation in productivity across individuals within
the firm.

Note that since the wage is assed to be adjusted to equal the
worker's productivity, layoffs will never occur in this model. The
fact that a separation might be officially recorded as a sIlayoffII is

basically a matter of semantics and

in fact be due to the

programs. Therefore an impor-

tant conclusion of the matching hyothesis is that there is no useful

a

layoff. Finally, it is important to

note that because learning about the job is likely to take

—8—
B. The Specific Training Hviothesis
Alternative models of job separation have focused on the concet of
fixed costs of employment.9 It is argued that when a firm hires a worker
it incurs certain fixed costs in the form of hiring and

training

costs.

The immediate implication of the existence of these fixed costs is that
workers with a higher degree of "fixity" are less likely to be laid off
during periods of slack demand since the employer has an incentive to

recoup his investment. This model, of course, can be generalized such
that fixed costs are borne by both workers and employers (e.g. specific
training), and therefore workers with a higher degree of fixity are less
10

likely to quit.

To illustrate the effects of the existence of specific training on
labor turnover, consider:

The Job Search Hvnothesis
Another approach to the analysis of job mobility is suggested by the

existence of imperfect information in the labor market.11 It has been
shown that imperfect information on the part of employers and employees
creates a non—degenerate distribution of wage offers for given skills.12

This wage dispersion is likely to affect the labor turnover decisions of

individuals

and firms.

We can easily derive the implications of the existence of wage dispersion on the probability of quitting by considering equation (1).

wage is not as clear: The worker may be receiving a higher relative
wage in this firm than elsewhere since his productivity in this particu—

lar firm may also be relatively higher. The effect is nil if wages are
adjusted

to productivity, but positive if discrepancies between wages

and productivity are larger at higher wage levels and are not eliminated.

Thus we would exect to find a positive correlation between wages and the

II. The Determinants

of

Job Mobility

In this section we present an empirical analysis of the determinants

of job mobility. The data set used is the National Longitudinal Survey

of

— 12 —

Mature Men (aged 45—59 in 1966) which provides continuous information on
work and earnings histories between 1966 and 1971.15 To simplify the
empirical analysis, we restrict our sample to consist of all white men who
reported a wage rate in 1966, who renorted key variables such as education
and

job

mobility oatterns, and who were still in the labor force in 1971.

We also limit our sample to individuals who experienced no geographic
mobility during the period in order to focus on job mobility within the

local labor market. We avoid the problem of individuals being recalled
from a layoff by defining job mobility as a change in employers. Thus

recalls would not be measured as job searations. Moreover, by deleting
migrants and

retirees

from the sample of job changers, we further under-

estimate the true separation rate. Any additional restrictions on the
sample

will

be discussed as the results are presented.

Table 2 shows the mean probabilities of job separation for our samle.
It can be seen that despite the age range of the samole we observe a high

degree of job separation. In fact, within a five—year period, 22 percent
of the samole changed employers. Note, however, that about half of these

seoarations were eplover—initiated——i.e. layoffs or firings. This leaves
a remarkable amount of quits considering the average age of the

satnole.

When we segment the five—year period into shorter tine soans, 1966—69 and
1969—71, we see clear evidence of the effect of a downturn in the business

cycle on the type of job separations that occur. For example, in the
1966—69 period, 57 percent of all job separations were auits, while in

1969—71, the statistic was 39 percent. Although job separations decline

with educational attainment for this sample, it is interesting to note
that the proportion of job separations that are quits increases with

education. This pattern, however, is not as clear during the economic

downturn of 1969-71. In Table 2, we also find that about 60 percent of
all quits are due to "job—related" reasons. An individual is assumed
to have quit for job—related reasons if his quit is due to:

(1) dis-

satisfaction with wages, hours, working conditions, type of work,
(2) difficulty in getting along with employer and/or fellow employees,

or (3) finding a better job. An individual leaves for personal reaSons if his quit is due to (1) dislike of location or community, or
(2) health or family reasons.

Our analysis will be conducted in two steps. Although in the
previous section we argued that the matching process would only be
relevant in explaining turnover in jobs of short duration, we will
initially focus on mobility from all jobs using the traditional
dichotomy of quits and layoffs, as well as a more refined definition
of quits in terms of job—related and

personal

quits. We will also

between quits and layoffs. Finally, we differentiate between short
and long jobs and discuss in detail the relevance of the

The regressions in Table 3 examine the determinants of the probability of quitting between 1966 and 1969.18 Some regressions on the probability of quitting in the five—year period, 1966—71, are presented below.

1. The Reservation Wage
Our measure of the reservation wage is based on the question:19

Q: Suppose someone in this area offered you a job in the same
line of work you are in now. How much would the new job
have to pay for you to be willing to take it?

Individuals responded to this question by either giving a numerical wage or
by answering that:

(a) they would not accept a job at any

wage;

(b) they

would accept a steady job at the same or less pay; (c) they would accept a

job but did not know at what wage; and (d) any other response. About half
of our

sample

dividuals

responded with an actual reservation wage. For those in-

who gave one of the above reasons, we set the reservation wage

equal to the actual wage but at the same time we standardize with a set
of dummies indicating the actual response. The dummies we use to correspond to the above answers are (a) NOTTAXE, (b) STEADY, (c) ACCEPT, and
(d) OTHER.2°

18Note that the sample sizes in Table 3 are different in each column.
This is because for each regression we defined the relevant sample as
those individuals who did not change jobs plus those who changed for the

particular reason

under analysis. We use this method in order to answer
the question of what determines a particular type of separation versus
staying on the job.

201n effect what we are doing is to use the best available information
(i.e. the actual wage) for those individuals who did not report a reserva-

wage. The dummies capture the fact that the true reservation wage
was unavailable for this group of individuals. See Dagenais (1973) for
a discussion of the econometric problems encountered with missing infor—
tion

mation.

— 20 —

In

regression 3.1 we estimate the equation for all quits;

that

is,

the dependent variable is coded as unity if the individual quit his job

in 1966—69, and zero if he did not change jobs at all. We find that
the effect of the reservation wage is negative and significant.21 Its
magnitude indicates that a one dollar increase in the amount required
to induce the individual to change jobs decreases the probability of
quitting by about 16 percent in this saxttple.22 It is also interesting
to note the effects of the duimnies indicating the individual's response
to

the reservation wage question. For example,

responded

that

those individuals who

they would not accept a job at any wage

(NOTTA) are

83 percent less likely to quit a job than individuals who gave a nuineri—

cal reservation wage. Thus the qualitative response to the reservation
wage question in 1966 was as important as the quantitative response in

indicating which individuals were more likely to quit in the next three
years.

23Note that since the effect of NOTTAXE

is five times the effect of a

one dollar increase in the wage, individuals who responded that they
would not take a new job at any wage were, in effect, indicating they
would require a five dollar wage increase to change jobs. Since the
mean wage is under four dollars, this group of individuals requires
more than a doubling of the wage in order to change jobs.

— 21 —

We

can

extend the empirical analysis by noting that the

NLS

pro-

vides detailed information on the reasons for quitting. We segment the
sample

into two major categories: quitting for job—related reasons and

quitting for personal reasons. One could argue

that

the reservation

wage should have a weaker effect in the case of personal (or exogenous)
quits since when unexpected personal problems arise, the

job,

"value" of the

as measured by the reservation wage, becomes a less critical fac-

tor in the individual's decision to quit. This is, in fact, what the
results in Table 3 indicate. In regression 3.2, we find that a one
dollar increase in the reservation wage significantly lowers the prob-

ability of a job-related quit by 21 percent. On the other hand, in
regression 3.4, we see that a one—dollar increase in the reservation
wage lowers the probability of an "exogenous" quit by only 12 percent.

We can isolate from the men who quit for job—related reasons a
small group of individuals who quit because they found a better job-—
that is, men who were "pulled" from the current job by a better job

offer. It would appear that the reservation wage should have a strong
negative

effect on

the probability of finding a better job, since these

individuals most closely resemble the typical decision maker in search

models. The results

in Table 3

confirm this ext,ectation. From regres-

sion 3.3, we can calculate that a one—dollar increase in the reservation
wage makes the individual 23 percent less likely to find a better job.
In order to make our results comparable with those from other data
sets,

and because the reservation wage is defined for only half our

sample,

we estimated the logit regressions using the actual wage as the

relevant measure

of the price of time. The estimated equations are

— 22 —

shown in Table 4. The results are qualitatively similar to those obtained
using the reservation wage: A one—dollar increase in the wage reduces the
probability of a job—related quit by 26 percent, but reduces the prob—

ability of an exogenous quit by only 6 percent. The similarity between

sets

the two

of coefficients should not be surprising. The basic differ-

ence betzeen w and w

is that the reservation wage incorporates the value

of nonpecuniary aspects of the job. Since our vector of standardizing
variables includes a measure of job satisfaction, we are in a sense holding constant these noripecuniary differences; in fact, we may be "double—

counting" variations in these differences thereby weakening the effect
of w on the quit rate.

2. Job Characteristics
A vector of variables describing the characteristics of the individual's current (1966) job is included in the regressions in Tables 3 and

4. We find that individuals who liked their jobs (as measured by LI)
were 60 percent less likely to quit in the next three years. It is important to note that the probability of being "pulled" from the job is
not affected by the individual's level of job satisfaction; LIXE has an

insignificant effect in equation 3.3. This result is intuitive since an
individual may

his current job very much but if a better job offer

is found he will accept it.

This effect is probably

due

to the fact that

SPELLS is

entering

This effect is even more strongly observed through the use of the

variable TENURE (current job tenure as of 1966) in Table 5. This table

hypothesis. That is, there is a positive correlation between
the volume of specific training and job duration thus inhibiting intraining

dividuals with longer job tenure, ceteris aribus, from quitting. As
explained in Part II, an alternative hvoothesis is that individuals
and employers view the first few years of a job as a trial "match."
If either the employer or employee find the match incompatible then

job separation will occur. According to this hypothesis, once this

The results are striking. The probability of auitting the job within

dramatically to 74 percent in the second three years of job tenure.

The results in Table 5 confirm this hyothesis. Similarly, once job
tenure is held constant, the wage effect is diminished since wage

levels and job tenure are strongly and positively correlated.29 The

argued that the same process which determines the probability of quitting
in 1966—69 also determines job tenure as of 1966, since tenure in the

current job is the result of the process determining mobility in earlier

periods. To the extent that

the

variables determining job mobility in

the 1966—69 period also determined tenure in the current job as of 1966,
it is not surprising that the coefficients on the other variables are

The Determinants of Layoffs

B.

Our analysis of mobility has concentrated on separations initiated

by the individual. In this section we focus on separations initiated by
the firm. The NLS data provide two categories of firm-initiated separa-

tions: layoffs and discharges. Since most of these separations are
layoffs, we

ignore

the distinction between the two

categories.

Table 7

presents the set of layoff regressions both for 1966—69 and 1966—71.

1. The Wage
In studying worker-initiated mobility, we argued that the relevant

wage variable underlying the individual's decision to quit was the

reservation wage, Clearly when we analyze firm-initiated separations the
relevant wage variable should be the actual wage, since the actual wage
is

more positively correlated than the reservation wage with the firm's

labor costs. Note that the actual wage has a positive (but insignificant)
effect on the probability of being laid—off. This finding is consistent
with a specific—training hypothesis only if there is a negative correlation between firm—financed and worker—financed specific training. A

more likely explanation is provided by the hyoothesis discussed in Part II
that workers are comensated for working in jobs that have high layoff

rates

by receiving higher

including

the

wages. We can test this hypothesis further by

a set of industry dummies in the regression in order

inter—industry differences in layoff rates •

Within

to capture

an industry one

would expect a weaker relationship between layoff rates and wages. In

significant effect of pension plans on layoff

rates. This would be con-

sistent with the hynothesis that individuals who have pension plans at

their firms strive for better job performance in order to reduce the
probability of being laid off.
The results in Table 7 show that unemployment in the last calendar
year (as measured by WKs and SPELLS) is positively related to the prob-

ability of layoff. These variables, of course, could be proxies for
some undesirable characteristics of the

worker thus increasing the rob-

ability of involuntary turnover.

30The only positive and significant industry coefficient was construction (the omitted industry was agriculture) which had a coefficient of
.106 and a t-value of 2.26.
It is interesting to note that the industry
variables do not signflcantly affect the wage coefficient in the quit
regression (for example, see Table 10).

— 35

Job tenure is introduced into the layoff equation in Table

8. Regres-

8.1 shcws that job tenure has a strong negative effect on the prob-

ability of layoff: An additional year of job tenure decreases the probability of layoff by 12 percent. Again this could be due to the existence of firm—financed specific training, although as can be seen in Table
8, the relative effect of job tenure becomes zero past the first three

years of employment. This finding would tend to su art the "matching"
hypothesis discussed earlier. It is interesting to note the difference
in the effects of the job tenure dummies betzeen quits and

is

layoffs. There

a much sharper decline in the effects of the tenure dumties in the lay-

off regression. This could be evidence of some degree of job seasonality.
Due

to

the construction of the data set, termination of temporary jobs

could not be distinguished from actual layoffs. Thus it could be that
the strong effect of

short

job tenure on the probability of being laid

off is merely evidence of a large
actually

proportion of "layoffs" that are

seasonal jobs.31

We also found that union

membership had a

weak positive effect on

the probability of being laid off between 1969 and

1971,

not holding

job tenure constant. This could occur because in unionized firms

would have less flexibility in reducing wages. Therefore, the

Separations from Short and

Long

Jobs

Contrary to the matching hyothesis, our ana1ys in Sections A and
B indicate that it is imvortant to distinguish between quits and layoffs
in analyzing the determinants of job seoarations. Moreover, the results
in Section C only partially support the matching view of job mobility.
However, we argued

in

Part II

that the matching hypothesis is most relevant

during the early years of job tenure. Therefore, in order to more accurately test the matching hypothesis, we divide our

into individuals
whose job tenure as of 1966 is less than or equal to three years (short
sample

jobs) and individuals whose tenure is longer than three years (long jobs).

It is interesting to note that the probability of a job separation for
individuals in short jobs is 53 percent, and 56 percent of these separations are quits. For longer jobs the respective statistics are 7 percent

and 59 percent. To test the relevance of the matching model, we estimated
separation, quit, and

layoff

regressions setarate1y for short and long

jobs. The wage coefficients from these regressions are given in Table
10.

Once

we take account of the compensating differential effect on the

probability of a layoff by holding industry constant, we find that the
actual
being

wage has no effect

on the probability of separating, quitting, or

laid off from a short job. In Part II, we showed that, according

to the matching hypothesis, there was no distinction between quits and
layoffs, and that the wage rate would not be related to either when

analyzing separations from jobs of short tenure. The results in Table 10
seen to indicate that the matching process is useful for understanding
the determinants of separations from short jobs.

For longer jobs, wages are negative and significant in determining
the orobabilitv of separating

or quitting, and have a weak, negative ef-

fect on the probability of a layoff. Once we realize that the layoff
coefficient may have a tositive bias if we are not adequately controlling
for compensatory differentials, these findings are consistent with a
specific training hypothesis that assumes a positive correlation between
worker—financed and firm—financed specific training investment.

it is 286 percent higher if a layoff occurred in 1966—69. On the

it is 318

percent if a layoff occurred in the 1966—69 period. We can summarize

these results by noting that the probability of quitting does not depend on the nature of the previous job separation, while the probabil-

ity of

layoff is more strongly related to a previous layoff than to a

previous quit. This result, of course, could be due to the fact that
terminations of seasonal jobs are coded as layoffs in the NLS.

the results in Table 11 show that certain individuals are

that

turnover rates decline with age,

we find that within this group of middle—aged men there exists a

of individuals who are

is

interesting that the nature of the earlier separation does not strongly
determine

the nature of the subsequent separation once we account for

some degree of seasonality in the layoff group.

In summary, the evidence from Tables 10 and 1]. suggest the Irnoor—

tance of the matching process in the first few years of job tenure once
we abstract from

the

effect of coxnensating differentials in jobs that

have high layoff rates. As predicted by the matching hyothesis, we

observe

an insignificant wage coefficient in the regressions explaining

quits and layoffs from short jobs. Moreover, the importance of the
matching process within the

nature of the

job is highlighted by the fact that the

previous separation does not determine the nature of the

separation from the current (short) job.

The Consequences of Job Mobility
The previous sections have focused on an analysis of the determinants

of job mobility. We now

extend

our

study

by concentrating on the effects

of job mobility on the earnings profile. Previous work on the NLS by
Borjas

wage

(1975) and Parnes

and Neste]. (1975) has

found that

quitters had

growth over the survey neriod at least as great as the non—changers.

It is important to note, however, that these studies examined the wage
growth of these different groups contemporaneously with the job change.

Thus their results captured a mix of both the immediate and future gains
in wages from job mobility. We extend their work in several respects.
First, we distinguish between the immediate gains from job mobility and
the future gains from job mobility. We comnare individuals who quit

their jobs in 1966—67 (and did not change jobs thereafter) with individuals who stayed with the same employer throughout the five—year period.
The relevant comparisons are the iximiediate wage gains (i.e. 1966—67) and

future wage growth (1967—71). This enables us to answer the question of

whether the effect of mobility on the earnings rofi1e is a parallel upward shift. The second contribution of our analysis is to distinguish
between job—related

the wage

paring the subsequent wage growth of movers to that of the stayers might
yield a biased estimate of the true effect of job mobility.

A. Thmediate Wage Gains
Colus 12.1 arid 12.2 in Table 12 present the regressions explaining percentage wage growth in the 1966—67 period for individuals who
either did not change jobs at all in 1966-71 or who changed jobs in
1966—67 only. By including a set of durmties indicating the nature of
job mobility we are able to measure the immediate gains from mobility
since

therefore less exact than

the

analysis of 1966—67 wage growth.

34Note that the sample sizes in this section have declined slightly.
This is due to our restricting the sarnnle to men who reported their
wage in periods subseauent to 1966. Also note that our use of percentage wage growth (and not absolute growth) is suggested by the

han capital modal of wage determination. For an exposition of the
model see Mincer (1974).

In

Table

—

12, four dummy variables are used to capture the effect of

job mobility on wage growth: LAYOFF, indicating whether or not the individual was laid off from the 1966 job; PERSONAL, indicating if the
individual quit his 1966 job for exogenous reasons; PULL, if the quit
took place because he found a better job; and PUSH, indicating that the

quit took place because of dissatisfaction with his 1966 job. The excluded group, of course, are those individuals who did not change employers.

Generally, the dimmy variables indicating type of quit are insig-

nificant except for the effect of PULL on 1966—69 wage growth. We find
that individuals who quit the 1966 job because they found a better job
have percentage wage gains

that

are 18 percent higher in 1966—69 (or

6 percent higher per year) than those who

stayed.

In the 1966—67

period, however, the effect of PULL is 12 percent per year. Moreover,
in this shorter period the effect of PUSH is negative and

slightly

significant. Note that these results point out the need for di3tinguish—
ing between different types of quits. That is, in order to correctly
estimate

the effects of job mobility on wage growth, one needs to know

the motivating force behind the individual's decision to quit. This
finding is even more strongly observed when we utilize a more detailed
breakdown

of quits

as in Table 13. One

striking result is the

differ-

ence in the effects of the several categories which composed PUSH in
Table 12:

(a) individuals who quit due to dissatisfaction with wages;

(b) individuals who quit due to dissatisfaction with working conditions;
and

that

both quits due to dissatisfaction with work and quits due to inter-

personal problems in the job have strong negative effects on the immediate
wage gain, while quits due to dissatisfaction with wages have a positive

effect which becomes significant in the 1966—69 period. Thus If an individual disliked a nonpecuniary aspect of his job, he is willing to

trade away some of his wages. As will be seen below, the trade is "fair"

these individuals gain significantly in terms of job satisfaction.
These findings show that to examine the effects of quits on wage growth
since

it

is important to distinguish between the different types of quits;

otherwise,

the net impact of quitting will be a conglomeration of many

diverse effects.

The effect of LAYOFF on the immediate wage growth is interesting.

We find that individuals who were laid off in 1966—67 had a significant

increase in their wage growth as compared to the non—movers. Yet in
1966—69, LAYOFF during that period has no effect on contemporaneous wage

growth. Thus we conclude that men who were involuntarily separated from
the 1966 job do at least as well as those who did not change jobs in the

1966—71 period. This could be due to the fact that our sample

of

lay-

off s is restricted to "successful" searchers——that is, men who were laid

off in 1966—67, but stayed with the new employer for the remaining four
35

years.

We also included a vector of personal and job characteristics in
the regressions

the effects of time remaining in the labor force, REM, and changes in

Recall that in explaining the determinants of separating from a short
job we found that there was no meaningful. distinction between quits

and layoffs. The question arises as to whether in studying the consequences of separating from short jobs one should distinguish between

quits and layoffs. We find, that in comparing individuals who separated
from short jobs with individuals who stayed in short jobs the results
reported in Table 12 still hold, i.e., there is a meaningful distinction

between quits and layoffs. In comparing individuals separating from

is obtained: being laid off from a long job has a significant

effect on inediate wage growth. Quitting from a long job has the same
effects as those reported in Table 12.

B. Future Wage Gains
We have already shown that job mobility creates discontinuous shifts

in the individual's earnings profile. We now consider whether mobility
in the pre—retirement years has any

effect

on the subsequent wage growth

in the new job, i.e., on the slope of the earnings profile. Again, we

The most striking result is the negative and significant effect of
LAYOFF

on future wage growth. That is,

even though the immediate

effect

of a layoff on wage growth is positive, over the long run these individuals exnerjence smaller wage growth than those men who stayed on the job.
Generally, the effects of a quit on future wage growth are insignificant,
except for the coefficient of finding a better job on 1969—71 wage growth

which is negative. However, even for this group, the net gain of a quit
over the five—year period, 1966—71, is positive. The fact that quitting
in general has an insignificant effect on future wage growth suggests

that

the gain to voluntary mobility (at least for those who were "pulled"

from the job) is one of an immediate wage gain rather than a continuing
increase in wages.

on—the—job investment taking place. Thus these individuals undertake mo—
bility not as a means of finding jobs which provide higher levels of job
investment but as a method of obtaining an immediate increase in wages
by shifting to higher, but parallel (to that of stayers), earnings
profiles.38

C. Nonpecuniarv Gains
Up to this point we have analyzed the effects of job mobility on

wage growth. In this section, we explore its effects on job satisfaction. We defined an individual as "liking" his job if he indicated
that he liked his job "very much" or "fairly well." Table 15 shows
the percentage of individuals who liked their jobs in 1966 and 1969 by

type of job separation during this period. The results are extremely

interesting. About 93 percent of the individuals who stayed in the job
in the 1966—69 period liked the job in 1966, while only 83 percent of
those who quit their job in the next three years were satisfied with

their 1966 job. It is remarkable that by 1969, the percentage of individuals who liked their jobs was 94 percent for both groups. In fact,
most of the increase in job satisfaction for those individuals who quit
is due to the increase attained by those individuals who were "pushed"

out of the 1966 job—that is, those individuals who left the 1966 job
because they were dissatisfied with a job—related characteristic such as
wages,

work, and interpersonal relations.

381t is imPortant, however, to note that our analysis was carried out
in percentage terms and since the stayers have higher average wage levels
than the quitters, those who remain in the job achieved larger absolute

wage increases in the survey period.

Summari

This

paper has analyzed the determinants and consequences of middle—

age job mobility. Traditional analysis has distinguished between two tyes
of separations: au.tts and layoffs. It can be argued by viewing the job
as a marriage between employer and worker that this distinction has no
empirical

content and adds

nothing to our understanding of the determi-

nants of job separation. On the other hand, persons quitting their jobs
for

personal reasons may not have the same economic motivation

who

quit

as those

for job—related reasons. This latter argument would suggest an

even more detailed breakdown anng types of auits. By utilizing this
latter breakdown of job separations we obtained

several major empirical

findings:
1.

Theoretical, models of job separation are couched in terms of

reservation wage. We took advantage of the fact that the NLS provides

this information, and as expected we found that the probability of
quitting for job—related reasons was significantly and negatively re-

lated to the

reservation

wage when job tenure was not held constant.

The probability of quitting for personal. reasons, however, was less

a

— 59 —

strongly

related to the reservation wage since this type of quit is due to

exogenous forces. Once job tenure was held constant, the effect of the
wage

on quit rates was diminished in all samples.

2. The availability of a pension plan had a strong negative effect
on job-related quits but did not determine quitting for personal reasons.
Similarly, personal characteristics such as time remaining in the labor
force and

wife's labor force status bad

the

systematic

effects on job-'

related quits and insignificant effects on exogenous quits. These findings

were invariant to the inclusion of job tenure in the regression.

3. The probability of layoff was positively related to the individual's wage rate and this effect became stronger when job tenure

was held constant. The positive wage effect can be explained by compen-

sating differentials individuals in jobs with a high degree of instability will demand higher wages. Indeed, when industry was held constant
in the regression, the positive wage coefficient was diminished.

While the above results support the argument that the quit-layoff
distinction as well
our analysis

as a more detailed breakdown of quits is meaningful,

showed that the matching hypothesis has relevance as well:

4. We found strong evidence of serial correlation in job mobility.
In particular, we observed that most senarations occur during the first

of job tenure. This result is evidence of a matching process
between firm and worker that occurs in the early years of the job as
few years

both parties learn about each other.
5. The nature of previous job separations was not a strong determinant of the nature of future job separations.

This finding conforms

with the predictions of the matching hypothesis that the quit-layoff
breakdown is uninformative.

— 60 —

6.

Since it can be argued that the matching hypothesis is most rele-

vant for short jobs, we separately analyzed the determinants of searations

of short jobs versus long jobs. Cnce we took account of the

compensating

differential effect operating in the layoff equation, we found that the
wage rate had no effect on the probability of separating, quitting, or

being laid off from a short job. The distinction between quits and layoffs, however, remained in the analysis of long jobs.
Finally, we analyzed the consequences of job mobility during the pre—

retirement years. Our analysis focused on the effects of job mobility on
wage growth and job satisfaction:

7. We found significant evidence of the need to distinguish between
types of quits. In particular, we observed that individuals who were
pulled (i.e. found

a

better job) from their jobs had higher immediate wage

gains than stayers, while individuals who were pushed (i.e.

were

dis-

satisfied with the current job) had smaller wage gains than stayers. We
also found

that in

this age range, quitting did not affect the slope of

the earnings profile in the new job.

8. Job mobility affected not only the individual's money wages, but

also his degree of job satisfaction. For example, while individuals who
quit because they were dissatisfied with their current job had negative or
zero

immediate wage gains (relative to the stayers), they experienced

significant gains in job satisfaction. These individuals evidently quit
not for wage gains, but for nonecuniary aspects of the job.

The reader will recall that at the outset of this pacer, we discussed
several hypotheses which are useful in understanding the determinants and

— 61 —

consequences of job mobility. The findings presented in this paper indicate
that once we take account of compensatory differentials in jobs with high
layoff rates, the matching view of job turnover is relevant for explaining

separations from short jobs. In the case of long jobs, however, the
evidence points to the relevance of specific training in explaining job
turnover.
