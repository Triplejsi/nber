for more complex and/or accurately specified relationships. I eschew

approach to focus on a more basic question: if concentration and profitability
are indeed related, what market process produces the relationship? The
traditional answer has been that high concentration facilitates collusion and
hence super marginal-cost pricing, for which some profitability measure is a

proxy. Unfortunately, this answer does not logically follow from the usual
evidence, so its acceptance by economists and practitioners of antitrust policy
is little more than an act of faith.

Any profitability measure implies a corresponding difference between

prlee and average cost. As a matter of simple arithmetic a causal relationship
running from concentration to profitability can operate either through an
effect on price (the usual interpretation) or on average cost, or, of course,

both. Acceptance of the pure collusion interpretation of the evidence has
so far hinged on the largely untested assumption that concentration has

little or no connection with the implied average cost measure. However,
indirect tests of the assumption, most notably by Dernsetz (1973), imply

that it may not be useful, and his finding is one motive to the present
work.

In essence, this paper will try to decompose the concentration-profits
relationship into separate concentration-price arid concentration-cost

relationships. By doing this, I hope to shed light on some of the allocative
and distributive issues that, I suspect, give the subject its intrinsic

interest, but which have not so far been confronted empirically: les high

concentration save or waste resources? 1es it lead to higher prices? Who
gains and loses from a social policy hostile to high concentration? Since the
unique aspect of the paper is its focus on a concentration-cost relationship,

most of the analytical effort is spent here. I review the theory underlying
such a relationship, and develop and implement a model designed to estimate

its importance. Subsequently, I try to estimate how much of the usual profitconcentration relationship is due to cost effects and how much to price effects.
The main conclusion is that, while price effects are not absent, the cost
effects so dominate them as to cast doubt on the efficacy of any general legal
rule hostile to industrial concentration.

The possibility that nrket structure and costs are related has of
course long been recognized. An unconcentrated industry in which a

and more

The process by which the old technolo is rendered economically obsolete will

entail a fall (or at least no increase) in price. The price decline need

be

great enough to eliminate producer rents, either because the associated

to

leave room in the market for a fringe

of' old-

technology firms. Whichever force operates, there is a clear dilemma for

policy: attempts to thwart increased

concentration will merely

resources without benefiting consumers.1
The concentration-profitability literature has so far given little

weight to "natural oligopoly" interpretations of the data. Two reasons for
this neglect are important enough to affect the structure of this study:

1. A "natural oligopoly" interpretation is asymmetric. Some technological progress can be scale-reducing. If this sort of' change diffuses
slowly enough, or cannot be implemented as efficiently by all firms, the
large firms will be the marginal firms and smafl firms will earn rents. Thus
we

bc that rents to size-specific technical change are unimportant empirically.

at half of General Motors' unit cost will have trivial impact on automobile

prices or the measured efficiency of the automobile industry. I shall attempt
to disentangle the possibilities empirically rather than intuitively. The
model I develop permits any kind of change in market structure to reflect
size-related

technological change, and

would. likely involve a reallocation of output among efficient-sized firms.

This argument, which can be found in Demsetz (1973) and McGee (1971),

is

sketched in

Figure 1.

Let P1L

be the long-run

curve of a competitive industry with

demand, D. Let P1RM be the long-run firm supply curve, so, following the
scale-economies literature, firm size is indeterminate in the range OB. We
observe an actual (or average) firm output of OA. The industry is in

equilibrium with a price of 0P1, zero rents and

of, say, 14.(OA/OC). Now, one

Assume for now that the resulting Increase in A's output also increases any
rneasure of industry concentration. Let us then see what is required for
average cost to decline while profitability increases.

Whether or not this holds again depends on supply and demand

favors an increase in rents.

All the preceding results--and ambiguities--would hold if A were

a small firm, except, of course, that concentration could decrease.
generally, where differences in firms' costs underlie changes in their

market shares, one ought to expect any change in market structure to promote

efficiency. However, with constant returns-to-scale, there is a clear bias
toward

increased concentration as the main source of lover costs. So long as

a firm's superior tcchnolo' simply lowers the level of its horizontal
marginal cost curve, the firm

will

expand to maximal efficient size.

Demsetz tests for this bias by comparing rates of return of large and

small firms by industry. He finds no difference in these rates of return in
low-concentration industries, so small firms do not seem to have a cost ad-

vantage there. However, in highly concentrated markets, the large

higher rates of return, so Demsetz concludes that they have lower costs,

firms

have marginal costs like Q1M could be characterized as competitive,

while the cost difference generates both high concentration and producer

rents. However, in another industry the aggregate marginal cost of the

superior firms could pass through U, while a collusive agreement among them
keeps the price at P1. In that case, a smaller firm could survive, and the
same disparity among rates of return would be observed. Indeed, once one
allows for both the traditional connection between concentration arid

collusion and

for

differences among firm costs, still less benign solutions

become consistent with Demsetz'c results. For example, let the long-run supply
from less efficient firms be increasong. Then let the process described by
Demsetz and McGee generate increased concentration which incidentally

decreases the cost of collusion. The large firms may now find it in their

interest to set a price above the previous competitive price (P1), even
though they must yield some market share to do this. The marginal firm in
this case would be both "small" and

earning

a "competitive" rate of return,

arid this result would also be consistent with the Dernsetz data.

(Se,e Demsetz, l97, pp. 178-179.)

My intent here is not to catalog possibilities, but to indicate that

there is insufficient evidence for a conclusion that the effects of
concentration are either wholly beneficial or costly.
If an eclectic integration of the prevailing theory cannot therefore
be ruled out, it becomes a useful framework with which to evaluate the main
costs

and benefits empirically. In the remainder of the paper I try to

2. How much of any resulting change in costs is translated into
price changes?
3.

How important is the relationship between market structure and

collusion, and how much are prices thereby affected?
While answers to these questions would be useful in clarifying an
important academic literature, they also have important policy implications.

The merits of an anti-concetration policy can hinge on whether the collusion
effects of concentration outweii the cost effects.
The discussion so far can be summarized symbolically as follows.
The prevailing view on the effects of market structure on the price of any

The Relationship Between Costs and Market Structure

For simplicity,

classify the firms in any industry into two groups:

Type L firms are or will become the largest in the industry; type M firms are

all the others. The industry's cost per unit of output (C) at any point in
time is then

C = sL +

(8)

(1 - s)M,

where
L, M =

the unit cost of a firm in each group, which is assumed
to be the same for all firms in the group.

s = Type L's share of industry output (e.g., a four-firm
concentration ratio, if the type are defined as the
largest four).

Since we will be interested in percentage changes over time in C (C), note
that

C = [ L L+ (1- s) MM] + [L

(9)

M]dS

The last term on the right-hand side of (9) captures the effect of market
share changes on efficiency. It says that if, for example, the type L are

more efficient (L < M) and their market share increases, the resource cost
of industry output is thereby reduced. Now, express each type's unit cost
change as

ii]. Enpirical Results: Costs and Market Structure
The basic cost relationships just developed are estimated here for a
subset of 11-digit SIC manufacturing industries. The subset consists of those

industries for which a meaningful change in unit cost (essentially industry
expenditures

this is

deflated by an output index) can

be

computed for 19117-67. Since

the longest period practicable, we face the risk that the basic cost

relationships will be obscured by technological change. However, I felt the
greater risk was that

short-period changes in

market structure would hide the

more fundamental relationship we seek to measure, a relationship which after
all purports to rationalize a nontrivial part of the existing variety of

market structure. Even 20 years is not long enough to permit as much change
in this variety as we might like.
Many current 11

digit

industries had to be dropped because

of changes in classification between 1947 and l967, or because reliable
output indexes were unavailable from 1947.13 To limit potential measurement
error, "industries" with low or changing coverage or specialization ratios
were also de1eted. Finally, I deleted two industries--drugs and

ballpoint pens--which experienced profound technological change in this

period. They met all the formal tests for inclusion, but their measured
productivity growth was so atypical as to obscure some of the results and
raise questions about the comparability of their earlier and later outputs.
This left a sample of 165 industries.
Cost data available at the 11-digit level include only labor and raw

material expenditures by Census establishments. This leaves out expenditures
(e.g., advertising) typically incurred by administrative offices rather than

plants, and it excludes capital costs. I discuss later a modest adjustment
for the former deficiency. I assume that capital costs are proportional to an

21
industry's gross book value of plant and equipment, for which data are

available

or can be estijBated.16 The factor of proportionality is derived

from Berndt and Christensen'S (1973), estimate of annual capital cost shares

for all manufacturing. I simply choose the proportionality factor that yields

sample the Berndt-Christeflsefl cost shares for 19147 and 1967. 17

To calculate the cost-share-weighted input price changes on the r.h. s.
of (23), distinguish three inputs: labor, raw materials and capital. The
input cost shares are set at their 1947-67 means, and the input price changes
are calculated from the fou.owinR data:
1. Labor--payroll per employee. (Compensation per man hour is not

consistently available for 19147.)

2. Raw materials. Purchase price indexes are
industry.

However, the major change

here

not

available by

is a decline in the relative price

of agricultural to manufactured materials between 19147 and

1967. Therefore,

using 1963 input-Output (Office of isiness Economics, 1967) data on the
direct and indirect purchases of agricultural products per dollar of purchases

for each SIC industry as weights, I estimate separate raw material price
indexes

for each industry.

18

3. Capital. Since industry-specific
that

data are unavailable, I assume

the change in the rental price of capital is the same for each industry.
Finding empirical counterparts to the crucial market structure

variables on the r.h.s. of (21) poses a major difficulty. The relevant theory
applies to firms classified by terminal re:iative size regardless of initial
size. Unfortunately, corresponding pub1ihed data do not exist. We have only
OnVeI,L, ionl

concentration ratioi, which do not reveal where today's largest firms

came from. Therefore, I must make the strong asuntion that the large firms in
196! are the same as

(or

at least dominated by) those in 19147.

In keeping

22

with the simple size dichotomy embodied in (21) and

to make the

results of

this study comparable with the bulk of the literature, Â£ is then defined
simply as the absolute 1947-67 change in an industry's u-firm concentration

ratio

(and s is the average of the two concentration ratios). The reader

should, however, be aware that the model predicts cost effects for turnover

of large firms

as

well as for net changes in their relative size.19 Finally,

g is defined as the log of 1967 divided by 1947 sales net of the log change
in the manufactured goods WPI. This variable's accuracy as a demand change
proxy depends on an implicit assumption of u.nlt elastic demand for each
industry's product.

I want to test Demsetz and McGee's conjecture that the process describec
by (21) is more important for increases in concentration than

decreases.

The

formal model does not allow for this except through differences in cx.
Therefore, I simply estimate separately the effects of increases and
decreases in concentration, and see whether these effects are indeed dif-

ferent. The basic reessiOn is given in Table 1 for the values of a. which
minimize residual variance (see Note to Table i).
The results lend some support to the basic model and uncover a few

puzzles. For example, the model predicts a coefficient of +1 for the first
two factor price variables, and indeed both are insiiificant]-y different

from 1. However, the results show neither the expected difference between
large and small firm cost changes (the coefficient of G2 should be less than
that of Gi), nor the relationship of the CR1 coefficients

to those of G2 and

01 (the former should equal the difference of the latter two). And the
coefficients of the CR2 terms deviate from their theoretical value of -1.
In spite of' these drawbacks, a market share effect on costs does show through,
and as I demonstrate litter, it Is empirically important.

consistent with all of the nonlinearities emerging from the basic model.21
This consistency, though, hides a qualitative discrepancy between the empirical

results and the basic thrust of the model. npirically the main link between
market structure and costs comes via the term (CR1+) in which market structure
change and growth interact. An increase in concentration in a nongroving market
has trivial cost effects. In the model, this interaction term is supposed to
have effects proportional to differences in firm

cost

growth rates. However,

the coefficient of this term in Table 1 is much larger than any plausible

difference in cost growth rates, so it seems clear that the model incompletely

specifies the interaction of growth

and market

structure with costs. The

size of this interaction is a puzzle that demands further work, but here I shall

(1) The explanatory power of this regression is slightly smaller
(R2 =

complex formulation shown there.

(2) Coefficients of gZ and s are both significantly negative
(t =

-2.2

and -2.3) when concentration is increasing and insignificantly

negative when it is falling. This corroborates the basic result of Table 1
and the general pattern of results in Tables 2 and 3.
(3) The magnitude of the cost changes implied by this regression around

the sample means tends to be larger than in Tables 2 and 3. For example, the
changes corresponding to those in the first row of Table 2 would be 10.7,
15.8 and 6.2; for the first row of Table 3, we get 5.5, 8.0 and 2.8.

effects in those tables

may be conservative, but the patterns here and in the tables are sufficiently

similar to support the amalgamation of these effects into the single CR1
variable.

So far I have been lumping productivity and input price effects on

costs together. To explore any interaction between market structure and
input prices, as well as to check on the reasonableness of the preceding
results, I estimated market structure effects on two productivity measures.

The first is an estimate of F in (23), derived by imposing the Cobb-Dougln.s
restriction that the coefficient of each weighted-factor-price change is unity.

This is essentially an estimate of total factor productivity. The second is
a conventional labor productivity (change in output per worker) estimate,
which is motivated in part by the measurement error in the nonlabor factor

prices. When thesc were regressed on the last six variables in Table 1,

29
the pattern in that table

was repeated:

only increased concentration signi-

ficantly raised productivity. The magnitudes of the productivity improvement
are also familiar. At the sample means, these were:
Total factor productivity: 8.6 percent, if concentration increases;
3.1 percent, if' concentration falls.

Labor productivity: U.4 and 3.5 percent respectively.
Finally,

over which they

I examine the sensitivity of the results to the time period
are estimated. The relevant issue here is how long it takes

before long-run effects dominate. A shorter time period will, for one thing,
make the production function-cost curve relationship in equations (22) and (23)

inappropriate. The more

substantive

risk of specificatn error arises from

the need to distinguish the transitory from the permanent changes in market

structure upon which the theoretical link to cost changes rests. Over short
periods, concentration changes will be dominated by forces, like differences
between the shape of large and small firm short-run marginal costs, which

are ignored by our theory. Moreover, firms which are expanding rapidly to
take

advantage of their lower

long-run costs can incur a short-run adjustment

cost penalty. All this suggests that if we focus on too short a time period,
the market structure-cost relationship will be unreliable and attenuated.2'
Theory, though, gives no guidance on what is "too short" concretely.
Consequently, Table

shows the sample-mean cost changes derived

from replications of the regression in Table 1 on data from various subperiods.
For ease of comparison, the cost changes are shown per percentage point

change in concentration. I also show the t-ratio for the coefficient of
the growth interaction variable (CR1), since this turns out to be as concise
a sununary test of the significance of market structure effects on costs for

any subperiod as it is for the whole period.

Market Structure, Prices and Profitability
The existing literature on profitability and

provides a

convenient starting point for our analysis. Its almost universal conclusion
is that high concentration and high profitability go hand-in-hand. Since the
data used here share a coimnon source with Collins' and Preston's (1968)

their results provide a useful starting point. Their
profitability measure is the "price-cost margin" (M) which is essentially:

reproduced on line 14 of Table ,

in

which M is made dependent on the 4-firm

concentration ratio and the ratio of gross book value of fixed assets to

industry sales. (The latter is meant to adjust for capital costs.) Their
results can be compared with those of similar regressions for each census

year for the sample used in this study (lines 1-6). The pattern is clear:

the coefficient of concentration is almost always siificantly positive and
on the order of .1. (The generally superior results for the capital intensity

variable in my sample, while encouraging, need not concern us here.) The
concentration effect seems weaker in the two earliest samples,

level and change effects is extremely important, since it permits comparison

between the main body of my results (which are necessarily estimated in
changes) and that of the literature typified by Collins and Prestonts study
(which invariably employs levels).
A typical inference drawn from results such as those in Table 5 is

that they signify inefficiency in concentrated markets. The problems wit1
this inference may be seen with the aid of the following simplified linear

representation of equations (5) and (6). Let the analogue to (5) be

The net allocative effect of concentration depends on the relative magnitudes

to the components of C in (26). For example, suppose that low-cost firms fail

their marginal cost exceeds average cost. Then P will not fall by the whole

To overcome this problem, I use a two-stage procedure in which the
predicted values of the unit cost variable from the Table 1 regression are

used

as regressors explaining price changes, thereby "purging" the cost

variable of the measurement error it shares with price changes. The resulting
estimate of the price change structural equation is in Table 6.

Census. The

establishment basis of census reporting means that the Census' cost measure
excludes items like advertising and central headquarters overhead. These
excluded

costs ought to affect price changes when they do not change proportionately

with the included costs. However, Internal. Revenue Service data from tax returns

include total deductions by item for 3-digit industries. The largest item ("cost
of sales and operations") corresponds roughly to the

costs

measured by the Census.

Therefore, it is possible to compute a proxy for the ratio of total costs to costs

measured by the Census from the S data at the 3-digit level.

The log change in

this ratio (0CST) is then entered for each 14-digit industry falling within any

3-digit class.29 Unless OCST is a perfect proxy, it should have a positive coefficient below that of COST.

The results are consistent with prior expectations,

If we

reduction in concentration). The two effects are roughly comparable, because
the weak cost effect is reinforced by the pure price effect in the latter case.

These relults pose an immediate question about the meaning of the

pure price effect. Is it plausible to attribute that effect to collusion?
Recall that an alternative interpretation would rely on rents to differential

efficiency, and these could be consistent with a competitive process. These
alternatives can be distinguished by estimating the effect of DCR

separately

for the rising and falling concentration subsamples. Since costs decline for
both

types of change, the "rent" interpretation implies an offsetting DCR effect

for both types. In particular, this means that the coefficient of a decrease in
concentration

should be negative (or, since the cost effect is weak, at least not

positive), which offsets some of the tendency of the cost reduction to lower prices.
This "rent" interpretation is not, however, borne out empirically.

profitability falls. This process seems inconsistent with a pure "rent"

interpretation, so the
and

asymmetry between the profitability effects of increasing

decreasing concentration renders the "cost of collusion" interpretation more

plausible.

32

Noncollusive

interpretations cannot, however, be entirely ruled out. For

example, when an output expansion by an efficient firm imposes losses on other
firms,

there

is no need for the industry

in the aggregate to earn rents from this

efficiency. And the likelihood of negative aggregate rents is greater if the

efficient,
the

growing firm is small initially

than if it is large, simply because

small firm has fewer inputs on which it can earn the efficiency rents that

migit outweigh everyone else's loss. Unless the small firm gets to be sufficiently

large, concentration will decline. Thus, coexistence of declining rents with
declining concentration can be consistent with competition.33

Even if the results in Table 6 are consistent with some collusion, they

may overstate its importance. The theory which

permits

some rents to efficient

firms implies that concentration-induced cost changes have a smaller effect on

price than

industry-wide

changes in, say, wage rates. The positive coefficient

of DCR may, in part, be correcting for our failure to allow, for such differential

effects by lumping all sources of cost change into the one COST variable. To
test this, I implemented something like (29) by breaking COST into the component

due to the change in concentration and that due to all other forces. The coefficients of these were .75 and .98, respectively, while that of DCR declined

to .16. The implied total effect on price of an average increase in concentration
becomes 1i..5,

instead

of -5.6 percent. While this procedure does not allow a test

of significance, the difference in the cost coefficients is consistent with some
rents for innovating firms even in the absence of collusion.

The direct effect of concentration on price seems to have a shorter gesta-

tion period than the cost effect. This is evident in Table 7, which gives the
coefficient of DCR in subperiod estimates of the regression in Table 6. These
are uniformly positive and close to the full period estimate. This means that
prices adjust completely to a change in concentration within a decade and that

temporary and permanent changes have equally powerful price effects. This pattern
may help explain the survival of the erroneous conventional wisdom about concentra-

tion. Consider a merger which permanently increases concentration and reduces
collusion costs. This permanence may hinge on efficiencies which, however, take

a 1on time for the merged firm to implement. Thus, the immediate and perhaps
most easily detectable effect of the merger may well be an increase in price.

142

Since efficiency effects take hold so gradually, it would be desirable
to observe the full price effect of changes in concentration over periods even

longer than two decades. The only data currently available for this are crude,
but they are suggestive. For a handful of 1-digit industries from 1939 to 1967
output indexes can be pieced together. Since sales data are not uniformly available, deflating value added by output is as close as we can come to a price in.-

dex. In Table 8, the change in this "unit value added" is shown for 214 industries
which experienced a large (10 or more percentage points) change in concentration,
from

1939 to 1967, and whose growth in output or value added over the period was

at least half that of all manufacturing or of their 2-digit groups. On average,
these industries' "price" performance is about 20 percent better than that of

either their 2-digit groups or all manufacturing. While

it

is hardly uniform,

this superior performance characterize virtually all the large deviations. Like

the previous results, the degree of superiority is similar regardless of the direction of change in concentration (but, here it is more reliable for decreases).
Since the

concentration here is about 17 percentage points, the
average price effects here are about double those for the l9k7_67 sample.

bt too much can be made of this result, but it hints at the danger of

consequences

of a change in concentration.

The Role of the Number of Firms in an Industry. The empirical work has so
far focused on concentration, since this allows comparability with a large literatu.re. However another structural characteristic, the number of firms, merits exaznination, for it may affect both costs and prices. Telser (1972) has shown that,

holding concentration constant, the price-cost margin increases with the number

of firms. While this may

disappoint

Cournot's descendants, Telser suggests that

it is consistent with an alternative, competitive dis-equilibrium explanation:

of one type of firm ought to be related

to an

cost advantage. To test this, I added two terms to the regression in

Table 1: the log change in number of firms if concentration decreased (zero
otherwise), and the same variable for industries with decreasing concentration

(zero otherwise). On the preceding argument, these should have negative and

positive coefficients respectively. They did, though the effects were not overly
powerfu.1. (both elastricties were around .1, with t-ratios of about 1.6).

To ascertain the competitive effects of a change in the number firms, I

then added this variable to the regression in Table 6. On Telser's tentative
explanation for his result, more firms would be attracted by rising prices,

holding costs constant. However, the coefficient of the log change in number
of firms is virtually zero (.003, t =

0.2).

Thus my data hint that the main

role played by the number firms is on the cost side of the profitability equation.

Conclusions
Most practitioners have chosen to interpret the profitabilityconcentr:ttion relationship as evidence for collusion. A minority has

i6

emphasized the concentration-efficiency nexus. The evidence here is consistent with an eclectic view, but one in which efficiency effects predominate.

An important implication of this finding is that, for an its bulk, the
concentration-profitability literature is incomplete. Since it has largely
been motivated by a collusion model, most of its growth has been elaboration

of that theme. However, attention to the efficiency effects of concentration
may yield the larger research payoff. For example, one major task is to
separate the symptomatic from the causal elements in the statistical relation-

ship between concentration and efficiency. A firm may stumble onto a costreducing process and then expand its share of the market. The two events
yield distinguishable efficiency gains. The former of these is not caused
by the increase in concentration, but both will be statistically related to

it. More commonly, perhaps, efficiency does not come free, and this creates

an immediate complication. Investment

in

search

for

efficiency will be

induced by low costs of expansion, so in that sense the Increase in concen-

tration and the initial discovery are causally related.4
If the literature is incomplete, so is the rationale it provides for

legal hostility to concentration. The possibility that an anti-concentration
policy can retain most of the efficiency gains associated with concentration
and rield a net improvement in resource allocation cannot be ruled out.

it if the magnitudes of the effects we have measured here are close to
correct, the odds are against that

possibility.

It is not clear that U.S.

antitrust policy restricts concentration very much (Pashigian, 1968; Stigler,

1966). However, if it does this, it is more likely to reduce efficiency, raise
prices, and reduce owner wealth.

I treat the effect of this ambiguity later, but it is essentially forced by

UThe important nonliriearities arise from the dual role of Z as an
indicator and implementor of cost changes. Ignoring the growth Interaction

implied by (20), this feedback leads to C < 0. The growth interaction
complicates this:

also has to be aiind.ful

of

the reciprocal nature of this relation-

ship. A firm--and therefore the industry in which it is classified--can
become more efficient today, while its cost advantage is only subsequently
translated into larger market share.

2ne reason for this is that more general long-run equilibrium cost
changes occur slowly. The subperiod regressions underlying Table 4 tend to

be

the

by insignificant or implausible negative coefficients for

factor-share-weighted input price change terms, which is a symptom of'

incomplete adaptation to these price changes. Like the market share effects,
these input price effects also tend to be more erratic over the two shorter
subperiods.

costs. In computing OCST, therefore, the

denominator includes depreciation, interest and

well as "cost of sales" and operations. The numerator is reported total

where R = C*/C.

However,

we know only the proxy for R, OCST. If
R =

b + d(OcsT)

the estimate of p is
P = ab + ad(OCST) + aC

If

there is no measurement error, b =

0,

d = 1,

and

ad = a.

3it since

is not a perfect proxy, d < 1 and E(ad) < a.
So long as d > 0, we want to take account of any market share
effects on the costs not in C. For example, If the share of central office

OCST

overhead in total costs grows with concentration, part of the previously
calculated cost reduction would be offset. However, regressing OCST on the
market share variable in Table 1 yielded insignificant (and numerically

trivial) effects of both increased and decreased concentration.

Stigler (1961i.) argues that the Herfindahl (H) index is superior to the concentration ratio as a proxy for the cost of collusion. Since the Herfindahi
index is unavailable for our sample, this argument cannot be directly tested.
However, Nelson (1963)

the log of H on the log of concentration and its square, and

found an essentially constant elasticity of about 1.8. This crude empiricism
and Stigler's theory suggest that

raising concentration to a power and sub-

situting the change in this varialbe for DCR in Table 6 will improve the

56

results, if

the

"cost of collusion" interpretation is correct. I attempted

transformation for powers ranging from .25 to 2, end the results are

this

encouraging for Stigler's model. The coefficient of this transformed variable

note from Table 2 that the cost effect is also larger (9.2% v. 8.0%), and the

total effect (2.6 -

Is the same.

am indebted to Yale Brozen for pointing this out. A simple numerical
example may clarify his argument:

Consider

a fiveâ€”firm industrj where firm A

. .,E

initially has 6o percent of the market and B, .

Let "CR" then be 60 percent. Initially P = C =

1,

each have 10 percent.

and there are zero rents.

Now let any one of these firms (a) discover a way to lower C to .8, (b) cut
P to .9 and (c) add 20 points to its market share. The efficient, growing
firm

then

gets rent per unit

of

its output =

.1,

while all other firms suffer

a loss of .1 per unit. If A is the efficient firm, CR will Increase to 80,
and industry rents per unit will be +.o6 =

.80(.i)

+

.20(â€”.1).

If B is the

efficient firm and gains sales proportionately from other firms (including A),
CR will decline to I6_2/3; B Is bigger (30 percent of the market), but still

not as big as A. In this case, unit rents are _.014 =

.30(+.l)

+

.T0(â€”.i).

57

together with decreasing concentration if B

There would be increasing rents
obtains between 50 and 60

percent

of the market and thus replaces A as the

dominant firm. The essential logic
the efficiency can apply it

of the example is that the firm discovering

(and earn rents) to all its output, not just the

output it adds; and A has the larger output base.

This is at least one way
between growth and
both

to interpret

the importance
