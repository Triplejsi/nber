INTRODUCTION
In economic modelling the existence and sense of direction of the

causality are often chosen on a priori grounds. However, on many occasions economists fail to agree on the direction of changes, or whether

feedback is occurring. For instance, the debate between the monetarists,
who view noney as a principal cause of cliannges in nney income, and

the

critics of this view, who say money is a passive adapter to business conditions with little independent influence, has continued for decades.

Whether one or the other side proclaims the truth is largely an empirical

matter. A fundamental study of this problem has been done by Cagan in
1965 who, relying on disaggregated U.S. data from 1875—1960 and nonpara—
metric methods, argues convincingly that the long—run relation between
money supply and the price level is largely unidirectional. His analysis
of the cyclical relations between money and income fails to yield a firm
conclusion, however.

Recently Granger (1969) gave an explicit and testable definition of

causality and feedback. Sims (1972) used a Hilbert space argument to
show that Granger's definition was equivalent to the existence of a parti-

representation of the "driven" process with respect to the "driving"
process and proposed a univariate regression method to test for the direccular

tion

of causality. Since then, a significant amount of interest in the

theory and technique of causality detection has been developed in the

economic literature. However, the particular aspect of inference advocated by each individual author fails to yield a consensus on the parti-

cular problem being investigated. Take the case of money and income

causality. Sims (1972) contended that there existed a unidirectional

2

causality from money to GNP

in

the U.S. On the other hand, DyReys, Star-

leaf and Wang (1976)1, Feige and Pearce (1974), etc., based on different

methods, contended that money and income were, at most, weakly related.
Neither is the pattern uniform f or inter—country comparison. For instance,
Wall (1974) found that money was the driving force for income in the U.K.,
while Williams, Goodhart and Gowland (1976) found the reverse causality
to be the case.

The dispute, as we see it, stems at least in part from concern over
the errors associated with the classical hypothesis testing where we may
(i) wrongly reject the true (null) hypothesis (type I error), or (ii)

wrongly accept the false (alternative) hypothesis (type II error). Take
the simple example of two uncorrelated processes

then the variance of the estimated ktl order cross—correlation ((k))
is:

T is the sample size. For white noise the corresponding result

is:

(2)

Var ((k))

Hence if aS is positive, (1) is inflated relative to (2), whereas if
a5 is negative, (1) is deflated. Equation (1) then shows that very large
cross—correlations, all of them spurious, can be generated between two

uncorrelated

processes as a result of the large autocorrelations within

the two processes (for economic examples, see Granger and Newbold [1974]).

3

An incorrect inference about the nature of time series data would then set
a critical region which would either give too high a significance level and
too low a power or vice versa. The concern of such a "spurious regression1'
phenomenon led Pierce and Haugh (1977) to propose causality detection based
on cross—correlations of whitened series, which may be viewed as an at-

tempt to set the correct significance level. The concern of "spurious
independence," or the power of the test, led people to propose testing
procedures based on a direct multivariate autoregressive—moving average
model fitting, generalized least square method, etc. (Caines and Chan
[1975], DyReyes, Starleaf and Wang [1976], Sims [1972, 1975], Wall [1974],

etc.). In this paper we intend to survey and suggest the theoretical
framework of the important aspects of causality detection with the purpose of conveying to the reader the essential features and the different
forms in which inferences may be drawn from given data.

Section II presents the basic theorem characterizing the causality

events and suggests two feedback detection methods which, like the
one suggested by Pierce and Haugh (1977), are based on correlation analy-

sis. In Section III we survey other well—known causality detection
methods and try to relate and to compare them with the methods suggested

in Section II. Section IV briefly reviews the theoretical controversy
of the relationship between money and income and presents some empirical

evidence based on the methods discussed in this paper. Conclusions are
in Section V.

ing at least Cx., y}, and AtXt be the information set apart from

Let At =

Granger's (1969) definition of causali-

ty and feedback are:2

is causing Y, denoted by X

(1972).

are orthogonal.

Based on this theorem, various testing procedures have been proposed

to detect feedback. In this section, we propose yet two more testing
procedures. The methods are based on the idea of correlation between
two time series rather than regression analysis. In regression theory,
one variable is considered random or "dependent" and others fixed or

"independent." In correlation several variables are considered and

treated synmietrically. Since both X and Y are stochastic, we feel it
is more natural to consider them in terms of a correlation approach rather

than a regression approach. Of course, if we start with a joint normal
distribution, we arrive at the same tests in either case when the two

procedures are independent. The probability theory under the null hypothesis is the same. However, if the alternative is true, the distribution
of the test criterion will be different.

and c.(O), c.(O) and C-(k) are the sample variances and cross—covariances

(T_p)?(k)

In a large sample this statistic is approximately chi—square distri-

buted with M degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis, because the
asymptotic distribution of a finite set of lagged cross—correlations
between two independent linear processes is normal (Hannan [1971, p. 230]).

The proof of (k) having the same asymptotic distribution follows
straightforwardly from that of Haugh (1976) except for the minor

compli-

cation here that although v is a white noise process, u is not. How-

ever, the independence of u and v implies that c(k) is still of

O(T); thus,

there is no change in the basic argument. Neither is there

a reduction in the degrees of freedom for this test because the constraints
placed on the residuals by the fitting process did not play a crucial role
as that in the case of Box and Pierce (1970) or Chitturi (1974).

(1948) showed, by a sampling experiment, that when the two series

uncorrelated, the variances are approximately (T—p)1, even for small samples,

and the bias is small.' On the other hand, if the alternative is true, the
cross—correlation estimates based on moments are not necessarily efficient. The

8

variance/covariance matrix of the cross—correlation functions are now
complicated functions of the true autocorrelation functions and the true

cross—correlation functions (Hannan [1971, Ch. 4]). The efficiency of
the statistics, as test statistics, depends not only on their variance
under the null hypothesis but also on their distribution when the null

hypothesis is not true. Although it does not necessarily follow that a
more powerful test will be obtained by using a statistic which is more
efficient than the one which is less efficient, there is a strong intuitive appeal to use a statistic which is consistent and asymptotically

efficient under both the null and the alternative. It is likely to be
locally more powerful than others (see Kendall andStuart [1961, Ch. 25],
Rao [1962], and the discussion in Section III below).
The reason one suspects Test 1 is not fully efficient is that the

stochastic

processes (vs, Ut) are not serially independent. Using spec-

tral representation, we can trade our sequence of dependent random vari-

ables for a sequence of independent random variables. Thus, an approximate likelihood ratio test can be proposed for the two residual time series.
The null hypothesis in the frequency domain can be stated as:

III. OTHER TESTING TH0DS
In this section, we try to relate the two testing procedures
suggested in the last section to other well—known testing procedures,

which are based on prefiltering and

regression

methods and, to the extent

possible, compare their relative power. All these tests are derived
from various equivalent statements of theorem 1.

Test 3 (Sims test): From theorem 1(u),

Sims(1972)

suggested an F

test for causal detection. That is, first regress Y on past and future
values of X, taking account by generalized least squares or prefiltering

of the serial correlation in the residuals. If there is no feedback from
Y to X, future values of X in the regression should have coefficients
insignificantly different from zero, as a group.

12

Test 4 (Pierce and Haugh (1976), Wall(1974)): First use separate
filters on X and Y to ensure that each is very nearly pre—whitened.
Then use cross—correlation analysis to determine whether the residuals

of the two prewhitened series are cross—correlated. If causality runs

It follows that even in the

true that a direct test would be more powerful than test 1. Actually, none
of the statistics considered so far are asymptotically fully efficient in gen-

eral. However, a direct test presupposes a structure of the model, but other
testing methods do not. Test 3 in the ideal case is a likelihood ratio test,

DNEY AND INCOME CAUSALITY DETECTION

The description of the money—income relationship has been a subject of
much debate in

economic literature. Standing on one side are the quantity

theorists who claim that money or its rate

of change tends to "lead" income.

(Friedman and Schwarz [963, Friedman [1970], Brunner and Meltzer [1964], etc.)
Standing on the other side are the new viewers who provide explicit examples
of the possibilities for non—correspondence between causal ordering and temporal ordering of turning points (Brainard and Tobin [1968], Tobin [1970], etc.)

are claimed to result primarily from the behavior of commercial banks and the
public.
The monetarists, on the other hand, although agreeing with the general
relevance of money and income, are far from reaching a consensus with regard

to the impact of economic activity on money supply. The strong view (e.g.,
L. Anderson [1968])contends that the behavior of the monetary authorities

monetary impulses are considered the major factor

for variations in money income.

Such controversies can only be resolved by empirical studies. In
this section we use the concepts of feedback and causality as they apply

stochastic processes to derive a time series interpretation of the
direction of cause and effect. Hopefully it will shed some light on
to

this empirically difficult problem.

Test 3 uses identically the same method as Sims (1972). The income
(or money) variable was regressed on current, eight past lags and four

future money (or income) variables together with a constant term, trend
and seasonal dummies, to test for income—money (or money—income) feedback.

If the four future coefficients are significant by an F—test, then we say
that feedback is occurring.

Separate autoregressive processes were fitted to prewhiten the

money and income series before constructing test 4. Whether the direction of causality goes one way or another depends upon whether the chi—
square statistic based on the first four positive or negative cross—
correlations between the residuals of money and income is significant or not.

Tests 1 and 2 use a different methodology. To test for causality
direction from money to income, we first regress income on its own part

and the constant term to remove its past effect. Then we regress money
on current and past incomes and the constant term to remove the effect

of income variables on money. Test 1, just like test 4, then computes
the chi—square statistics from the cross—correlations between the residuals of these two series to test for the feedback from money to income.
Test 2, on the other hand, uses the money series, with the effect of income removed, and the income series, with its past effects removed, to

test for causality from money to income is less conclusive. Tests 1 and

3 confirm Sims earlier result that causal relation runs

from

Ml to income,

but not for tests 2 and 4. The reason that these results are different might
be explained by the observ-ation mentioned in the introduction. That is,
if the 'residual money and income data were not serially independent,

tests 1 and 3 might be in favor of the alternative hypothesis, hence

generating spurious correlations. On the other hand, tests 2 and 4 take

explicit account of the serial dependence of the time series data, thus
proper precautions were taken against spurious dependence. However, as

causal coherence, phase diagran, gain and residual spectra of money and

two time series and their strength, which were used to derive our summary

statistics. For instance, figures 1 to 5 gave the sample measures of causal
coherence, phase, gain, and the residual spectra of QP and l2 after the
effects of past M2 were removed. Figures 6 to 10 gave the similar measures
with regard to H2 and GNP after removing the past effects of GNP. A comparison of causal coherence squared (fig. 1 and 6) and the gain from GNP

not.

In section 3 we offered sri explanation of why various causality

detection methods might yield different conclusions. Section 4 applied
these methods to the empirical detection of causal direction between

money and income. We found that the relationship between Ml and GNP
was dubious, but the relationship between M2 and GNP was stable. Both

the suary statistics and the spectra diagrams indicated that there
