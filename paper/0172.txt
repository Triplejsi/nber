In this paper, the bias that results from using nonrandomly selected
samples

to estimate behavioral relationships is shown to arise because of

a missing data problem. In contrast with the standard omitted variable
problem in econometrics, in which certain explanatory variables of a regression
model are missing, the problem of sample selection bias arises because data
are missing on the dependent variable of an analysis.

Regressions estimated

on the data available from the nonrandom sample will not, in general, enable
the analyst to estimate parameters of direct interest to economists. Instead,

such regression coefficients confound
the

meaningful

structural parameters with

parameters of the function determining the probability that an observation

makes

its way into the nonrandom sample.
Sample selection bias may arise for two distinct reasons.

First, there

may be self selection by. the individuals being investigated. One observes
market wages for certain women because their productivity in the market

exceeds their productivity in the homeJ Similarly, one observes wages for
union members who found their nonunion alternative less desirable.

Finally,

the wages of migrants (or manpower trainees) do not, in general, afford an
estimate

of what nonwigrants (nontrainees) would have earned had they

migrated

(participated in training). In each of these cases, wage functions

fit on the available data do not estimate the wage function that characterizes
a randomly selected member of the general population subject to the titreatmentli

of work, unionism, migration, and manpower training programs, respectively.

Note that this does not imply that the more market productive women
are the ones observed working.

2

Moreover, in each case,

if it were possible to obtain the missing wage data

for either the treatment or nontreatment population, it would be possible to utilize
simple regression techniques to estimate the parameters of population
functions.

Simple comparisons between pre and post treatment wages would

yield unbiased estimates of the economic benefits of the treatment.
Sample selection bias may also arise as a direct consequence of
actions

taken by the analyst. In studies of panel data, it

is common to

require that "intact" observations be employed. For example, in analyses
of

the time

The effect of such criteria operates in precisely the same fashion as
self selection: fitted functions confound behavioral functions with sample
selection functions.
It is fair to say that most competent analysts have been aware of

the possibility of both sources of selection bias. It is also fair to
that

the accepted econometric practice has

selection biases.

Recent

work in econometrics has attempted to improve on previous

work by making specific assumptions about the source of selection bias. In

particular, this work assumes that both the missing data and the available
data are drawn from a common probability distribution, typically assumed
to be a normal law. Except for work by Amemiya (1973) and Gronau (1974), the
authors of

ordinary

A simple estimator is

discussed that enables analysts to utilize

regression methods to estimate models free of selection bias.

The techniques discussed here are applied to reestimate and test a
model of female labor supply developed by the autho; (1974). Besides
providing an illustration of the methodology, this application is of interest

in its own right for three reasons: (a) an important variable utilized in
the author's previous analysis, the labor market experience of women, was
incorrectly coded by the primary data source, (b) the simple estimators
discussed here allow for much more extensive testing of the maintained
hypotheses of the previous paper, (c) the method discussed here produces
an initial consistent estimator for the likelihood equations of the previous

paper. This last issue is important because the likelihood function proposed in
the 1974 paper is not globablly concave and hence the issue of selecting
an initial starting value is an important one, since local optima will not
yield consistent estimators.
Four conclusions emerge from the empirical analysis of female

labor

for

supply that is conducted on

the 1967 National Longitudinal Survey

women age 30—44. First, estimated coefficients of labor supply and wage

functions are quite sensitive to alternative treatment of the labor market
experience of the wife. Recent work (Heclcian, 1977) suggests that unmeasured
factors that determine participation also determine past work behavior.

the wife's labor force experience as an endogenous variable in

participation

standard instrumental variable estimation techniques,

paper (Hecloan, 1976).

4

significantly alters the coefficients of estimated labor supply and wage
functions. Second, in a modal that treats the labor market experience of
the

wife as endogenous, there is evidence that selection bias is an

important phenomenon in the estimates of labor supply functions, but there
is little evidence of selection bias in estimates of the hourly wage

function. Third, the empirical analysis casts some doubt on the validity
of the simple model assumed in the 1974 paper. With a minor modification
the basic structure of the model remains intact and concordant with data.

Fourth, conventional measures of labor supply overstate the amount of
measured work, create the statistical illusion of a standard work week and
work year, and considerably understate the true sample variation in labor
supply.

This paper is in three parts. En the first section, selection bias
is presented within the specification error framework. In this section,
general distributional assumptions are maintained. En section two, specific
results are presented for the case of normal regression disturbances. Simple
estimators are proposed and discussed. In the third section, empirical
results

are presented.

I. Sample Selection Bias as a Specification Error
To simplify the exposition, consider a two equation model. Few new
points arise in the multiple equation case, and the two equation case has
considerable pedagogical merit.

Consider a random sample of T observations. The equations for
individual i may be written as

implication of a random sampling scheme. Denote

the joint distribution of IT11, IJ by h(Uii. U2i) which may be a singular

distribution. The regressor matrix is assumed to be of full rank so that
if all data were available, each equation could be estimated by least
squares, and all parameters would be identified.

Suppose that one seeks estimates of equation Cia) but that data are

missing on

for certain observations. The crucial question is "why are

data missing for certain observations?"

No matter what the answer to this question, one can write the population regression function for equation (la) as

is zero, the selected sample regression function is the same as

the population regression function. In this case, least squares may be
applied to the subsample of the available data to estimate the population

regression function. The only cost of having an incomplete sample is a loss
in efficiency.

6

In the general case, the sample selection rule that determines

the available data has more serious consequences. Consider the following

selection rule: data are available on

Several special cases of this model are of interest. First assume
that the only variable in the regressor vector

this case, the probability that an observation is included in the sample is
the same for all observations and is not a function of any explanatory

In the general case with nontrivial regressors included among the

From equation (5), it is evident that a symptom of selection bias
is that variables that do not belong in the true structural equation (e.g.,

elements of

not in X11) may appear to be statistically significant

determinants of

when regressions are fit on selected samples. For

example, in Gronau's analysis of the selection bias that arises In using
the wages of working women to estimate the potential wage of nonworking
women, variables that affect the probability that a woman works, such as
the presence of children, may appear to affect market wages when, in fact,

no causal association exists. Thus regression evidence that women with
children earn lower wages is not necessarily evidence that there is discrimi-.

nation against such women or that women with lower market experience—as

proxied by children—earn lower wages. Evidence that such extraneous
variables ttexplaintt wage rates may be interpreted as evidence In support of

the selection hypothesis. However, even if no such extraneous variables
appear in

the

the

selected sample regressions, estimates of the intercept and

population variance may be biased.

could

helpful to relate the simple model

here to previous work in the literature.

The justly celebrated model of Tobln (1958) may be fit within this

Tobin's model was a major stimulus to later work. Its simplicity
and elegance mask two important ideas that have been confused. Most economists
have interpreted his model as a prototype of a limited dependent variable

model: the range of observed values of the random variable

short of zero. Putting Tobin's model

cannot fall

this way, it is less interesting.

Most economists are willing to Live with this type of truncation of the

range of a variable and simple transformations can eliminate it (e.g., use
of logs).

The important

feature of Tobin's model is that a selection rule

0) generates the sample of observed data. Both Cragg (1971) and

Nelson (1975) note that the selection

rule generating

need not be as closely related to

the

population regression function as Tobin

assumed. Their models may be fit

within

the schema of equations (1) and (3).

each region. If the self selection rule is to choose that region with the
highest income, both the selection rule and the

subsample regression functions

can be simply characterized by an obvious K + 1 variable extension of the

previous analysis. The second example concerns the measurement of union—

nonunion wage differentials. Each person in a hypothetical population can be
viewed as possessing both a union and a nonunion wage function. One self
selection rule, based on the assumption of freedom of entry into unionism,
is to select the unionism status with the
highest wage. Estimators of wage

this section, it is useful to clarify three

concepts that are frequently confused in the literature. The first is the
concept of a truncated variable. The second is the concept of a truncated

sample. The third is the concept of a censored sample.
A sample is said to be censored when it is possible to use sample
evidence to estimate the probability that a hypothetical observation will

be observed. This is the situation assumed

in the model of equations (1)

and (3). A truncated sample differs from a censored sample because the
probability of sample selection cannot be estimated from observed data. A
random variable is said to be truncated when its range is limited.
Clearly,
random variables can be truncated in

either censored or truncated samples.

Also, quite clearly, the operational distinction between a censored and

11

trlmcated sample vanishes if there is a priori information about the
probability of sample selection for a hypothetical

observation. These

categories often overlap. Thus in Tobin's model the sample is censored
but the random variable is truncated.

LI. Simple Estimators for the Case of Normally
Distributed
and
In this section, the model of equations (1), (3) and (4) is derived
for the specific case of joint

normality for U11 and U2. The normality

assumption is used in the models surveyed in Section I and is a natural

starting point for any analysis. A simple estimator for this normal model
is derived and discussed.

The joint distribution of

U1, U2iih(U1i. U21),is a bivariate

normal density fully characterized by the assumptions stated in equation (2).
It is permitted to be singular as in Tobin's

model. Using well known results

In

the

section, the techniques of Section II are applied

to estimate

labor supply and wage functions of married women. In the absence of

fixed costs of entering and exiting the labor market, and

under

the assump-

tion that workers are free to choose their hours of work, two functions
fully characterize the labor supply decision.

The first function is the market wage function for the woman, Y1,

by equation (la). The second function is the reservation wage that
the value that a woman places on her time if she does not work

(W).

the market wage exceeds the reservation wage (Y1i >

This model differs from the sample selection model of equations Cia)

and (lb) in one important respect. Unlike the case in equation (ib) there is
information about

up to a factor of proportionality (l/y) if a woman

works (Y21 > 0).

The decision function that characterizes labor force entry,
which is the sample selection rule for this model, is closely related to the
hours of work equation. The model of Lewis (1974) and Gronau (1974) is

exactly the model of equations Cia) and (lb) and does not utilize the potential

source of information that closely links the participation decision and the
labor supply function.

of equations (lla) and (llb), it is clear that both

wage and hours of work functions may be subject to selection bias. Least
squares estimators of the wage and hours functions fit for working women
confound the parameters of the sample selection function with the parameters

of the behavioral functions of interest.

This is not to say that estimates of wage or labor supply functions
fit on subsainpies of working women are of no interest. A regression model
that deletes the conditional expectation of the error terms approximates a
function with a well defined interpretation. Consider equation (lib). The

same set of variables (X2) appears in the regression function and in the
conditional mean of U2. If one deletes the conditional mean, to a first order
approximation a regression equation estimates the vector

ordinary least squares coefficients estimate the effect of a variable

the variable in sorting people out in the taste distribution, the second

add up the average labor supply at each ability class to

The crucial feature of labor supply function (12) is that the supply
of labor is assumed to be a function of the gap between market wages and

reservation wages. This gap, in turn, is a measure of the probability that
a

woman works.

Thus a

strong assumption of this formulation

is that a

woman more likely to work is also more likely to supply more labor when she works.

the work increasing effect of child care costsJ

B. Main Empirical Results
The data utilized in the empirical analysis are a sample of 1735
women taken from the 1967 National Longitudinal

Women Age 30—44

present

(The

Survey of Work Experience Of

"Parties" data) who are white, married with spouse

with husbands working in the previous year (1966). A woman is

classified as working if she worked for cay in 1966 and satisfied the other

sample selection criteria. Using this definition, 812 of the women work in
1966. The primary data source is described elsewhere in detail (Shea, et al.,

1970). A more complete description of the means

of

the data used here and

the sources of sample attribution is provided in Appendix A.
Given current professional ignorance about the appropriate dimension
of labor supply, a variety of measures could be analyzed. Instead, a careful
erami nation of the available data suggests that only one reliable measure is

available: annual labor supply as defined by dividing annual

earnings

in

1966 by a questionnaire wage asked in early 1967. A superficial
inspection
of the data source suggests that a direct measure of labor supply is available
1Note that equation (13c) is cast in terms of hours of work.
Technically speaking, hours should be treated as a limited dependent variable.
In the empirical analysis presented below, I ignore this complication. Since
hours of work distributions are concentrated far away from zero, and
is
possible to use log hours rather than hours in a more general formulation.

it

23

by taking the product of weeks worked in 1966 and "usual hours worked."
However these data are not usable since "weeks worked" includes vacation

time and sick leave—two important margins of adjustmenè.

Inspection of

the histograms of both weeks worked and annual hours defined as the product
of weeks worked and average weekly hours, suggests too much bunching of

hours in standard reporting intervals. Appendix C presents the histograms
for the measure used as well as the standard measures!

&i important point

to note in these histograms is that the distribution of annual hours of

work, properly measured, shows much less of the bunching away from zero
hours of work that is manifest in conventional measures of labor supply.
It is precisely this artificial bunching that has stimulated recent work
that introduces fixed costs into the analysis of labor supply behavior

(Rosen, 1974). Accordingly, it is not surprising to find the result
reported below, that with a proper measure of labor supply, there is much
less evidence in favor of models with fixed costs of work.

Lone disadvantage of the choice of labor supply measure that is
offered in the text is that some women who work in 1966 did not supply a
questionnaire wage. Only five percent of the sample is lost for this
r eas on.

24

The specification of the economic relationships is conventional
and

requires

little comment. Following Mincer

(1974),

the logarithm of

rates is assumed to depend on schooling and market experience.
Experience is defined as the number of years since leaving school that a
wage

woman has worked six months or longer. Following much

labor supply is postulated to depend on wage rates of the head and

female

wife,

previous research,

the presence of children, family assets and wife's education.
Recent work by the author (Heckman (1977)) presents evidence that

the

labor market experience of the wife cannot be treated as an exogenous

variable in the participation decision. (Evidence on this is offered below.)
This variable records the wife's previous work history and is highly correlated
with unmeasured determinants of current labor force participation. The
empirical analysis discussed below explicitly deals with the endogeneity issue
and considerable evidence is found for endogeneity of experience in labor

supply and participation
wage

equations but little evidence for endogeneity in

functions. Estimates of labor supply functions that purge "experience"

of its endogenous component produce more plausible labor supply estimates.

The structure of the discussion of the empirical results is as follows.
First, estimates of equation (l3b) are discussed. Then estimates of the labor
supply and wage functions are presented. Finally, some tests of the simple
model of equations (lla) and (lib) are performed in a separate section.

Table 1 records the estimates of the (a2) normalized coefficients
of equation (l3b) which generates the probability that a woman works. The
first column presents estimates based on the assumption that experience is
exogenous. The second column presents estimates based on predicted experience.

The instrumental variables used to predict experience are reported below the
table.

As expected from a reading of the literature, the presence of small
children, and a higher husband's wage rate lower the probability that a

randomly selected woman works. Women with greater education are more likely

to work. For both sets of estimates,

greater work experience raises the

probability of participation although both the size of the effect, and its

statistical significance, are diminished when predicted experience is used
in place of the actual variable in the estimation of the probit coefficients.

of

experience is not an important issue in the estimation of the coefficients

of the wage function. In my judgment, the best wage function is the traditional one recorded in column 1, but there is little to choose from between
the estimates presented in column 1 and those presented In column

2.

The story with respect to the estimates of the labor supply functions

is different. There is strong evidence for both sample censoring and
of experience.
endogeneity/ The estimates of the traditional regression specification are
displayed in column 1 of Table 3. These estimates are in agreement with
those in previous studies and require little comment. The regression estimates
recorded in column 2 are unreasonable. There is little evidence of sample
censoring, but the coefficients of the equation are not fit with much precision.
Column 3 differs from column 1 in that experience is treated as an endogenous

variable. The result of the Wu test applied to this equation strongly rejects
the null hypothesis that experience is an exogenous or predetermined variable.

Column 4 displays the estimates of the labor supply function accounting

for sample censoring and endogeneity of experience. The null hypothesis that
experience

is predetermined and

rejected.

Accordingly, the estimates in column 4 are offered as the best in

the null hypothesis of no censoring are both

this table.
A comparison of columns 3 and

4

reveals important differences. Except

for insigificant coefficients, all of the slope coefficients in the labor
supply equation presented in column 4 are larger in absolute value than the
coefficients in column 3. The elasticity of labor supply in the column 3
estimates

is high but not too much outside the range of estimates presented

by Schultz (1975, p. 31). The elasticity of 4.5 derived from the specification
in column 4 seems unduly large and requires some comment.

The important point to note is that traditional estimates of

the

coefficients of labor supply functions of working women confound two effects:
movement along a given labor supply function for working women and movement

across taste distributions. Thus, for example, presence of an additional
child under six has a dramatically negative effect on hours of work for
a working woman (—925 hours reduction in supply).

But working women with an

additional child have a greater average taste for market work since only
the most work prone women remain at work after the imposition of a child.

The two separate effects for each variable can be combined and

evaluated at the sample mean. The result of such combination is displayed

in column 5. By and large there is close agreement between the coefficients
of column 3, which are estimates of the combined effect, and the coefficients

in column 5. In particular, the estimates of the wage elasticities are in
very close agreement.

The conclusion to be drawn from the labor supply analysis is that
traditional

methods of estimating labor supply functions give a downward

biased <in absolute value) estimate of the true effect of economic variables.
The wtimates presented here reveal a strong behavioral response to
wage
change which is not discordant with previous estimates, but which casts a

new light on their interpretation.

is

The estimated labor supply elasticity reported in column 3 (1.99)
quite similar to an estimate of .2.3 reported by Haney Rosen who uses

the

same data set.1 Rosen's estimated elasticity combines the effect of a

the composition of the sample of working women. Thus his estimate is
compared with the estimate in column 3, and is an understatement of the
effect of a wage change on the labor supply of women already working.
A final feature of the estimates presented in column 4 is worth

noting. The coefficient on "A" is large and positive. This suggests that
unemasured factors that raise the probability of

correlation is in accord with that predicted by the simple model of

equations (ha) and (llb).

Tests of the Simple Model of Equations
(lla)—(llb) and a kevised Model

En this section, some informal tests of the simple model of
equations (ila) and (llb) are conducted. Most, but not all, of the

restrictions predicted by the model

accord with the data. An
expanded version of the simple model is offered that allows for the effect
of variation in the availability of informal day care arrangements that is
are in

documented elsewhere (Heckman, 1974) as

well as variation in the fixed costs

of work examined by Cogan (1975) and Hanoch (1975). The structure of this

section is as follows. First, informal tests are discussed. Then, a
revised model is offered.

31-A

4 of Table 3) are displayed in Table 4. Given the sampling error in estimating
these coefficients, the ratios are remarkably close to each other. The
agreement is closer yet if one examines only the ratios of coefficients that

are statistically significant in both equations. These ratios are denoted
by an asterisk.

regression coefficient is a consistent

which is the square root of the residual variance in

the estimated equation. A test of the simple model is to compare the square
root of the estimated residual variance with the regression coefficient.

This comparison is made in Table 5. The agreement between the two estimates
is remarkably close. Moreover, as previously discussed in the first paragraph
of this section, the constant of proportionality estimated in Table 4 is

the inverse of a32íy

Using .6x103 as

an estimate of the average ratio,

another estimate of a22
/y is 1666, again a number close to the regression
coefficient estimate.

Other informal tests of the simple model are possible. If equation
(lib) is the labor supply function, the model of Tobin, discussed in section
one ("Tobit") is an

Estimated

appropriate description of the labor supply function.

Tobit coefficients are displayed in Table 6. "Tobit" underestimates

(in absolute value) the coefficients of the labor supply function)

Except

for the intercept term, each "Tobit" coefficient is about seven—tenths of the
corresponding coefficient of the unrestricted labor supply estimates, repro-

duced in the second column of Table 6. Note, however, that the estimated
standard error of the Tobit regression (1409) is remarkably close to the
previous estimate (1424) obtained from equation (15).
1This understatement of Tobit coefficients suggests that the Shultz
(1975) estimates of female labor supply elasticities, based on Tobit, are
downward biased.

34

At this point it may be helpful to take stock of what has been

learned.

The simple citadel is almost right. The "Tobit" estimates of the slope

coefficients are smaller (in absolute value) than the initial consistent

estimates, but by a constant of proportionality (.7). The only discordance
in this pattern comes in the estimates of the intercept terms. The Tobit
intercept is disproportionately larger than the unrestricted labor supply
intercept than the ratio of slope coefficients would suggest is appropriate.
The model of equations

(lla)—(llc) and

(12) may be modified slightly

to rationalize this pattern. First review the economics of the simple model.
To focus ideas suppose the wage function (corresponding to equation (ila)) is

(l6a)

W=a0+a1E+u

while the reservation wage function (i.e., value of time) is

Suppose that there are work related costs such as day care and
other household expenses. Recent evidence (Heckinan, 1974b) suggests that

some women have access to limited quantities of low cost day care and other

household services from friends and neighbors. An

analytically simple way

to characterize such limited availability of low cost substitutes is to
flew it as an augmentation of the woman's time budget that expands available
time by less than one hour for each hour worked up to some given number of

working hours. A consequence of the limited availability of low cost
substitutes is a discontinuity in the labor supply function at the given
number of hours.

sources that (imperfectly) replace her
to h* hours. Note that this woman has a lower reservation
to informal

wage, B, than the other woman, but that beyond h* hours, it

takes

a greater

wage rate to induce her to work more hours. This is so because of the wealth
effect that arises from her access to low cost sources, and from the assumption

that leisure is a normal good. The population of all women contains a
mixture of women with the two types of labor supply functions.
In a general model it is plausible that both slopes and

intercepts

of labor supply functions are affected by the limited availability of low

cost substitutes for the woman's tine. Before more elaborate models are
explored it is useful

to

examine more fully

the

implications of the simple

model depicted in Figure 2.

Given a-distribution of the two types of labor supply functions in the
population, and

given

that some women with a "broken" labor supply function

have hours of work in excess of h*, the average reservation wage in the
population is less than the average of the intercepts of the labor supply
functions,

household

substitutes, the two

interpersonal variation in the cost of

measures coincide so that the average of the

intercepts is the average of the reservation wages. An important consequence
of the inequality of reservation wages and

intercepts

is that any

empirical

procedure that constrains the intercept of the labor supply equation to be
the reservation wage understates the effect of wages (and other variables) on

labor supply. This insight is important because the model of equations (lla)—
(llb) and the Tobit model both impose this constraint on the data.
To establish this result intuitively, note that using equations (16a)
and

(1Gb), equation (18) can be written as

labor supply curve to A defines a wage that plays the same role as the
reservation wage in a model with no work related costs.

37

h -

(w - w*)

so that the wage that just induces a woman to work a positive number of

hours is the reservation wage w*. In terms of the notation of Figure 2,

A v*. If one constrains the intercept of the labor supply curve to be
the reservation wage, when the "broken line" function BEFG describes some or
all of the data, one underestimates the response of hours to wage rates as

well as the intercept in the labor supply equation. See the dashed line
B'G' in Figure 2. One can prove that "Tobit" and the model of equation
(llb) impose this constraint on the fitted function.
By way of contrast with these results, it is helpful. to consider a

model with fixed costs of work. For simplicity consider money costs of
work. As both Cogan (1975) and Hanoch (1975) have shown, the affect of
fixed costs of work on labor supply is that women who work at all must work

a minimum number of hours, say h, to recoup the fixed costs. The reservation
wage is raised over a case without fixed costs. This model is depicted
in Figure 3. Ecre the standard labor supply function for a woman of given
characteristics is indicated by a solid line while the modified labor supply

in the standard case while "C" denotes the reservation wage in the case of

fixed costs of work. In the presence of fixed costs, the reservation wage
is greater and the level of the supply function is higher reflecting the
assumption that leisure is a normal good, and that fixed costs subtract from

income. Unlike the situation in the preflous case, the average of the
reservation wages exceeds the average of the intercepts. Thus any model
that constrains the intercept of the labor supply function to equal the
average of the reservation wages overstates the effect of wages (and other

variables) on labor supply)
The empirical

results reported in Tables

4 and 6 favor the model of

differential access to low cost substitutes for tine in the home over a model

with fixed costs in a dominant role. "Tobit" underestimates the reponse of
labor supply to a change in economic variables, and the Tobit intercept is
higher than the intercept of the unrestricted labor supply function, an
implication of a model in which the true reservation wage is less than the
intercept of the labor supply equation. Finally, note that the only modif i-.

cation required to make equations (lla)—(llb) consistent with data is

relaxation of the interequation proportionality of intercepts. The corresponding interequation slope coefficients are related by a common factor of

proportionality.

argument is made by both Cogan (1975) and Hanoch (1975). These

would also arise if employers offered "tied" packages of wages and
hours if each individual had his own "best" minimum hours offer in the market.
In this case, the labor supply function for the tied case would coincide over
/with the standard labor supply function, but the average of the intercepts
would understate the. reservation wage.

crucially affects the Outcome

of such tests. In results not reported here, use of the conventional

implications, i.e., one would accept a

model of fixed costs. But as previously noted, the standard measures induce
the illusion of fixed costs via

reporting error that overstates the extent

of labor supply and the fiequency of occurence of standard reporting

intervals so that empirical analyses based on this measure of labor supply
yield misleading conclusions.

Summary and Conclusions

In this paper, the bias that results from using nonrandomly selected
data is discussed within the specification error framework of Griljches and
mail. A computationally tractable technique is discussed that enables
economists

to utilize simple regression techniques to estimate

function free of selection bias.

behavioral

Asymptotic properties of the estimator

are developed.

A modal of female labor supply and wage rates is estimated with this

technique. The empirical results suggest that selection bias is an important

in estimating labor supply functions but is less important in
estimating wage functions. Very high estimates of the elasticity of female
problem

labor

supply are derived but these are shown to be consistent with conventional

estimates that ignore selection bias. The labor force experience of the wife
is shown to be an endogenous variable in labor supply equations but not in
wage functions.

of the model appear to be in accord with the data but an

expanded model that introduces the notion of limited household accessibility
to low cost substitutes for the wife's time appears to fit the data better.
With a proper measure of labor supply, the implications of a model with fixed
costs of work in a dominant role are rejected by the data.
