Abstract

The educational screening hypothesis states that beyond a
certain

point schooling functions as a signalling device to

identify pre—existing talents. We test for the presence of screening by comparing the schooling and earnings of self—employed workers

and of those employed by others in a sample set of occupations.
We expect those employed by others to pursue additional schooling
to signal prospective employers. We expect self—employed managers
to acquire no additional schooling for signalling purposes. We
expect

to

other self—employed workers to obtain additional schooling

signal potential customers. Our empirical results, based on

1970 Census data, strongly support the case for screening.

However, the relative magnitude of the

screening

portion of school-

ing is relatively modest, lying between approximately 5 and 10 percent.

Educational Screening and

*
Occupational Earnings

educational screening hypothesis has received considerable

The

attention in recent years. Simply stated, it is that beyond a certain
point schooling does not improve an individual's productive capacity but

instead functions as a signalling device to identify his pre—existing

talents. 1

A prospective employer who has no direct way of assessing an

applicant's productive capabilities uses his educational attainment level as

an indicator of his expected productivity. Employers therefore pay
more to the more highly educated applicants (or hire them in favor
of less educated applicants), not because (or solely because) educa—

don enhances their productivity but because it identifies the more
productive workers. A necessary corollary of this, as St,ence (1973)
argues, is that for the job market to remain in equilibrium, the
more educated will in fact have to demonstrate their greater pro-

ductivity on the job. The observed positive relation between schooling
and earnings is then due to the identification or screening function
of education, rather than to a productivity—augmenting process.

This paper was originally presented at an NBER seminar in Stanford
in March 1977. We would like to thank those present for their comments
and Robert Lipsey for his helpful suggestions. The work for this paper

was supported by the National Science Foundation, Grant No. S0C74—21391.

l Wolpin (1975) points out, it is not necessary to assume that
is no productivity effect from schooling, only that beyond a
certain level of schooling the effect is signalling and not productivity

Test),

and other socio—demographic variables. These earnings

are then used to predict an individual's expected earnings,

had he been employed in another occupation. Finding that a large
percentage of blue—collar workers earn less than their expected income
in white—collar and other occupations with higher educational require-

ments, they conclude that education acts as a barrier to entry in
these

occupations. The weakness of the Taubman and Wales test is that

they assume that the only characteristics that affect worker pro-

ductivity are the variables they use in their earnings regression.
In fact, these explain only a small part of the variance in earnings.
If there are unobserved traits positively associated with schooling
(perhaps

initiative, for example) and positively correlated with

earnings, then the Taubinan and Wales test only begs the question:

Layard

and Psacharopoulos propose three hypotheses for testing

the presence of screening. First, the rate of return to uncompleted
courses should be lower than that to completed ones. Second, stand-

ardized educational differentials in earnings should not rise with
age, since employers should have better information about older
employees'

abilities. Third, if screening is the main function of

education, there are alternative testing procedures that can be

done more cheaply than schooling. None of these hypotheses was
empirically confirmed. However, none of these propositions is implied
by the screening hypothesis. The first is really a "credentialt' or
"sheepskin" hypothesis that a diploma per se is used as a screening

device, rather than years of education.2 The second hypothesis also
does not follow from the screening hypothesis. All that the screening hypothesis contends is that schooling itself does not increase

worker productivity. In fact, higher educated individuals may be
more productive and must be, as Spence argues, for the job market to

remain in equilibrium. Therefore, there is no necessary reason for
earnings differentials between schooling groups not to increase with

age. The third hypothesis is irrelevant to the argument, since the
existence of cheaper alternative testing devices does not contradict
a screening function of schooling.

Albrecht's test was to compare the

hypothesis. When adjusted for hours worked, college graduates have

given

position of those inside an organization with those outside

the organization. His data were applicants for the position of tax
auditor for an Internal Revenue Service office in San Francisco.

He reasoned that the office would have better information on inside

candidates than outside ones. Therefore, if education were used as
a screening device, schooling should have less bearing on the hiring

decisions of inside applicants than outside ones. This hypothesis
was not confirmed. But here too the inference is not warranted.
Education may be directly (though not causally) related to an individual's

onthe—job productivity and still be used as a screening device.
Albrecht's results thus do not refute the screening hypothesis.
Using data on college graduates working in a large corporation,

Wise (1975) found that earnings were significantly related to the

undergraduate grade point average (CPA). Moreover, when college
quality (selectivity) was controlled for, CPA was still significant.

In fact, earnings increased faster with CPA at the more selective

than less selective colleges. On this basis, Wise concluded that
"college education is not only a signal of productive ability, but

in fact enhances this ability." Again, the conclusion is not warranted
by the results. From Wise's findings, one could alternatively argue

that

a sophisticated employer like a large corporation uses not only

schooling level but college quality and academic achievement to screen
employees,

because innate ability is better identified by these three

factors than by schooling level alone. Moreover, the fact that earnings
rise faster with CPA

at

more selective colleges suggests that the

S

difference

between an A and

a

B at a more selective school represents

a greater spread in ability than at a less selective school (also,
see Lazear (1977)).

Wolpin presents the most direct test of the screening hypothesis
to

date. Using the NBER—Thorndyke sample, he estimated separate

earnings equations for salaried and self—employed workers, where the

explanatory variables are schooling, experience, and ability. His
reasoning is that students planning to go into their own business will
acquire less schooling than those planning to work for an employer,

since the former will stay in school only long enough to satisfy the

needs of their work, whereas the latter will acquire additional schooling

to signal a prospective employer. Wolpin makes four predictions

based

on the screening hypothesis. First, self—employed workers will

have a lower mean schooling than salaried workers. Second, the increment in earnings from schooling will be lower for self—emoloyed than

salaried. Third, earnings differentials between schooling classes
will decline with experience for salaried workers. Fourth, earnings
profiles by schooling class will diverge with experience for self—
employed workers. None of these hypotheses was empirically confirmed.
Wolpin's

orocedure avoids the basic objection to the previous

tests that productivity (and hence earnings) should be positively
related

to schooling, irrespective of whether schooling augments pro-

ductivity or functions as a screening device. However, there are other
problems with his tests. First, mean schooling for self—employed

should be lower than that of salaried workers only if the occupational
mixes are substantially the same. In fact, self—emvloyed workers are

—6—

concentrated in occupations requiring more schooling (see below).
In addition, there is reason to believe that in many occupations
self—employed workers will acquire more schooling than their salaried

counterparts to signal prospective clients (see below). Second,
the return to schooling should, in fact, be greater for self—employed
than

salaried workers. The reason is that self—employed workers

(given perfect foresight) acquire only as much schooling as needed
in their occupation. Given the same ability (or distribution of
ability), self—employed workers should receive the same earnings

as salaried workers with more schooling. (See Riley for a 5lightly
different argument.) Third, as we argued above, there is no reason
why age—earnings profiles by schooling class should converge with

age for salaried workers, even if screening takes place. Fourth,
inversely, there is no reason why the profile should diverge with age
for self—employed workers.

Riley proposes a test of screening though in the paper shows no

empirical results. He argues that in some occupations the direct
observation of an individual's productivity and potential is more

difficult than in other occupations. Therefore, screening would more
likely occur in the former than in the latter occupations. One should
therefore observe a lower rate of return to schooling in the screened

than in the unscreened occupation. Moreover, in the screened occupations, education credentials are by definition the basis of the initial

wage offer. Therefore, an earnings function should be a better
predictor of earnings in earlier than in later years for scrnened jobs,
and the predictive power of the earnings function should decline in

— 7.-

the screened relative to the unscreened sector with experience. The
problem with this approach is that no independent means is provided
of distinguishing between screened and unscreened occupations, except
by whether or not it fulfills the prediction.

I. An Alternative Screening Test
In this paper we shall present a new formulation of a screening

test. We shall then test for the presence of screening using data
from the 1970 Census Public Use Sample. Our results generally confirm
the presence of screening.

Our screening test involves a comparison of the educational
attainment of self—employed workers with those employed by a corporation or someone else (ttsalariedtl workers) on an occupation by occupa-

tion basis. This procedure will overcome the bias built into Wolpin's
test from not controlling for occupational mix. In addition, it will
allow us to distinguish between occupations with and without customer

signalling. The test will also avoid the identification problem
between schooling as productivity enhancer and

schooling

as an indicator

of ability. The test is direct, since if a portion of schooling
serves to signal a prospective employer, then schooling behavior should
differ between those with and without an employer.

Suppose S1

years

of schooling are necessary to acquire the requisite

for a given occupation. Students intending to work in this occu-

pation for someone else may, however, pursue S1 +

S2 (S,>O) years

schooling, where the additional S2 years are needed to signal a

of

pro-

spective employer. Students planning to enter business for themselves

—8—

will acquire oniy S1 years of schooling. Standardized for experience,
ability, sex, race, and other demographic characteristics, less educated,
self—employed workers should receive on average the same earnings as
more educated salaried workers.
The resultant test is not as straightforward as it might appear.
While models of educational screening generally predict that workers
in the screened sector of an occupational labor market will obtain
more

not always the case that

the

will be the unscreened group. Even though

self—employed workers do not need to screen themselves, if they are
in

an occupation which sells labor services directly to the public,

they are effectively being employed by their customers. Since customers can rely on the name and reputation of a firm providing a

service such as that of an electrician or auto mechanic, the self—
employed in these occupations will acquire additional educational

credentials
overcome

(vocational diplomas, trade courses, and the like) to

customer uncertainty about their ability.3

The key to whether self—employed or salaried workers are the
ones screened in a given occupation depends on the relative amount

of

information those who contract for labor services have on workers'

abilities, independent of workers' educational credentials. In
almost evety occupation those who contract for the labor services of

31n New Haven, from casual observation we noticed that the
local Pontiac dealership displayed no vocational training certificates in their service department, whereas our local mechanic did.

S

—9—

the self—employed will do so on a different basis than those who

contract for those of the salaried workers. When an occupation

provides services directly to the customer, the customer as contractor will knoi less about the ability of a self—employed worker

than about a firm that hires salaried workers to provide the same

services to the customer as part of its business. The firm can
rely on internal training programs, job histories, and its personnel
files to ensure threshold occupational ability levels regardless
of educational credentials, while the customer hiring directly
will be forced to make a decision with less information about the
self—employed worker. The customer will demand an educational
premium of the self—employed worker to overcome the lack of a direct
measure of ability, something that the salaried worker will let

his firm's reputation cover. In this case, the extra S2 years
of schooling will be acquired by the self—employed worker.
The only case where one would not expect self—employed to
have more ecuation than salaried workers is in occupations where

ings. The first is that self—employment earnings may be underreported.9

This will bias upward the coefficients on

it will understate the actual level of earnings for a given level of

9Computations done by Ono (1972) showed that wage and salary
earnings reported in the Public Use Sample equalled 100 percent of
National Account totals and non—farm self—employment income in the

(Table 4). However, the National Account estimate of self—employment

invested in a small business in addition to labor earnings. This
will bias downward the coefficients on SE(PERM) and SE(NEW), because

it will overstate the level of self—employed labor earnings for a
given level of schooling (and age). To overcome both problems, we

estimated a second equation, substituting the logarithm of total
personal income (Log(Y)) for Log(E). This may not fully overcome

the first bias, since an underreporting of self—employment earnings

may be reflected in an underreporting of total personal income. Moreover, the use of total income, which should capture the property
income of both salaried and self—employed workers, may not fully
overcome the second bias. The reason is that the self—employed may
have a greater tropensity to invest, since they own their business,
or that they may be wealthier to begin with, which may be a dominant
reason

that they have their own business.

Another

bias

in the test is caused by the uncertainty students

have about whether they will be salaried or self—employed. A reasonable presumption is that any student in doubt about his future employment status will acquire more schooling rather than less to keep both

options open. This will bias the coefficients on SE(PER) and SE(NEW)
upward. However, it is for this reason that we
group

split

our self—employed

into two samples. The first group, SE(PERN), has the most

stable businesses and would presumably have been more certain when
young about their future employment status (for example, managing a
family business). The second, SE(NEW),

are

the ones with relatively

new businesses, including many who recently switched from salaried
positions.

This group would probably have been less certain when

—14—

about their future etnploytnent status. In occupations without

customer screening,
coefficient

we would predict a higher but less significant

on SE(NEW) than on SE(PERM)

The Public Use Sample, unlike the NBER—Thorndyke sample, contains

no information on ability. But this should not bias the test, unless
the dis tribution of ability or its covariance with earnings is different among self—employed than among salaried workers. As far as the

distribution of ability, there is no a priori reason

to suspect a

difference between self—employed and salaried workers. As far as the
covariance of ability and

earnings,

we would expect earnings to be

directly related to ability for self—employed workers throughout their

working career and

for

salaried workers in their later working years.

For salaried workers in their early working years, we would expect

earnings to be pegged to schooling in screened occupations. But, by
the corollary of the screening hypothesis, ability must vary directly
with schooling for the signalling process to remain in equilibrium.
Thus, for young salaried workers we would also expect earnings to be
positively related to ability.

The vocational training variable VOTRAIN will allow us an additional test for employer screening. The screening thesis maintains
that schooling (after a certain point) serves to signal on—the—job

productivity but does not augnnt it. However, vo'atiOnal training,
by its very

definition,

is geared to providing job—specific skills.

101n occupations with customer screening, the uncertain group
would behave like the more certain self—employed group and acquire
the additional schooling needed for setting up their own business.
Therefore, no prediction is offered on the relative magnitudes of the
coefficients of SE(PERN) and SE(NEW) in these occupations.

—15—

Therefore, on prima facie grounds, we should expect a different relation between schooling and earnings for those with and without voca-

tional training. In particular, we would hypothesize two different
sets of relations for white—collar and blue—collar workers.

White—collar (professional and technical, administrative, sales
and

clerical) workers are generally drawn from a pool of high school

graduates and college matriculants (see below). Suppose employers
screen the available pool of high school and college students on the
basis of schooling level, grades, and other indicators of ability
(references, for example) and hire

positions

with the

intention

the most able for white—collar

of training them (programmers, for example).

Those not hired, the less able, may attend a specialized vocational
school

(a computer programming institute, for example) to acquire

specific
pool

job—related schools.

Employers may then hire from a second

of prospective candidates, those who graduate from vocational

institutes, and select on the

basis

of demonstrated capabilities.

Employers will pay a premium to the first group for their greater
(signalled) ability and to the second group for their already acquired

job—specific skills. On net, the two

ings, but

the second group will

groups

may have comparable

earn-

schooling. In

terms of our model, then, we would predict a positive coefficient on
VOCTPAIN.

Blue—collar (skilled and craft, semi—skilled and operative,
unskilled,

and service) workers are generally drawn from a pool of

high school drop—outs and graduates (see below). In their case we

—16—

might expect

self—selection to occur during high school with the less

academically capable pursuing vocational training in high school and
'dropping

Out" and

the

graduating. Enmloyers

more capable pursuing an academic program and
hiring for blue—collar jobs may then hire

two pools. They may hire high school graduates or near graduates

from

on the basis of their greater demonstrated ability with the intention
of training them, and

they

may also hire high school drop—outs with

vocational training on the basis of their acquired skills. Here too
the two groups should have comparable earnings——the first because
their

of

greater (signalled) ability and the second for their job—specific

skills. But the second group will have less schooling. In terms of
our model, then, we would predict a negative coefficient on VOCTRAIN.

III. Results
We extracted full samples of 39 out of the 439 occupations in the
1970 1/100 Census Public Use Sample. The occupations we chose met

the following two criteria: (1) the number of self—employed in the
occupational sample exceeded 50 and (2) the number of salaried in the

sample exceeded 50. Fifty—four occupations fulfilled these two criteria.

Of these we selected 39 to be fairly representative of the broad spectrum of skill levels in the occupational hierarchy."
Table 1 shows the mean schooling level for self—employed and
salaried as well as the percent self—employed and occupation size for

we suspect screening occurs, only that these are the ones we can most
easily test for the occurrence of screenIng.

each of the 39 occupations. The percentage self—emi,loyed varies
considerably across occupations and ranges from 3 to 91 percent,
though half the occupations lie in the 10 to 30 percent interval.
(For the labor force as a whole, about 7 percent are self—employed.)

No systematic relation is apparent between the percentage self—

employed and position on the occupational hierarchy. Schooling
levels generally decline down the occupational ladder. For the
professional and technical group, mean schooling varies between 12
and 18 years of schooling for both the salaried and self—employed
groups; for the managerial and administrative group, the range is

12 to 15 years; and for the sales and clerical group, the range is

also 12 to 15 years. In only 2 of the 19 white—collar occupations
is the mean schooling level less than 12 years. For the skilled
and craft group the range in mean schooling levels is 10 to 12 years;
for the onerative and semi—skilled groui the mean schooling level

rounds to 10 years for each occupation; for laborers the mean schooling
level is 9 years; for farmers it is 11 years; and for service workers

the range is 10 to 11 years. In only 1 out of the 21 blue—collar
occupations

does the mean schooling level exceed 12 years.

The mean schooling levels of salaried and self—employed workers,

unadjusted for differences in earnings and demograhic characteristics,
follow the hypothesized pattern in some groups but not in others. In
the professional and technical group, riean education is higher for
self—employed workers in 4 occupations and lower in 2. In the managerial

and administrative grouD, mean schooling is lower for the self—ennloyed

— 20-.

in 4 occupations and higher in only 1. In the sales and clerical
group schooling is higher for the self—employed in 2 occupations and
lower in 4.

In the craft and skilled group, schooling is higher

in

6 and lower in 3. In the operative group, it is higher in 1 and

lower in 3. In the laborer, farm and service groups it is higher in
3 and lower in 4. The actual schooling levels are fairly close between
salaried and self—employed workers. In fact, in 30 of the 39 occupations, schooling levels are within a half a year of each other for the
two groups.

Occupational size varies considerably among occupations. The
largest occupation in the sample is managers and administrators N. E. C.
(not

elsewhere classified) with over two—and—a—half million members,

and the smallest farm managers with 37,000.

About

16 percent

of the

labor force is represented in this sample and ahout 22 perent of the
self—emDloyed.

About 80 percent of the self—employed in our sample

fall in the category managers and administrators N. E. C.

Conclusion

The screening hypothesis states that certain classes of workers

obtain more schooling than that necessary for the specific or general
skills required in their work in order to signal employers or customers
who may contract their services. Among those working for someone else,

extra

schooling will be acquired to signal a prospective employer.

Among self—employed managers, no additional schooling will be obtained,

since

their services are administrative and not contracted by

anyone

else. Among other self—employed workers, extra schooling will be pursued
to

attract prospective clients. Their schooling 7il1 exceed that of

salaried workers in the same occupation in order to compete successfully

against the firms in which the latter are employed.

skilled and semi—skilled workers, where we might expect minimal employer
screening, between a half and a full year of schooling out of 10 to 12
years constitutes the signalling portion.

Additional corroboration of the screening hviothesis is provided

by the results for the vocational training variable. In the case of
blue—collar workers, we hypothesized that some self—selection occurs

during the high school years. The more (academically) able complete
high school, while the less able acquire vocational training and 'drop

out. In the case of white—collar workers, we hvothesized that the
more able are hired directly by an et1oyer from high school or college,
while the less able continue their schooling in some vocational program.
In both cases, the acquisition of specific job—related skills serves as

a

substitute for the greater ability signalled by formal schooling. An
