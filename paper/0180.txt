theme in these studies as well as in the massive literature on the effects
of home environmental variables on children's

cognitive development is that

well—being at later stages in the life cycle depends on well—being at early
stages.

The basic purpose of our research is to contribute to an understanding of the joint determination of children's cognitive development and

their health. Although there is a large literature concerning the first

of these issues, there has been little work on the latter.2 We
also explore interrelationships between various

aspects of children's physical

health and

to answer the important question

of whether poor health retards the

cognitive development of children.3
More specifically, this Paper, which is part of a larger project,

examines the detenninants of

years of age in Cycle II of the U.S. Health

variables and proxies for the endowed

covering similarities in or differences between health and development

effects. The empirical work is guided by an insight provided by
a
theoreticai model of

transfers of human and non—human

wealth: namely, to understand the behavior of parents with
respect to
their children's health and development, it is important to

3Birch and Gussow (1970), whose entire book focuses
on the effects of
health on learning, point out that most of the evidence they
bring to
bear on the issue is indirect because "...
there has been little investigation of the specific relationships
between the physical status of
poor children and their later developme

The Model

In this section we outline an economic model of children's health
and

intellectual

development. The model serves as a vehicle for organizing and

interpreting empirical research with a data set as complex as the Health

Examination Survey. While our model

draws heavily on analyses of inter—

generatjon transfers by Becker (1967, 1974); Friedman and

Leibowitz

(1975); Ishikawa (1975); Becker and Tomes (1976); and Tomes
(1977), one

of its novel aspects is that it

suggests appropriate ways to estimate the

effects of parents' income and other variables on children's health
and
development.

A. General Analytical Framework
To start the analysis,

assume that parents trake decisions over two

periods (0, 1) or stages in their life cycle. In period 0
their children
are completely dependent upon them for financial support, while
in period
1 the children become financially independent. 1 The
tiarents' utility functicn

can be specified as

U

where C0 and
total number

=

U(C0, C1, N, Q),

(1)

C1 represent their consumption in each period, N is their

of children, and Q is

quality per child.

This utility

En

quality

a general model, child quality would depend on the child's expected
wealth, health, intellectual development, and perhaps other fac-

so that these variables would enter the utility function as separate

argunents.

To simplify the analysis and to obtain testable propositions,

we assume, however, that child

quality is determined solely by the child's

lifetime wealth or, equivalently, by the present value of earned and non—

earned income in the period of independence:

Q=B+tq(H, D)

a result of the first—order

more plausible assumption is that financial transfers are made during
the period of independence rather than at its beginning.
This, however,
does not affect the analysis if the tax treatment of the transfers
are unchanged and if individuals face "good" capital markets. See, for example,
Blinder (1973).

where H0 is the initial or inherited stock of health (genetic endowment
of
health) ,

I

is net investment in health,

is the initial or inherited

stock of development, and C is net investment in development.5 To
com-

plete the rudiments of the

model, we specify production functions of in-

vestments in health and development as

In equations (5)

and

(6), M is a vebtor of endogenous inputs in the health

production function, X is a vector of endogenous inputs in the development

production function, and F arid F' are vectors of exogenous variables that
affect the efficiency of the production process. Examples of elements in
the N vector include medical care, nutrition, housing quality, and parents'
time; while examples of elements in the X vector include school quality,

home learning aids, and parents' time. Examples of elements in F and F'

children in a given family

have

assumptions insure that the optimal amounts of B, H, and D as well as Q

will

be the same

for

all children in the family.7

Note that the initial stocks of health and

development

(H0, D0) are

in the production functions of both I and G. While no assimiption

is made at this time with respect to the directional effects of these
initial stocks on I and C, this flexible specification allows for a number

of possibilities, For example, the effect of medical care inputs on
changes in health may be greater when an individual's stock of health is
at a lower level (i.e. 3I/H0 c 0). Or, children with greater inherited

intellectual ability may augment that ability more easily (i.e.

6The vectors F and F' might or might not be identical.

vary,
B, D, and H would tend to differ aitng children but Q would not (see
Becker and Tomes 1976). In future work we may pursue theoretical and
empirical analyses in which endowments vary among children in the same
family.

Further, this specification allows for an interplay between

health and development1 and in particular, it allows for the possibility
that low initial health levels will affect

realized intellectual ability.9

8This assumption is made by Becker and Tomes (1976). on the other
hand,
Ploom's (1964) findings suggest that the initial level of measures such as
height, IQ, and school achievement does not affect the rate at which
a child
augments these measures.
9Most

of the literature on

the interaction between child health and development emphasizes the impact of low levels of investments in health at
the preschool stage of the child's life
cycle on subsequent cognitive development (for example, Birch and Gussow l970 Broman, Nichols, and
Kennedy 1975). to examine the impact of both current and initial health
on development or to allow for full simultaneity between health and development, it would be necessary to introduce more than one period of

• dependency.

10From now on we treat M and X as scalars rather than vectors.

hence Q, by one dollar, C0 must fall by (1 +

product of B is constant at one dollar. The cozmrion value of the two

equalities in (8) may be interpreted as the marginal cost of quality,
which is completely determined by the interest rate once the optimal

in human capital of children are determined solely by differences

marginal costs of producing this capital. Differ-

ences among families in their demand for children's quality have no bearing on differences in children's realized human capital.

So far we have assumed that the financial transfer can be positive,

zero, or negative. In analyses of intergenerational transfers that are
similar to ours, Becker (1967); Friedman and Leibowitz (1975); Ishikawa
(1975); Becker and Tomes (1976); and Tomes (1977) point out that it is

reasonable to impose a solvency constraint, a constraint that parents
cannot leave debts to their children, or that B > 0.

fficiency in the production of both

tynes

of children's human capi-

tal is measured by the parents' educational attainment (FIEDUCAT and
FEDUCAT) •16 Since mothers traditionally spend more time with children

than

do fathers, MEDUCAT should have a greater effect in the reduced form

ecruations than FEDUCAT (as measures solely of inherited IQ, they would be
expected to have equal effects).

Information about the prices of the inputs in the health and development production functions is difficult to obtain for the Cycle II data set.
There are no direct measures of relevant prices such as the price of medi-

cal care or the price of parents' time (or their wage rates). Moreover,
since the precise locality of each observation cannot be identified, it

is not possible to estimate these prices with local market data. Therefore, we use a set of crude proxy variables to control partially for these
prices.

To control for price variation due to region and size of place of
residence, we enter a set of three region dunmiy variables (denoted NEAST,

MWEST, SOUTH) and four sizes of place variables (denoted UflBl, URB2, URB3,
NURE).

Information about whether or not the child's vision has been cor-

rected (SEEG, NSEEG) provides some indication of the price of medical care.

II. Data and Estimation
Actual estimation of the relationships represented by equations (9)

through

(12) is conditioned by

the

nature of the data. In this section we

describe our data set, specify which empirical measures will be used to
represent the theoretical variables in (9) through (12) , and outline the
statistical

techniques to be used for estimation.

A. The Data

Our data set is Cycle II of

the U.S. Health Examination Survey (BEE)

by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) . Cycle II
is a nationally representative sample of 7,119 children aged six to eleven
conducted

years examined over the 1963—65 period.1 This sample is an exceptionally

rich source of information about children's health, their intellectual development, and the characteristics of their families. More specifically,
the data comprise complete medical and developmental histories of each child
provided by the parent, information on family socioeconomic characteristics,

birth certificate information, and a school report with data on school
performance and classroom behavior provided by teachers or other school

off icials. Most imrcrtant, there are objective measures of health

from

detailed physical examinations and scores on psychological (including
vocabulary and achievement) tests. The physical examinations and the

osychological tests were administered by the Public Health Service.

A1thouh the sample contains children of all races, for three reasons
we restrict our analysis to white children only. First, this procedure

avoids the problem associated with alleged "cultural biases" in IQ and
achievement tests. Second, in preliminary estimates of equations (9)

through (12), it was found that the hypothesis of equality between sets
of coefficients for whites and blackswas rejected. Therefore, these

subject of a large literature. Our actual choices of measures will be
determined primarily by the data available in Cycle II and will be
guided by the existing literature.

1. Measures of Health
The issue of how to measure children's health is very much an unresolved

one, even among professionals in the area of public health.4 Most recent
studies of children's health have used data taken from one or more

•of the following categories: measures of disability, measures related to
the incidence of abnormal conditions, and measures derived from parental
assessments of children's health (for example, Wallace 1962; Mechanic 1964;
Mindlin and Lobach 1971; Talbot, Kagan, and Eisenberg 1971; Kaplan, Lave, and
Leinhardt 1972; Hu 1973; Schack and Starfield 1973; Kessner 1974; Haggerty,
Roghmann and Pless 1975; Inman 1976) ,

Although we plan to follow the precedent

of these earlier studies, some of the above measures (disability and the

incidence of certain physical conditions) are not entirely appropriate
to our model because our health variable refers to the child's "permanent"

of health rather than short—run deviations from that "permanent"
state.5 Much childhood disability results from the natural sequence of childstate

hood diseases
"permanent"

and acute conditions which do not reflect on the child's

state of health.6

preservation and normal functioning.

that

60f course, there is a positive correlation between the two in the sense

a child with poor "permanent" health is more likely to contract acute
conditions and to have them for a more extended time period. For example,
Birch and Gussow (1970) discuss how nutrition (clearly a determinant of
permanent health status) and disease are intimately related.

II —

The ideal measure of "permanent' health from an empirical persnec-

tive is a single measure that appropriately sinmarizes all available
and relevant

information. Health, however, is clearly a multidimensional

concept. A single index is not feasible and would not be desirable from a
medical point of view. In particular, even if it were clear what the
components of such an index should be, there would be no agreement about the

weights assigned to each component. In the case of children's health, the
derivation of such weights would be especially complicated because some of

the components would be development—related: a given observation might
indicate

at

low health capital at one stage of development but not

another stage of development. Finally, although a single health status

index would be conceptually neat, it is possible that the various components
of health will be differentially affected by the socioeconomic factors.

Analysis of a set of components rather than a single index will allow us to
detect such differential effects.

The set of measures we use are height, the peridontal index, the number

of decayed teeth, and the parents' assessment of the child's health.7 These
are described below.

7We selected health measures from the HES based on the advice of John
NcNamara, M.D., Assistant Professor of Public Health and Pediatrics at
Columbia University School of Public Health and Associate Coitmtissioner in
the New York City Department of Health; Roy Brown, M.D., Associate Professor
of Community Medicine and Pediatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine
of the City University of New York; arid Thomas Travers, D.D.S., Director
of lunbulatory Care in the New York City Department of Health.

1. I}mIGHT, children's height standardized by the mean and standard
deviation of height for each age-sex grout.8 Height is a standard
indicator of children's nutritional status, and good nutrition is
an obvious and natural vehicle for maintaining children's health
(for examole NCHS l975b).
2.

IPERI, the child's peridonta]. index, which is a good

overall

index

of oral health as well as a positive correlate of nutrition

(Russell 1956). Due to the significant age trend in this variable (NCHS l972b) ,

it

is standardized by age in the sane manner

as IHEIGHT. Higher values of IPERI indicate poorer oral health.
3.

IDECAY, the number of decayed nrimarv and permanent teeth, ad-

justed for age and sex as is IHEIGHT. IDECAY is a supplemental
measure of oral health and also reflects nutritional status.
Higher values of IDECAY indicate poorer oral health.
4.

PFHEALTH, a dichotomous variable that indicates the parents'
assessment

of the child's current state of health. PFHEALTH

equals one when parents assess the child's health as poor or
fair and equals zero if they assess it as good or very good.

2. Measures of Intellectual Development
Three measures of intellectual development are used to represent intellectual development capital (D):

an IQ measure derived from two subtests from

It is well—known (for example, Bloom 1964) that physical growth rates
differ by age and sex. For any observation IIIGHT is the difference between the child's actual height and the mean height for his or her age—
sex group divided by the standard deviation of height for that age—sex
group. If the actual height of each age—sex group is normally distributed,
this standardized measure could be directly translated into the child's
height percentile.

the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (denoted WISC),9 and reading

arithmetic test scores on the Wide Range Achievement (denoted RWRAT

and

and AWRAT, respectively)J0 Many persons have criticized these measures
of

intellectual development, but even more have used them to conduct

empirical

analyses (for example, the studies cited in Averch et al. 1972).

We distinguish between reading and arithmetic

achievement because

of evidence that among various school achievement measures mathematical

achievement is the most important determinant of earnings (Ashenfelter
and Mooney 1968; Kenny 1977). Achievement rather than IQ would seen to
be most appropriate for our purposes since we wish to measure intellec-

tual development rather than innate ability. It is, however, intellectual development at the onset of independence that is desired, and since
IQ

has been found to be a good predictor of success at school (for ex-

ample, Carroll 1973), we use WISC and

current achievement (RWRAT and

AWRAT) as alternative measures of D. All three measures are scaled to

9The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children is a common IQ test,

similar

to (and highly correlated with results from) the Stanford—
Binet IQ test. The full test consists of twelve subtests, but only
two of these (vocabulary and block design) were administered in the
HES. The possible difficulties in the estimation of full scale IQ
from these two subtests is examined in NCHS (l972b). For a full discussion of all psychological tests administered in the HES, see NCHS
(1966).

The Wide Range Achievement Test is a single test that can be
given
to children of varying ages. In particular, the same test was given to
all of the 7,119 children in the sample. (Only twelve—year olds, who

for WISC and six-month cohorts are used for IRAT

and AWRAT).

3. Explanatory Variables
The

and

explanatory variables in the reduced form equations are health

development

endowments, prices of the composite health and develop-

Inent inputs, measures of efficiency in the production of health and

development capital, family income, and the rate of return on financial
investments.

The rate of return on financial investments is assumed to

be constant for all members of our sample. Measures of the other theoretical variables are described below and are defined precisely in

Table 1. The table also contains definitions of the seven dependent
variables described above.
The health endowment of the child is represented by the following
11

measures:

1. Birth weight, measured by the dichotomous variable LIGHT.

A

child is considered to have low birth weight if he or she
weighs less than 2,500 grams at birth.
2. Mother's age at the time of birth, represented by three dummy

variables (LMAG, HMAG3S, and HMAG4O). Mother's age at the
time of birth is considered an endowment measure because
relatively

older mothers have been found to have a greater

frequency of infants in poor health, while relatively
mothers are

likely

young

to have "unwanted" births and consecuently

receive poorer prenatal care.

mentioned in Section I, a number of the health and development
endowment measures which are treated here as exogenous would be considered endogenous in a more fully specified model.

general it is difficult to make predictions about the directions of
effects of proxies for endowments,
efficiency, and input prices. One consideration is that an increase in a health
endowment, for example, might
lower efficjenc', in the production function of investment in health. If
so, investhent would tend to fall, while the final stock of health might
increase, remain constant, or decrease. A second consideration is that
most of the proxies are correlated with both health and development
endowments, health and development efficiency, or health and develooment
input prices. Given that cross endowment, cross efficiency, and cross
input price effects cannot be signed a priori the effects of these
measures also cannot be predicted a priori. The signs in the tableproxy
are
based on two assumptions: Cl) the own endowment effect is positive,
and
(2) the cross effect does not outweigh the own effect if the two go in
opposite directions.
dsthject to the modifications in note c, the effect of MEDUCAT
or FEDUCAT
would be positive if the price of time were held constant and ambiguous if
it were not.

NSEEC, SEEflG). Although, strictly

information about the correction of visual defects

cannot be included in an endowment variable, such information
does provide some evidence about the price of medical care,
one

of our other explanatory variables.

The develoontent endowment is represented by the following variables:

1. Mother's and father's educational

attainment (denoted MEDUCAT

and FEDUCAT, respectively). Parents' educational attainment

is

a crude proxy measure of the child's inherited

intelligence.

2. A dummy variable indicating whether or not a foreign language
is

sooken in the home (denoted FLANG). This factor could con-

tribute either positively or negatively to the child's intellectual endowment.

3. Two dummy variables measuring asoects of birth order-—one in-

dicating whether the child is the first born in the family
(denoted FIRST) and one indicating if the child is a twin
(denoted TWIN). Everything else equal, more parental time is

available to first born children and non—twins than to later
children or twins.
4. Birth weight as defined above. Since birth weight is partially
determined by maternal health and nutrition
during pregnancy,

it

is frequently used as a crude index of overall fetal de-

velopment (including brain development).15

thepubliclvsuppljed
data with measuresschool

II — 15

S. Visual and hearing acuity, as defined above.
Efficiency in the production of both tynes of children's htmaan capital is

measured by the parents' educational attainment (tDUCAT

and

FEDUCAT) 16 Since mothers traditionally spend more time with children
than do fathers, ?€DUCAT should have a greater effect in the reduced form
equations than FEDUCAT (as measures solely of inherited IQ, they would be
expected to have equal effects).
Information about the prices of the inputs in the health and develoz,—

ment production functions is difficult to obtain for the Cycle It data set.
There are no direct measures of relevant prices such as the price of medical care or the price of parents' time (or their wage rates). Moreover,
since the precise locality of each observation cannot be identified, it

is not possible to estimate these prices with local market data. Therefore, we use a set of crude proxy variables to control partially for these
prices.

To control for price variation due to region and size of place of

residence, we enter a set of three region dummy variables (denoted NEAST,
MWEST, SOUTH) and four sizes

of place

variables (denoted URB1, URB2, URB3,

Nun?). Information about whether or not the child's vision has been corrected (SEEG, NSEEG) provides some indication of the price of medical care.
To hold constant the cost of the mother's time (probably one of the most in-

portant inputs in both the health and
the

development functions), we control for

primary activity of the mother (full—time work, nart—time

work,

or no

work, denoted by the dummy variables MWOR1'T and MWORKPT). Everything else

equal, mothers with higher oPportunity costs are more likely to work in the
labor market (and to work longer hours).17 The cost of time, both of
mothers

who work and those who do not, might also be related to their

schooling (MEDUCAT).18 A similar comment applies with respect to the correlation betweeen the father's price of time and his schooling (FEDUCAT).
The final input price proxy is a dummy variable that indicates whether the
child attended kindergarten or nursery school (denoted KIND). We assume
that the likelihood of kindergarten attendance

is negatively related to the

price of this type of schooling and positively related to the value of the
mother's time.

Family income is represented by FINC, a continuous income variable
computed by assigning midpoints to the income classes reported in Cycle

Finally, two additional variables are included. The first, a dummy
variable indicating whether or not the child is male (denoted MALE)

problems with selectivity bias, which are

19Since this family income measure does not hold constant the
mother's
labor force status and the father's experience, we
experimented
with
an
income measure that held these two factors

constant. The adjusted income
variable was very highly correlated with FINC (the correlation coefficient
was greater than .99) and the regression results were not altered
when adjusted income was used in place of FINC. Therefore, we report results

The

Although our

model does not call for the latter variable in the reduced form (it is
simultaneously determined with child quality), it is among our explanatory
variables for the following reason. Family size is not determined with
perfect certainty. The resulting random variations in the actual number
of

children will generate adjustments in final child quality. For ex-

ample, when a family has more than the desired number of children, this
increases the relative price of child quality and leads to a downward ad-

justment in desired child quality.22 Thus, we expect children in large
families to have lower H and 1).

C. Estimation Method
The relationship summarized by

equations (9) and (11) or (10) and

(12) can be written as:

20See Ben—Porath and Welch (1976) for a discussion of this possibility.

21LE3S20 does not measure comoleted family size, but rather the number

persons in the household younger than 20 years at the time of the Cycle
II interview. Therefore, LESS2O may overstate or understate completed
family size. The mean value of LESS2O in our sample (3.6) may seem highs
but it must be remembered that this figure is computed from a sample of
children, not from a sample of families. In general the mean computed
of

from a sample of children will be larger than that computed from a sample

of families for two reasons. First, families with no children do not
appear in a sample of children, but they do appear in a sample of families.
Second, annng families with children, the probability of any family being
represented in a sample of children is greater the more children in the
family, whereas the probability of any family being represented in a sample
of families is independent of the number of children in that family.

Estimation of equation (13) would be straightfo,a if we could
identify which observations belong in each of the two regimes.25 In
our

data, however, there is no direct way to do so. An alternative

Procedure would be to estimate B (which from Figure 1 can be seen to
depend on those factors which determine the location of the demand and
marginal cost curves of children's quality) and use the estimated value

of B to classify observations. But again, this procedure requires in-

formation about the value of B, at least for a subset of observations.
Another tactic is to note that among the determinants of B, it seems
likely

that variations in income will cause the greatest amount of varia-

tion in B. This suggests the simple, though admittedly crude, procedure
of classifying observations by family income.26
We estimate the relations in equation (13) using this simple classification scheme. The two sthsaxnples are children whose families

have an annual income of under $7,000 and those whose families have
an annual income of $7,000 or more.

Although $7,000 is not the most

obvious cutoff noint to use to identify the regimes,27 we use it for
25Even in this case, however, there is the possibility that in each of
the two regimes the error term would be correlated with some of the independent variables, leading to biased coefficient estimates. For a similar
point in the context of the estimation of searate fertility demand functions for women who work and women who do not work, see Willis (1973).
26The appropriate estimation procedure for this type of
two—regime model
in the absence of direct information for
classifying observations into
regimes is the 'switching of regimes" model described in Goldfeld and Quandt
(1973). The application of this statistical model to our estimation problem
is discussed in Edwards and Grossman (1976). We do not use this technique
here because it is very expensive.

and Sonuist (1969) find that

about 30 percent of families receive art inheritance. If this same percentage were applied to our sample
this would irnoly
27Lansing

an income cutoff somewhere in the $7,000 to $10,000 interval
(47 percent of our sample has family income of $7,000 or more and 22 percent
has family income of $10,000 or more). Such a cutoff would be infeasible
with our data set.

II — 22

several

reasons. First, this cutoff point separates our data into two

equal subsamples, so that standard errors of coefficient estimates in each regine will not differ due to differences in sample sizes.
roughly

Second, since our obsenatjo consist of families with
young children,
the current income of these families is likely to understate their life-

time wealth (relative to the Population at large). If one
takes account of this understatement, the top 50
percent of our sample
may correspond

to the top, say, 40 percent of the population at large.

Third, preliminary estimates of equation (13)
servations with annual income greater than

with annual incomes greater than

or

using, alternately, obequal

to

$7,000 and those

or equal to $10,000 showed that the co-

efficient estimates for these two subsainples do not greatly differ
(although, of course, their standard errors are larger for the higher in-

come class). Finally, many persons are interested in the behavior of low
income groups, and public policy often is aimed at these groups.

Hence,

we choose a $7,000 cutoff point because estimates derived from the resulting pair of income classes will be more useful for policy—makers in
the fields of children's health and

intellectual development than those

derived from a $10,000 cutoff point.

Means and standard deviations of all variables in each of the two
subsamoles

are shown in Table 3. A cursory examination of this table

reveals that there are indeed imoortant differences between these two
groups with respect to both the dependent and independent variables.

A. Basic Hypotheses
There are two nrimary predictions qenerated by the model:

the sets

of coefficients in the two reqimes will differ; and the family income
variable will have a positive effect in Regime 1 and no effect in Regime
2.

There is also the rncre

fundamental prediction that the set of

explant variables suggested by the model do succeed in explaining a significant portion of the variance in the health and development
variables. The latter prediction is clearly supported by our results.
Adjusted R2's range from a hiqh of .238 (for WISC in the lower income
class) to a low of .025 (for IHEIGHT in the upper income class). Even

some cases imperfect proxies for the desired theoretical variables,

taken as a set they do have a

significant impact on our health and de-

velopment measures.

The prediction of two distinct regimes or two different relationships between each of our health and

both of these dependent variables, income has a positive, significant

statistically significant in both income classes
or in neither income class (IREIcjrr and

One likely explanation for the significant coefficients in the upper
income class is the previously mentioned bias resulting from the mis-

classification of observations. In particular, it is likely that members
of Regime 1 are

erroneously included in the over $7,000 income

class,
causing an upward bias in the coefficient of FINC for that class. The
plausibility of this explanation is confirmed by an additional test. In
the upper income class we replace the continuous income variable FINC

with two dummy variables

indicating whether the family had income of

$10,000 and over, or of $15,000 and

over. These dummy variables allow

for a nonlinear income effect in the upper income class. In no case was
income found to have a significant marinal effect when it exceeded

Effects of Other Variables
In discussing effects of variables other than income on intellectual

development and health, we deal with narents' schooling, mother's work
status, number of children in the family, health endowments measured in

infancy, and health endowments measured currently.3 To focus the discussion, note that among our health variables height would be viewed as

the best health measure by persons concerned with the relationshin between

health output and proper nutrition (for examle, National Center for Health

Statistics l970b, 1975; Seoane and Latham 1971; Owen 1973). The peridontal
index and the number of decayed urinary and permanent teeth are good over-

all indexes of oral health and supplementar, measures of nutrition. It is
plausible that the peridontal index, which reflects status of the guns, is
less sensitive to appropriate dental care than the number of decayed teeth.

This proposition is sunported by the higher adjusted R2's in the decay re-

gressions than in the peridontal regressions. Parental assessment of the
child's current state of health is employed as a dependent variable to

a

show how results differ when health is measured sub-jectively by narents as

onposed to objectively by

physicians.

Table 6 contains regression coefficients of mother's schooling and

father's schooling. These two variables have positive and statistically
significant effects on all measures of intellectual development in both

the high income sanle and the low income sarnole. When health is defined in a positive manner,4 fifteen of the sifleen schoolinq coefficients
are positive, but only ten achieve statistical significance at con-

ventional levels of confidence. These ten appear primarily in the
low income sample. It is noteworthy that height, which nutritionists would view as the most important health measure in Table 6, is

practically independent of schooling in the high income samole but dependent unon schooling in the low income sarnnle. We reach the tentative
conclusion that schooling effects are more important for low income
families in the case of health but not in the case of intellectual de—
velonment.

Presumably, schooling of both parents is positively correlated with

the endowment, efficiency, and the value of time. Subject to the modification in Table 1 (note c), an increase in the endowment or in efficiency
raises health or development, while an increase in the value of time

lowers it. Since we are not able to control fully for the value of time
as schooling varies, our results imply that the efficiency or endowment
effect outweighs the value of time effect.

4Recall that IPERI, IDECAY, and PFHEALTH are negative correlates of
children's health.

There is some evidence in Table 6 that mother's schooling has a

larger impact on cognitive development than father's schooling. Five
of the six mother's schooling coefficients exceed the corresponding

father's schooling coefficients. This is consistent with the notion
that

mother's schooling is a more important determinant of efficiency

in development production than father's schooling. A related and
interesting finding emerges when separate development functions are

estimated for boys and girls (see Tables A-8 through A—b). In a].—

most all instances, mother's schooling has a larger effect on the
intellectual development of girls than of boys. On the other hand,

father's

schooling has a larger effect on the intellectual develop-

ment of boys than of girls. We do not know whether this reflects
basic properties of the development production function or whether it

reflects oschobogical forces in early childrearing such as the child's
attachment

to the parent of the same sex.

Table 7

contains

regression coefficients of the two variables for

mother's work status in the labor force. The signs of twenty—three

of the twenty—eight coefficients in the table indicate that
children whose mothers work full—time or part—time have lower levels

of health and development than children whose mothers do not work. In
the

development functions only one of six work status effects is sig-

nificant for the low income sample, while three of six are negative and

significant for the high income sample.5 In the health functions

about the same number of effects are significant in each sample. While

no overall pattern of effects is apparent for the health measures, our
results suggest that mother's participation in the labor market has a
greater detrimental effect on the children in high income fand. lies than

on those in low income families. Interpretation of this finding is subject to the caution that unlike other parental characteristics, mother's
labor force status changes over the child's early life cycle. Our work
status variables provide infonation only on the orimary activity of
the

mother at the time of the Health Examination Survey. Before firm

conclusions can be reached with respect to the role of mother's labor
force status in the determination of children's health and development,
the effects of length of participation and of the life cycle pattern of
participation would also have to be examined.
Regression coefficients of the number of persons in the housi—

serves

as a proxy for completed family size. It has

tistically significant effects on the three measures of intellectual

development. The effects of nirther of children in the family on health

are more erratic. When health

certain kinds of health are subject to irore sharply diminishing returns

the margi-nal cost of investment in health would have relatively small

effects

in the reduced form demand curve at relatively high levels of

The coefficient of the dumny variable for breast—feeding (MBFED) indicates substantial returns to this activity in terms of cognitive develop—
ment While each discipline may offer its own internretation of this

result, a plausible exalanation is that MBFED serves as an auxiliary measure of both the amount of tine mothers spend with their children and

families tastes for children.
Regression coefficients of health endowments measured currently are

presented in Table 10. All of these are based on the physical exaininations administered in the Health Examination Survey. Once again we focus
on

endowment effects in the development functions.

All six coefficients

of abnormal hearing (IREAR) are negative, and five of the six are statis-

tically significant. it is not surorising that the impact of poor hearing is larger

in

the case of school achievement than in the case of IQ.

The importance of poor hearing in the determination of school achievement
is revealed by the following

comparison. In the high income sample, with

all other factors held constant, children
score

with poor hearing have a RWRAT

that is approximately 14 points lower than children with normal

hearing. This difference is twice as large as the 7 point difference in
the mean RWRAT score in the high income sample as compared to the low

income sample. The presence of significant abnormalities (ABN) also is
detrimental to achievement and IQ, although the effects are insignificant
in the high income sample. To a large extent, the last result is due to
the very low prevalence of abnormalities

(.17 percent) in the high income

sample.

Strictly speaking the vision variables in Table 10 (SEEG, NSEEG,
SEENG) cannot be interpreted as endowments

because they combine

information on uncorrected vision with information on whether the child
wears

glasses. Nevertheless, these variables convey useful information

concerning the impact of investment in vision on intellectual develon—

ment.6 In particular, the difference between the coefficient of SEEG
and the coefficient of SEENG comnares children with abnormal

uncor-

rected vision who wear glasses to children with abnormal uncorrected

vision who do not wear glasses. These differences are shown in
Table 11. In general investment in improved vision has a positive
payoff in terms of intellectual development in the high income sample

but not in the low income sample. Kessner (1974) reports that 40 percent of children in a low income sample who were tested with their

glasses failed a visual acuity test. It is plausible that this percentage would be much smaller in a high income sample due to the receipt

of higher quality optometric services by children in such a sample. If
so,

this provides an explanation of the results in Table

that

11 and evidence

the returns to appropriate vision correction might be substantial..7

similar comment can

be made with regard to hearing since children
with endowed (uncorrected) abnormal hearing might have had their hearing
corrected by investment. Such children cannot be identified in the
sample. In the case of vision, since children who wear eyeglasses were
examined without them, only endowed (uncorrect) abnormal vision can be
identified precisely. Information on the use of eyeglasses was added to
the regressions to make the results more comparable to those for poor
hearing. Moreover, this procedure controls in part for reverse causality
from intellectual development to poor vision due to excessive use of the
eyes.

7The positive and significant coefficients of SEEG in the high income
santDle indicate that children with abnormal uncorrected vision who wear
glasses have higher intellectual development scores than children with
normal uncorrected vision who do not wear glasses. This might reflect
a negative correlation between SEEG and the price of medical care, or it
might reflect reverse causality from development to SEEG.

Stnnary
A stated goal of public policy in the United
States is to improve

the economic and

social

well—being of certain groups of children by im-

proving their cognitive develooment and health.

To allocate scarce

resources

among competing programs with respect to children, policy—
makers require information about the dollar costs and benefits of these

Programs. Clearly, our results cannot supply policy—makers with all
of this information. We have no measures of the costs of raising
health or development via alternative programs such as those aimed at
reducing the incidence of low birth weight

size. Nor do we have measures of the

or lowering completed family

dollar values of the benefits of

such programs. Nevertheless, our results do contain policy

insights about potential
cognitive

benefits in terms

relevant

of "physical" (health or

development) units. Policy—rnakers are then free to assign

set of weights they choose to these "physical" units and can
thereby translate increments in health or development into monetary
whatever

magnitudes.

Further,

our results are useful whether or not the mechanism by

which a given variable alters health or development is fully understood.
In the case where the mechanism is known,

our

results can

be used to

identify the appropriate kinds of government intervention. A case in
point is the theoretical and empirical role

of family income. Here we

feel confident that the basic force at work is conmiand over real re-

sources provided by income. Alternatively, when effects of certain
variables are large but mechanisms are

not well understood, our findings

III — 20

suggest

the nature of additional research that is required to formulate

nublic policy, rather than the appropriate policies per se. Consider
for example, our result that parents' schooling is an important deter-

minant of the height of children from low income families. This result
has

a very definite policy implication if the mechanism at work is a

positive correlation between schooling and nutritional intakes or between schooling and knowledge of what constitutes an appropriate diet.
The policy implication is much less clearcut if the mechanism at work
is a positive relationship between parents' schooling and genetic
inheritance.

Our major findings are:

1. The prediction of two distinct regimes or two different relationships between each of our health and development variables and
the set of explanatory variables is generally supported by our results.
Statistically significant differences in the sets of coefficients for
the two income classes are reported for five of seven dependent vari-

ables. Although these results cannot

be characterized as

"unanimous"

support for the basic structure of our nodel, they do constitute

stronger verification than may be initially apparent. The two income
classes used here are unlikely to coincide completely with the two

regimes specified by the model. The resulting misclassification of
observations

will tend to bias the coefficient in the two

income

classes towards equality, making it more difficult to obtain significantly different coefficients in the two income classes even though

such differences do exist in the two regimes. We observe significant
differences in coefficients for five of our seven variables despite
this bias towards finding no such difference.

III —

2.

21

The prediction that income will have a positive effect on health

or development for families in Regime 1 and no effect in Regime 2 receives

weaker support in our results. For the two achievement measures, income
has a positive, significant impact for lower income families and a non-

significant impact for upper income families. For the other dependent

family income is either statistically significant in both in-

variables,

come classes
significant

mentioned

or in neither income class. One likely explanation for the

coefficients in the upper income class is the previously

bias resulting from the misclassification of observations. In

particular, it is likely that members of Regime 1 are erroneously included
in the over $7,000 income class, causing an upward bias in the coefficient
of income for that class.

3. When health is measured by height, parents' schooling, mother's
work status, and family size are significant predictor variables in the
low

income sample but not in the high income sample. On the other hand,

these three variables tend to be as important (or more important) predic—

tars of intellectual development in the high income sample as in the low
income samnle.
4.

Health

endowment and investment measures have significant, posi-

tive effects on cognitive development. In particular, cognitive development scores are higher when children weighed more than five pounds at
birth, when they were breast—fed, when their current hearing is normal,
and when abnormal uncorrected vision is corrected by the use of eye-

glasses. These findings suggest that prenatal and pediatric care pro—
grams that could identify high risk mothers and children at modest cost
would have relatively high expected benefits.

III — 22

Finally, our findings highlight at least two fruitful areas for future

research. One is an investigation of the extent to which endogenous current health measures affect intellectual
investigation of health and development

development, The second is an

relationships at later stages in

the child's life cycle. Both of these will contribute further to our
understanding of how health and development interact and

will provide more

refined measures of benefits from investments in children's health.
