PRICE BEHAVIOR IN THE LIGHT OF BALANCE OF PAYMENTS THEORIES

*

Irving B. Kravis and Robert E. Lipsey

The purpose of this paper is to describe the behavior of that subset of
prices

and price indexes that is relevant to the theory of balance of

payments

adjustment. The theoretical writings on the balance of payments may be viewed

at

this juncture as falling into two

and

main groups —— the "standard" theories

the more recent monetary theories. Each of these is examined to determine

the assumptions and predictions made about particular kinds of

prices, and the

empirical evidence regarding these prices is then set out. Although some assessment of the theories ——

solely

from the price aspect ——

is

offered, the emphasis

is on the price structure and price behavior that ought to be captured in a

satisfactory theory of the mechanisms of international adjustment. For pragmatic
reasons, attention is placed mainly on the theory relating to exchange rate
changes rather than on the explanation of adjustment with fixed exchange rates.

The

Theories

The standard theories which held sway in the 1950's and 1960's consisted of
three major components ——

approaches.

price elasticity, multiplier and absorption

Emphasis on one or the other of these approaches differed with

the time, the purpose and the analyst, but as time went on it was more and more
unusual to find reliance placed on one to the exclusion of the others.

The monetary theories, much more cohesive but still varying in some important
details from one writer to another, were advanced largely by R. Mundell and H.G.

Johnson and their students, beginning in the late 1960s. These theories regard
the balance of payments as a monetary phenomenon, and in contrast to the standard

model tend to minimize the effects that balance of payments adjustments per se

can have on relative prices and quantities traded.

*

Prices &n the standard theory
Prices, which concern us here, are viewed very differently in the two sets of

theories. Curiously enough, the standard theory, in which prices play an important
role, is silent on the nature of the world price structure. For its purposes,
prices (after due allowance for transfer costs) may or may not be the same for
identical goods in different countries, and there may or may not be discriminatory
pricing between domestic sales and exports or between exports to different destinations.

In the elasticity approach, the part of the standard package for which prices

play the most central role, the basic assumption is that exchange rate changes
can produce changes in the prices of one country's goods relative to those of
another country's, and that these price changes are the key factors in inducing
quantity

n

changes that adjust values of exports and imports and hence

the balance

of trade. The analysis is devoted to an account of the elasticity conditions
which will lead to an improvement of the balance of payments following a depreciation of the currency.

More specifically, the implications of the standard approach for the behavior
for prices and for price-induced quantity changes following an exchange rate change
may be set out as follows:

1. The own—currency prices of both export— and import—type goods will rise
in the depreciating country and/or fall in the appreciating country relative to
nontraded goods prices.

2. These price shifts induce increased net exports from the depreciating
country. Also, the price changes should lead to an increaseln the ratio of exports
to production and a decrease in the ratio of imports to domestic absorption.

3. The terms of trade (the ratio of the export price index to the
index) are likely to deteriorate for the depreciating country, although this is not

inevitable. The outcome depends on the pattern of the elasticities, but since a
country is apt to be more specialized in its exports than in its imports, the depreciation is more apt to lower the world prices of its exports than the world prices
of its imports.

4. The overall price level of the depreciating country adjusted or the
exchange rate change will diminish relative to that of the appreciating country.

This follows from #1 if the prices of tradables are the same everywhere or if
their price changes are more closely linked than the price changes for nontradables

in

different countries.

exports

The price shifts will lead to changes in

the commodity composition of

and imports. Even uniform (in proportion to exchange rate changes)

• changes in all traded goods prices (as in a small price—taking country) would

lead to different quantity changes for the various traded goods because of

L

—4—

differences in the elasticities of substitution between traded and ncntraded
goods in both production and consumption.

6. For a country which is sufficiently important in at least some commodities either as a buyer or seller, own—currency price changes following a

depreciation will not be uniform across all traded goods. The more important
the country is in a particular commodity market, the less, other things being
equal, will the own-currency price change as a result of the depreciation and

the more will the world price(s) alter. Thus both the price structure of the
depreciating country and that of the rest of the world should change when an
important country appreciates or depreciates.

The possibility, left open in the elasticity approach, that prices of traded
goods need not be identical in different countries provides somewhat more scope
for terms of trade changes, particularly if there is incomplete specialization
(in the sense that each country produces some of the goods it imports).

The price predictions of the standard approach to a devaluation may, conceivably, not turn out to be correct either because there are important omitted

variables or because it is based on the wrong view of price behavior. By its
concentration on micro—prices, the elasticity approach neglects the macroeconomic

variables taken into account in the absorption and monetary approaches. Its predictions may not come to pass if validating macroeconomic policies are not

followed,

if appropriate policies are followed it may be difficult to separate the effects

and

—5—

of those policies from the effects of the balance of payments deficit or of the

devaluation. With respect to price behavior, the law of one price may operate
to make impossible some of the relative price changes (more on this point below).

Prices in the monetary theory
The price behavior anticipated by the monetary theory is very different.
The general price level is given a central role since it determines the real
*

value of nominal assets including money and internationally traded debt.

Because there is assumed to be a perfect international market for assets, at
least for the advanced industrial countries, changes in price levels in domestic
currency have to be offset by changes in exchange rates --

world price structure. In its purest form the monetary theory holds all prices

single well integrated market. Prices of traded goods are held together because
there is very high substitutability among the products of the industrial countries

"... since the analysis is concerned largely with general price and level movements that restore the initial real equilibrium of the economy, there are no
changes in the relative prices of nontraded goods to worry about (and changes

and arbitrage or even the threat of arbitrage keeps prices uniform. The prices
of nontraded goods are kept in line by the substantial substitutability that
exists between traded and nontraded goods in consumption and among the inputs for

traded

*

and nontraded goods in production.

This across the board application of

the law of one price enables the monetary theory to enjoy simultaneously the

virtues of great simplicity and of great power: if prices must be the same the
world over, any changes in the domestic supply of money not offset by changes
in the domestic demand for money can only find an outlet in the balance of payments; people will not hold more money than they want, and an excess supply, for
example, will be spent on foreign goods or foreign assets thus creating a balance
of payments deficit.

For practical purposes, however, most writers of the monetary school apply
the law of one price only to tradables and take account of the possibility that
the prices of nontraded goods may differ between countries, although it is sometimes asserted and in other cases implied that these differences are transitory

*

"... the

monetary models almost invariably assume ... that a country's price level
is pegged to the world price level and must move rigidly in line with it. One
justification for this assumption is that, at least among the advanced industrial
countries, industrial competition is so pervasive that elasticities of substitution
among the industrial products approximate more closely to infinity than to the
relatively low numbers implicit in the standard model." Johnson (1972), pp. 235-36.

even if goods cannot be traded, the factors used in producing them generally

of being a machine tool operator producing machinery or consumers durable goods
for export, or instead of imports, and the price of haircuts must be such as to
give the barber labor earnings comparable to the wages paid in exporting (and
import competing) industries. Secondly, even where there are no comprehensive
direct links between costs of production of tradable and non-tradable goods,...
the prices of non-traded goods will be linked to the prices of tradables through
tastes, supply conditions, and the overall budget constraint, and fixed given the
other factors and the relation between domestic expenditure and income." J.A.

and that tney will disappear in long run equilibrium.

ition

In the short run or trans-

period depreciation lowers the price of nontraded goods at home and raises

their price abroad and induces substitution just as in the elasticity approach.
Indeed,

short run equilibrium is characterized by an
exchange of traded goods for real balances and hence the absorption effects of a devaluation are emphasized, the role
of the relative price of home oods is nevertheless crucial
in the adjustment mechanism.
...

Traded goods are still subject to the law of one price, a specification that
is not in the least essential to the standard theory but which is usually assumed

as a matter of course by elasticity theorists. A balance of payments disturbance
arising out of thbnetary causes will not bring about any change in the terms of

trade in the new equilibrium as compared to the old

one; in the course of the

adjustment process the, terms of trade for a depreciating country may either improve
or worsen.

Comparisons of price behavior in the two theories

"The existence of non—traded goods does, however, become relevant in the empirical
application of the theory, in both the static case when prices may differ from the
prediction of simple purchasing power theory owing to differences in the money
prices and expenditure weights of such goods between countries, and the dynamic
case of growth of productivity at different rates in the traded and non-traded
sectors, which implies different price trends in the two sectors when factor
mobility equalizes factor prices between them." Frenkel and Johnson, ibid., p. 28.
"To put the point more extremely than is necessary for present purposes, in a
general equilibrium of prices the fixing of any one price by trade determines
all the rest. The adjustment to the real equilibrium of relative prices, which
must be achieved eventually, can be quick or slow. The monetary theory assumes
that it is quick." D.N. McCloskey and J.R. Zecker, "How the Gold Standard Worked,
1880—1913," in Frenkel and Johnson,

dictions? To a considerable degree, the two theories stress different aspects
of price (and quantity) behavior and are more like ships that pass each other

in the night than like ships that collide head on. The elasticity approach concentrates on the short run process of adjustment. It stresses the real changes
that are the consequences of exchange rate changes: there are shifts in the overall volume of traded goods, changes in the quantity composition of exports and
imports, and changes in price structures with respect to (a) traded versus non-

traded goods, (b) various traded goods both in own-currency and in foreign currency prices when a large country alters its exchange rate, and, possibly (c)

the terms of trade. There is nothing in the elasticity theory to suggest that
these changes are temporary.

The monetary theory concentrates on the long run equilibrium position. it
anticipates that the law of one price will have wide application —— even to non-

traded goods after a lag. When exchange rates change, prices will adjust quickly so as to maintain the world—wide equality of prices for individual

or

in their price structure.

Not all of the other changes anticipated by the elasticity approach would be

inconsistent with the monetary theory. Temporary changes in the relatIonship of
traded to nontraded goods prices are accepted. Even changes in price structure,
especially if they were identical inown currency and world prices, would appear
more to limit the sweeping simplicity of the theory than to challenge it on
grounds that are

fundamental

to it.

—9—

Although the elasticity writers talk of the "short run" process of adjustment
and the monetary writers of the "long run," this betokens a difference in the
stages of the econoxtic process that are the focus of inquiry, rather than a dif-

ference in the duration of the time periods under consideration. Most analysts
using the elasticity approach would expect the adjustment process to work itself

out in a period of say 2 to 5 years. As for the "long run" of the monetary school,
one adherent, M. Mussa, writes that since "the horizon of the policy maker is
typically much shorter than a decade" and also because o,.f problems of "sorting

out empirical relationships which involve very long lags, "...

the

advocacy of

a monetary approach to the balance of payments necessarily involves the assertion
that these 'longer-run consequences' materialize within a time horizon of two or

three

*

years."

Hence there is not much difference between the calendar time

periods dealt with by the two approaches, but the elasticity writers focus on
the changes within the period while the monetary writers stress the equilibrium
conditions that must emerge at the end of the period, given the controlling role
of monetary factors in setting of f the adjustments.** Within the adjustment
period, in the more realistic versions of the theory, there can be temporary
deviations from the behavior of prices that characterise equilibrium situations.

For xample, changes in the traded/nontraded price ratios in opposite directions
in deficit and surplus countries may interfere with the close correlation between
price level movements generally expected.

A basic feature of the monetary approach, Mussa writes, is "a concentration on

We have not tried to set out all the contrasts between the two appraoches.
Our focus on prices has led us to ignore some very important differences in pre-

dictions --

as, for example, the anticipation of the standard theory that growth

produces balance of payments deficits while the monetary approach reaches the
opposite conclusion.

A potentially important omission in both of the theories, already alluded to, is

the lack of any attention to the possibility of price discrimination in international

trade. In previous work, the present authors suggested there is in fact widespread
price discrimination and that this leads to a further price-related mechanism of
*

adjustment.

A depreciation of the exchange rate will appear to a firm able to

price differently in home and foreign markets as a rise in foreign demand (in

terms of its home currency). This will enable the firm to raise its export price
(still in home currency) relative to its domestic price, and the resulting jm-

provement in profit margins in export relative to domestic sales will lead it

to

**

shift its sales towards exports.

An appreciation will have the opposite

effect of shifting sales away from the foreign to the home market. The balance
of payments consequences of these shifts can of course be readily assessed in
terms of the elasticities of supply and demand and the macroeconomic conditions
considered in the standard approach.

variables including domestic money stocks, international reserves and capital
movements.

Our aim, as we said at the outset, is much more modest. It is to examine
the behavior of prices in the light of the assumptions and predictions made about

prices in the two sets of writings about the balance of payments. Some of these
views of prices are what might be called "end-product" or "final outcome" views
--

that

is, they are assumptions or predictions about price relationships that

should be observable since they refer to what is supposed to exist at any moment
of time; all the interdependencies are assumed to have worked themselves out to

produce the result that will always be found in the real world. The application
of the law of one price to traded goods, for example, falls in this category.
In other instances, the movements of prices or changes in price relationships
that are observable at a moment of time are not independent of other (non-balance
of payments) variables and an examination of such prices outside of an econometric
model which takes the interrelationships into account is of more limited value.
The predictions of the elasticity approach tend to fall in this category. They
depend on validating macroeconomic policies which may or may not be followed; if
validating policies are not pursued the effects may be offset and if they are followed
they may dominate the outcome.
We nevertheless present the evidence on the behavior of the relevant price

variables. A main reason for this is that relative to the volume of theoretical
writings on the balance of payments —-

all

and/or predictions about price behavior —-

of which must make some hypotheses

there

has been remarkably little

empirical work on prices in connection with the mechanism of adjustment, and

much of the work that has been done has been based on unsatisfactory data. We
think it worth while therefore to set out the evidence —— some of which has not
been available before or if available not assembled for the purpose -- even

—12—

though part of it requires analysis beyond what we attempt here before its bearing
on different theories can be fully assessed.
More specifically, we shall concentrate on two aspects of the price behavior
discussed in

balance of payments literature --

the law of one price and the

behavior of relative prices. The "relative" prices that are found in the literature and that concern us are (a) prices in one country vis a vis those in another,
(b) export prices relative to import prices and (c) tradables prices relative to
nontradables prices.
As is so often the case, difficulties are encountered in designing empirical

measurements that match the theoretical concepts. These difficulties, largely of
a definitional character are found at every level of aggregation that has come into

our discussion of the theories: the meaning of the general level of prices; the
definition of the various subsets of goods, particularly traded Sand nontraded
goods; and the definition of individual products or.product categories.

Price levels

In the theoretical discussions of relative price movements, it is often

adequate to carry on the discussion in terms of a one-commodity model. For
empirical purposes it is natural to regard a general price index as the matching
measure, but this creates difficulties about some of the arguments about prices.

When the law of one price is involved in such models, for example, it is not
clear whether we should take the meaning to be that (a) the time to time movement of the prices of identical commodities must be the same in all countries
after adjustment for exchange rate changes, or that (b) the exchange-rate-adjusted
movements in overall price levels in different countries must be identical (i.e.,

that the purchasing power theory of exchange rates is valid). Since the overall
price movement of any country has to be some kind of weighted average of the

-13-

movement of individual prices, both (a) and (b) cannot be true simultaneously
unless the relative importance of corrunodjtjes is the same in each country

or unless all commodities have identical price movements.
If we are to compare price level changes, we must choose among three
measures -- GDP
implicit deflators, wholesale prices and consumer prices.
All suffer, for purposes of international comparisons of price movements, from
the fact that the methods used in their Preparation,and sometimes the Constituent
elements as wells differ from one country to another.

Of the three, the GDP implicit deflator has the strongest claim to represent
*
a general measure of a country's price level.
It is based on a conceptual framework that assigns an appropriate weight to each good, whatever the classification
chosen -- as for example, between tradables and nontradables. Wholesale
price

indexes, historically the most widely used in comparisons of price level changes,**
have no clear conceptual framework, as their official producers are sometimes
candid enough to say.

Because of this lack they are probably more subject to

international differences in scope than either implicit deflators or consumer

This seems to be the view also of Officer
who has recently produced a comprehensive review of the purchasing
power parity literature, including parities
based on Costs as well as on the several price indexes. See L.H. Officer,
"The Purchasing Power Parity Theory of Exchange Rates: A Review Article," IMP
Staff Papers, March 1976.

**See Officer's survey of empirical studies, 2E cit., pp. 33—49. An important
reason is of course that GDP deflators were not widely available before World
War II.
uThough general wholesale price indexes have been calculated by many countries
for years there is no precise answer to the question of what such an index
measures. This is so because the index cannot be associated with any adequately
definable value aggregate." Statistics Canada, Prices and Price Indexes, July

indexes.

However, the wholesale price indexes of the different countries

are similar in that they include a higher proportion of tradables -as they do on commodities ——

concentrating

than either the implicit deflators or the consumer

price indexes. Since the time to time movements of tradables are presumably
more similar in different countries than are riontradables, wholesale price indexes

may be expected to be biased in the direction of uniformity of price movements.

Another source for such bias is that the indexes usually overweight primary products
and often completely omit highly differentiated products:
Consumer price indexes are not subject to the same conceptual deficiencies
as wholesale price indexes but they provide partial rather than comprehensive

Consumer price indexes do, of course,

include services as well as commodities, but since they typically exclude publicly
financed services, their scope varies from one country to another in accordance

with the division between household and public financing of certain services such

For example, the French wholesale price index in the late 1960s did not include
prices for machinery or equipment whereas these categories made up 28 percent of
the weights in the German index of producers prices of industrial products.
Neither the French index nor the German index included food or agricultural products while in the Italian index of wholesale prices, 29 percent of the weights
consisted of agricultural products and products of the food and related industries,
and another 19 percent, products of agricultural manufacturing industries other
than foodstuffs. The indexes of Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom
were more comprehensive in their commodity coverage. Practices also differed among
the countries with respect to the inclusion of mining and quarrying, electricity,
and in the treatment of complicated engineering goods ranging from transistors to
ship building. See the brief descriptions of the indexes in the 1972 Supplement
to the Statistical Yearbook and Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, United Nations,

The scope of implicit deflators is more likely to be similar since they are
pegged in the main to a common accounting framework (the U.N. System of National

Accounts

**
).

Differences

are greater when it comes to practices for factoring

the current value series into price and quantity changes.

With respect to

consumption, however, the similarities are more striking than the differences. The
virtually universal practice is to use appropriate component series of the consumer an
wholesale price indexes to deflate expenditures at a relatively disaggregated level.
Differences tend to be greatest in problem areas such as rents and in capital forrnatic

and government final expenditures; in some of these areas quantity indicators are
occasionally used to produce quantity indexes and the price indexes are then

derived from the expenditure ratios. Where, as is more usual, price indexes are
used, the nature of the price series upon which reliance is placed varies widely.
The diversity is particularly great for construction where input prices are employed
in some cases and a list of finished construction outputs in other cases, the list
differing in composition from one country to another.
All these individual price series are used to deflate disaggregated expenditure

*

There are also some important differences in weights. For many of the countries
including France, Germany and Italy, around 45 percent of the weights are represented by food, beverages, and tobacco. In the U.S. index, these categories
account for less than a quarter of the weights. Rent and household operation
made up 15 percent of the weights in Italy, 25 percent in Germany, and 33 percent
in the U.S. U.N., Supplement....

components. The resulting detailed constant price series are aggregated to obtain GDP, and the implicit GDP deflator is then derived by the division of this

constant price series into the current price series. The effect is to produce
a current weighted (Paasche) price index for each period which is not in principle

comparable with the index for any other period except the base period. This is
a nicety with respect to which we shall follow a well beaten path in ignoring.

From the standpoint of the monetary approach, the chief factor influencing
the choice among the three indexes would appear to be the one that is most

relevant to the demand for money. If the demand for money is conceived of mainly
in terms of households, the consumer price index, even with its differences in
coverage arising from differences in the financing of services such as health

and education, is the most appropriate index. It is perhaps for this reason
*

widely•used in the writings of the monetary school, but even from the standpoint
of the demand for money balances the GDP deflator has the advantage of taking at

least

**

some account of the non-household holders of money.

Specialized subsets of goods

For empirical purposes it is necessary to have an operational definition of

traded and nontraded goods and of exports and imports. One easy solution for exports and imports is to assume that each country is completely specialized in a

particular set of exports. This assumption was embodied in Viner's interpretation
of the classical theory of the adjustment mechanism: "...

in the same markets, and primarily to relative variations in prices as between

and import commodities."

Disturbances to international equilibrium thus

in changes in the terms of trade which helped restore the equilibrium.
This simple solution.is not satisfactory for major industrial countries like
the U.S. or Germany because some goods may appear on both the export and import
lists at different times or even at the same time; there are likely to be continual changes in the lists of commodities that are exported or imported, both
additions and deletions occurring each year.

Also, there is a need to distinguish between traded and nontraded goods. Viner
proposed to define a domestic commodity as one that does not ordinarily cross a
national frontier and whose price is not tied so directly to the prices of similar
products abroad that the differential between the domestic and the foreign price

approximates the cost of transportation.

**

The implementation of this definition woul

be very onerous since it would require a price comparison for each good before it

could be categorized. Also, the definition has the disadvantage that it might lead
to the classification as domestic goods of internationally traded commodities for

regards this explanation as "implausible" and "silly". "Internationally it
assumes that if, on an international gold standard, gold were redistributed from
Guatemala to Colombia, the price of bananas would fall in Guatemala in proportion
to the decrease in the money stock and the price of coffee would rise in Colombia
in proportion to the increase in money there." (.
pp. 26-27). However,
earlier Collery recognizes that a change in relative demand (e.g., following a
transfer from one country to another) could alter the terms of trade if the marginal preferences of the two countries were different and if supplies were not
perfectly elastic in one of the countries. However, Collery denies that changes
in the terms of trade would contribute to the restoration of equilibrium as Viner
held.

which discriminating pricing prevails.

Recently Aukrust has suggested that the appropriate distinction is between
"exposed" and "sheltered" industries, the former consisting of those that market
their products abroad or face foreign competition on domestic markets and the

latter

*

consisting of those that are relatively free of foreign price competition.

From the standpoint of tracing the transmission of price effects this puts the
emphasis where it belongs, although if one is concerned with production consequences
the distinctions between the absorption of home-produced and import goods and between production for the home and foreign markets may still be important.
There are several devices for coping with these definitional problems in

empirical work. One way is to select certain categories of goods for which
separate price indexes are available and which clearly fall in one class or the

other. Services, for example, may be treated as archetypal nontraded goods and
manufactures as arthetypal traded goods. Within manufactures, producers durables
constitute a category which are apt to be more traded relative to their production

than most other manufactures. Agricultural products, which are also widely
traded, have the disadvantage that the industrial countries maintain substantial

commodities could ther be regarded as tradables and services as nontradables.

commodity by its relative importance in domestic shipments, exports and imports,

respectively, in turn. This procedure would produce a different price index for
each of the three classes. Its disadvantage is that it may not be sensitive
enough to distinguish clearly the alternative price movements of the three groups
of commodities; this failure is more likely to occur if the weights for the three

classes are similar. Another disadvantage is that it assumes that
the holesale prices are adequate indicators of the prices of imports and exports.
We have reason to believe, as will be seen, that this assumption is unwarranted,
but it still may be claimed that the domestic prices of those goods that are
traded are more correlated with their own prices in international trade than are
the domestic prices of nontraded goods with the prices of traded products.
Another method, found in the literature, is to use the ratio of the GDP implicit deflator (or sometimes of the consumer price index) to the wholesale price
index as an indicator of the movement of the nontradables/tradables price ratio
on the ground that the wholesale price index is more heavily weighted with
tradable goods.

Finally, there are a few cases in which genuine export and import price in*

dexes (not unit value ) indexes are available. It .s then possible to use the
implicit deflator or the general wholesale price index, or the component of that
index relating to domestic prices if available, to represent nontraded goods in
comparison with the export and import price indexes.

Although a recent interpretation of Hume holds that his view of the adjust**

ment mechanism involved different prices for the same goods in different countries,

For the defects of unit value indexes as measure of price movements, see I. Kravis
and R. Lipsey, Price Competitiveness in World Trade (New York: National Bureau of
Economic Research, 1971), pp. 4-5. Many studies dealing with the matters treated
here are flawed by treating export and import unit value series as though they
were price series.

it is almost always taken for granted in discussions of balance of

payments theory that the law of one price applies to traded goods. This, as
previously noted, is an essential assumption for the monetary approach but not
for the elasticity approach even though writers using an elasticity framework

usually make the same assumption as a matter of course. Price differences
attributable to transfer costs (transport costs, duties, etc.) are, of course,
allowed for, but since these costs can usually be assumed to vary little relative
to the product price over a short span of years, identical traded goods are taken

to have the same price movements in all countries. The swift price adjustments
anticipated by the monetary theory imply that exchange rate changes should not
alter the price relationships among different countries of the world when prices

are converted to a common currency at the prevailing rates of exchange of each
day.

As part of our investigation of the applicability of the law of one price,
we shall present evidence below pointing to substantial differences in price

levels

and movements for goods in the same 4- or even 5—digit SITC categories

when exported by different countries or when sold at home and abroad by the same

country. For exam,1e, German export prices (in dollar
terms; i.e., adjusted for exchange rate changes) for "locks, padlocks and keys
therefor of miscellaneous metal" (SITC 698.1) rose by 104.9 percent between 1970

and 1974 while U.S. export prices rose by 23.3 percent. Is this evidence that
the law of one price does not apply here? One possibility is to answer this
question in the negative or at least to reserve judgment on the ground that the

Papers, Series M, No. 34 (New York: United Nations, 1961).

—21—

internal composition of the exports within the category may differ between Germany

and the U.S. One could go even further and define products or commodities in
such a way that any price difference between two items means that they are dif-

ferent goods. Such a decision would not be entirely unreasonable; differences
in the terms of sale -—

credit,

delivery dates, before and after sales service,

etc. -- may involve such different bundles of benefits in two purchases even of
physically identical goods that the prices would not be the same even under perfect competition.

But this would be to make the law of one price prevail by assumption, and
would in any event salvage little for the monetary approach notion of speedy

price adjustments for traded goods. The composition of the exports of two
countries for the same 4-digit category may in actual fact differ, and this may
produce some differences in the price indexes for the category as between the

two countries. But even if the differences in price movements stem entirely from
differences in composition, the large differences such as the one cited above and thoE
found below for other 4-digit categories, including "pumps and centrifuges" and
"tractors other than road tractors" do not point to the high degree of substitutability between the exports of major industrial countries that is assumed in the

monetary approach. At the disaggregated level, our decision to treat the things
falling within 4- or 5-digit SITC categories as like products would not appear
to bias the results against the monetary approach.

Criterion of similarity of price movements
This discussion brings us to another thorny question that need not be
answered in theoretical discussions but for which a criterion is required in

empirical work. In theory, it is enough to say that price movements are or are

—22—

not the same, but when we examine actual price series we find various degrees of

similarity. How alike do prices or price movements have to be so that we can say
they satisfy the law of one price?

A number of studies directed at the empirical testing of the monetary theory of
the balance of payments answer this question by comparing the similarity of the behavior of prices in different nations with the similarity of price behavior for similar
*

commodities in different regions; the inter—regional variation of prices in an economy
considered to be highly integrated such as that of the United States is used as a

standard against which international price variation may be measured. If it is found
that the similarity of price movements in different countries is as great as the
similarity of price movements within different regions of the country taken as the
standard, it is concluded that the international economy is as integrated as the

domestic economy of the standard country. This measure of the openness or the degree
of integration of national economies may have its uses (as, for example, in explaining the relationship between commercial policy and economic growth), but it has its

limits as an empirical test of the monetary theory of the balance of payments. Where
the similarity of price movements is low, both, within the standard country and among

countries, the monetary theory may apply to neither type of situation. There is
ample scope not only for differential price movements but also for price-induced
changes in real variables such as flows of goods and unemployment.
Indeed, even high coefficients of correlation may conceal shifts in relation-

ships that are economically important. For example, the r2 between annual changes
in German export prices and in German domestic prices for manufactured products

See D. McCloskey and R. Zecher, "How the Gold Standard Worked, 1880-1913," J. Frankel
and H.G. Johnson (edsj, The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments, (London:

between 1954 and 1974 is 0.92. Despite the high correlation, however, the ratio
of export to domestic prices varied over an 8 percent range (taking the relationship in 1963 as the base, the high was 105.8 in 1956 and the low 97.8 in 1973).
This seems small, but, as we have argued elsewhere, the variations were large
enough relative to profits/sales ratios to make substantial differences in the
relative profitability of exports and domestic sales and hence to produce signif icant shifts in exports relative to domestic shipments.*
This suggests that the criterion of the similarity or dissimilarity of price
movements might be an analytical one, based on the impact of the differences on quan-

tity changes. If the divergence in the price movements

of,

say, German and U.S.

exports were great

—23—

enough to produce a shift in relative quantities, we could say that the price

movements could be regarded as different for practical purposes. We would still
be faced with the issue of how big the quantity change could be and still have

the price differences not violate the law of one price. Also, owing to product
to product differences in demand elasticities, we would be in the position of
judging differently the same percentage deviation between different pairs of (for
example) German and American export prices.
In the empirical work which follows, we do not attempt to apply a fixed

criterion for assessing whether the data do or do not conform to the law of one

price. We offer our judgment in each case and cite the quantitative criteria
suggested by others where we have found some, but regard as our main contribution
a clear presentation of the differences so that each reader will be able to form
his own opinion.

The identification of historical periods for the observation of price behavior
A study of price behavior during the adjustment process under fixed exchange

rates would be faced with the very difficult task of identifying historical periods
of exchange rate equilibria and interim periods when the adjustment mechanism was

supposed to be operating. We try to avoid this briar patch by concentrating on the
effects of exchange rate changes

For the standard approach, the period following an exchange rate change is the

period when the expected price changes are supposed to occur. The behavior of the
terms of trade, the relationships of nontraded goods prices relative to traded
goods prices, and the behavior of real variables in the adjustment process can
all be studied as far as the elasticity approach is concerned for periods following
exchange rate changes.

I

—24—

Some attention is given in the literature also to the period before the exchange rate change during which, it is often held, there will be a growing over-

valuation of the currency. One would expect thefore to observe in the period preceeding an exchange rate change, prices in the depreciating country rising relative to prices in appreciating countries.
Our criterion for identifying appreciations or depreciations was a change in
the annual average exchange rate of at least 3 percent from one year to the next.
Once a change this large was identified, years on either side were included in
the period of change if the year-to-year changes were in the same direction and

at least 1 percent. For the periods preceeding and following the period of change
in the exchange rate we have chosen both 3- and 5-year periods for study. These
choices are intended to constitute periods long enough to determine wheter the price
effects produced by the exchange rate changes are offset quickly or at least
after the adjustment process has worked itself out as the monetary approach pre-

dicts. The 3-year period probably is the more appropriate measure of the "long
run" from this standpoint, while the 5-year period may be regarded as the outer
limit.

Much of the price behavior anticipated in the more sweeping versions of
the monetary theory of the balance of payments represents ongoing phenomena that
should be observable both within and outside of periods of balance of payments

adjustment. Prices are to move identically in different countries whether the

balance of payments is in equilibrium or in the process of adjustment. In its
more careful form, however, the monetary theory stresses the rapid adjustment of
prices and confines its predictions about the similarity of price movements to

equilibrium periods. Testing this version of the theory would require the identifica
tion of periods of balance of payments equilibrium. The strategy we have adopted is

is

simply to compare price movements for a number of different arbitrarily

chosen

intervals varying in duration from 2 to 10 years.

Price Levels and Changes in Price Levels

with over-

all price levels —- and then go on to sectoral prices and prices for detailed corn-

Inodity categories. In each sector we assert our conclusions as headings and follow
with the argument.

What we want to know about price levels or changes in them is whether they conform to the law of one price or whether it is possible for the price levels of different countries to alter in relation to one another for balance of payments reasons
or as a result of exchange rate changes.

The price level indexes are obtained by dividing purchasing power parities (number
of units of foreign currency required to purchase what one dollar will buy) by
the prevailing exchange rate (foreign currency per dollar).
These have the advantage of coming closer to the comparison of prices for a basket
of goods that is identical for all the pairs. However, they also have certain
disadvantages for our purposes that will shortly be made clear. With respect to

Price relationshios among major industrial countries, as indicated by comoarisons

of absolute price levels, changed as much as 25 to 30 percent in some cases
between 1950 and 1970.

Given that there are differences in price levels, an important question is

what happens to these differences through time. If

because

of changes in long run

structural

they are altered, is it only

factors, such

as relative GDP per capita, or

do long run and short run balance of payments factors -- trade
movements -—

flows and capital

affect them? It is, of course, easier to answer the question

of whether they change than to say why they change.

It is convenient to.discuss the changes against a framework of naive

pur-

chasing power parity (PPP) theory and then return to the assessment of the significance• of the findings both for monetary theory, and, more incidentally,

purchasing power parity theory.
In its naive form

the

PPP theory denies that relative price levels change;

there are differential movements in the price levels of a pair of countries,
the rate of exchange will tend to adjust so as to maintain the PPP relationship

the Ps represent purchasing power parities (currency units per U.S. dollar) divided

data for 1950 are from OEEC studies and those for 1970 from the U.N.

work, both of which have already been referred to.
The 1950 and 1970 comparisons are set out in Table 2

for six European

countries vis a vis the U.S. The PPPs and the Ps for 1950 and 1970, and the ob*

served 1970/1950 PPP relationship are given. Using the U.S. weighted data, we
see that although European price levels were still below that of the U.S. in
1970, they were in the main closer to the U.S. level than they had been in 1950
(compare columns 9 and 11).

(But note that the 1950 price comparisons relate to

the 1950 GNP basket, while those of 1970 relate to the 1970 GDP basket.) The
relative change over the 20 year period, what we have called the PPP relationship,

is set out in column 13. For 3 countries the numbers are close to 1.00 as the
naive theory would predict. For others they deviate by at least 10 percent.

1.34, 1.26 and 1.22, respectively.
*

As previously noted, these have the advantage of referring to a fixed basket of goods.
However, it is not clear whether the balance of theoretical considerations favor U.S.or own-weighted data. In the PPP literature, some writers have favored own-weights on
the ground that price parity should be regarded as being based on parity of unit factor
cost. See Officer, op. cit., p. 15. Even if this argument were accepted, the case for
its application to the data in Table 2 would be weakened by the fact that they are
based on price comparisons for final expenditures and thus on what the country absorbs
rather than on what the country produces (as it would be if the comparisons were based
on prices of the outputs of the industries of each country).
For all countries except Belgium, the deviation from the purchasing power parity result
is greater when the country's own basket of goods is used than with the U.S. basket
(see column 14). ThIs may be attributable to the fact that the own-weighted GDPs
shifted substantially towards the U.S. bundle of goods for which European prices were
more expensive. The shift towards the U.S. bundle has been documented for France,
Germany, Italy and the U.K. See I. Kravis, Z. Kenessey, A. Heston, and R. Summers,
p. 268.

—32—

Changes in price levels as measured by implicit deflators also show some substantial
deviations from the PPP relationship
Another and somewhat more usual way of analyzing changes in exchange-rateadjusted price levels is to use time to time indexes to measure price changes

between periods. The greater abundance of such data gives us more freedom in
coverage of time periods and countries. As noted earlier, this wider coverage
comes at a cost since the methods used in different countries in making price
indexes and sometimes the scope of the indexes vary widely.

—33—
In Table 3, we draw on the wider availability of implicit deflators to add
5 other countries to our

sample of developed countries.

*

The PPP relationships

tend to be well above 1.00. For 1970/50 (column 16) they are over 1.30 in 3 out
of 10 cases. For the countries that also appear in Table 2, the results are simi-

lar.

**

The availability of the PPP relationships for the subperiods of the 1950s
(column 15) and 1960s (column 14) provides an opportunity to examine a somewhat les

less strict or naive version of PPP theory which holds that there are some devia-

tions from a PPP of 1 but that these are soon reversed. In fact, the deviations
from 1.00 in these two subperiods are substantial though not as great in most cases

as for 1970/1950 or 1973/1970. As this implies, there is no consistent tendency
for the deviations of the 1950s to reverse themselves in the 1960s; in 4 of the 9
comparisons with the U.S. the deviation of the 1950's grew larger during the 1960's

and in the same direction. Matters are

little better when all possible pairs of

countries are considered; in 17 of the 45 pairs

the dviation of the 1950's

grew larger during the l960s (and in the same direction), in another 12 the deviation was in the opposite direction but even larger and in 15 pairs the 1970/1960
index was closer to 1.00 than the 1960/1950 index; 29 of the cases, therefore, do
not support the PPP theory.
*

All

the industrialized countries were included for which trouble—free continuous
series could be found in various issues of the U.N. Yearbook of National Accounts
Statistics. Main reliance was placed on the 1957, 1966, 1970 and 1974 issues.
However, the U.S. implicit deflators for GD? were taken from Table 7.15 of the
official U.S. national accounts tables in order to utilize revised data that were
not yet published in the U.N. source.
**The PPP relationships for 1970/50 tend to be more similar, as we might expect,
to the own-weighted Table 2 indexes than to the U.S.-weighted indexes.
There are 10 countries for which indexes are available both in the l950s and
l960s; hence 45 pairs. For one pair, Denmark-Germany, the PPP relationship
was .97 in both periods.

However, the terminal yeats of the periods in Table 3 were selected for
reasons of statistical convenience and not to represent the equilibrium periods
between which the PPP relationship is expected to conform to unity in the monetary
and purchasing power parity writings.

We have therefore examined the ?PP relationships vis a vis the U.S. of the
countries in Table 3 for all possible 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 year periods between

1950 and 1970. The results are summarized in Table 4 in terms of the frequency
distribution of the deviations from the PPP relationship. It is evident that
the anticipated PPP relationship tends to hold for short time spans, though cases

of deviations of 10 percent or more can be found. Over longer periods of years,
relative price levels tend to drift farther apart. For the 2 year periods, for
example, exchange rate adjusted price levels deviated from the U.S. price level by
20 percent or more in.only 1% of the observations and

changed

by 5 percent or less

relative to the U.S. in three-quarters of the cases. At the other extreme, for the
10 year periods, only 14% of the relationships had changed by as little as 5% and

one-fifth had changed by 20% or more. The drift becomes more pronounced if the time
span is expanded past 1970.

In Table 5 we compare the indexes of PPP relationships of Table 3 based on
GDP implicit deflators with corresponding indexes based on wholesale prices and

on consumer prices. Those based on wholesale prices tend to be closer to 1.00
than those based on implicit deflãtors or than those based on consumers prices.

Even in the wholesale—price—based series, however, large deviations can be found
particularly when relationships between pairs of countries, not including the U.S.,
are taken into account (36 percent in the 1950s for Norway—Italy and 18 percent in
the l960s for Sweden-Japan).

Finally, we show in Table 6 the results of still another way of guaging the
similarity of price movements ——

price change for each country for 1950—73 was correlated with each of the other

countries.

*

In order to economize on space we present for each country only

the average of its correlation coefficients with all the other countries and the
number of cases (in brackets) in which the coefficient was significant at the

.05 level. Note that the correlations are higher and more often significant
for the exchange rate adjusted price changes than for price changes in local

currencies, higher for wholesale prices than for consumer prices and higher for
**
The average correlations for
consumer prices than for implicit deflators.
adjusted implicit deflators vary from 0.44 to 0.75, high enough, as we further
suggest below, to indicate that there are links between national prices but not
high enough to suggest that they are "rigid".

The comparisons of price levels at different times and of the movement of price

indexes relative to exchange rates lead to the conclusion that while the price
levels of different countries are indeed linked together, the links are looser
than described in the monetary approach to the balance of payments.

In assessing the significance of the data in Tables 2 to 6 for the PPP theory
and for the monetary approach to the balance of payments, two kinds of questions

arise. One is whether the deviations are big enough to damage or discredit the
theories and the other is whether-they can be explained away.

Each analyst will have to decide in the light of his own purposes whether the

All years, including those in which exchange rates were changed were included.
Years of change should conceivably have been excluded on the ground that prices
might have adjusted though not simultaneously. However, exclusion of years of
change for either member of each pair would greatly reduce the number of observations. From Table 7 below, which gives periods of exchange rate changes for industrial countries, it can be seen that only 1953—55 and 1963-65 were years not
involved in changes even as initial or terminal years.
**

Data for 1950—70 produce the same conclusions though the r's are slightly lower.

—40—

PPP relationships fall close enough to 1.00 to satisfy the theories.* As a
matter of general judgment we express our own opinion that the results do not

support the notion of a tightly integrated international price structure. The
record of exchange-rate-adjusted price changes after the end of the pegged exchange
rate system in the early 1970s shows that price levels can move apart sharply

without very rapid correction through arbitrage. The large German deviation
from the PPP shown in Table 2 for 1970/50 did not, for example, reverse itself,
**
but grew larger in the ensuing
years.
On the other hand, the data do suggest that the usual -- though not necessary
--

situation

is one in which short period movements in GD? price levels are close

together.

Our findings appear to be less reconcilable with the monetary approach with
its emphasis on the quick arbitrage of prices,than with the PPP theory, which from
its beginnings in Cassel's writings made allowances for various short or long run

factors that could cause a divergence from the PPP relationship. For example, the
large differences observed since 1970 would appear to constitute strong evidence
against

the quick adjustment hypothesis of the monetary approach, but could

be explained away by PPP theorists on grounds of an unsatisfactory base year,
brevity of the period, or real changes in one or another of the countries.
*
We

have encountered comments by several authorities on the size of deviations from
the PPP relationship that may be worth mentioning: H. Houthakker is reported
recently to have offered the view that a deviation of 10 percent, as an example,
told little about the probable movement of exchange rates, implying that larger
ones would. (Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 3: 1975, p. 552). Officer
cites Haberler as expressing doubt that an equilibrium rate would differ by more
than 15 to 20 percent from PPP "under normal circumstances" and H.G. Johnson as
expressing the view that "...the exchange rates of the major countries do not
depart very far (typically less than 20 percent) from purchasing power parity."
(Op. cit., pp. 25 and 26).

In

terms of GNP deflators (available in the June 1976 issue of International
Financial Statistics) the PPP relationship for Germany was as follows for each
year taken relative to 1970:

It seems that this relationship

hould not provide any basic difficulties for the monetary approach though the idea
hat nontradables are brought into alignment in the long run would have to be given
ip in favor of the concept of a changing norm for nontraded/traded goods prices in

Lifferent countries. It would, however, be more difficult to incorporate this

elationship

**

in the PPP theory.

uring the period 1950-70, appreciations tended to be followed by relative price level
ncreases and depreciations, with less uniformity, by relative price level decreases.

If price levels can differ and can also change in different directions, what
ole do changes in the balance of payments situation play in influencing the degree

nd direction of price level movements? A firm answer to this question would require
careful study of each country first to identify periods of deficit and surplus and
econdly to measure relative price level movements before, during and after the dis-

quilibrium period. Account would have to be taken of policies pursued at home and
broad that might tend to obscure the impact of the disequilibrium on the behavior
f prices, particularly the effects of domestic monetary and fiscal policies and of
he balance of payments position and price level changes of the country's main trading
artners.

If the main explanation for differences in price levels resides in differences in
per capita income, then the countries in Table 2 that went the farthest in diminish—
ing their income gap vis a vis the U.S. should also have experienced the greatest
reduction in the price difference. There is some evidence in support of this when
the changes in own-weighted price indexes (column 12 minus column 10) are plotted
against changes in the U.S.—weighted real income indexes; the relationship is less
clear cut in the scatter diagram involving U.S.-weighted price indexes and own—
weighted income indexes.
This is the judgment given by Officer although no one can say for sure where the
line should be drawn between additional variables that may legitimately be added
to PPP to explain exchange rates and those that so alter the character of the
relationship that it should no longer be regarded as a PPP theory. See Officer,
o. cit., pp. 3-4 and 22.

We

do not attempt such careful country studies here, but merely examine the

behavior of prices in the cases of appreciations or depreciations by industrial
*
countries. A change in the exchange rate during the period 1950-70 may be taken

as prima facie evidence of the prior existence of a disequilibrium. Was there, in
view of the widely different circumstances and of the different policies followed
after the exchange rate change,

any reasonably

consistent outcome with respect to

relative price levels?
Of course,, at the moment of depreciation the entire price level will appear to
the rest of the -world to be lower than it was before by the amount of the deprecia-

and the opposite is the case in an appreciation.

The issue is how long this

shift,in relative price levels lasts in the world as it actually works. If all
prices, tradables and nontradables, adjust very quickly to the world price level,
then the impact of depreciations and appreciations on relative price levels can

only be very brief. Tradable goods can be expected to rise in terms of local

*If one were looking at adjustments with exchange rates that remain fixed,
price movements right be compared for countries with a
great diversity of balance of payments experience over a long period of time.
among the countries of Table 2, Germany and the U.K. are in this respect at
opposite extremes, the former with persistent surpluses during the period 1950-70
and the latter with constantly recurring deficits. The data in Table 2 (columns
13 and 14) do show that the German price level rose substantially more than the U.K.
price level, both taken after adjustment for exchange rate changes (i.e., in dollar
terms). -Indeed Germany and the Netherlands, which like Germany found it necessary
to appreciate during the period, had larger price rises than any other country in
the table.
These data do not, however, lend consistent support to the hypothesis that relative
price levels tend to rise with persistent surpluses and to fall with persistent
deficits. For one thing, they are not unequivocal in showing that U.K. prices rose
less than those of Belgium and Italy which had favorable balance of payments historic
What is worse is that when subperiods are examined (see Table 4), U.K. prices are
seen to have risen more in the 1950's (though not in the 1960's) than those of
Germany (and also of the Netherlands) despite the difference in balance of payments
tendencies.

currency more readily than nontradables; they will, perhaps sooner rather than
later, conform to their world price levels or at least adjust towards those levels.

However, to the extent that nontradable goods remain unchanged in price or adjust
only partially, the average price level of a depreciating country will be reduced
and that of an appreciating country will be increased (from the viewpoint of the

outside world after taking account of the exchange rate change). Whatever these
basic tendencies toward price adjustments are, price movements up or down may be
abetted or hindered by monetary and fiscal policies followed after the exchange
rate changes; these may be in a direction that reinforces the exchange rate change
or they may be in the opposite direction.
Account must be taken, also of the price changes that preceeded the exchange rate
change

and presumably

played a part in bringing it about. The elasticity writers

would ordinarily expect to observe a rise in relative price levels immediately preceeding exchange rate depreciations and a fall in relative price levels immediately

preceeding exchange rate appreciation.

*

These prior changes would be expected par-

ticularly in the prices of tradables.

In order to examine these questions, we have set out in Table 7

all

the cases in

which changes of 3 percent or more in annual average exchange rates that occurred for
the industrialized countries during the period 1950—70 and for which implicit deflators
could also be obtained from the tJ.N. Yearbook of National Account Statistics.

Annual rates of change both j local currency prices (Part B) and in exchangerate-adjusted prices (Part A) are shown for four periods:

the ensuing 3 years, and (d) the period of change plus the ensuing 5 years. The price
indexes are taken relative to "world" price indexes; the latter are calculated from
the prices of 16 industrial countries using as weights the relative importance of their

currencies

in the initial composition of IMP Special Drawing Rights (SDR's).

*

Turning first to the years preceeding appreciations, the data in local currency
(Part B, column 3) do not show any strong or consistent tendency for prices to decline

relative to the world average prior to appreciations and to rise prior to depreciation
Either shifts in relative price levels were not involved in the development of these
balance of payments disequilibrjums or we should focus on some subset of prices, such

as tradable goods. We return to the last point in the following section dealing with
sectoral prices.

Our main concern is in any case with the change in the GDP price level for the

period of change and its sequels. For this purpose, we concentrate on the exchange—
rate-adjusted price movements relative to the world (Part A).

In four of the five appreciations where we have data on prices 3 and 5 years
after the period of exchange rate change, the price level was higher relative to the
world than at the initial year shown in the table (columns 5 and 6).

Notes to Table 7

Part A
Col. 1: All periods were included in which there was a change in the average
annual exchange rate of at least 3 percent from one year to the next.
Once a change this large was identified, years on either side were
included in the period of change if the year-to-year changes were in
the same direction and at least 1 percent.
Col. 2: Exchange rates are annual average of daily dollar prices from IMP converted
to an index of foreign currency units per dollar. Percent change is
computed from the formula (I/I)-l, where 10 is the index at the beginning of the period and I is the index at the end of the period.
Col. 3 -

6:

(11/10), where I is an index of the GDP implicit deflator of the
given country, divided by its exchange rate index referred to in note
to col. 2, relative to a SDR (Special Drawing Rights)-weighted average
of exchange-rate-adjusted GD? implicit deflators of 16 industrial countries,
and the subscripts 0 and 1 refer to the initialand terminal years.

Col. 7 - 10:

As in col. 3 - 6, except that given country wholesale price indexes

The data on the 5 depreciations in Part A show a tendency for relative
price levels in terms of implicit deflators to be lower 3 and 5 years after the ex-

change rate change than before. In only one case —— Denmark after 5 years -- was
the relative price level-measured in this way higher than before, and in this instance
the reason was an exchange rate appreciation (see coluxnn 14).

These findings are very different from the expectations of a simple monetary
model which would call for changes in local currency prices (Part B) exactly of f-

stting exchange rate changes arid for no changes in relative price levels in dollar

terms (i.e., columns 3 to 10 in Part A should have entries of 1.00). Again we see --

here in the context of exchange rate changes --

that

relative price levels can and some-

times do shift by substantial amounts that are not quickly arbitraged away. The directi
of these shifts over short periods

in the incidents we have examined tends to be

consistent with the direction that the reasoning of the standard model would lead us
to expect from the exchange rate changes, but we have not established any causal con-

nection. It seems unlikely, for example, that the 15 percent increase in the Dutch
implicit deflator (in dollars) relative to the appreciation of approximately 4 percent could have been due in large

part

to the exchange rate change.

— 49-.

The Behavior of Prices in Different Sectors
We are concerned in this section with the price levels and price movements of
tradables relative to nontradables,and within tradables of exports relative to im-

ports. Almost all of the theories of the adjustment mechanism provide for shifts
in the tradable/nontradable price ratio, but the elasticity approach is more hos-

pitable to changes in the commodity terms of trade (export prices relative to import

prices) than the monetary approach. The differences between export and domestic
prices of the same goods, almost universally ignored, will be treated in the next
section dealing with the behavior of prices for individual kinds of commodities.

We start with price level comparisons for nontradables and tradables, and then
move on to changes in prices for these two categories and in the terms of trade.
Price level differences for nontrada.bles are larger than for GD? as a whole.

The main explanation for the association between price levels and per capita
*

incomes summarized in equation 1, it has been suggested ,

lies

in the differential

impact of high wages in high income (high productivity) countries upon the prices of

commodities and the prices of services. The tradability of commodities tends to produce international product price equalization; differences in productivity between

high and low income countries will simply lead to wage differences. For services,
however, productivity differentials tend to be smaller and the high wages of the
high productivity countries lead to higher prices for the purchasers; unlike the
commodity sector, there is little or no trade in services and country to country
differences in service prices are thus possible.
If this explanation is valid we should expect to find that the price levels

for the nontradable components of final expenditures on GD? should vary according
to real GDP per capita while prices for the tradable components should be alike.
*

nd

Usher, o. cit.
The recent currency of this idea is attributable to Balassa, op. cit. ,See also
P. Samuelson, "Theoretical Notes on Trade Problems," Review of Economics and
Statistics, Vol. 46, May l964 pp. 145-154. However, Viner's interpretation of

argument. Viner,

The expectations about the nontradables are met by the data for the 10 countries
listed in Table 1. When the sex-vice components of final expenditures (including such
things as barber shops and beauty parlors, governmental services and health services)

are

combined with construction to form a nontraded goods component,

*

price levels

(using U.S. weights) range from 17 percent in India to 100 percent in the U.S. with
the next highest price level being found in Germany at 74 percent. It is true also
that the price levels for nontraded goods are positively correlated with GDP per
**

capita:

where the data are drawn from Table 1 (columns 8 and 5).
Price levels for tradables seem also to vary though not so widely.
The expectations with respect to tradables are not however met. For the total
goods components, consisting of consumers commodities and producers durable goods,
the range of price indexes runs from 74 percent for Irdia to 114 percent

for Germany. The dispersion of the price levels is clearly smaller than irithe case
of the nontradables. Not only are traded goods prices in the other countries closer
to American prices of the same goods as compared to nontraded goods, but also the

dispersion of the price indexes among the 9 countries other than the U.S. is smaller
for the traded goods than for nontraded goods.

Nevertheless, the differences are

not trivial even among the industrial countries; traded goods prices are around 20

percent higher in Germany than in Japan and theU.K..

There is some unavoidable arbitrariness in classifying all final expenditures into
one or the other of these two classes of goods. Electricity, for example, has been
treated as a traded good in the data in Table 1. Also, some service categories have
cost structures that are 100 percent labor costs (domestic services) while others
have important commodity components (public transportation).

For

own-weighted indexes, the coefficient of real GDP per capita is 0.484 nd

is .83.

—51—

Furthermore, even the tradable price levels tend to be correlated positively
with per capita income:

The slope is,however, smaller than for nontradables.*
Thus, not only do price levels differ substantially when the whole aggregate of
goods entering into GDP is taken into account but the level of prices for the kinds
of goods that can enter international trade is also subject to a substantial variation.

Part of the reason may be that the prices we are comparing, prices to domestic final

purchasers, contain some local service elements even for tradable goods. For example,
wheat shipped to India and to Germany at identical prices from the U.S. would
probably cost the German consumer more than his Indian counterpart simply because
internal costs of distribution and transportation are higher in Germany; at least,

that would be the case if German wages were higher than Indian wages in a proportion
greater than the extent to which German productivity in distribution and transportation

exceeds Indian productivity. It is doubtful,howeve, that all the difference can
be explained in this way; German prices for traded goods were more than 50 percent

higher than Indian prices. It seems likely that some of the difference is caused
also by the local production of tradable goods at lower costs in India than in

Germany. There is also the possibility that wheat shipped to India may be invoiced
at a lower fob price than wheat shipped to Germany. This is clearly the case for
concessional wheat sales. Are there other commodities for which price discriminating

to machinery prices, has been that the opposite is usually the case —- that is, that

they are charged higher prices than the industrial countries.
another possible explanation nay be that many of the final product expenditure
categories we have included with

example, nay in some or most countries have a very small traded content. At

for

least some monetary theorists would, however, expect arbitrage or the possibility

of arbitrage to equalize prices in these cases (after allowance for transport costs).
We accept the indication of equation 3 that even tradables
tend to be more expensive in higher income countries, a view that will be bolstered
by evidence in the

"Services" include the whole of GDP except the commodity producing sectors
-agriculture, mining, construction and manufacturing.

—54—

Whatever the reasons, the secular tendency for the nontradables/tradables price

ratio to rise is evident in Table 8 for all five of the advanced countries for whih
we have been able to get some indication of this relationship over time.

There is some evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the nontradables/tradables
price ratio rises as a result of an appreciation and falls as a result of a
-

depreciation.

As one means

of

examining the behavior of this ratio in connection with the

balance of payments, we may turn back to Table 7 where we included wholesale price

indexes with this purpose in mind. Since wholesale price indexes are more narrowly
focussed on tradable goods than the GDP deflators, we should be able to infer the
behavior of the nontradables/tradables price ratio from the relative movements of
the GDP deflators and the wholesale price indexes.

After the appreciations, therise in the implicit deflators is larger in 4 out of
5 cases than the rise in the wholesale price indexes (compare in Part A columns

4 and 8, 5 and 9, and 6 and 10). The implication is that the nontradable-tradable
ratio rose, but since movements in this direction may be presumed to be the trend

we cannot be sure that it was the appreciation that produced this result. In a few
cases, the differences are large enough and the period brief enough (in the 1950-52
Canadian appreciation, for example) to hazard the inference that the appreciation was
resronsible but in other cases the difference was only a few percentage points and
such a view is not warranted.

After the depreciations the decline in the implicit deflators is greater, again

in 4 out of 5 cases, than the decline in the wholesale prices. In these instances the nontradables/tradables price ratio fell despite its underlying upward
trend.

The data thus give a substantial measure of support to the expectations of
relative price changes following depreciations, and appear to be consistent with

—55--

expectations about price changes following appreciations. Conformance in this
case may be more safely attributable to the exchange rate changes themselves
than in the case of the movements of the overall price levels considered in the
earlier discussion of Table 7.

Another approach to the examination of the effect of exchange rate changes
on the nontradable/tradable price ratio is to concentrate on the period 1970-73,

when there were large changes in exchange rates. It is not implausible to believe
that within so short a period the effects of these exchange rate changes upon

price structure dominated the effects of different growth rates. When eight
countries for which sector implicit deflators were readily available are arrayed

as in Table 9 in order of diminishing appreciation of their currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar, there is a clear tendency for the relative prices of services
(nontradables) to rise the most in countries that appreciated most. The table
uses implicit deflators for various sectors to form two frteasures of service/

nonservice (nontradable/tradable) prices: (a) the ratio of the deflator for community services (i.e., health, education, etc. but not trade or public administration) to the deflator for manufacturing (column 6); and (b) the ratio of the
deflator for all services (i.e., noncottunodity sectors) to the deflator for the

commodity producing sectors (column 9).

*

Germany and Belgium, with the largest

appreciations, had the largest increases in relative prices of services (non—

tradables) by either measure. On the other hand, the relative price movements
in the other 6 countries do not fall so neatly in line.

The terms of trade of Germany, the ratio of the export price index to the
import price index, are shown for the period 1960—73 in Table 10.

The major move-

ments of the terms of trade were associated with the 1960—62 appreciation and with

the continuous appreciation of the mark beginning in 1969. In both episodes the
terms of trade increase, as anticipated by the standard theory. The fall in the
terms of trade in 1973 when the exchange rate appreciated further, which was
untoward, may reflect the rise in oil prices.

The Behavior of Tradable Goods Prices

It is almost always assumed that whatever may be true about the prices of
home goods, the prices for internationally traded commodities must be identical

in different markets. We have already shown that in fact the prices of tradables
vaiy substantially in countries with different per capita incomes. Here we
investigate the application of the law of one price to exports originating in
different countries of comparable stages of development and to goods originating
in a single country but sold both at home and abroad.

There are reasons for believing that there may be substantial deviations from the
law of one price even for traded goods.

For the prices of internationally traded goods to be identical in different
markets

transport costs must be zero or egual for each given product from all

origins to each destination, or each traded good must have only one source of
supply.

If these conditions are not met, there must be some differences in prices

of internationally traded goods either at each destination for goods with different
origins or at the various points of origin for goods with a single destination.

Some materials in this section have been taken from 'Export Prices and Exchange
Rates," a paper prepared for the U.S. Department of State by Irving B. Kravis,
Robert E. Lipsey and Eliot Kalter.

There are, however, more weighty
expecting

reasons ——

both

static and dynamic ——

for

departures from the law of one price. A static circumstance

giving rise to price discrimination between destinations is that in at least some
sectors there are oligopolistic firms facing different elasticities of demand at
home and

to

in

each foreign market; profit maximizing behavior would lead such firms

charge lower prices in the markets characterized by more elastic demand. The

possibility of price differences among different exporters from the same or different countries is abetted by the existence of product differentiation both in
terms of physical characteristics relating to appearance and performance, and in
terms

of various service elements such as before-and after-sale advice and service,

credit

terms and speed of delivery.

*

Oligopoly strategies aimed at maintaining

a certain price position relative to rivals may produce price discrimination when
the

constellation of rivals differs from market to market or when the exchange

rates of different destination countries move differently with respect to the

oligopolist's hone currency. Such behavior would be warranted if the oligopolist
regards

his long run

in a market as being
profit

utaximizatior/jeopardied by a loss of market share

(a form of capital).
In addition, dynamic factors associated with changes in comparative advantage
and changing market

shares make it possible for one source of supply to be selling

at lower prices over protracted periods of time. Selling at a low price is, after
all, the traditional way of breaking into a market and expanding market shares.
Shifts

in trade shares in individual product classes and broad groups of products are

continually occurring. In the decade of the 1960s, for example, the share of Japan
in "world" manufactured exports rose by more than

70

percent while that of the U.(.

dropped by more than a fourth and that of the U.S. by more than a tenth.

If

shifts are prolonged and frequent, disequilibrium situations in which

markets have not fully adjusted to changes in comparative advantage may be the norm
rather than the exception. The files of the U.S. International Trade Cormnission

claims that foreign sellers are undercutting domestic producers in home markets,
arid

such

claims are not infrequently accompanied by expanding foreign shares in

domestic markets.

Lack of knowledge, uncertainty regarding the reliability of new suppliers,
the reluctance to give up a satisfactory relationship with customary suppliers
and commitments to a given type of equipment because of previous purchases or

stocks of spare parts may all explain the failureof buyers to respond immediately
to price differences. They may explain too why it may be necessary for price differences of a substantial and/or prolonged character to exist if sellers hope to
overcome the inertia of buyers in patronizing customary sources.

There are, therefore, reasons for believing that there will be notable
depar.tures from the uniformity of prices and also, since the causal conditions

alter through time, in the uniformity of price changes. The evidence on this
point is far from voluminous, but it tends to emerge from almost any careful set
of international price comparisons.

Prices may differ substantially for comntetitive products exr'orted by different
countries.

are increased by the inclusion in some price comparisons of offer prices—— that
is, the lowest prices offered by each country other than the one actually making
the sale. These prices do not represent actual transaction prices. While we
think they do belong in measures of international price competitiveness, we would
exclude them for present purposes if we could. Such offer price data were most
important in the electrical machinery category where such heavy equipment is
customarily sold through bidding arrangements; they played but a small role in
the price measurements for iron and steel.

less over the entire period covered by the study, 1953—64. The period was one
in which the U.S. share in the iron and steel exports of the 21 OECD countries
declined from 19 percent to 10 percent and that of the U.K. from 14 percent to

9 percent, while the German share rose from 12 to 18 percent and the Japanese

price

differences persisted while th low price sellers gradually expanded

their

market shares and the high priced sellers saw their shares contract.
The time to time movement of export prices of comparable goods from different
countries sometimes differs substantially.
*

The dearth of data on export prices is slowly being
remedied, but long series
of comparable export prices for two or more countries are still rare. Using a
combination of data reoorted upon in our earlier work (1971) and official German
and U.S. export price data, we are now able to compare German and U.S. export

prices for machinery and equipment (SITC 7) over the period 1954—75 (see Table 12).
From 1954 to 1969, when the D.M./dollar exchange rate was relatively stable
(varying

within a 7

percent range), the annual ratios of German to U.S. export

prices, both taken in dollar terms, varied
in 1969, however, the mark

began to

within

a 10 percent range. Beginning

appreciate, and most of its rise was passed

through to German dollar export prices. The German/U.S. export price ratio was
45.5 percent higher in 1975 than in 1969; the German export price in DM increased
by 44.3 percent and the $/DM rate by 59.7 percent compared to a rise in U.S. export

prices of 58.4 percent. As this implies, there is very little similarity between
the changes in German and U.S. export prices when both are expressed in dollars.

No one should be misled about the abundance of export price indexes by the rather
irresponsible tendency of international agencies to collect unit value indexes from
different countries and to publish them under the heading of "price" indexes. The
IT has done this for years in its International Financial Statistics (see, for example, pages 32-33 of the September 1975 issue). After representation by one of the
present authors, the relevant table in a recent issue (January 1977, pages 34-35)
uses the term "unit values" parenthetically once in a two page spread where the term
"prices" appears twice in major titles and 6 times in chart titles. A note at the
back of the issue (page 404) explains that virtually none of the series for the more
than 80 countries included is an export price or an import price series.

Notes to Table 12
Cols. 1 and 2: Indexes are aggregations from individual cotmnodity export and
domestic price series. The individual price series are first put in
the form P/P1 and then combined without weighting into indexes for

SITC 4—digit subgroups. These 4—digit indexes are then weighted by
1963 German exports for aggregation to higher levels. The discontinuity
in the export price index at the time of the shift to the value—added

tax was treated by assuming no change in price during the month of the

shift in the tax system. The extrapolations to 1975

series

ranges from 8 in 1953 to 22.in 1975 and only those domestic
price series falling within the groups covered by the export price
series are included in the domestic price index. We are indebted to
Eliot Kalter for the selection and matching of export and domestic
price data.
In calculating the 3—digit export and domestic price indexes, each
4—digit subgroup was given its weight in U.S. exports in 1963. Each
3—digit group was given its weight in U.S. exports in aggregating to
2—digit classes except when the coverage of 4—digit subgroups was less
than 40 per cent of the value of exports in the 3—digit group, in which
case only the weight of the covered 4—digit subgroups was used. The
same procedure was followed in aggregating from the 2—digit to the
1—digit level (SITC 7 as a whole).
Two 4—digit export price indexes available in the original sources
were omitted in this calculation, and the corresponding domestic price
series were therefore also dropped. One was the BLS series for SITC
729.3 and the other was the NBER series for 722.1. In the case of
SITC 729.3 the BLS export price index is dominated by semiconductors
while the wholesale price index is heavily weighted with television
tubes. Therefore the two were considered to be not comparable. In
the case of SITC 722.1, from 1953 to 1964, the NBER "international
price index" is constructed from domestic transactions prices while the
BLS domestic price index is apparently based on list prices, which
differed greatly (see Kravis and Lipsey, Price Conmetitiveness,
pp. 408—421). Thus the relationship between them is mainly that of
transactions prices to list prices rather than of export to domestic
prices.

Each German export price index in dollars at the 4—digit level is
divided by the corresponding U.S. export price index and the
resulting
relative price indexes are aggregated up to 3—digit, 2—digit, and
1—digit levels using as weights total OECD exports in 1963.

In

Table 13 the results of a comparison for 9 detailed (4—digit SITC)

component categories of SITC are presented. Because the categories for which
export price series are published in the official German and U.S. sources are
not always the same, these were the only components for which we were able to
match German and U.S. export price series quite closely over long periods

(10 to 21 years). The correlations between percentage changes in German and
U.S. export prices are low, and in only three subgroups (tractors, heating and
cooling equipment, and powered tools) is the slope coeffidient significant at

the 5% level or better. The ratio of the index of German export prices to the
index of U.S. export prices drifted far from 100 (see columns 3—6).

The differences in prices in dollar terms, relative to 1970, were large in
the period preceding 1970 (see columns 8 and 9) but they became even larger

subsequently when the mark began to appreciate sharply. In 1974, German export
prices for the 9 categories ranged from 21 to 58 percent higher relative to

U.S. export prices than they had been in 1970. If this was an effect of the DM

appreciation,

it was not a fleeting one. Most of the 41 percent increase in

the dollar price of the mark that occurred between 1970 and 1974 had taken place
by 1973; between .1973

and 1974, the increase was only 2 percent.

A question that arises for these and other comparisons of different price
series concerns the extent to which two series differ because (a) the prices of
identical products moved differently in different origins (or destinations) or

of different sets of goods.

Recent work at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

throws some light on this question. Suomela and Perez-Lopex of the BLS staff drew
upon the export price series for individual commodities to match
the commodity composition of a selected number of categories for which German

export

*

price series were available.

By weighting the U.S. individual series with

the German export weights, they produced more closely matching U.S. and German

export price series than previously available. Their results, presented as annual
indexes of price competitiveness by taking the ratio of the German to the U.S.
**
series, are reproduced in Table 14. Since the German and U.S. domestic price
movements for machinery generally (SITC 7) were very similar (see columns 1 and
5 of Table 12, the exchange rate changes are once again seen to dominate the large
shifts in relative German/U.S. export prices.)

John W. Suomela and Jorge F. Perez—Lopez, "Measuring Changes in U.S. Price
Competitiveness," presented at the Atlantic Economic Conference, Washington,
D.C., September 12—13, 1975 (processed). U.S. series were apparently selected
to represent each "subcategory" included in the category. The subcategories
were defined in terms of 7—digit U.S. Schedule B or 6—digit Brussels Tariff
Nomenclature (BTN) classes. The categories thentselves are approximately 4—
digit BTN classes.
**
is reassuring to note that Suomela and Perez—Lopez, who based these relative
changes on especially matched U.S. and German price series, obtain results
which compare closely to the relative price changes based on the less perfectly
matched published series. This is the case, at least, for the three categories
(out of the six they used) for which we canfind roughly comparable published
German and US, series:

The results from these closely matched price series confirm our earlier
findings that substantial relative price changes can and sometimes do occur.

From 1964 to 1967 relatively small differences are found in the index of price
competitiveness but between 1967 and 1968 half of the series reveal shifts of 5
percent or more and beginning in 1969, when exchange rates began to change sub-

stantially, year to year changes are common. Furthermore, the relative price
changes did not cancel out over time. From 1964 through 1969 they ranged up to
7.6 percent and all but one were over 2 percent.

When exchange rates were moving rapidly, between 1969 and 1973, the relative
price movements were far greater, up to 29 percent in a year and cuiiulatin to
over 60 percent in most cases.

"p

—69—

In the period .of stable exchange rates, prior to- 1970, the largest divergences

from unity in the indexes of-price competitivenesswere 6 or 7 percent. For example,

machinery

export prices rose by 7 percent relative to those of the U.S.).

Of course, it is still possible that the individual product varieties differ
between German and U.S. exports even after the improved matching by Suornela and

Perez—Lopez. Our own view is that the comparisons are be€ween like products
which are in competition with one another but that for reasons given earlier
market arbitrage does not necessarily operate to prevent very

substantial

dif-

ferences in export price movements between major competing countries. However,
as we argued in an earlier section, any claim that substitutability between the
exports of the advanced countries is high can hardly be maintained without ex-

pecting that it will be high within such narrow product groups as are found in

the previous text table. Whether the series we have cited are regarded as comparing German and U.S. export prices for identical or for different products,
they constitute strong evidence against the price assumptions of the monetary

approach.

*

Attention

may be called to an effort to compare export trends for all coimnodities
which is not treated in the text because U.S. export prices had to be supplemented
by wholesale price data. The quarterly indexes in the original source have been
averaged to produce the following annual indexes of price competitiveness (ratios
of export price indexes):

The data do not support the proposition that the price movements of different
countries, especially of major competitors, must be the same. German competitiveness fell with respect to both the U.S. and Japan, by 12 percent in 1975 compared
with 1970 in the first case and 17 percent in the second:

The information obtained from these and other sellers and buyers, including some from
abroad, suggested that price differentiation between various markets was more

Japanese exporters.

More systematic evidence about the existence of price discrimination for
traded goods may be obtained by comparing the German and U.S. export price series
with their corresponding wholesale price series.
For machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7) as a whole we may compare the
German and U.S. export indexes set out earlier (Table 12) with domestic (wholesale)
price indexes constructed by combining the individual wholesale price series to an

aggregate index with the aid of each country's export weights. Thus the effect of

for selling insulating fiber glass in Germany at a price 40 percent higher than
that charged in the Benelux countries and another firm for maintaining music record

fruit company was selling bananas in rich Common Market countries at twice the price

different goods composition in exports and in domestic sales has been sharply
reduced, and the remaining (within 4-digit SITC category) room for compositional
differences is subject to our remarks in the previous section about the implications
of the existence or non—existence of substitutability of different bundles of goods
falling within a. detailed (4—digit) category.

that the constant terra be insignificantly different from zero. However, the

slope coefficients in the U.S. equations are significantly different from one
(at the 5% level) and the same is true for Germany when export prices are taken
as the dependent variable though not in the opposite case.

It is in any case questionable whether reliance should be placed on a

statistical test. The differences may not be large enough to be picked up by
a statistical test yet be economically important. Although variations of less
than 10 percent in the export/domestic price ratio over a 20 year period may
appear to be quite modest, when account is taken of profit/sales ratios ——

which for U.S. corporations producing SITC 7 products were around 4 percent
i 1970 —— such swings imply large shifts in the profitability of exports and
domestic sales. As we have pointed out elsewhere, both U.S. and German data
provide evidence of associated changes in exports relative to domestic shipments
(Kravis and Lipsey, 1977).

At a less aggregated leve], evidence about the existence of price discrimination between domestic arid export sales of traded goods may be obtained from corn-

parisons

*

between export and domestic price series

an earlier paper in which

we compared changes in export prices for four countries (Germany, Japan, U.K.
and U.S.) with those in domestic prices over the one- and four—year spans calculated

in the Price Competitiveness book. It was found that in more than two-thirds of the
cases the difference between export and domestic price changes was 4½ percentage

points ox more, far from identical changes. The correlation between the two price
movements was also fairly low —— below .50 —— and it was low for each of the four
countries, each time period, and each SITC division included.

For the U.S., we can now report on the results of a very detailed matching
of annual export and domestic price data for the period 1968-76 carried out in

the Bureau of Labor Statistics by Eliot Kalter. Sixteen 4- and 5-digit SITC
categories were included; all were within the SITC machinery divisions, 12 of
them in machinery other than electri (SITC 71) and the other 4 in electrical

machinery (SITC 72). The basic materials consisted of wholesale price series at
the 8-digit level in the classification used for the wholesale price index and of

unpublished export price series for 7-digit Schedule B categories. Within each 4digit category a wholesale price index was calculated as an unweighted average of
the 8-digit series assigned to that classification and an
export price index was correspondingly computed as an unweighted

average of the indexes of the 7-digit categories that fell within the scope of the

4-digit

*

group.

The index numbers were expressed as year to year price relatives (the index
for a given year being divided by the index for the previous year) and it was in
this form, yielding eight observations, that the export price series and wholesale
price series for each of 16 4— or 5-digit SITC categories were correlated.

The coefficients of determination do not suggest identity between domestic

and export price changes: 12 of the 16 are .75 or below.

(See Table 15.) The

ratio of the export price index to the wholesale price index strayed over a
20 percent range or greater during the nine year period in over half the cate-

gories. Variations greater than 30 percent were found in many cases and the lowest
range was 7 percent.

Kalter's careful matching of U.S. wholesale and export price series on a

detailed basis covers only a relatively short span of years. A less perfect set
f 10 matches, 9 of them among those studied by Kalter, extends over periods of 17

Only 8—digit wholesale price series and 7-digit export price series which could
be matched were included; wholesale price series for which matching export price
series were unavailable were excluded even though the series belonged within the
4- or 5-digit category and the same restriction was imposed on the export price
series. This requirement produces more comparable wholesale arid export price indexes
at the 4- and 5-digit level even though the measure of the movement of each type
of price is probably less reliable than that which would be produced by the inclusion of all of each type of series in the derivation of the 4— or 5—digit
averages regardless of the ability to match. Kalter also tried restricting the
4- and 5—digit price indexes to those 8—digit wholesale price categories and 7—
digit export price categories for which data were available in every year during
the period 1967—76. This eliminated a large number of the 8—digit wholesale price
series and of the 7-digit export price series and thus tended to produce erratic
results sometimes based on only one matched series, whereas there were usually
from 5 to 12 series if series were included even if they were not available for
every single year.

to 22 years ending in 1974. They are based on NBER indexes up to 1964 and on published BLS indexes for the subsequent years.

The results, presented in Table 16, are broadly consistent with the findings

based on the more detailed matchings. We would expect these data to show a weaker
relationship between wholesale and export prices both because the matchings are
crude and because they extend far past the period of sharp inflation when the

strong upward movements of most prices tended to increase the correlations. Contrary to our expectations, they show a stronger relationship and somewhat smaller
deviations of one from the other for the indexes that cover the post—1970 period:

The data that cover only the earlier period of more stable prices and exchange rates

show smaller deviations but also a much weaker relationship between the two. Thus,
whatever the period and no matter how carefully the export price series are matched
with the domestic price series, as far as we can go in that direction, export prices
and domestic prices do not generally reveal identical movements; although they
resemble each other, there are sometimes large discrepancies in year—to—year changes.

Furthermore, moving toward refinement of the comparisons does not appear to reduce
the discrepancies between the two types of prices.

For the matching of German export and domestic price series for 4-digit SITC

categories, we had to rely on published export and wholesale price data. The 69
matches, which cover the whole range of manufactures, are too numerous to present

in detail and we merely summarize their behavior in Table 17. About 40 of the
series begin in the mid 1950's and the others in the early 1960's; the terminal
year is usually 1974 but in about a third of the cases it is a year or two earlier.

Summary of Comparisons of German Export and Domestic Prices

Table 17

0\

-.4

— 77

—

The correlations of year—to—year percentage changes in extort and domestic
prices were not often high. In only four of the matches was r2 over .75 and in
well over half of the comparisons it was under .50. The three columns on the
right of Table 17 show that the ratio of the wholesale to the export price index

often varied substantially. As previously noted, even a high correlation does
not preclude what may be economically significant variations between the two

indexes. For example, for worked copper and its alloys (SITC 682.2), which had
the highest r2 (.91), the ratio of the export to the domestic price index deviated
from 1.00 by as much as 24 percent in the thirteen year period for which the two
series could be matched.

If attention is confined to the period terminating in 1970, the case for
identical movements of German domestic and export prices is still weaker. In
the

49 categories for which

only

at least ten year—to—year price changes were available

6 x2s were as high as . 50.
Thus

it seems fairly clear from the data presented in this section that for

Germany, as for the United States, export

price

movements can and do differ sub-

stantially from domestic price movements for the same or similar commodities.

Summary and Conclusions

The

view of price

behavior that emerges from this survey does not

correspond

precisely to either of the two major paradigms about prices, the one set o.it by the
standard theory and the other by the monetary approach to the balance of payments.

Partly because the specifications for price behavior of the monetary approach
are more demanding, the

expectations

price

of

picture

we have painted is more at variance with the

that approach. Using a GDP framework for measurement, we find that

levels differ sLgnificantly among countries and even price level movements

for industrial countries sometimes differ substantially over both short (3 to 10

—78—

years) and long (20 years) periods of time. There also can be and sometimes are
substantial differences between the export prices of one country and those of others

for the same goods. Export prices for like goods from different countries often
change substantially relative to each other and for a given country ezport ar.d

domestic prices for the same kinds of goods differ and do not necessarily change
identically from year to year.

links are loose rather than

rigid.

Each theorist must decide how far to permit an impact of this real price
world on his model. It seems to us that, as far as commodities are concerned,
an adequate model has to take into account the leeway that each country ——

even

one that is highly integrated into the world economy — is given for independent
money and fiscal policies by the imperfections of markets and the complexlties
of

price behavior.
