PRICES AND EXCHANGE RATES

Introduction
The changing competitive position of the United States in international
trade is the net result of many influences operating on the internal prices of
the United States and its chief competitors and on the exchange rates between

their currencies and the currencies of other countries. Both monetary and real
factors, and both cyclical and secular influences affect the competitive position
of the country.

The present paper is intended to make a modest contributicn to an understanding of one small but important link in this complicated chain of interact-

ing factors. It is a link that has often been ignored because strong simplifying
assumptions have until very recently usually been made about it. We refer to the
relation of exchange rate changes, export prices, and domestic prices. During
the last few years a number of attempts have been made to examine the extent to

which exchange rate changes were "passed through"; that is, the extent to which
a given depreciation in the U.S. dollar, for example, resulted in a corresponding

decline in the price of U.S. exports in foreign currencies. ** However, the pos-

sibility that a change in the exchange rate might also alter the relationship between the export price

and the domestic price of a given product, expressed in

the same currency, has been almost completely ignored. The assumption made,

implicitly

by most past writers in the theory of international trade and more

recently explicitly by advocates of the monetary approach to the balance of
payments, has been that the "law of one price" applies to shipments destined
for home markets and for foreign markets.

Reasons

for Deviations from the

Law of One Price

For the prices of internationally traded goods to be identical in different
markets, transport Costs must be zero or equal for each product for all origins to

each destination, or each traded good must have only one source of supply. If
these conditions are not met, there must be some differences in prices of inter-

nationally traded goods either at each destination for goods with different origins
or at the various points of origin for goods with a single destination.
There are, however, more weighty reasons -—

both

static and dynamic ——

for

expecting departures from the law of one price. A static circumstance giving rise
to price discrimination between destinations is that in at least some sectors there
are oligopolistic firms

destination countries move differently with respect to the oligopolist's home

currency. Such behavior would be warranted if the oligopolist regards his long
run profit iaximization in a market as being jeopardized by a loss of market
share (a form of capital).

In addition, dynamic factors associated with changes in competitive advan-

tae and changing market shares make it possible for one source of supply to be
selling at lower prices over protracted periods of time. Selling at a low price
is, after all, the traditional way of breaking into a market and expanding market

shares. Shifts in trade shares in individual product classes and broad groups of
products are continually occurring. In the decade of the l960s, for example, the

share of Japan in "world" manactured exports rose by more than 70 percent while
that of the U.K. dropped by more than a fourth and that of the U.S. by more than

a tenth.

*

If such shifts are prolonged and frequent, disequilibrium situations in

which markets have not fully adjusted to changes in comparative advantage may be

the norm rather than the exception. The files of the U.S. International Trade
Commission (formerly the Tariff Commission) and of like bodies in other countries
are full of claims that foreign sellers are undercutting domestic producers in home
markets, and such claims are not infrequently accompanied by expanding foreign
shares in domestic markets.
Lack of knowledge, uncertainty regarding the reliability of new suppliers.,

the reluctance to give up a satisfactory relationship with customary suppliers and
commitments to a given type of equipment because of previous purchases or stocks

The share comparisons are for the years 1960 and 1970; the "world" consists of
the 14 major industrial countries.. See.U.S. Department of Commerce,
national Economic Indicators and Ccmetitive Trends, June 1976, p. 57.

of spare parts may all explain the failure of buyers to respond immediately to

price differences. They may explain too why it may be necessary for price differences of a substantial and/or prolonged character to exist if sellers hope to
overcome the inertia of buyers in patronizing customary sources.

There are, therefore, reasons for believing that there will be notable departures from the uniformity of prices and also, since the causal conditions alter

through time, in the uniformity of price changes. The evidence on this point is
far from voluminous, but it tends to emerge from almost any careful set of international price comparisons.

Evidence of price differences for exports of different origin
Documentation of the existence of substantial differences in the export
prices of different countries may be found in an earlier National Bureau study
dealing with the international price competitiveness for manufactured metals and

metal products (Kravis and Lipsey, 1971). While some differences were found in
all 6 of the 2—digit SITC categories included in the study, the largest differences
**
were in .ron and steel (SITC Division 67).
Japanese prices averaged 30 percent

Relative prices of each iron and steel product in this comparison are weighted
by the importance of each product in 1963 exports of OECD countries. The country
composition of the OED has varied; the statistics in the source cited refer to
18 European countries and the U.S., Canada, and Japan.

less than those of the U.S., German prices 24 percent less and the U.K. prices 22

percent less. Table 1 shows frequency distributions of price differences from the
U.S. for individual 3— and 4—digit SITC categories falling within the iron and
steel (SITC 67), non-electrical machinery (SITC 71) and electrical machinery (SITC

72) divisions. For iron and steel, the individual differences, though clustered
around the

average

cited above, were as large as 43 percent for Japan in the case

of iron and steel wire (SITC 67) and 40 percent for Germany in the cases of bars
and

rods

(SITC 673.2) and tube

and pipe fittings (SITc 678.5). These differences

persisted more or less over the entire period covered by the study, 1953-64. The
period was one in which the U.S. share in the iron and steel exports of the 21

OECD countries declined from 19 percent to 10 percent and that of the U.K. from
14 percent to 9 percent, while the German share rose from 12 to 18 percent and
the Japanese share from 5 to 14 percerrt. Similar,

in shares were found in non—electrical machinery and

For this period, at least, notable and even substantial

price differences persisted while the low price sellers gradually expanded their
market shares and the high priced sellers saw their shares contract.

Table 2). From 1954 to 1969 when the D.M./dollar exchange rate was relatively
stable (varying within a 7 percent range) the annual ratios of German to U.S.

export prices, both taken in dollar terms, varied within a 10 percent range.
Beginning in 1969, however, the mark began to appreciate, and most of its rise

was passed through to German dollar export prices. The German/U.S. export price
ratio was 45.5 percent higher in 1975 than in 1969; the German export price in
DM increased by 44.3 percent and the $/DM rate by 59.7 percent compared to a rise

in U.S. export prices of 58.4 percent. As this implies, there is very little correlation between the changes in German and U.S. export prices when both are expressed in dollars.

Price discrimination
There is also persistent evidence that price discrimination by sellers to dif-

ferent markets is quite common in international trade. References to such discrimination are continually appearing in the business and financial press, and occas—

there is an official finding of discriminatory pricing.

For example, it was recently reported that the Common Market fined a glass producer for selling insulating fiber glass in Germany at a price 40 percent higher
than that charged in the Benelux countries and another firm for maintaining music
record prices in Germany 50 percent higher than in France. It was also reported
that a fruit comnany was selling bananas in rich Common Market countries at twice
the price charged in poorer ones. New York Times, 17 January 1976.

from abroad, suggested that price differentiation between various markets was
more widely practiced by European suppliers than by U.S. firms and still more by
Japanese exporters.

iore systematic evidence about the existence of price discrimination for
traded goods may be obtained by comparing the German and U.S. export price series

with their corresponding wholesale price series. The price series for machinery
and

transport

equipment (SITC 7) shown in Table 2 were constructed by combining

the individual wholesale price series to an aggregate index with the aid of each

country's export weights. Thus the effect of different goods composition in exports and in domestic sales has been sharply reduced. It is true that there is
still room, within the 4-digit SITC categories, for compositional differences, but
if markets were perfect 1substitutions in production and consumption could be ex—,

pected to keep the price movements of such closely related goods in close harmony.
Are the ranges of variation in the export/domestic price ratio -for the U.S. (column 8) and 8.5 percent for Germany (column 7) ——

6.4 percent

sufficiently

small so that we may judge export and domestic prices to move identically? One
way of answering this question that has often been followed is to regress one
price series against the other and to demand for a judgment in favor of identity
not only an r2 that is equal or close to one but also a constant term that is insignificantly different from zero and a slope coefficient that is insignificantly

different from one. The two sets of series do not pass these tests unequivocally.

is 0.95 and the r for the corresponding German pair is 0.80.

The latter

is significantly different from one at the 5 percent level. Both the U.S. and
German equations satisfy the condition that the constant term be insignificantly

different from zero. However, the slope coefficients in the U.S. equations are
significantly different from one (at the 5 percent level) and the same is true
for Germany when export prices are taken as the dependent variable though not in
the opposite case.

It is in any case questionable whether reliance should be placed on a stat-

istical test. The differences may not be large enough to be picked up by a
statistical test yet be economically important. Variations of less than
10 percent in the export/domestic price ratio over a 20 year period may appear to

be quite modest. Yet when account is taken of profit/sales ratios —- which for U.S.
corporations producing SITC 7 products were around 4 percent in 1970 —— such swings

imply large shifts in the profitability of exports and domestic sales. As we have
pointed out elsewhere, both U.S. and German data provide evidence of associated
changes in exports relative to domestic shipments (Kravis and Lipsey, 1977).

At a less aggregated level evidence about the existence of price discrimina—
tion between domestic and export sales of traded goods may be obtained from corn-

parisoris between export and domestic price series in an earlier paper in which
changes in export prices for four countries (Germany, Japan, U.K., and U.S.) were
compared with changes in domestic prices over the one- and four—year spans calculated

in the Price Competitiveness book. It was found that in more than two-thirds of
the cases the difference between export and domestic price changes was 4½ percent-

age points or more, far from identical changes. The correlation between the two
price movements was also fairly low —— below .50 —- and it was low for each of the
four countries, each time period, and each SITC division included.

For the U.S., we can draw on matched export and wholesale price indexes for
ten 4—digit SITC categories covering periods of 17 to 22 years ending in 1974.

They are based on NBER (Kravis and Lipsey) indexes up to 1964 and on published ELS

indexes for the subsecuent years. The index numbers were expressed as year to
year price relatives (the index for a given year being divided by the index for
the previous
each

of

year), and the

export price series and wholesale price series for

the ten 4-digit SITC categories were correlated in this form.

The results are shown in Table

3.

**

The coefficients of determination do not

suggest identity between domestic and export price changes: 12 of the 16 are .75
or below. The ratio of the export price index to the wholesale price index strayed
over a 20 percent range or greater during the nine year period in over half the

These results are confirmed by a more detailed matching carried out by Eliot
Kalter for a shorter span of years (1968—76). Kalter used published 8—digit
wholesale price index and unpublished export price series for 7-digit Schedule
B categories to make indexes for 4- and 5—digit SITC categories.

Theory of

price discrimination

The theory of the firm facing separated markets is well known.
Let us assume
for simplicity that there are only two such markets and that there is an upward

sloping long-run marginal cost curve. Assume further that the original (pre—$

—14—

devaluation) foreign demand curve (Dr') is more elastic than

the

domestic demand

curve (D0). The initial domestic price S P and the initial export price is
these prices correspond to the marginal revenue established by the intersection at

E of the marginal cost curve (LRMc) and the combined marginal revenue curve (T0).

amount of optimal price discrimination between the domestic and export market.
If we had assumed instead, that the foreign demand curve was less elastic
than the domestic demand curve, ceteris paribus, or if there had been an exchange
rate appreciation rather than an exchange rate depreciation, then the amount of
optimal price discrimination between the domestic and export market would have
increased.

Still another possibility is that the oligopolist (or any seller facing a
sloping demand curve) keeps his foreign currency prices in each market unchanged

in order to maintain his market share. This policy carried out in the face of
exchange rate changes would

of course produce discriminato-ry pricing or, if

in different markets were already different, it would produce changes in

the degree of discrimination.

results of the regressions are set out in Table 4. The coefficients of

the R terms tend to be negative and the sum of the three

coefficients is invariably negative. In all but agricultural machinery, the largest and most significant
negative coefficient is for R2. The sum of the R coefficients, the equivalent of

over a two to three year period. The association is negative because a

depreciation (decline in foreign currency units per dollar) is equivalent to an
upward shift in the foreign demand for U.S. goods (in terths of U.S. dollars) and will

cause the price discriminating exporter to raise his U.S. dollar export price relative
to his domestic price, while an appreciation will produce the opposite effect. In
the case of a depreciation, price discrimination in which lower prices are charged

exporters is apt to be reduced while in cases of appreciations price discrimination
may be increased as export prices are lowered still further below home price levels.

Several reservations about these conclusions must be entered. One is
that the last few years of the period, 1971—74, saw different exchange rate
institutions and much greater variability of the exchange rate than those of the

earlier years. The relatives for the SDR/dollar rate since 1970 are as

follows:

1971/70
1972/71
1973/72

99.7
92.4
91.1

.1974/73

99.1

The 8 or 9 percent changes in 1972/71 and 1973/72 contrast with very much smaller
changes in the opposite direction (2 or 3 percent appreciations at the outside)
in the average exchange rate of the-U.S. dollar against the currencies of main
trading partners for the period before 1971.

The data thin

out

as we go back in time

to

pre-1971 years and there is but

limited opportunity to explore the stability of the relationships in Table 4.

For SITC 71, there were 170 pre—1971 observations. The equation is:

The equation is very similar to the SITC 71 equation in Table 4 except that it is

R.rather than R_1 or R2 that has the largest impact on export prices. Also, the
sum of the coefficients of R (ZR) is - .10, for the pre-1971 period, a smaller
negative number than the -.17 of the Table 4 equation.

For SITC 72 only 36 observations are available for the period ending in 1970

and the results are less reliable.

*

When SITC 71 and 72 observations are pooled,

ER becomes -.05, again smaller than the Table 4 results.**

The different results found for the pre— and post-1971 data ar.e plausible
within the framework of search and information cost theory if it can be assumed
that exchange rate changes during the fixed regime period were more fully anticipated than exchange rate changes during the flexible regime. Given art exchange
rate change and thus a change in the foreign country's demand for U.S. exports
in terms of U.S. dollars, the oligopolist can be regarded as knowing only one
***
point on the new demand schedule.
The less anticipated the exchange rate

change, the longer and more costly the searcK. Thus, it would be expected that
the price response lags after the post-1971 exchange rate changes are longer than

the pre-1971 exchange rate changes. it is planned to investigate further these
differences between the pre— and post-1971 data with respect to the tiraing and
magnitude of the exchange rate effects using a quarterly lag structure.

We conclude tentatively that the structural relationships that we have uncov-

ered are valid both for the period before 1971 and for later .years although the
sizes of the coefficients and the lag structures may differ.
A second reservation is that results apply only to one export sector, albeit
an important one; machinery accounted for about one—fourth of U.S. exports in 1974.
It is possible, however, that discriminatory pricing may characterize other impor-

tant export sectors as for example transport equipment and chemicals which accounted
for 15 percent and 9 percent of U.S. exports, respectively.*

Pass through coefficients
A more technical limitation is that the equation we have fitted is open to

the charge of simultaneous equation bias because P, P, and R are all interdep—
•endent. One of the results of this interdeendency is that the coefficient of
the

exchange rate in equation 1 does not represent the extent of the pass through

of an exchange rate change.

Rather than reflecting the

full amount of the change in the dollar export price (and thus the

be a small source of bias relative to that affecting equation

(Equation 2 also ignores the possible effect of exchange rate changes on whole-

sale prices via the cost of imported materials.)

When

equation

2 is used as a regression equation, the coefficients of, the

unit cost variables are highly significant and account for one—third to half of

the variance in U.S. wholesale prices. The coefficients of the Rs, however, never
achieve statistical significance, though they conform to expectations in that they

are predominantly negative. (See Appendix Table 2.) A negative relationship
between

and

R, R1, and R_2 is expected both because an exchange rate change

affects the total marginal revenue curve and because, if domestic goods have

nported materials, an exchange rate change affects the long—run marginal cost
curve (assur4ng that it is not horizontal).

It should be noted that a regression based on the variables in equation 3
differs from a regression based on equation 1 only in that the coefficients and

t-statistics on the exchange rates differ. The
statistics on all other

variables

remain the same. The regressions involving

AP are therefore identical with those in Table 4 except for the sums of coef—

ficients of the P.s. A comparison of Tables 4 and 5 indicates that the negative
size of the R's tends to be larger and the coefficients of the R's more signifi-

opposite is true for electrical machinery. The sum of the R's compare as follows:

If the coefficients of the R's are negative in equations explaining
then the coefficients of the R's regressions using AP will be more negative
than the coefficients of the R's in Table 4. This condition is met in the equa—
tions for SITC 71 but not for SITC 72.

The sums of the adjusted R coefficients (EAR) provide measures of the extent
to which foreign currency export prices fell short of matching the proportionate

change in the exchange rate, and thus tell us how the foreign currency pride of

U.S. exports changed as a result of the exchange rate change. For SITC 7 as a
whole,

for example, a 10 percent devaluation of the dollar (fall in the foreign

currency

price of the dollar) would result in a 2.0 percent increase in dollar ex-

port prices and an 8.0 percent decline in the foreign currency prices. The "pass
through"

ratios may thus be obtained by adding 1 to the EAR; the pass through

ratio was .80 for SITC 7,

.78

for SITC 71,

etc.

Additional independent variables

Even with these adjustments, our equations can be criticized for omitting
some independent variables that may conceivably also have an influence on dollar

export prices. In Table 6, the equations in Table 5 are repeated with the addition
of two independent variables.
One of the new variables, P,

is intended to

reflect the prices of U.S. com-

petitors for each 4- or 5-digit SITC category. In the absence of actual price data

A destination weighted deflator was also used but it did not prove significant
when added to equations containing P' perhaps becauc rivals were also destinations.

The sum

of

the pass-through coefficients in the right hand columns of Tables

5 and 6 (for 1953-74) is greater than the sum of the discrimination coefficients
in the right hand column of Table 4, as expected, for all SITC categories with

the exception of SITC 72. Thus, for example, the pass through for nonelectrical
machinery SITC 71 is 73 percent effective (Table 6) while the discrimination co—

efficient

is -.23.

This indicates that a 10 percent U.S. dollar depreciation

will cause the dollar export price io rise by 2.7 percent while the dollar wholesale price will rise 0.4 percent over a two to three year period (the difference
between the export and wholesale price indexes, 2.3 percent, is indicated by the
discrimination coefficient).

For machinery as a whole a 10 percent U.S. dollar depreciation causes a 2.4

percent rise in the dollar export price. Since.the dollar wholesale price is
only minimally affected by the exchange rate change, the 10 percent U.S. dollar
depreciation causes a 2.4 percent differential between the home—currency domestic
and export price.

Conclusion

We have shown that the law of one price does not necessarily apply to traded
goods and that export prices and export price movements can be and frequently are
different from domestic prices and domestic price movements. In the irnoortant
machinery and equipment area competitors' prices and relative growth in GDP (U.S.
versus export destination countries) affect the U.S. export/domestic price relation-

Finally exchange rate changes also have an influence, a dollar depreciation
tending to increase the export/domestic price ratio and an appreciation

change rate change, a depreciation of the dollar is initia1l passed on in the

adjust their export prices to conform to the optimal relation-

ship between home and foreign prices by raising dollar export prices. By the end
of two to three years, the sum of the R coefficients suggests, one-fourth to one—
half of a depreciation has been offset by dollar export price increases, and the
reamining three—quarters to one—half passed on to foreign purchasers in the form
of lower foreign currency prices of U.S. exports.
