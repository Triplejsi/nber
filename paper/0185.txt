INflODUCTIO,

Dynamic issues in the analysis of wages and labor supply have been
recognized for some time. Friedman (1957, 1962) developed the concepts of
permanent and transitory income and their role in consumption, including labor

supply. Lewis (1957) outlined a concept of long—run trend, seasonal and

cyclical time series variation as well as cross sectional "differ til"
in hours of work. He says:
• . the hours of labor supplied per head are made to depend
chiefly upon long—run or permanent real wage rate and real
property income prospects which would be little affected by
short—run ('transitory') variations in real wages and real
property income."

Mincer (1962 )

set

out a reconciliation of apparetly contradictory long—run

time series and cross sectional labor supply (participation) results for
married women. The reconciliation was based on the distinction between
permanent and transitory components of (husband's) income.
Dynamic issues in the analysis of labor supply arise in a quite different

set of models. I want to mention two which are particularly related to this

paper. Lucas and Rapping (1969) are concerned with short run and long run
1
aggregate labor supply functions in the context of a macroeconomic model.

While their results are all based on aggregate data they provide (section 2)
an excellent discussion of the context in which this microdata study is to

be placed. While their "operational supply hypothesis" incorporates a model
of adaptive wage expectations, they outline an alternative view "in terms of
a current real wage consisting of 'permanent' and 'transitory' components."
At the disaggregated level of local labor markets, Lucas and Prescott (1974)
provide a model which introduces local business cycles and serial correlation

in wage rates at the local level. While their purpose is quite different,
emphasizing job search, mobility and equilibrium unemployment, the notions

—2.-

of spatially distinct markets and autocorrelated predetermined labor demand
discussed

there are fundamentally useful in interpreting dynamic labor supply

results.
Another

distinct class of labor supply models has grown out of the work

of Beckman (l977).2 These studies of the labor supply of women emphasize the
joint determination of participation and hours of work and incorporate permanent
and transitory components of women's participation probability functions.

Another study which has come to my attention recently is closely related

to parts of this paper. Hauseman and Wise (1976) present3a simultaneous
equation model for wages and hours observed each of two years. As in the model
presented

model
only

here, hours are taken to be a function of predetermined wages. Their

differs from the one reported here in several important ways.

First

two years of data are used so that serial correlation in transitory

variables cannot be separated from the permanent component. The permanent and

transitory labor supply elasticities are constrained to be equal. Their model
emphasize the important problem of estimation on data truncated with respect

to an endogenous variable while the one reported here does not. One potentially
severe problem with the data from the New Jersey Income Maintenance Experiment
is the quality of the variables used. •The hours and especially wage variables

are constructed from less than ideal underlying measurements.4 The results
reported later will illustrate the importance of measurement error in both
observed earnings and observed hours.

There are some important differences between previous studies and the

—3—

one reported here. First, the availability of panel data makes possible
the estimation of the parameters of dynamic relationships in micro data which
may help reconcile previous divergent cross sectional and aggregate time
series results.5 The fully dynamic nature of many models has not yet been

adequately exploited. One aspect of this is that transitory (short run)
variation in economic variables may not elicit the same behavioral response

permanent (long run) variation. This possibility introduces a whole new

as

class of models and estimation problems. The model reported here is possibly
the simplest such model.
A second difference is an emphasis on the components of variation in economic
variables rather than simply the regression coefficient representing the effect

of predetermined variables. The components of variation in economic variables
become more interesting in panel data because more than the component "due to
X' can be studied.

Another feature not common to many economic studies is estimation
explicitly based on

observed variables rather than "constructed" ones

•

This

allows the problem of measurement error to be tackled directly. The importance
of measurement error in hours, when earnings rather than the wage rate is observed,
has been widely documented.7 (See for example Mincer (1976) and Ghez and
Becker (1975).)

The

purpose of this paper is to develop and test a dynamic labor supply

model which incorporates the essential features of these previous models. The

issues of permanent and transitory effects and of cross section versus time
series can be addressed much more directly given the recent availability
data

of panel

featuring repeated observation over extended periods of time of the same

—4—

individuals. The labor supply model presented below emphasizes the effect
of permanent individual wage differences on permanent annual hours of work
and the effect of serially correlated transitory individual wage variation on

short run hours of work. Permanent and transitory deviations from the
aggregate labor supply functions are also allowed. A by—product is an analysis
of the relative roles of permanent and transitory components of both wages and
hours in the distribution of earnings.

The next section provides a description of the essential features of the

model. Section III provides a detailed outline of the empirical model and
method of obtaining maxin likelihood estimates of parameters. Section IV
provides a discussion of the results including the components of variation in
wages, hours, and

earnings.

Comparisons are made by schooling group, by

experience group, by union status, and by wife's work status. Finally the
results are summarized in Section V.

II. A DYNAMIC LABOR SUPPLY MODEL

The purpose of this section is to outline briefly the dynamic labor
supply model developed more fórmafly in the next section and to introduce
a

few caveats.

The essential feature of the model is a two equation system relating the

wage rate and hours worked at each point in time. Wages are presumed to be
predetermined f row the viewpoint of each individual laborer. The wage rate
(in logs) of any particular laborer at a particular point in time is composed

of several components: a year effect representing tear—to—year wage variation
common to all individuals; an individual specific permanent (long run) wage

level; and a serially correlated transitory (short run) deviation of that

individual's wage rate from its permanent level. The individual permanent
component is itself composed of the effect of measured and of unmeasured

individual characteristics which affect wages. The unmeasured permanent component reflects the permanent characteristics of the local labor market in which
the person resides (if he doesn't move) as well as his own personal character-

istics. The transitory wage component measures the effect of local business
cycles and local labor market transitory variation as well as the effect of time
varying individual characteristics which are not measured or incorporated •into
the analysis.8

Annual hours of work is similarly composed of several components a year
effect representing year—to—year variation in hoUrs commcn to all individuals;

a labor supply response to permanent wage differences among persons; an individual residual or deviation from the aggregate long run labor supply function;

an individual response

to the personal transitory wage deviation from its

permanent

residual serially correlated transitory term representing

level; and a

involuntary

transitory variation in hours (not on the aggregate transitory response

—6—

function). Three concepts of the hours—wage relationship are distinguished.
The first corresponds to .ggregate tine series on wages and hours for the

population under study. In the aggregate the forces of supply and demand for
labor jointly determine wages and hours. The determinants of this aggregate
relationship are not modeled here.9 The other concepts relate to labor supply
decisions by individuals facing exogenously determined wages rates and wage rate

deviations over time, given the aggregate level of wages. It is assumed throughout that each individual takes his wage rate as partly exogenous and partly

predetermined by decisions made earlier in life. He may however respond differently to transitory than to permanent wage differences. All individuals are
assumed to have the same transitory labor supply elasticity and the same degree
of serial correlation in transitory variables.
The well known labor supply (labor—leisure choice) models would presumably
predict the negative income effect to be larger for a permanent wage difference

than for a transitory one. The (positive) substitution effect is more likely to
dominate

for a transitory wage deviation than for a permanent one. A crucial

factor however is the degree of serial correlation in the transitory wage
variation over time for the same person. The greater the serial correlation
the more a transitory wage change appears to be a permanent one.
This

formulation of the model begs several issues. First the model

implicitly assumes costless shifts in annual

arrangements may

such shifts more costly° It should be kept

that other employee—firm arrangements may exist. For example, some

workers may be faced with a fixed salary (annual earnings) but variable annual

hours. Working when the need arises may be a condition of employment, at a
fixed salary. In such a case the average annual wage rate (considered empirically)

will be negatively related to annual hours of work. Many examples can

—7—

be found. At the other extreme some serviceworkers may

may face

fixed working

hours but a random average hourly wage rate. Salesmen and self—employed
barbers might be illustrations. In this case the

transitory elasticity would be

zero. These possibilities cloud the interpretation of measured labor
supply relationships.

The model ignores taxes (and thus marginal versus average wage rates) and

non—pecuniary inducements to work In fact, the model is estimated using
observations on hours and earnings, rather than wages. The wage variation
parameters

are inferred from annual earnings and annual hours and thus refer to

average annual hourly wage rates. The whole dynamic issue

is ignored. (See Lucas and Rapping (1969). The issue of life

joint planning of hours and wages (human capital investment) does not

enter explicitly.

The model ignores an important set of issues

participate and the interrelationship among the
decisions of members of a family or household unit. This eliminates perhaps
including the decision to

most (positively) responsive segments of the potential labor force, women

and retired persons. Only prime age white males (not retired, disabled or
fulltime student) are considered.
Given these caveats let us proceed to the formal

model.

THE FORMAL EMPIRICAL MODEL

The purpose of this section is to more formally outline the dynamic labor
supply model and the resulting implicatibns of dynamic earning variation. First
the dynamic wage function is outlined. Second, the dynamic properties of annual
hours,

induced by wage variation and exogenous to wage variation, are outlined.

Third, the dynamic properties of the resulting earnings function are explored.

Finally, the model is fully combined into matrix form

procedure

and the maximum likelihood

is discussed. The empirical model analyzes the covariance structure

over time of the log of real annual earnings in 1970 dollars and the log of

annual hours of work. Measurement error in these variables is introduced into
the estimation procedure. It is assumed throughout that the random variables

0w oh 1w h and X are independently distributed. A path diagram for the
model, for four years, is presented in Figure 1. Notation for variables and
parameters are presented in Table 1.

This correlation is clearly a monotonically declining function of the time
distance between the years and asymptotically approaches
This dynamic wage equation is precisely the form of the dynamic earnings
function assumed in Lillard and Weiss (1977) and Lillard and Willis (1977).
In those studies time varying

were included so that potentially transitory

variation is explained as well. The approach taken here is to generalize the
structure to the more fundamental wage and hours variables which determine earnings.

b. Hours
The individual annual hours equation similarly is composed of permanent
and transitory components,

(10)

—11—

Three concepts of hours—wage relationship are distinguished. The first
corresponds to aggregate time series observations on hours and wages, i.e.
and

.

In

the aggregate the forces of supply and demand for labor

will jointly determine wages and hours. The other concepts relate to labor
supply decisions by individuals facing exogenously determined wage rates and
wage rate variations over time, given the aggregate level of wages in the

economy. It is assumed throughout that each individual takes his wage rate as
partly exogenous and partly predetermined by decisions made earlier in the life

cycle. He may however respond differently to transitory than to permanent wage
differences. We thus have an aggregate time series relationship common to all
men, an across individual permanent relationship, and an individualized
response to personal time series variation.
The permanent hours component is the sum of a long run labor supply
function and an individual intercept term,

The individual constant term, or deviation from the permanent labor supply

The

term captures the effect of unmeasured individual chaacteris tics affecting

long run labor supply and perhaps permanent exposure to involuntary spells of
unemployment. Since ii and H are in logs,

represents the long run labor supply

elasticity.

The transitory hours component is itself composed of two parts; one part
is serially correlated transitory variation induced by short run wage variation
and the other is an independent source of transitory hours variation,

The independent transitory variation reflects the operation of local labor

labor supply elasticity. The covariance structure of annual hours over time

Clearly permanent wage variation contributes to permanent covariation
in annual hours through long run labor supply, and serially correlated transitory

wage variation contributes to serial correlation in transitory annual hours

through the short run labor supply response. The serial correlation in annual
hours is then a mixture of two

first

The covariance structure between hours and wages over time is due solely

For the purpose of estimation, measurement error in observed hours,

is introduced. It is assumed that measurement error is dis-

tributed independently from year to year with zero mean and variance

.

This

source of variation then contributes only additively to the diagonal elements
of the observed covariance matrix for log hours.

c. Earnings

In the data annual hours and annual earnings are observed rather than the

average annual wage rate. In addition, the roles of wages, hours and labor
supply in the distribution of earnings over time is an interesting issue in
its own right.

Since W and H are in logs, the log of annual earnings is their sum,

IV. EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES

In

this section I present estimates of the parameters of the dynamic

labor supply model discussed in the previous section and discuss the implications

of those estimates. First, several hypotheses are tested with respect to
measurement error and equality of the long run and short run elasticitieS.
Second, for the model finally selected, estimates of the predicted covariance

structure are compared with the actual ones. For these parameter estimates
the various aspects of true wage, hour and earnings dynamics are explored

fully. The importance of the various sources of earnings inequality are
compared. Finally parameter estimates are compared across several subsamples
including schooling groups, experience groups, union membership status, and
wife's work status.

a. The Michigan Income Dynamics Panel
The University of Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics represents a

panel of seven contiguous years, 1967—73. The survey included 5,517 households,
about 2,000 from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity and an additional

3,000 from a cross section of U.S. families. Since the SEO subsample selected
by the Survey Research Center for inclusion in the panel was not random with

respect to income, this group is excluded from consideration. A detailed
description of the data is provided in Morgan (1964). The parameters of the
model are estimated for the 1,041 persons identif fed as a white male head of

household (including single persons) be&ween the ages 18 and 58 in 1967 who were
not disabled, retired or a fulltime student during the period and who reported

positive annual hours and earnings each year. All earnings values are in real
1970 dollars. The mean years of schooling is 12.12 and the mean years of
experience (age minus years of schooling minus 5) in 1970 is 24.11.

—20—

b.

Parameter Estimates

Individual

year means of log earnings (

+ rp,

log hours () and log

wages (rfl) are presented in Table 2 along with their respective antilogs.

These parameter estimates do not vary across the various submodels because
they correspond to simple ineans4 These wage and hour figures correspond

roughly to aggregate time series observationsP They are however for a restricted
subgroup of the population, prime age (18 to 58 in 1967) white males who were

not disabled, retired or fun time students, and who had positive annual hours

and annual earnings, each year of the seven year period 1967—73. Perhaps
the most positively responsive groups with respect to labor supply are omitted,

especially those who would enter the labor force to work positive hours. Perhaps
most importantly the values of

and F for a panel necessarily incorporate mean
16
experience effects as well as time effects.
Estimates

of all other parameters of the i9odel are presented

in Table 3. The full model is compared with three alternative restricted
models. The first tests the hypothesis that the long—run and short—run labor
supply

elasticities are equal, S =

8.

The hypothesis is clearly not rejected.

The long—run and short—run labor supply elasticities are not different. As

will be illustrated this result is robust over many subsamples. This is in
strong contrast to many previous studies. As will be noted later the serial
correlation in transitory wage rates is .823. It appears that the serial
correlation in transitory wage rates is high enough -to induce workers to behave
as if they were permanent changes.

The other estimates concern the importance of measurement error in observed

hours and earnings. These sources of variation are clearly significant individually and combined. While measurement error in earnings is significant,
controlling for it has relatively little impact on parameter estimates except
to

reduce estimated wage components and increase estimated serial correlation.

Measurement error accounts for 6.6 percent of total variation in observed log
earnings. The

components of earnings variation are:

Measurement error in observed annual hours is even more significant and

controlling for it has a larger impact on parameter estimates. The most
important effect on parameter estimates is to eliminate the negative bias imparted
to the short—run labor supply elasticity when only hours and earnings are
observed rather than the wage being observed directly.

This source of bias

is widely cited in the iiteratureJ7 It also reduces the estimates of
all

variance parameters and both serial correlation coefficients. Measurement

model (including measurement error) with

=

U

The estimated model

parameters reproduce the actual covariance patterns remarkably well. A first
order autoregressive process was assumed for both transitory wages and exogenous
(not wage induced) transitory hours covariation over time. The resulting total
hours and earning

these

covariation over tine is correspondingly a weighted sum of

two autoregressive series plus the permanent component. The prediction

errors in each are quite small. The covariance between hours and earnings
actually observed also exhibit the declining covariance property predicted by
the labor supply model in conjunction with permanent and serially correlated

transitory wage and exogenous hours variation. It is, in fact, this covariance
structure which primarily determines the estimates of S and 0 .

It is quite

a strong result to find that the permanent level of covariation in hours and
earnings and the rate of decline in the covariation toward that permanent level
imply that S and 0 are equal.

c. Mean Effects of Schooling and Experience
Before turning to the components of variance consider the mean effects of

schooling and experience on wages, hours and earnings. The estimated values
of the effect of schooling and experience on wages
exogenous hours

and the effect on

are present in Table 5 along with some other calculated

coefficients. The total effect of schooling and experience on annual hours

is given by h 03w and the total effect on annual earnings is

cs1 +(l+5)a"

—23—

An additional year of schooling increases wages 7.9 percent and exogenous

annual hours by 1.6 percent. The combined effect of a year of schooling on
annual hours, given the labor supply elasticity —.160, is an increase of .3

percent. An additional year of schooling increases annual earnings, through
exogenous hours, wages and induced hours, by 8.2 percent. The.082 is
precisely the coefficient of schooling in a simple earnings function including

experience and time dummies estimated by OLS on the pooled data. The experience
coefficients are also the same.

However, the precise sources are made evident

by this estimation procedure.

Years of experience have the usual quadratic effect on wages and earnings
resulting

in a

concave experience—wage or experience—earnings profile. The

experience—exogenous

hours profile has

a much larger positive slope (is more

concave)

than the total experience hours profile including the

reaction

to the increased wage rate over the life cycle.

variation and 23.9 percent to total wage (W) variation. They explain 9.8 percent
of permanent exogenous hours variation and 5.9 percent of total exogenous

wage Variation. When the labor supply response is included,
they explain only 3.0 percent of permanent hours (H1') variation,

1.7 percent of total true hours (H) variation, and 1.4 percent of observed (h)

variation. Schooling and experience account for 42.0 percent of permanent

earnings (P) variation, 27.1 percent of total trueeanings (Y) variation, and
25.3 percent of observed earnings variation.

Comparison of Schooling Groups

Separate parameter estimates are obtained for

the

three schooling groups:

(1) less than 12 years of school; (2) a high school degree, 12 years; and
(3) more than-a high school degree. Sample sizes would not permit smaller
groupings. The year means are presented in Table 6 and the components of
variance are presented in Table 7. The full set of estimates are in the Appendix.
The permanent and transitory labor supply elasticities are not significantly

different in any of the schooling groups. The elasticities are remarkably
close across schooling groups, and are very close to the combined elasticity

of —.160. Measurement error in both observed hours and observed earnings
are quite significant and similar in magnitude to the combined estimate.
Additional schooling appears to increase the wage at an increasing rate,
6.8 percent per year for less than 12 years and 10.1 percent per year for
greater than 12 years; but it increases permanent hours at a declining rate,
2.3 percent per year for less than 12 years and 1.0 percent per year for

greater than twelve. The implied effect on permanent annual earnings,
+ (l+e)a', is correspondingly an increasing function of schooling, 7.8
percent per year for less than 12 years and 9.8 percent per year for greater

than 12 years (using the own groups 8 estimate). The experience effects are
all

very similar to the combined estimates.

The components of wage variation vary systematically across schooling
groups. The s4e of the permanent unmeasured wage component, a2 , declines

substantially at the higher schooling group. This result holds true to a
lesser degree when the effect of schooling and experience are incorporated to
obtain total permanent wage variation,
While the size of the variance

a .

in the random shock, a2

,

is

U—shaped with increased schooling, the serial

correlation coefficient increases more than enough to offset the decline so
that the variation in transitory wages,

,

w

actually

increases with schooling.

There is clearly a tradeoff between the size of the permanent wage component
and the amount of autocorrelation.

Both increase the correlation among years.

They change in opposite directions across schooling groups resulting in

correlations which are quite similar. However the estimate of the. proportion
of wage variation which is permanent differs substantiall': 71.9 percent for
less than 12 years, 55.2 percent for 12 years, and 42.6 percent for greater
than 12 years.

—29—

Exogenous hours is characterized by a U—shaped pattern for both
and
6

and by a declining pattern for both 02h and a2

.

The

II

U—shaped pattern for the permanent component is not surprising since high
school graduates should be a more homogenous group than the other two.
However, it appears that increased schooling results in a decline in transitory
variation in hours which is only slightly offset by an increase in auto...
correlation.

Earnings variation is characterized by a U—shaped pattern of permanent
variation and a larger transitory component in the higher schooling group.
Of total true earnings variation the permanent component represents 62.1 percent
for less than 12 years of schooling, 53.2 percent for 12 years and 45.4 percent
for greater than 12 years.

h. Comparison of Experience (in 1970) Groups
Parameter estimates are obtained for experience groups of ten year intervals

up to 30 years and for those men with more than 30 years of experience. The
year means are presented in Table S and the components of variance are presented

in Table 9. The full set of parameter estimates are presented in the Appendix.
The growth of the means with time reflects the average effect of experience

within the intervals as well as time effects. The mean growth rate (trend) in
the wage declines monotonically from 7.3 percent for the young experience group to
2.0 percent for the experience group with more than 30 years of experience.
The aggregate trend in annual hours is characterized as expected by a slight rise
in hours worked for young workers, a fairly flat hours profile during the
middle years and a substantial decline of 1.3 percent per year on average for

those with more than thirty years experience. Correspondingly the aggregate

earnings trend declines monotonically even mote substantially than wages
from 7.8 percent for the youngest group to .7 percent for the oldest.

While the trend Ft reflects the combined effect of a time trend and
experience as each person in the group grows older, the effect of (linear)

experience on the mean wage, W, within the group is characterized by a similar

pattern9 Additional experience increases the mean wage of individuals within
the same experience group by 5.8 percent per year for the younger, and by

approximately 1.6 percent per year within the two middle groups. It reduces
the mean wage by 1.5 percent per year for the oldest group. Exogenous hours
profiles increase at 3.2 percent per year for the youngest group, and remain
essentially flat over the remainder of the working life with a modest decline

within the oldest experience group. Correspondingly, annual earnings profiles
rise at 8.2 percent per year for the youngest group: 3.2 percent exogenous
experience—hours growth, 5.8 percent direct wage growth, and a .8 percent

hours reduction induced by the increased wage. Annual earnings rise at 1.4
percent per year through the middle yeats and eventually decline at 1.7 percent

per year for the oldest experience group. These experience patterns are
consistent with the pattens observed in the combined estimates.
The schooling coefficient declines monotonically by almost 40 percent from

the youngest to the oldest experience group. This could be the result of a lessening
of the importance of schooling over the life cycle or of those persons with more
experience also being of older vintage combined with an increase in the importance

of schooling for more recent vintages. Results reported in Lillard (1977) suggest
that earnings—experience profiles diverge for the same cohort.

The permanent and transitory labor supply elasticities are of similar

magnitudes across the groups. Again the two elasticities are not significantly
different from each other.
The variance

of the permanent component in wages (both measured and un-

measured) increases

substantially and monotonically from low to high experience

—31—

levels. The variance for the youngest group is less than half of that for
the oldest two groups. The size of the transitory wage component declines
considerably in spite of a large rise in the serial correlation coefficient

from .549 to .852 from the youngest to oldest group. The resulting share of
wage variation which represents permanent wage differences increases from

56.0 percent for the youngest to 70.7 percent for the oldest. The permanent
and

transitory exogenous hours components are roughly constant across experience

groups. The resulting true annual earnings permanent variance component increases
ncnotonically,

and almost doubles, from the youngest to oldest experience

group. The transitory true earnings component is roughly constant across
experience groups (except for the 21—30 group due to both -a low transitbry

wage component and a low transitory exogenous hours component). The share of
the permanent earnings component goes from 49 .4 percent

to

for the young group

62.6 percent for the oldest.

growth rates over the period 1967—73 were very similar across the groups.
While those never in a union had slightly

greater earnings growth it was due

to greater hours reduction rather than to a differential wage growth.
The effect of schooling on wages is three times larger for those never

in a union than for those always in a union. For those in a union sometimes
the effect of schooling is in between. Schooling has roughly the same effect

for each group on exogenous hours. The mean schooling level is 12.8 years for
those never in a union and 10.7 years for those always in a union.
Wage growth with experience is substantially greater for those never in

a union, especially at younger ages. However union members increase their
exogenous annual hours of work at twice the rate (1.4 percent per year versus

.6 percent per year) of non—union workers. Mean experience is 23.6 years for
those never in a union and 27.0 years for those always in a union.
There is considerably less wage variation among union members than among

those never union members. Total wage variation is .382 for non—union workers
and .080 for union members (nearly 80 percent smaller). The variance in
permanent wages for union members is only 16.3 percent as large as for non—union

workers. Among non—union workers schooling and experience account for 46.9 percent
of permanent wage variation and 31.7 percent of total wage variation. Among
union members schooling and experience account for 19.0 percent of permanent

wage variation and 10.0 percent of total wage variation. Transitory variation
among union members in wages is only 30.6 percent as large as the corresponding

variation for non—union workers. The serial correlation coefficient is the
same for both.

The

exogenous

and total hours components are very similar across

—33—

groups.

Those workers in a union sometimes have slightly lower permanent hours

and larger transitory hours components than the other two.
There is, as a result of the large difference in wage variation, a large

difference in earnings variation among the groups. Total true earnings variance
for union members is only 29.7 percent as large as among non—union workers.

Permanent earnings variance is only 20.8 percent as large. Transitory earnings

variation is 45.4 percent as large. Among union members

permanent

earnings

differences account for 45.0 percent, while the share is 64.1 percent for nonunion workers.

Comparison By Wife's Work Status
The

married men in the sample are grouped by the work status of their

wives. One grOup had wives who did not work at all (None) during the 7

year

period 1967—73. Another group had wives who worked (positive annual hours

and annual earnings) each (All) of the 7 years. The third group had wives who
worked some (1—6 years) of the years but not all. The year means are presented
in Table 12 and the components of variance are presented in Table 13. A full
set of parameter estimates are in the Appendix.
The aggregate wage differential between those men whose wives work all of
the time and those men whose wives don't work at all varies between 12 and

25 percent. Those whose wives don't work earn more. The earnings growth
over the period is the same for both groups. The earnings growth for the men
whose wives don't work comes from a greater wage rate increase accompanied
by a reduction in hours relative to men whose wives work all of the time.
The effect of schooling and experience are not very different across the

groups. Schooling and experience each have a slightly greater effect on wages

The greatest difference between men by wife's work status is in the

components of wage variation. The permanent wage component for men whose

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this

paper,

I

present

a method for estimating permanent and

transitory response functions in panel data. The basic concept
developed here is an analysis of the structural relationships among

time varying economic variables, each of which has been decomposed
into permanent and serially correlated transitory components. The
permanent and transitory components can then be allowed to be related

by different structural parameters. The more serial correlation in a
transitory component, the more it will behave as a permanent one.
The method is applied empirically to estimate the parameters of

a dynamic labor supply model. Wages are presumed to be predetermined
from the viewpoint of each individual laborer. The wage rate (in logs)
of any particular laborer at a particular point in time is composed of

several components: a year effect representing year—to—year wage
variation tommon to all individuals; an.individual specific permanent
(long run) wage level; and a serially correlated transitory (short run)

deviation of that individual's wage rate from its permanent level. The
individual

measured

permanent component is

itself composed of the effect of

and of unmeasured individual characteristics which affect wages.

Annual hours of work is similarly composed of several components: a
year

effect representing year—to—year variation in hours coon to all

individuals; a labor supply response to permanent wage differences among
persons;
labor

an indivdual residual

or deviation from the aggregate long run

supply function; an individual response to the personal transitory

wage deviation from its

permanent level; and a residual serially correlated

transitory term representing involuntary transitory variation in hours

—36--

(not on the aggregate transitory response function). All individuals
are assumed to have the same transitory labor supply elasticity and the
same degree of serial correlation in transitory variables.

The dynamic labor supply including errors of measurement can be

straight—forwardly

the

written as a LISREL model. Assuming normality for

relevant variables, maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters

are obtained. Parameters are estimated for while males who are not
disabled, retired or full time students during the panel period 1967—73.

The

model is estimated using annual hours of work and annual earnings

in real 1970 dollars (equals, hours plus wages in logs) since wages are
not observed directly.
First the significance of measurement

error is tested. It is quite

significant for both hours and earnings. Measurement error accounts for
6.6 percent of observed variation in annual earnings and 17.4 percent of

observed variation in annual hours of work. Controlling for measurement
error in hours eliminates the usual negative bias in the labor supply
elasticity widely cited in the literature when hours and earnings rather
than hours and wages are observed. The permanent and transitory labor
supply elasticities (response parameters) are found to be negative and
not significantly different from each other (—.160 when constrained to

be equal), while each is significantly different from zero. This equality
result holds in various subgroups as well, e.g. 'schooling groups,

experience groups and union status groups. The exception is husbands of
wives who work all 7 years. In the latter case the short—run elasticity
is more positive than the long—run elasticity but remains negative. It

—37—

appears that serial correlation in transitory wages is high enough (.823)
to induce workers to behave as if they are permanent.

The estimated regression coefficients of schooling and experience
on permanent wages and on exogenous permanent hours allows a decomposition

of the effect of these variables on anhual hours and annual earnings. The
effect of an additional year of schooling on annual hours in .3 percent

per year and on annual earnings is 8.2 percent per year. The effect on
the average hourly wage rate is 7.9 percent. Experience has a large
effect on the wage rate of 4.2 percent per year and on annual earningsof 4.1
percent per year, but has little effect on annual hours except for those
with little experience (positive) and for older workers (small negative).
Of total wage variation within any year 63.6 percent represents
permanent

differences among individuals. Of the permanent component

37.6 percent is explained by schooling and experience.

correlation

The serial

coefficient in transitory wages is .823.

Permanent hours variation accounts for 61.4 percent of total true

hours (net of measured error) variation. Of the permanent variation
3 percent is due to schooling and experience. Of the transitory variation
90 percent is due to exogenous hours variation (not induced by transitory
wages).

Of total true (net of measurement error) log earnings

earnings variation 64.5 percent represents permanent differences among

individuals. Of the permanent earning component 42 percent is attributed
to

schooling and experience. Of the permanent earnings

variation 23.0

—38—

percent is due to permanent exogenous hours differences, 70.8 percent is

due to permanent wage differences and the induced permanent hours variation
and the remaining 6.2 percent is due to the correlation between exogenous
permanent hours and permanent wages. Of the remaining transitory variation in
true earnings 27.5 percent is due to exogenous transitory hours.

Alternatively

total true earnings variation can be decomposed into exogenous hours and wage

(plus induced hQurs) variation. A substantial 24.5 percent of earnings inequality
is due to exogenous variation in hours, 60 percent of which is permanent.
The permanent and btnsitory

labor

supply elasticities are not significantly

different

by schooling group. The elasticities are remarkably close ac-ross

schooling

groups, and are very close- to the combined elasticity. The components

of wage variation vary systematically across schooling groups. The estimate
of the proportion of wage variation which is permanent differs substantially:
71.9 percent for less than 12 years, 55.2 percent for 12 years, and 42.6 percent
for greater than 12 years.

The wage, hours and earnings patterns with respect to experience within
and across experience groups are consistent with the -estimates for the combined

group, but with more detail, for wage, hours and earnings. The schooling
coefficient declines monotonically by almost 40 percent from the youngest to

the oldest experience group. The variance of the permanent component in wages
and in earnings Q,oth measured and unmeasured) increases substantially and

monotonically from tow to high experience levels. The variance for the youngest
group is less than half of that for the oldest two

groups.

The size of the

transitory wage component declines considerably in spite of a large rise in the
serial correlation coefficient from .549 to .852 from the youngest to oldest

—39—

group.

The resulting share of wage variation which represents permanent wage

difterences increases from 56.0 percent for the youngest to 70.7 percent for

the oldest. The transitory true earnings component is roughly constant across
experience

groups (except for the 21—30 group due to both a low transitory

wage component and a low transitory exogenous hours component). The share of
the permanent earnings component goes from 49.4 percent for the young group

to 62.6 percent for the oldest.
The wage differential between union (all) and non—union (none) workers
is

about 14 percent and constant over the period. The aggregate trend in growth

rates over the period 1967—73 were very similar across the groups.

While those

never

in a union had slightly greater earnings growth it was due to greater

hours

reduction rather than to a differential wage growth. The effect of

schooling on wages is three times larger for those never in a union than for

those always in a union. Wage growth with experience is substantially greater
for those never in a union, especially at younger ages. However union members
increase their exogenous annual hours of work at twice the rate (1.4 percent

per year versus .6 percent per year) of non—union workers. Mean experience is
23.6 years for those never in a union and 27.0 years for those always in a union.

There is considerably less wage variation among union members than among those

never union members. Total wage variation is .382 for non—union workers and
.080 for union members (nearly 80 percent smaller). The variance in permanent
wages for union members is only 16.3 percent as large as •for non—union workers.

Anong non—union workers schooling and experience account for 46.9 percent
of permanent wage variation and 13.7 percent of total wage variation. Among
union members schooling and experience account for 19.0 percent of permanent

wage variation and 10.0 percent of total wage variation. Transitory variation

—40—

among union members in wages is only 30.6 percent as large as the corresponding

variation for non—union workers. The serial correlation coefficient is the
same for both.

There is, as a result of the large difference in wage variation, a large

difference in earnings variation among the groups. Total true earnings
variance for union members is only 29.7 percent as large as among non—union

workers, permanent earnings variance is only 20.8 percent as large. Transitory
earnings variation is 45.4 percent as large. Among union members permanent
earnings differences account for 45.0 percent, while the share is 64.1 percent
for non—union workers.

The greatest difference between men by wife's work status is in the

components of wage variation. The permanent wage component for men whose
wives work all of the years is only 60 percent of that component for men

whose wives don't work at all. The transitory wage component is 66.7 percent
as large. Both permanent and transitory exogenous hours components are also
much smaller.

The resulting permanent earnings component and transitory

earnings component for men whose wives work all years are 63.0 percent and
76.7 percent respectively as large as the corresponding components for men
whose wives don't work at all.
Another interesting result is obtained for those men whose wives work

some but not all of the years. Those men have a smaller permanent and larger
transitory wage component (and earnings component) than either extreme group.
Serial correlation in the transitory component is slightly weaker as well.
Perhaps the most interesting result is that the transitory labor supply
elasticity is signigicantly more positive, but still negative, than the

permanent elasticity. The permanent labor supply elasticities are not different
from the overall value. All of these results taken together indicate a need

—41—

for further research on directly estimating the degree of complimentarity
and substitution among the labor supply of family members (husbands and wives).

to the problem, of measurement error in hours when houré and earnings are
observed, in cross section data suggested by Mincer (1976) and Ghez and
Becker (1975).

One approach suggested by Mincer is to regress current log hours

Another approach
estimates

taken by

Borjas (1976) is to use

of the wage rate. This includes using "usual wage" to predict

hours and using (earnings/hours) to predict hours last week.

His results

lead to a positive labor supply response but are the very short run as
hours last week.

18. The corresponding estimate of
Py

in Lillard and

Willis

based directly on the earnings data alone

(1977) was 71.1 percent. There are a few differences

in approach worth noting. The previous estimate (1) made no attempt to
control for measurement error in earnings, (2) was based on an analysis of
OLS residuals (from the same earnings function implied by
including only time dummies, schooling and experience plus race) rather than
joint estimation by M.L., and (3) was not based on a separate analysis of
whites, as the current results are, but instead included a dummy
shift variable for non white observations.
