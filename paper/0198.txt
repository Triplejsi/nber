whether these moves were in fact caused by

ft. Theoretical Frnnwwork and
Enipirical SpecUlcatioss

The data presented in Section I document
the relationship between migration and job
mobility. In this section the framework within
which the decision to migrate can be analyzed
is discussed and it is shown how job separations can be integrated into this analysis.

Economic theory predicts that an individ-

ual will attempt to sell his services in the
market which offers him the highest return.
Larry Sjaastad utilized this basic concept in

his analysis of internal migration in the
United States. The individual is guided by his
discounted net return from migrating at time
t; if this net return is positive, he will migrate.
In other words,

PM1 - f(G1)

(1)

where PM1 is the probability that the individ-

ual moves in time period t and G is the
discounted net gain from moving. Thus G1 can

be written as follows:

G,..-Y'—Y1—C,
(2)
where Y is the present value of the expected
real income stream if the individual migrates
in time period t, Y, is the present value of the
expected real income stream in the current
location calculated at time t, and C1 are the
costs of migration as well as such Costs as the
loss of the wife's earnings (assuming such a
loss occurs), the costs of uprooting school-age
children as well as the time costs of searching
for a job and residence in the new location. If

> 0, the individual is assumed to
migrate.
The probability PM1 can be viewed as the

unconditional probability of migration. As
was shown in Section 1, some migrants are
also job quitters, some were laid off, and the
remainder are individuals who did not change
employers. In other words. PM can be viewed
as the sum of three joint probabilities:

(3) PM.P(QflM)+P(LflM)
+ P(NS
where

n M)

P(Q fl M) — the joint probability of quitting and migrating
P(L fl M) — the joint probability of being
laid off and migrating
P(NS fl M) — the joint probability of not

separating from the firm
and migrating

Moreover each joint probability can be
rewritten as

P(XflM)-P(X).P(MIX)
(4)
where X — Q, L, or NS,' P(X) is the
probability of a quit, layoff, or no separation,
and P(MIX) is the probability of migration
conditional on a quit, layoff, or no separation.

Equation (4) shows how the decision to
migrate is directly linked to the probability of
ajob separation. In studying migration, there-

fore, we see that it is crucial to have an
understanding of both the process of job

mobility and the determinants of the conditional probabilities of migration.
In order to study the determinants of the

probability of migrating, those variables
which measure the discounted net return from
moving must be identified. Since the decision
•to move has already been shown to be closely
tied to the decision to change jobs, the analy-

sis is in part an attempt to measure the
discounted net return from changing jobs. In
addition, those variables which determine the
conditional probability of migration must be

examined. Of course, there may be some
overlap in the sets of variables that determine

P(X) and P(MIX). More important is the
fact that some variables may affect the
discounted net return from migration only
because they affect the discounted net return

from separating. This points out the importance of examining the joint probabilities of
migration rather than the unconditional probability of migrating. Moreover, it suggests
that a convenient way of determining whether

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

a variable's measured effect on migration is
due solely to its effect on the probability of
changing jobs is to compare the effect of that
variable on the probability of separating and
migrating with its effect on the probability of
separating and not migrating (i.e., changing

jobs in the local labor market).

For example, consider the effect of the
individual's current wage. According to the
theory of specific training, the wage should
have a negative effect on the probability of

quitting, but an ambiguous effect on the
probability of a layoff.8 If the wage does not

affect the conditional probability of migration, then a negative effect of the wage on the
probability of migrating may be observed only
if the individual quit his job. And, if the wage
affects migration simply because it affects the
probability of separating, then the measured

effect of the wage on the joint probability of
migrating and separating would be the same
as its effect on the probability of separating in

the local labor market. In the case of transfers, however, the wage should have a positive
effect on migration since employers would be
likely to transfer (i.e., invest in) those individ-

uals who already have a large amount of
specific training and are closely tied to the
firm.' This analysis shows, therefore, that the
'The theory argues that employees with more worker.
financed specific training are less likely to quit and those

with more firm-financed specific training are iess likely

to be laid off. Following Donald Parsons, since an
individual's wage can be expressed as

W- a0 + a,E + a05.
where E — education and S, — worker-financed specific

training, the quit probability will be inversely related to
the wage when education is held constant. The sign of the
relationship between the layoff probability and the wage

depends on whether firm-financed specific training is
positively or negatively correlated with worker-financed
apecific training. Although the positive correlation is
more likely, the layoff probability may still be positively
related to the wage if job instability is compensated by a
wage premium. See Robert Hall for a discussion of the

DECEMBER 1979

true effect of the wage on the probability of
migration can only be estimated when the
different types of moves are distinguished
from one another.
Other variables can be suggested as deter-

minants of the discounted net gain from
moving. Education should have a positive
effect on the conditional probability of migration since more highly educated individuals
would tend to have better information about

nonlocal job opportunities, may be more
adaptable to change, and tend to be in occu-

pations that operate in a national labor
market. This would predict a stronger effect
of education on nonlocal separations than
local separations. Whether education will in

fact have an effect on the unconditional
probability of migration, however, is unclear.
For example, Borjas and I present evidence

that more educated individuals are significantly less likely to be laid off. This would
suggest that in the case of the joint probability of being laid oIl' and migrating, the effect
of education is ambiguous in sign. Therefore
in estimating the relationship between education and migration one would want to distinguish among types of moves.
One of the most important sets of determinants of the net return from migration is the

characteristics of the individual's family.'0
For example, married individuals with working wives should have higher costs of migra-

tion than those whose wives are not in the

labor force. Similarly, individuals with
school-age children should have a lower net
return from migration, everything else held
constant. Again, however, the effects of these

variables on the decision to migrate may
depend on the association of a move with a job

separation. For example, the presence of a

working wife may have little effect on the
probability of betng transferred by one's
employer; the true inhibiting effect of wife's

decision of job separators would then not be
correctly estimated in an analysis that did not
distinguish among types of moves.
This approach also indicates why certain
job-related characteristics should affect the
net return from migration. For example, individuals with low levels of tenure in the current
job are more likely to experience a job sepa-

ration." And, given the underlying relationship between migration and job separations,
these individuals would therefore be likely to
move geographically. More important is the
notion that the correlation between job tenure

Determinants of Migration

In this section the results of estimating
equations (5), (6), and (7) using data from
the NIS of Young Men, the Coleman-Rossi
Retrospective Life Histories Study, and the
NIS of Mature Men are presented. Table 2
contains the regressions for the NIS Young
Men sample while Table 3 contains similar
regressions for the Coleman-Rossi sample and
Table 4 presents the regressions for the NLS

Mature Men.'2'3 The regressions in these
tables do not hold job tenure and length of

observed negative effect of residence when in

residence constant since it can be argued that
these variables are serially correlated with the

fact the true causative variable is job

dependent variable, that is, previous moves

and length of residence may produce the
tenure.
The analysis presented here thus shows
that the relationship between job mobility and
migration can be demonstrated by estimating
the following set of linear probability equations:

(5)

PM, — a(Z,, F,, J,)

(6)

P(Q fl M), — b(Z,, F,, J,)
P(L

fl M), — c(Z,, F,, I,)

P(NS fl M), - d(Z,, F,, J,)
(7)

P(Q

fl NM), — e(Z,, F,, I,)

P(L fl NM), - f(Z,. F, J,)
where Z, is a vector of individual characteristics, F, is a vector of family characteristics, J,
is a vector of job-related characteristics, and
NM means not migrating. It has been argued

that the coefficients in equation (5) will not
correctly estimate the effects of the independent variables for all movers since, as equa-

have determined current job tenure and
length of residence. In fact, when tenure and
residence are added to the regressions, some
of the other independent variables do become

less significant (but the conclusions of thts
analysis are unchanged) indicating that these
variables also determined previous mobility.
The coefficients on tenure and residence from
these regressions are shown in Table 5 and the
complete regressions are available from me
upon request. In order to focus on the distinc-

tion between unconditional and joint probabilities of migration, each independent variable is discussed in turn to show how its
measured effect on migration depends on the
associated job separation. The variables are
defined in Table 2; note that the independent
variables are measured at the beginning of the
period under study.

that the wage has no effect on the unconditional probability of migration. The reason for

this somewhat paradoxical result is made
clear by an examination of the other regres-

the wage coefficient is always nonnegative

for this nonnegative wage effect was
suggested in Section II. Since the joint prob-

ability of migrating is a function of the

wage coefficient may be due to a nonnegative
wage effect on the probability of being laid off
and the probability of being "promoted" via a

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

fn. 13). It can therefore be concluded that the
relationship between wages and migration is
strongly dependent on the fact that job separations accompany migration; the only case in
which a move is seen to be negatively related

to the wage (i.e., quitting and migrating) is
found to be due entirely to the negative effect
of the wage on the job separation itself.

B. Education
Education has a positive and significant
effect in all samples on the unconditional

probability of migrating. This result is
consistent with the findings of other studies
surveyed in Greenwood (1975) and has been
explained as being due to the more educated
individual's ability to adapt to new locations
and his greater efficiency in searching for jobs

in other locations. The empirical results in

icant effect on the unconditional probability
of migration." This occurs for two reasons.

First, wife's participation has no effect in
these samples on the probability of being
transferred. Second, although wife's participation does inhibit migration in the case of

job quitters, this effect can not be directly
observed in the joint-probability (M!GQT)
equations. The reason is that wife's participa-

tion has a positive and significant effect on
the probability of quitting locally. Therefore,
to measure the negative effect of WLFP on

the probability of migrating, one should
compare the coefficients in the MIGQT and,
NMQUJT equations. As can be seen from
Tables 3 and 4, WLFP is less positive in the
MJGQT equations, reflecting the inhibiting
effect of this variable on quitting into another
labor market.'7 Similarly, the negative effect
of school-age children (SCHL) on the migra-

an effect on migration that is independent of

its effect on the probability of separating.
This can be seen by comparing the coefficients in the local and nonlocal separation

the wage, education does have an independent

school-age children inhibit a job quitter from
changing locations.

C. Family Variables

Previous research on migration has found
that one of the most important determinants

The costs of migration that are usually

associated with marital status can be
measured by information on the wife's labor
force participation and the ages of the chil-

dren. The effect of the wife's labor force
status is measured by a dummy variable
indicating her participation in the labor force
(WLFP) and a continuous variable measur-

ing her wage or annual earnings (WW,
WINC).'t For men in their 30's. 40's, or 50's

(Tables 3 and 4) we find that wife's labor
force participation has a negative but insignif"In the case of the Coleman-Ross) sample, many men

this variable, it was deleted from the regressions for this

"In the case of men who are in their 20's (Table 2). the
effect of wife's labor force participation on the unconditional probability of migration depends on the amount of
the wife's earnings. If the wife's annual earnings are
below $5,800 her participation does not inhibit migraIion
at earnings levels above $5,800 her participation has a
negative effect which eventually becomes significant.
(This is calculated by realiiing that WINC is actually an
interaction term between she dummy variable WLFP and
the wife's earnings if she works.) Since these women are
in their childbearing years and arc likely to participate
intermittently in the labor force, their current participation is noi an inhibiting factor in migration unless their
earnings represent a substantial contribstion so fam,l

thereby raising the costs of migration. One
must also recognize, however, that the negative effect of length of residence may be due
to the relationship between residence and job
tenure. To the extent that the individual has

not changed jobs during his stay in this
location, job tenure and length of residence
will be strongly correlated. Moreover, there is
substantial evidence that job tenure reduces
the probability of a job separation because of
the positive correlation between tenure and
job-specific training.'9 Since the relationship
between migration and job separation has
already been documented, it is quite possible
that the observed negative effect of length of

residence on migration may be due to the
negative effect of tenure on job separations.
We would like to be able to identify whether
there is an independent effect of residence on
migration.

Fortunately, since the data sets provide
information on both length of residence and
job tenure, the separate effects of length of
residence and job.tenure on the decision to
migrate can be identified. This is accomplished by defining a variable RTEN which
equals the difference between length of residence.and job tenure and including this variable as well as JOB (length of job tenure) in

the regressions. Then RTEN captures the

effect of a year of residence net of job tenure,
that is, the "pure" residence effect, while the
coefficient on JOB is the sum of the pure
residence effect and the pure job effect, if it
exists, If RTEN hasa significant effect on the

decision to migrate and the coefficient on
JOB exceeds(in absolute value) the coefficient on RTEN. then it can be concluded that
the inhibiting effect of residence observed in
other studies is due to the acquisition of both

capital.

on JOB and RTEN for each of the uncondi-

length of residence has an inhibiting effect on

migration which is net of the relationship
between residence and tenure. For the older
men, however, the correlation between residence and job'tenure is very high; RTEN only
ranges from zero to nine years. For these men,
RTEN is insignificant indicating that the

negative relationship between residence and
migration is due solely to the negative effect
of job tenure on separations. It is important to

when a job separation accompanies a

of the relationship between tenure and job

BAR TEL MIGRATION DECISION

The results in Table 6 show that if no
distinction is made among types of moves, a

positive and significant effect of migration on

wage growth is observed only for the NIS
Young Men. Distinguishing among moves
related to quits, moves related to layoffs, and
transfers provides a more revealing picture of
the returns to migration. For men in their 20's

and 30's (NLS Young Men and ColemanRossi), transfers have a positive and significant effect on wage growth. In other words,

young men who are transferred by their
employers achieve wage gains that are
substantially larger than the gains of men

with similar characteristics who do not
migrate. It therefore appears that in this age
group a transfer acts as a promotion within

the firm. While men in their 50's who are
transferred do not receive wage gains that are

significantly larger than that of the nonmigrants, it is important to note that this type of

move results in the largest wage gain (the
coefficient on MIGTR is larger than those on
MJGQT and MIGLAY).
Of all the coefficients on the separation-

related moves, only one is significant: the

NIS Young Men who quit and migrate
achieve significantly larger wage increases
than nonmigrants. Does this imply that for
the two older cohorts a geographic move that
accompanies a job separation does not pay?
The answer to this question depends on with
whom the migrant is being compared. For
example, in all three samples, individuals who

quit and migrate do better than individuals

who are laid off and migrate (compare
MIGQT and MIGLAY).2324 Further, in the
25Note that for layoffs this does not hold; individuals
who are laid off do better if they do not migrate.
The reader may be puzzled as to why a significant

positive return to local quitting is not observed. The paper

by Borjas and myself shows that for the MS Mature
Men, a substantial proportion of the quits in this age
Ireap either result in increased job satisfaction but not
increased money wages or are caused by exogenous
factors such as health or family problems. For the young
men, only thoae individuals who said they quit because
they found a better job had significantly larger wage
gains in the 1971—73 time period. Individuals who quit
because of personal problems or because of dissatisfaction with their current jobs did not have larger wage gains
than stayers.

NLS Mature Men sample, individuals who
quit and migrate achieve larger wage gains
than individuals who quit but do not migrate
(compare MJGQT and NMQUIT). In general, however, one can conclude that of the
three types of moves, transfers result in the
largest payoffs.

i.d Coeclioaa

This article has analyzed the determinants
and consequences of migration at different

stages in the life cycle. The theme of the
article has been that migration is closely
related to job mobility (in fact, between
one-third and one-half of all moves are caused
by the decision to changejobs) and that when

the decision to migrate or the returns to
migration are explored, one must take
account of this relationship. Several findings
support this argument:

I) Economic theory predicts that. ccterisparibus. the wage should have a negative

effect on the decision to migrate. This article
shows that the wage has a significant negative
effect only in the case of the joint probability

of migrating and quitting. Moreover, this
negative coefficient is entirely due to the
negative effect of the wage on the job separation itself.
2) The true inhibiting effect of a work-

Ing wife on a man's decision to migrate is
shown to be correctly estimated onl) when the

unconditional probability of migrating is
decomposed; this occurs because of conflict-

ing effects of this variable on the transfer
decision, the decision to change jobs in the
local market, and the decision to quit and
migrate. Similar problems exist for measuring the effect of the presence of school-age
children.
3) Previous research on migration has
found that one of the most important determinants of the decision to migrate is the length

of residence in the current location. This
article shows that since residence and job
tenure are positively correlated, the effect of
residence on migration is at least partially due
to the relationship between job tenure and the
decision to change jobs.
4) The wage gains from migration are

also seen to depend on the nature of the move
and the age of the migrant. Of the three types

of moves, transfers in general lead to the
largest wage gains; this effect is significant,
however, only for the two younger cohorts. A

quit-related move is also found to lead to
larger payoffs than a layoff-related move for
all three samples.

In conclusion, the empirical findings

presented in this article support the initial
argument that one must take account of job
mobility in studying the determinants and
consequences of the decision to migrate. The
results indicate that there is an important link

between the decision to migrate and the
probability of a job separation; an analysis of

migration that ignores this link may fail to
understand the role played by many socioeconomic variables in the migration process.
