attempts to analyze migration

in the awareness

of the family context.2 In

contrast to most of them, my focus is exclusively on the family context. The
paper defines family ties relevant to migration decisions and explains their

effects on the probability of migration,

of the gain, and the Ga are defined as present value.

and 70.56 percent of families will

stay without

conflict. In the remaining

26.88 percent of all families, one member is moving or staying contrary to

his "private" calculus of gains and losses. The allocation of these "tied

with k —

a

matter which potentially affects family stability when migration

opportunities arise. This matter is discussed in section 4 below.
Since "tied" persons in the family are those whose gains from migra-

tion are (in absolute value) dominated by gains (or losses) of the spouse,
there are reasons to believe that wives are more likely than husbands to be

the dominated ("tied") partners. The assumption that k <

is especially
plausible for the labor market components of G.: On the return side larger
1

gains (or losses) are likely to accrue to persons with greater market earning
power. On the cost side, foregone earnings are also higher for

such

persons.

the return from migration is likely to be smaller for persons whose

labor force participation is discontinuous. Thus, the absolute value of G
is larger for husbands than for wives. Indeed, within the family, higher
market earning powers of husbands induce a lesser market participation, lower

market earnings, and a diminished migration payoff for the wife. The lesser
net payoff to wives may also result from a larger non—market component in

opportunity costs of migration acquired in non—market activity.

Consequently, wives are more likely to be tied movers in migrating

families while husbands, if they

are tied at all, are more likely to be tied

stayers than tied movers. This is most likely to happen when the wives contribution to family

contribution and
on family

income derives from a job. Of course,

of women, especially of married women who migrate. In our example, as many
as two—thirds of the women movers might move for family reasons only, while

at most one—quarter of the women stayers are "tied".

Judging by Table 1, and assuming that the distribution of gains from

mobility are related to distributions of wages expected over longer periods

of time, we may guess at current U.S. levels of k at a little over one—quarter:
.1 is the ratio of working wives to husbands' annual earnings,6 and since
labor

force participation of wives is about .5, the ratio for all families

is .2. p would be .5

if

the correlation between the education of spouses

is used as a guide, and .3 or less judging by the correlation of wages in

couples with working wives. If so, marital status (k —

reduce migration propensities of all families by as much as 20 percent. P
Presence of working wives (k =

should reduce it by as much as

7
As already

noted,

trends toward equalization of labor market experiences

of men and women (k increasing toward

i)

cause reductions in migration pro-

pensities in stable families. But, we will be shown, they also create greater
instability. Trends in p and their effects are not obvious.8 Even if marital endogazny
(similarity of traits) were to increase, the effects on migration would not

be clear, unless endogamy were to extend to most detailed occupational charac-

teristics of spouses.
6The estimate is .37 if l97 figures are used (Table 39 in CPS, P—60,
No. 101). I am grateful to Larry Long for the estimate and the references.
Tlnterestingly, the BI report on migration in 1962—1963 (Special Labor
Force Report No. 14) states that migration of married men (wife present) was
almost one—third less than that of other men, at ages 18 to 6.
8The correlation between husband's earnings and wives' labor force
participation has been changing secularly from negative to positive, at least
below median earnings of husbands (see Manpower Report of the President, 1975,
p. 59). This may suggest an upward trend in p.

—11—

At anr rate, inferences about the effects of p should be qualified

due to its necessarily restricted definition in Table 1: It represents a
correlation of gains from outmigration , since a single (aggregated) destination was assumed. If payoffs beckon in different destinations, p loses its
meaning altogether, and the family migration problem is magnified.
Several Destinations

Since

more than one destination is generally open to potential migrants,

G. should be defined as the maximum G over all possible

degree, although the partner whose gain is larger will tend to be closer to
his optimum. The previous conclusion that the "dominated" partner loses by

migration need no longer be true: Both lose relative to their "private"
potential, and the "dominated" spouse loses more,9 but both may gain, even

in a "private" sense (they always gain as a family) relative to origin.
9For

a focus on

this matter see R.H. Frank (1976).

—12—

The divergence of the two G. among destinations is most likely to arise

when both are

motivated

by job opportunities. For the spouse that is not

working, attachment to origin is probably a more important factor affecting

migration decisions than differential pull of various destinations. For
working couples the compromise involved in finding a destination which maximized family gains at the expense of the potential advancement of each worker

creates more ties: Now both rather than one spouse are "tied" in migration.
As shown in the next section, the larger magnitude of ties,1P the greater the
potential for family breakup caused by migration opportunities.

We may conjecture that to the extent that both G are motivated by job
opportunities, the dissimilarity in locational specificities of spouses that

gives rise to G. < G.

max might be reduced by a tendency for such families

to locate in large, diversified labor markets. Thus, it may well be that
growing

job motivation of wives will weaken the tendency toward far—flung

suburbanization, not only because of the negative effects of wage prospects

on fertility, but also because of a need for greater proximity to large, diversified labor markets.
The expectation of becoming a tied spouse, which characterized most

women until very recently, may have had some influence on women's initial

occupational choices. The preference for occupations which are most easily
transferable geographically may have contributed in part to the concentration of women in such traditional occupations as teaching, nursing, and secretarial work.11

10Note the more general definition of a "tie": Tied movers are not
only those with negative gains. Ties are defined and measured bi discrepancies
between actual and maximum potential private gains. Presence as well as
degree of "tiedness" are relevant, as shown in section 1, below.

.
.
11 Cf. Long (19714) for this
point of view.

—13—

But as the dramatic recent increases in family

ded

in expectations, the incentives for such

prior

instability

get embed-

adjustments will

be

re-

duced. More immediately, as shown in the next section, the growing risk
of marital instability reduces incentives of spouses to compromise locationally.

Consequently, in a classic case of self—fulfilling expectations, differential
migration incentives amplify marital instability, once it is anticipated.

for separated partners. Now, with M1 + M2

<

, partner 2 leaves and cannot

be bribed by partner 1 to stay, nor will partner 2 induce 1 to come along,
as this would make 2 even worse off than if he (or she) stayed.

To repeat, in the single destination case, family breakup occurs as

soon as the gain (or loss) of the dominated ("tied") partner exceeds the total
family gain from marriage. In the general case, breakup occurs when the sum

of ties T exceeds the sum of gains from marriage M. Under these conditions,

the gains from migration lead each of the spouses to follow their "private"
opportunities separately.
The conditions (2a) for breakup due to migration decisions are rather

stringent.

The smaller of the gain (G1) or loss (G2) (in absolute value)

from migration must exceed the sum of the gains from marriage. The more general
condition (2), with more than one destination, makes marital breakup more

probable, as the right side of inequality (2) must exceed that in (2a). Since

a time, greater mobility of separated men and women than of those not only

of time, the dif-

and separated former spouses tends to disappear.

In the case of the newly remarried, as in the case of newly married

people, a change in migration equilibrium will also result in increased initial
migration, but with the passage of time the differences from the behavior of

those married once for a longer time disappears. Thus marital instability,
whatever its source, creates "disequilibrium" migration incentives, while the
differential migration incentives of spouses creates marital instability.

The theoretical discussion and the following empirical evidence in
this paper indicate the way in which the initial (and expected) comparative
advantages of family members in market and household activities tend to be

reinforced

by family

labor mobility decisions. The adverse effects on the

seen as "social oppres-

from a "private" point of view. Such a view, however, fails to note

be

that the behavior we analyzed is a product of family welfare maximization.
This is pareto—optimal since "private" market losses can be

internalized by

the

family, that is compensated by a redistribution of gains. However, when

the

sun

of separate real incomes exceeds family real income, the optimal adjust-

ment is family dissolution, a growing phenomenon which is in part traceable
to the changing division of labor among the sexes.

IMPLICATIONS AND FINDINGS

The following examples provide clear empirical illustrations of the
concepts of "tied" spouses and of the distinctions between personal and family

gain in migration analysis:
the
(1) A BLS survey of persons unemployed in April 1962,12
incidence and attitudes of tied spouses: the unemployed were asked

whether they would accept a job in another area comparable to the
one they lost. A positive answer was given by 30% of the married
men, 21% of the single women, and only 8% of the married women.
Most people who said "no" cited family, home, and. relatives as
reasons

for the reluctance to move. However, one quarter of the

women singled

the

out their husbands'

in the present area

factor, while only 3% of

as

the husbands mentioned

their wife's job as such a factor. If this finding for the unemployed can be generalized to the entire population, 30% of

families would move and 30% —

8%

wives of moving families would be

= 22%

or two—thirds of the

"tied movers", while 25% out

of 70% of wives in families of stayers declared themselves to be

"tied stayers". (Surprisingly, these figures are rather close
to the numbers produced in the hypothetical example on p.4 ).

(2)

The importance of the distinction between personal and family gains
from migration was

first

shown in a study by Julie DaVanzo (1972).

data aggregated into nine Census divisions the
study estimated gross migration flows of men and women as functions
of "prospective" personal family gains. It was suggested in our
discussion that analysts looking at personal gains are most likely

to misinterpret the behavior of women. The study by DaVanzo shows
that men's gains explain migration of men in regressions with
R2
3l . When family gain is substituted, the R2 increases
to .39. The for female migration functions using their own
gain was only .21. It increases to .32 when men's gains are
substituted in the same regressions, and to .141 when family gains
are used.

1.

Marital Status
If family ties

deter migration, as our

discussion suggests, then husband.-

wife families should migrate less frequently than persons without spouses.
An excellent demographic study by Larry H. Long (19714) documents this difference

very clearly with data on annual migration rates reported in the U.S. Census
Current Population Surveys and averaged over a six—year period (1966—1971).
T&ole 1, borrowed from Long's study, shows that in each age group annual migration rates (col's 2 and 3)

was 25 —

614

years

of

husband and wife families in which the husband

old were less than rates of men without wives (single, widowed,

separated, and divorced).

The behavior of the youngest families (husband's age less than 25)
constitutes an exception, which can be explained by the concept of changes in

locational equilibrium. Life—cycle events such as completion of schooling,
entry into the labor force, family formation, or dissolution create new in-

centives and opportunities for migration. Conversely, people also migrate

to

start a career and. to marry. Since the youngest married couples are,

practically by definition, most recently married, their migration rate is
high. Table 2 shows that migration rates decline with duration of marriage
steeply

at first and

again

after 5—9

years of marriage.

income sizeable. This is not to deny the possibility of conflicting non—
pecuniary motives. Unfortunately, an empirical classification of families
by such criteria is not available, while employment status of spouses is
reported in a number of surveys.
All the surveys show higher migration rates of families where the wife
is not employed outside the home than in families where the wife is employed
(Table i). As Long (19714) noted, the evidence confuses cause and effect when
employment status is reported during the survey week, and migration, if any,

during the preceding 12 months. Such findings are partly biased since, of the
women who worked at the place of origin and lost their job through migration,15
many did not, or not immediately, regain employment at destination.
The proper comparison is by employment status which precedes migra-

tion. Table 5

(top

left panel) shows migration rates of families during a

five—year period following 1965,

by

age of husband and employment status of

wife. With the exception of the youngest couples, migration rates are lower
in families in which the wives were employed than in families with wives who

did not work in 1965. The least propensity to move is shown in families in
which wives' job attachment is strongest, here (col. 3) identified by the
wifes' employment both in 1965 and 1970.

In young couples (husband's age up to 29 in 1965) where wives worked
in 1965 (but not in 1970), migration rates were not lower than in families

where the wives did not work in 1965. This finding is confirmed in the NLS
sample of young men (next section, Table 7) and can be explained by: (1) investment aspects of migration: Largest investments with biggest (lifetime)

15lncreasingly states define this phenomenon as job loss, making the
worker eligible for unemployment insurance. The effect is to lower the cost
of migration and increase the incidence and duration of the wife's enemploy—
ment at destination.

stage

are

than in

later mobility, outweighing the possible adverse, but

weaker

effects on the market earnings of the wife. (2) Wives' participation in the
labor market is highly transitory at the child—bearing stage. Significantly,
Table 5 shows that in young families where wives had a strong attachment to
their market work (employed both in 1965 and

1970), the

deterrent effect on

migration is visible even in the youngest families (compare col. 2 & 3):

Evidently, a rise in investment costs ——

in

this case, larger foregone earnings

of wives —— does reduce migration rates. Nevertheless, the deterrent effect

on migration, even of wives who are more strongly attached to the labor force,
is weaker at younger ages, reflecting the strong incentives to invest in market
careers of husbands.

Table 6 shows an interaction of wife's employment status and distance
of migration in their effects on migration rates: Migration rates diminish
with distance, but

they decrease more strongly in families with

working wives

in other families. Indeed for the nearest relocations (within counties),
migration rates are higher in two—earner than in one—earner families. As
than

Long (l97) puts

it:

"Having a wife who works may inhibit long—distance

movement, but appears to promote short—distance movement". These findings,

incidentally, hold for employment status reported after (Table 1) as well as
before moving (Table 6).
A

search hypothesis can account for the higher local mobility rate of

two—earner families, and the progressively lower mobility rate of two—earner

compared to one—earner families at increasing distance. If search costs increase with distance (e.g., when repeated travel is required), the incentives

of arithmetic.

Consistent

evidence is provided by findings that in contrast to long

migration which is positively related to education of husband, short

distance

distance (within counties) moves are inversely related to it (Manpower Report,

l97).

The converse is true of wives' labor force participation and of their

education. (See Tables 1 and T.) Apparently, where the female to male wage
ratio is higher, migration, if any, is shorter, as the incidence of tied

husbands is greater. Short—distance search is a preferable alternative to
a potentially large

at longer distances.

The Family Context in Multivariate alysis
Some of the well—established findings in empirical migration studies

are: the positive effects of education and the negative effects of family

size,

particularly the presence of school—age children)7 In studies of

labor force behavior, mothers' labor force rates are lowest when the children,

migration, but also an intra—farnily substitution effect. The greater comparaof husband on

the wife and, therefore, to fewer obstacles to family migration. Similarly,
the pre—school status of young children signifies not only a lesser loca-

tional attachment of the family, but also little labor market attachment of
the mother, hence again a lesser obstacle to geographic mobility. Moreover,

intertemporal substitution is also at work: Anticipated locational attachment

one interesting implication: If migration is, in part, a consequence of job
turnover rather than conversely, the probability of job—related migration

the lesser effect on family income, wife's search for a new job at

destination is either less intensive prior to migration or postponed until
after migration.

The unemployment of women migrants at destination is either a result
of job loss at origin, or of labor force entry at destination by women who

did not work in the period prior to migration. This does not mean that,
in sum, more women migrants are in the labor force at destination than at

origin. The opposite is true: The lower panel of Table 5 showed that labor
force rates of wives who migrated are smaller than the labor force rates of

stayers within 12 months after migration. While the effects are strongest
immediately after migration, they last at least several years: It was shown

It was

previously that migration rates of two—earner families

migra-

tion status and location.

It was argued before that incentives for search prior to migration
are weaker for tied movers and prior search is costlier the more distant the

destination. And search at the unfamiliar destination can be prolonged and
unsuccessful. Consequently, the lesser search prior to migration is one possible explanation of the adverse effect of distance on wives' employment.
In addition, husbands' gains from migration increase with distance, and both

such gains and the probability of migrating long distances increases with

the education of the husband. Therefore, the intra—family income and substitution effects induce levels of wives' labor supply inverse to distance
and make decreases in their labor supply a positive function of distance.

Both unemployment and labor force withdrawal are results of tied

migration of working wives. If employment and earning opportunities turn out
to be meager or inferior at destination, withdrawal from the labor force is

a likely possibility. Reduction in wives' market labor supply following migra-

tion is

activity necessitated by setting up a new household in a new environ-

ment. The last factor may only temporarily remove women from the labor force.

In sum, migration results in both temporary interruptions and

long—term

with-

drawals from work.

The contrast between job motivated and tied migration is seen not only
in the comparison of effects on work experience of migrating spouses, but

also

the comparison of single with married women migrants. As Table 5,

in

panel B indicates, in contrast to married women, single women migrants have

higher

labor force rates at destination than at origin. Another vivid illus-

tration of family ties in migration is provided by the Polachek and Horvath

study of the Income Dynamics data: They find that families with husbands
receiving high wages move toward areas with fewer women in the labor force,

while families in which the wife has a

This

is evidence

is the incidence and magnitude

ties, rather than their effects that differs among the sexes.

Not

only tied movers but also tied stayers experience a redu.ction in

the market earnings potential. By definition, "tied" stayers fail to exploit
potential gains from labor mobility. The confinement of job mobility to the
local labor market, often at short distances, reduces the scope for job change

and the quality of the job match. If so, we may expect both a lesser propensity
to change jobs on the part of working wives, as well as a greater vulnerability
to layoff. Given a job loss, the lesser scope for search results in reduced
wage aspirations, more unemployment, and labor force withdrawals. Although

the implied duration of unemployment can be shorter because of reduced acceptance

—38—

wages and/or

labor force withdrawals, its incidence is likely to be

greater.
In two studies of job mobility in 1955 and 1961, the Current Popula—
tiori

Survey found that the proportion of job changers among working women was

20—30%

smaller than among men. But, since women work almost 20%

during

the year, the proportion of job changers does not appear to

ferent among the sexes per unit of

(purposive)

be dif-

time. Still, the conclusion that women's

job mobility is smaller than men's is correct: Women's job tenure

is on average half the length of men's tenure. In view of the just quoted
statistics on job change, this reduction in tenure is due entirely to labor

force withdrawals. As is well known, job turnover declines rapidly with tenure.
Consequently, if frequency of job change of women were the same as that of
men at each level of tenure, women would be observed to have a larger overall

frequency of job change per unit of time since their tenure is shorter. Evidently, their job mobility is lower than that of men at comparable levels of

tenure. This inference is confirmed in Table 9: For each level of tenure,
except the earliest, the job change rate of women (col. 14)

is

less than the

rate of men (col. 5), even though the men are about 10 years older. Total
separation rates of men (not shown here) are only slightly larger than in

ccl. 5. Total turnover among women is twice as high as job mobility in the
first 2 years of tenure, and the proportional excess increases with level of

tenure (compare col. 1 with 1). The difference is, of course, due to labor
force withdrawals. Note that their rate (col. 2) is largely unrelated to tenure,

in contrast to job mobility rates, which decline. Note also that reported
"quits for family reasons", an independent statistic, is very close to the
estimate of labor force withdrawals. The former does, of course, imply the

example, migration need not imply a withdrawal

from the labor force, though it very frequently does.
Census tabulations of unemployment by source suggest that most of the

excess of female over male unemployment is due to the unemployment of labor
force entrants, and

especially

of re—entrants. However, among the unemployed

who worked prior to unemployment, job leavers represent about one—third of all
unemployed women (over 20 years of age), while they amount to only one—sixth
to one—fifth of the comparable category of unemployed men: .Iost likely, this

is a reflection of the family, rather than of job motivated quits. Such
"exogenous" quits of women (or men) tend to involve unemployment to a larger
degree than job—motivated quits, which occur usually after workers have lined
up the next job.

Gains and Losses in Earnings

5.

As has been documented in many studies (Greenwood, 1975),

geograhic

migration usually increases earnings of men. However, effects on employment
of wives suggest that earnings of wives may suffer. Indeed, Galloway (1963)
was the first to find that interregional migration was associated with a decrease in the earnings of women (he did not distinguish marital status).

In the N Report (1976), Sandell finds that between 1967 and 1911,

incomes of migrant husbands increased by $l,l7 per year more than incomes of
nonmigrant husbands, while incomes of migrant families increased by $952

per

year. The difference (— $222) represents the average loss of wives. The

wives' income loss is partly a result of a reduction in labor supply and partly

a reflection of lesser wage growth of tied migrants. Adverse effects were also
found

both

in the growth of annual earnings as well as in wage

rates of

migrant wives by Polachek and Horvath (1976) in the Michigan Income Dynamics
Panel for 1968—1969 migrants.

Losses of migrant wives' earnings (relative to earnings of non-migrant
wives) diminish with the passage of time, as do the differences in weeks
worked, as Sandell reports. Initial uninformed search and family demands
connected with setting up a new household are temporary and account for the

initially strongest declines in employment and. earnings of wives. A conclu-

sion for the study of gains from migration is that, although conceptually less
appropriate,
not

they are

discernable in earnings of husbands more quickly (though

immediately after migration) than in family

incomes.

While migration of tied wives interrupts their work experience and
reduces their wage progress, gains

from

migration are larger for married

than

for other men, according to regressions using the various panel data (C—R,

NLS, and. MID). The gains are larger especially in families with "tied" wives:
Thus Ann Bartel (1975) finds in
at

the Coleman—Rossi data that where wives worked

origin (but not at destination) husbands received the largest gains ($122

per month). Gains were

much

smaller ($51 per month) where wives did not work

at origin (but did at destination). Gains of husbands were average when wives
had unchanged employment status. Similarly, in the NLS sample men in their

twenties whose wives had large earnings receive larger wage gains than other
migrating husbands of wives

who worked at origin.

The positive effects of marital status on migration gains

especially

ties:

of husbands

of men,

of working women (prior to migration) reflect family

Potential losses of wives raise the acceptance wage of migrating hus-

bands. Both

results follow: the probability of migration diminishes and the

"private" gain of the purposive job seeker increases.

—

We may conclude that the intra—family trade—off in gains and losses

from migration involves mutual causality: Gains of husbands induce a reduction
in labor supply and earnings losses of wives, while the potential losses of
wives' migration reduces migration but increases the gains of husbands in
families which move.

Migration,

Family Stability and Trends

The empirical evidence described thus far reflects the internalization
of family ties which, in the context of migration, can be viewed as an externality
to

the family member in'his (her) "private" capacity. As we

theoretical

always be

argued in the

discussion, conflicting "private" locational incentives cannot

reconciled, and prospective or actual migration leads to family dis-

solution. Conversely, when families disintegrate for whatever reason, locational equilibrium changes for many of the separated and divorced persons and
migration follows.

We have seen the stronger migration propensities of divorced and separated
persons compared to others in some of the data cited before. Evidence on
temporal sequences which would reflect migration—caused family breakup is

difficult to come by. We are able to get some inferences only from one data
set: The Coleman—Rossi panel provides chronological data on labor mobility
and on family formation and dissolution over a period averaging 15 years ——

from completion of high school to the mid—thirties of a sample of about 1,000
men. In this sample:

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The subject of this paper was the exploration of the effects of family

relation to migration decisions: In the case of a

single (aggregated) destination, ties exist when individual ("private") gains
of family members differ in sign. The tied. person is one whose gain (or loss)

is

smaller in absolute value. In the more general case of several potential

destinations, ties exist so long as the gain of at least one spouse in the

family's optimal location is less than his or her "private" maximum. In this
case both spouses can be "tied", although the discrepancy from the private

optimum is likely to be larger for the spouse with the smaller gain. Indeed,
the discrepancy is a measure of the magnitude of the tie. It is a measure
of the negative externality which the decision to move (or to stay) imposes
on the family members in their individual capacities.

integrity so long as

the sum of the ties is less than the gains from marriage. Otherwise, the
family dissolves, and at least one person moves. The theorem that families
move whenever family gain is positive and stay when it is negative must,

therefore, be amended: The sign of the family gain is a necessary, but not
sufficient condition, for the decisions to move or not to move as a family.

The presence of family ties deters migration of families, even though

It creates "tied" movers as well. Since gains or losses from migration

are increased by job mobility, two-earner families are more likely to

than

single-earner

families. Single earners in husband-

wife families are almost always men, so it is families

whose migration is most likely to be inhibited.

pirical evidence on the effects of marital status confirms these

propositions: Married persons are less likely to move than singles,
and the mobility of separated and divorced parents ("others") is by
far the highest. The mobility of singles is dampened by the fact that
many of

them are "tied members of households headed by parents or other

close relatives. In contrast, the mobility of "ot'ers" is auiented
by their relatively recent change of marital status which

creates

a

change of locational equilibrium. The same effect, of course, holds
for newly married couples.

more permanent, and when she is more educated. In contrast, when

families are classified by education of husband, they are more likely

to move: Educated husbands' contribution to family income is larger
and

their gain from migration is morelikely to outweigh their wifes'

losses.
The deterrent effect of wife's employment and of her education
increases with distance, while husband's education is positively re-

lated to the distance of migration. At shorter distances (intra—
county

moves), wives earnings actually permit more inensive search

activities of husbands. Indeed, search of both spouses is not inhibited,
since residential changes or commutes can accommodate job changes of

increases relative to long—distance migra-

tion.

Since earnings of wives permit a greater scope for purposive
search of husbands, working wives increase the probability of husbands'
job change

(by quit). Job changers are more likely to migrate than

those who do not quit; thus wives' work exerts indirectly a positive
effect on migration, as well as the negative effect already described.

The deterrent effect of wives' employment is, therefore, less clearly
observed in the unconditional than in the conditional (or quit) probability
of

migration.

Migration tends to reduce the unemployment of men and to increase the

unemployment of women, since women tend to be tied movers. But to the
extent that men are tied, unemployed men with working wives tend to
search longer at origin than unemployed husbands of non—working wives,

even if they eventually migrate. Migrating wives experience increases
in unemployment, reductions in employment, and labor force withdrawals

at destination, and these effects increase with distance. The reasons,
some of which have already been stated are: Postponement of job search
until after the move, change in intra—family income and substitution
