This paper constitutes a chorough revision of an earlier attempt
to analyze the data collected by the Northeast Brazil Hou.ehold
Pilot Survey, RPO 299, carried out in 1974 by the Department of
Agriculture and Supply of the Sucerintendency for the Development
of the Northeast (DA.i.-SUDENE) in cooperation with the Population
and Human Resources Division of the Development Economics Deprr€nt
and with the Development Research Center of the World Bank. The
data supplied by the above institutions, the financial support
provided by the Ford Foundation and the opportunity to perform
this work at the National Bureau of Economic Research-West are

1. Introduction
Latin America is known for its high rate of population
growth

and for the very high fertility rate of its rural. population.

The decline in Latin American fertility with urbanization and
economic growth has been attributed to many causes, both economic

and non—economic)- it is usually argued that new incentives for

fertility control are associated with these declines, countering
what is called a "traditional", "lethargic", "fatalistic" and
otherwise irrational mentality which favors large families in
Third World countries..2

In this paper it is

proposed

that high rural fertility

Latin America is a deliberate and rational adjustment to the
conditions of agricultural production that prevail in many areas
of the continent. The main finding is that sharetenancy, the
in

predominant

form of organization of production in the sparsely

populated central regions of the Northeast, and a common institution
in much of Latin America,3 contains a set of powerful fertility
inducements which are lost when households face a wage-labor

situation

in agriculture or in cities. Thus, the rapid decline of
the past decade in Latin America4 may be due,in
the general demise of sharetenancy and its replacement by

rural

fertility in

part,

to

sub-family
broad

farms (minifundios) dependent on wage labor5. These

implications are discussed in the

final section of the paper.

The empirical evidence is drawn from one of the most
backward and highest fertility areas of Latin America: .the Brazilian
Northeast. The ecological and economic environment of poor rural

households in that region is described and their fertility and
economic behavior is presented in a series of life—cycle profiles
calculated from a small sample gathered in two representative subregions.
2. Background

a

Over thirty million people live in the Brazilian Northeast,

large geographical area (1,600,00 square kilometers), notorious
for the occurrence of sporadic droughts which destroy agricultural
production6 and cause masses of the rural population to migrate to
cities, to more humid rural areas within the Northeast itself, or

to other regions of Brazil. By expelling people in this fashion,
the drought-prone central areas of the Northeast have contributed
heavily to Brazilian urban population growth problems, while
maintaining a moderate rate of increase within their own confines.7
Steadily drained of prime workers, those who are left behind
constitute the poorest segment of the Brazilian population. In 1974,
the year to which this study refers, Northeastern rural per capita
income was U.S.$ 200, as compared to the national average of
U.S.$ 800. It is also a population of above average fertility, with
child-woman ratios roughly 30% above the national average in 1970.8

6Analysis of annual rainfall statistics since 1930 in the State
of Rio Grande do Norte shows that critical drought years
(annual rainfall less than 250 m.m.) that cause severe crop
losses have approximately 20% probability of occurrence: i.e.,
one year in five. Report N9 921-BR, Northeast Brazil Rio
Grande do Norte Development Project, R DD—ARDD-WB, November 11,
1975, Annex 1 p. 2.
7For example, in Rio Grande do Norte, the drought—prone state
covered in the sample analyzed in this paper, the average annual
rate of rural population growth was only 1.2%, while the urban
rate was 5.3% in the same state from 1960 to 1970, according
to the National Demographic Censuses.

The rural household survey described below is evenly
divided between an out-migration region - the Sertio do Seridô
region of the state of Rio Grande do Norte - and an in-migration
region in the State of Maranhäo. The Rio Grandedo Norte part of
the sample (85 households), was collected in Caicô and Flornia,
two "townships" (municipios) , in the hot semi-arid area of the
central Northeastern region called the sertão (400—600 m.m. of
rainfall per year during 4-6 months and periodic drought; mean
yearly temperatures ranging from 239 C. to 279 C.) . The region
consists of large, flat, rocky stretches interrupted by abrupt
mesas and interspersed by fertile valleys where the land is
cultivated. Population density is very low (2-24 inhabitants

square kilometer) , but the

are lively and peopled by a
population well rooted in distinctive customs, proud and even
per

towns

rowdy, where brawls and shoot-outs are not uncommon. Perennial
cotton and cattle are the main cash—earning economic activities.
Beans and corn are interplanted with first—year cotton for
subsistance. As would be expected under conditions of risky
agriculture, large farms (fazendas) rely on sharing labor contracts
rather than wage or fixed rent agreements.1° Sharing occurs both
in the form of share—tenancy (parceiros)11 and in the form of

10Much of the mushrooming literature on sharecropping links this
form of contractual labor. arrangement with risk-sharing between
landlord and agricultural worker, under conditions of output
uncertainty. See, for example: S.N.S. Cheurig, "Transactions

Costs, Risk Aversion and the Choice of Contractual Arrangements',
Journal of Law and Economics, April 1969, pp. 23-42; D.M.G.
Newbery, "The Choice of Rental Contract in Peasant Agriculture",
Chapter 5 of Agriculture in Development Theory, L. Reynolds
(ed.), New Haven: Yale University Press; and also D.M.G.
Newberry, Risk Sharing, Sharecropping and Uncertain Labor
Markets, IMSS Technical Report N9 202, April 1976, Stanford;
T.D. Reid, "Sharecropping As an Understandable Market Response:
The Post-Bellum South", The Journal of Economic History,vol. 33
n9 1, March 1973, pp. 106—130.

Share—tenants (pçeiros) exercise some entrepreneurial judgment
and relative autonomy over a given, definite plot of land.
Sharecroppers (moradores)exercise no management skills, and do
not have a definite plot of land. They receive a share of the
output they harvest, as a wage payment in kind. Thus sharecroppers are a mix of share-tenants and money wage workers.
Given the absense of fixed rent contracts in the sample, both
sharecroppers and share—tenants will be called, sirnply,'tenants",
in order to simplify the exposition.

month period), flat plains, and a shallow topsoil that is
easily eroded if the forest is removed. A nomadic population of
squatters (posseiros)practices slash and burn agriculture on the
4—6

forest fringe. Corn, beans and manioc are grown for subsistence
and rice is sold to marketing intermediaries who transport and
resell it in urban markets. Extraction of babacu and carnaCiba
nuts are the main cash earning alternatives13 to rice. Rapid soil
erosion in the space of a. few years, plus inability to control the
onrush of weeds, push the farmer ever farther into the forest,
followed steadily by cattle ranchers whose herds prevent the return
of the former vegetation.14
Given their surrounding ecological environments, households
in both surveyed regions face periodic years of financial stress,
either because of the need to move to another location along the
forest fringe or because of a drought in the sertão. Since they.

have rarely been able to save enough to finance the added
expenditures, they frequently fall into debt during these critical

years. However, unless exceptionally high yields occur during the
next inter—crisis years, farmers may not manage to save enough,
after paying off their debts, to survive the next drought or to
finance the next move without having to borrow again. Under fortunate

adequately recorded in the sample.

the occurrence in succession of a sufficient number

of good crops does allow some households to save enough to buy a
small sub-family plot (miniftindio) of their own, typically under
10 ha. in area.15 This is not an unmixed blessing, since small

landowners forfeit their claim to credit customarily extended by

land—lords and become more vulnerable than tenants to year—to—year
irregularities in output.16 Moreover, the existence of labor
slack during much of the year reduces the dependability of the

wage

employment alternative when small landowners needs it most.
Consequently, small landowners sometimes give up their plots and

revert to tenancy in crisis years. There appears to be considerable

account for approximately 60% of the northeastern labor force. 17

The remainder are mainly wage laborers and intermediate size owneroperators.

The principil employer of this labor-force, whether on
a full or part-time basis, is a small group of landlords who own
most of the arable land and virtually monopolize access to water

reervoirs

in the drought prone areas. Since landlords'
agricultural income is dependent on the production of cash crops,
their main problem is to elicit from the unrooted, roving and

of

a specific form of share-tenancy arrangement, quite different in
many respects from its counterparts in Asia18 or in post Civil—War

Southern United States.19 Landlords provide tenants with an elastic
supply of land, according to household size, food consumption credit,

and marketing services (for their cash—crop production as well as

their consumption purchases) , in return for a contractually
fixed share of their output and the right to be paid in kind for

for

all

debts. This agreement protects the tenant household from the

extreme distress occasioned by severe droughts and cushions them
from the impact of milder climatic variations. Since the debt is
paid back at harvest time each year in terms of the cash crop, this
system increases the quantitity of that crop that the landlord takes
to market, above and beyond his own contractual share, in a form
similar to that of the crop—lien system of the South of the United
States in the post—slavery period.20
Aside from the sharing proportion, other features of the
Northeast Brazil sharing agreement are not explicitly contracted.
In particular, neither the labor obligations of the tenant, nor the

credit services of the landlord are formally stated. This
contrasts with the painstaking detail of share—tenancy contracts
elsewhere21; probably reflecting the fact that formal labor contracts
are basically unenforceable by absentee landlords and that informal

20Crop—lien indebtedness occurs when farmers promise to pay back
their loans in kind, in terms of a portion of their future
harvest. This form of collateral on loans was also typical of
Post-Bellum sharecropping in Southern United States. See R.L.

maximum legal rates. Instead of explicit contracts, therefore,

controling and eliciting tenant labor. The fact that debt

good yield happens to come his way. Otherwise, his consumption

26

In addition, given the conditions that prevail in the Brazilian
Northeast, emergency support is required in the occurrence of
crisis years, whether due to drought or travel.27
There are many controversies regarding whether the net
present value of children's future income contributions is positive
or negative at their time of birth, over the difference in social
versus private rates of discount concerning fertility decisions25

most stimulating discussion on the "labor motive" is
contained in John C. Caldwell, Towards a Restatement of

over the extent to which fertility behavior is consciously
determined.29 If it were established that parents in Northeastern
Brazil do receive a net positive flow of income from their
children, that alternative means of ensuring themselves of future
income are available to them, and finally, that there are positive
and

costs to child—rearing as well as to procuring durable income—
yielding assets, then it would be valid to examine whether the

fertility

of those parents may be consciously influenced by the
relative costs of children versus alternative sources of future

income. In order to empirically test such a hypothesis, however,
one must first translate the abstract economic concepts of assets

and costs, into their concrete manifestations in the specific
Northeastern context.
The main alternative to children as a source of future
income

in the rural areas of Northeast Brazil is land. Cattle

are very risky, since they perish in a severe drought. Cooperatives
and banks are unreachable, since they do not extend credit to
those who have no collateral. Investments in formal schooling are
somewhat pointless in an economy with skill requirements learned
through work experience, not in the traditional class rooms of
small rural communities. Out-migration holds the nebulous

promise of higher paying urban jobs, but also the expectation of
long uncomfortable travel on crowded buses to places where cash
is needed for every transaction, plus an indefinite period of
unemployed adjustment to foreign surroundings. Investment in the
future, therefore, narrows down to investment in children or in
land. Land provides income even to very small land'wners, who
frequently sharcrop Out their miniscule plots.30 Old people who
at least own their land are therefore assured of "retirement"
income even if there are no children to support them.

"intermediate" and "wholy modern" populations according to
the degree of conscious deliberateness in their fertility

behavior.

The cost of land, however, is money, that scarce resource
in an economy with a strong subsistance component, where all the

transactions are effected in kind. Moreover, large landlords are reluctant to sell small plots of land and, when they do
so, restrict such sales to low productivity plots far from water
reservoirs. This has caused the progressive partitioning of
already small plots into even smaller units over time, as mentioned
previously, unti' they are no longer sufficient to support a

subsistence circumstances is food.32 In fact, child mortality
is critically high during the weaning ages, 2-3 years, when
children become most vulnerable to food shortages.33

31The time-cost of children, especially that of the mother, is
a critical variable in deliberate—controled fertility models
such as those cited in the first part of footnote ( 24
above. But the availability of grandparents and pre—adolescents
to take care of young children, and the lack of employment

alternatives for these types of household members, reduces
the time-intensity of child-rearing for the household as a whole.

cost of food in those surroundings, in its turn, has
three components. The first is the land and labor cost of food
production by the household itself, there being no capital to speak
of. The second is the retail margin of food purchases. The third
is the interest-rate charged by the creditor who finances interThe

harvest food consumption by deficit households.
The first Cost, the production cost of food, can be
expected to be higher, and to rise more with growing family size,

among small landowners than because of the incidence of diminishing
returns in minifundos. This problem is circumvented among tenants,
however, is circumvented by landlords' practice of alloting land
according to their family size. The second cost, the interest cost
of food, is also much higher for small land owners, who have only
local usurers to finance their consumption, than for share-tenants
who have easy access to the credit extended by their landlords.
The third cost, the retail cost of food, is probably about the same
for all houselolds,. or approximately so. Thus, the food cost of
children, n that environment, should be lower for share—tenants
than for small land owners.

These considerations lead to the prediction that sharetenants would want and have more children than other rural residents
for two reasons. First, because the cost of acquiring childsubstitutes (maiply land) is relatively high for them and secondly,
because the cost of acquiring children (mainly consumer credit) is
relatively low for share—tenants compared to other agricultural

households. One would, in fact, expect tenants to be less conscious
of the costs of child rearing and more aware of the beaefits to be
derived from children.Therefore, they may engage in practices which
increase
may

their fertility and, more importantly, these practices
even be consciously motivated towards high fertility. Given the

common ethnic, regional, cultural, economic background of all these
rural households;given the relative mobility between small land

owners and

of share tenants; given their common

contact with reiativs
who have undertaken the drastic out-migration venture and who have

thereby

adopted lower urban fertility patterns, then both high and
low fertility may be the outcome of deliberate decisions, not of
ritual practices performed with no fertility outcome in mind.

This hypothesis differs both from those advanced by

controled fertility advocates as well as by natural fertility
advocates for Third World countries.34 It proposes that a natural
fertility outcome may be the result of a deliberate but truncated
ef fort to obtain a more than the feasible number of births. This
desire for high fertility may be economically motivated and
analysable

according to a choice-theoretic decision model that
would take into account the specific costs and benefits associated
with children, such as those mentioned briefly in the above
paragraphs.

The following section presents evidence of high desired
fertility among share tenants and low desired fertility among
small

land owners drwn from a small sample taken in Northeastern
Brazil. Evidence of different relative costs and benefits
associated with children among different tenure classes are also

presented at the end of the section.
4. Some Life-Cycle Patterns of Rural Household Behavior in
Northeast Brazil
The original objective of the small household survey
described in this section had been to prepare for a subsequent
and larger survey on the fertility and household behavior of small

farmers in Northeastern Brazil.35 The sequel was never carried
out, however, and the experimental questionnaires became the only
comprehensive source of information on rural household behavior
to emerge from .he project.

in all. 38

of the many known shortcomings of the data base,

it is used in this paper as illustrative support for empirical
propositions, rather than as a vehicle for hypothesis testing. The
demographic and economic life cycle patterns preéented will hopefully
be

thought-provoking for data-starved students of rural household

behavior in the Third World. In addition, some of the findings may
prove insightful for those interested in 19th century demographic
transitions among countries which experienced a sharecropping stage
between slavery, or serfdom, arid free wage rural labor.39
This section describes several salient features of life—
cycle household behavior among tenants, small landowners and
squatters living in the environs of two townships in the State of
Rio Grande do Norte - Caicô and Florânia- and one township in the
State of Marariho
Moncão - in the Brazilian Northeast. As is

-

shown below, tenants are found to have outstandingly high fertility
levels compared to the other population groups and even compared
to natural fertility populations in other countries. Fertility
differentials within the sample appear to be consistent with
differences in childrents contributions to household income

throughout the life cycle in each sample subgroup, as well as
with mothers' and fathers' stated perceptions of the relative costs
and benefits of child rearing. All tables referred to in the text
are in the appendix.

Table 1 shows the distribution of the sample among age—
location—tenure cells. The disadvantage of the small sample is
evident by the small number df observations in each cell and by the
number of empty cells. Ten—year age brackets would have eliminated
empty cells, but they would also have entailed a loss of comparability
between the fertility profiles shown here and those presented by
other authors.

39me absence of pure wage laborers in this sarile is noteworthy,
given the rapid demise of tenancy in the South of the country

and 3.ts substitution by wage contracts. It is said that the
switch

to wage labor in the South is caused by fear of tenants'
claims to land farmed by them over a certain number of years,
Consonant with recent rural labor legislation. If so, this
threat had not yet been perceived by the landlords in the
Serido in 1974.

The largest tenure class in the present sample is
composed of squatters; the smallest comprises

small landowners.

Only three interviewed mothers were under twenty years of age;

thirty-eight (the largest age contingent) were over fifty. This
heavy representation of relatively older women is somewhat atypical
of the region,40 but turns Out to be quite fortunate for the
purpose of calculating retrospective fertility schedules, shown
in the next table.
Table 2 presents estimated retrospective fertility
profiles for the surviving children of all, women in the sample.41
The estimate, however, is heavily influenced by the past fertility
experience of older women and may not be representative of the
fertility behavior of women currently belonging to each age

It is known that couples who control their fertility

prevention thereafter. This leads to profiles rather

later years. One possible test for the presence of active

birth control in a given population, therefore, is the degree to
which fertility profiles flatten out relative to the maximum
births attainable (natural fertility) . In order to better interpret
the figures presented in Table 1, its first four rows are graphed
in Figure 1 and compared to Henry's average natural fertility
profile.43
All profiles in Figure 1 lie well below the natural
fertility case (H), except for children born to Floränia woman
when they were 20to 25 years old. The Flornia schedule (F) is so
much higher than the schedules for Caicô and Moncão (C and M) that
one suspects that differences in subsample composition may be at

play. Accordingly, after regrouping the sample according to tenure
classes in Figure 2, one sees that tenants have uniformly higher
child survival rates; small landowners and squatters cross in the
30 to 35 age bracket.
The fact that these profiles lie everywhere below Henry's
may either indicate widespread birth control — an unlikely
supposition for the Brazilian Northeast - or higher child mortality
than in the control group. In order to correct for child mortality,
estimated age-specific child death rates44 were added to the
surviving birth rates, yielding an estimate of age—specific total
live births. The results are presented in Table 3 and Figure 3.

to age—specific child mortality rates was

the following way. Total deaths reported by
age group were divided by duration of marriage
and then regrouped into five-year Intervals. These fractions
were added in succession, with increasing woman's age. Thus,
contrary to the case of surviving births, the child deaths
estimated are more heavily weighted by the child mortality

experience of younger women. This approximation was made
necessary because information regarding age at death was not
adequately coded for children who were more than one year old

when they died.

Even

estimated

though appropriate confidence intervals have not yet been
for the profiles in Figure 3, their appearance is

suggestive of several important implications. First, fertility
among tenants is outstandingly high by any standard.45 Secondly,
the

fertility profile for small landowners is apparently quite

similar to the natural
do

fertility case (H); i.e., small landowners
not seem to control fertility either. According to the estimated

profiles, squatters are the group most likely to be excercising
some form of control, though they need not be conscious of doing
so. Their nomadic life—style in itself may cause frequent
separation among spouses and
number of births per woman.
Table 4 shows the

of each tenure group -

tenants, small landowners, others (squatters plus part—time sharecroppers) — who justified their family size preference in terms of

cost, in terms of benefits,or in terms of other considerations
regarding children. Health costs are taken to be a response that
either explicitly refers to the physical health strains of child
bearing or that refers to "psychic cbsts" such as pain, fear of
childbirth etc. Economic costs occur when the interviewer says

45

Given the method by which Tables 2 and 3 were calculated,

one should bear in mind the possibility that the slopes of
the profiles will be overestimated if:

i) presently older women had,in the past, relatively
more surviving children than younger women within
each age bracket; or, alternatively,
ii)

presently

younger women had,in the past, more child
deaths than older women within each age bracket.

Neither appear to be the case in this sample or in other
Brazilian rural, regions. The city of So Paulo, in the
South of the country does seem to have very high infant
mortality rates for teen—age mothers compared to older
mothers, but this seems to be related to specifically
urban problems. See Dr. Ruy de Laurenti, "Alguns Aspectog...", Table 7, p. 88.

Tenants perceive child cost much less frequently than small

example46, then Tables 5-8 suggest that tenants indeed are
realistic in counting more on their children's contribution
to household labor than do other tenure classes. Older tenant
families have more resident children (Table 5) and, consequently,
more workers (Table 6) than the other two

groups. In addition,
tenant children put in longer hours than the children of the
others (Table 7) and contribute proportionately more to household
income (Table 8).

The poor showing in Table 4 of the "pension motive" for

wanting children is also justified by prevailing practices. In
economies characterized by a large proportion of subsistence
consumption (Table 9) , inter-household remittances are too
cumbersome and inter-generational income transfers in kind are
effected primarily within the household. Accordingly (Table 10),
gifts, pensions and other forms of income not produced by household members are a small percentage of total family income. They

appear to be primarily a matter of local institutional availability
(e.g. of rural workers' unions,) rather than a matter of age or
tenure. No significant life cycle pattern in the relative ages
of non—nuclear family members was found, even though a vaguely
"U" shaped pattern discerned in Table 10 may indicate that young

pensioners.

presenting Table 4, parents explain desired family size not

only with regard to expected benefits from children, but also
from the point of view of expected costs. The fact that tenants
dc—emphasize child costs, while small landowners and squatters
stress them, suggests that children may be "cheaper" for tenants
than for nontenants.

discussed in section 3 above, the main child—cost
to parents,in the bare subsistance conditions of rural areas in
the Brazilian Northeast,is the cost of food. Food, in its turn,
may be relatively cheaper for sharetenants — due to the
availability of consumer loans extended by landlords — than for
others, whose ties to the local "credit-worthy" elite are weaker.
As

Accordingly,'cheaper"children for tenants would imply that they
borrow more for food consumption than do. others. This expectation
is supported in Tables 11 and 12.

Table 11 shows a strikingly different pattern of
indebtedness between tenants and small landowners. Whereas

tenants exhibit a constant ratio of indebtedness throughout the
life cycle, small landowners concentrate their debts in the
period when child-dependency is greatest. Table 12 shows another
important difference in the indebtedness patterns of tenants and
nontenants. Nontenants have a relatively balanced "portfolio" of
creditors, including banks, while tenants are highly dependent on
landlords for credit and have no transactions with banks whatsoever.

Table 12 also indicates that tenants borrow proportionately more

for

consumption purposes than nontenants.47

Thus, landlords seem to be financing the consumption

of their tenants' large families. Moreover, to the
extent that fertility is food-cost-elastic, landlords appear to
requirements

be creating an incentive for their tenants to have many children,
by cheapening the interest-cost of food. Finally, aside from
having many children and putting them

to

work, their seeming

eneligibility to institutional credit presents a serious obstacle
to

tenants' accumulation of productive assets, other than children.

47Consumption loans in Table 12 cover food, medicine, general
household and travel. Food was the most frequent case.

if tenants are credit-worthy enough to
repetitively merit so many loans from their landlords, their
lack of bank-credit becomes suspiciously sugestive of collusive
activity in the local credit market. Perhaps landlords derive
special advantages from the credit monopoly they enjoy vis--vis
their tenants. This advantage, however, need not be limited to
usurers' income from the interest rate charged. In stipulating
that the debt be paid in terms of the local cash—crop (cotton
in the case of Caicô and Monção, rice in the case of Monçäo), the
landlord-creditor is able to derive supplementary income by later
marketing the debt portion of the harvest (along with the
contractual share, in the case of landlords). Aside from preventing

The

sharing mechanism itself ensures landlords of

the future income flow to be derived from current financing of

tenant fertility. These conjectures are supported indirectly by

The other two components in the differential cost of
food between tenants and nontenants are its production and retail
cost, discussed briefly in section 3 above. The production cost
rises quickly for small landowners, as their family size increases,
due to diminishing returns on their own xniniscule plots. Because

of

diminishing returns, small landowners are forced to seek part-

time sharecropping, wage employment and

other

income earning

activities in order to support their families. As may be seen
in Tables 13 and 14, thiS need is most pressing during the late
twenties and early thirties, when children are small. Tenants, on
the other hand, are sai4 to be spared the incidence of diminishing
returns due to the practice whereby landlords allot land according

to family size. This is yet another way In which landlords may
be cheapening the food—cost of children for their tenants, in this
case its production—cost. For their part., by stimulating family
labor on their land, landlords would also be ensuring themselves
of increasing utilization of their notoriously under utilized
properties in the land—abundant — labor-scarce Northeastern
agrarian economy.

Finally, the retail cost of food is also said to be
largely under the control of landlords, who alledgedly force
tenants to buy from the farm—store, thereby deriving retail income
from the tenancy arrangement. This aspect cannot be analysed
within the present sample, since the origin of purchases was not
enquired. The sample does, however, provide some support concerning
landlord monitoring of the production—cost of food for tenants,

via elastic supply of land to larger families.

Table 15, which shows acreage farmed by tenure class
tenuous, for the
supposition that older (larger) tenant families receive more land
and age group, provides some support, albeit

than younger tenants. Before 30 years,of age tenant plots are
smallar than those of small landowners and squatters, but become
much larger by the ages of 45 and over. These older tenant familyheads sometimes command the agricultural labour of one or two sons
and four or five grandsons, all working their plots in the same
property and all living together in the same house. According to
Table '16, these are the highest income' households in the sample.
In fact, they may constitute the ideal which all others strive

to attain. Abundance is generated by pooling the production of
many workers into one large consumption urtit, even though

individual

consumption levels may be low.

The attainment of the large successful tenant family

may be a deliberate objective,served by low food cosprovided by
landlords and high fertility behaviour practiced by tenants. It
does not seem to be an unintended outcome of unconscious social
practices, since Northeastern rural households belong to the saxte
cultural—ethnic blend of whites, blacks and indians. There does
not even seem to be any consistent difference in age of marriage
among tenure classes (Table 17) , even though early marriage would
evidently serve the pro-natalist advantage of tenants and

late

marriage would serve the opposite interests of small landowners

squatters. Quite the contrary, the large tenant farni ly
appears to be a goal that is set upon early in life, toward
and

parents work by moving less than other rural households
(Table 18), establishing permanent ties of social and economic
dependence upon their landlords, having as many children as
possible and working them as much as they can.49
which

Conclusions
Northeastern share—tenancy is an institutional arrangement which
regulates a specific set: of transactions between tenants and

gain access to land and foodstorage services during destitute periods. Landlords gain access
to family labor from the overlapping life cycles of individual
landlords. Landless peasants

members. Intrinsic to this relationship is food—consumption-cumcrop-lien indebtedness. Its short-run effect is to provide an
incentive toward increasing household labor effort and specialization
in the cash crop. Its long—run impact apparently stimulates
increasing family size: both by boosting the benefits of larger
families and by reducing their cost. Thus, share—tenancy seems

had expected that tenant children would also put in fewer
hours in school than those of small landowners and squatters.
But the very spotty evidence collected in the sample
(Table 19) does not lend support to this supposition.

be linked to high fertility.50
This is a very new hypothesis and merits further

investigation. In subsequent papers, the food-cost and laborbenefits of children in a tenant-landlord economy will be contrasted
with those of a wage-labor agrarian economy. These elements will be
incorporated into a fertility model, which will be tested on the
rural portion of the nationwide household survey collected by the
Estudo Nacional da Despesa Familiar (ENDEF—FIBGE).
In Brazil, rural fertility rates have declined significantly

during the past decade. Meanwhile, the recent and rapid transformation
of share—tenants into a wage labor force has coincided with
increasing under—e'irloyment and labor — surplus conditions in the
urban economy. Since worstening urban employment prospects
progressively dampen the migratory threat, new commercial farmenterprizes may no longer feel the need to boost the reproduction
of the rural labor force or to tie workers to the land, as
slaveowners used to do by force and as traitiorial landlords
still do by indebtedness. The empirical evidence presented In this
paper suggests that the decline in rural fertility in Brazil, may
signify not a "modernization" of the rural labor force, but its
conscious adjustment to the loss of fertility inducements experienced
previously under tenancy.
