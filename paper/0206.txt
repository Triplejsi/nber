SOCIAL SECURITY AND HOUSEHOLD
WEALTH ACCUMULATION: NEW
MICROECONOMETRIC EVIDENCE
Martin Feldstein and Anthony Pellechio*
T HE social security program will pay benefits
of more than $100 billion in 1978.1 Public
transfers on this scale are large enough to have
profound effects on the behavior of the U.S.
economy. The most important effect, although
not the only one, is likely to be the impact of
social security on private saving and aggregate

an actuarially fair social security program leaves
the budget constraint unchanged, there is also no
change in each year's consumption. The social
security tax that is paid each year therefore reduces private saving by an equal amount. For an

actuarially fair social security program, this is
equivalent to reducing the personal wealth accumulated before retirement by the actuarial
present value of future benefits.2
It has been common in discussions of social
security policy to reject this picture of rational

capital accumulation. The present paper contributes to the analysis of this issue by providing new
evidence on the extent to which the accumulation of wealth by individual households responds

Some have even suggested that the provision of social
security may actually cause some individuals to save more
because it serves as a reminder of the need to provide for old
age. See Katona (1965) and Pechman et al. (1968).
The irrational saving behavior of a small fraction of the
population might justify a compulsory saving program even if

it had a small aggregate effect on saving. This is a quite

We define 'social security wealth" as the present actuarial value of future social security benefits. The adjective
"fungible" is used to distinguish household wealth as traditionally defined from the total household wealth. The calculation of social security wealth is discussed in section III below
and in Feldstein (1974).
8 Until 1972 the law made no provision for future increases
in the schedule of social security benefits. Increases occurred
frequently, but required explicit acts of Congress.

This important aspect is developed in Kotlikoff et al.

(1977).

Upton (1974). Our econometric evidence deals only partially

and middle income families is, however, contrary to the prediction of the Barro-Miller-Upton theory. For a more detailed

discussion of the reasons for believing that the effects of
offsetting intergenerational transfers is quantitatively small,
see Feldstein (1978). For those who remain agnostic about

the magnitude of offsetting bequests, our evidence can be
interpreted as quantifying the extent to which other reasons
cause a departure from the complete replacement predicted
by the traditional life cycle model.

1976a))9

Before turning to the econometric estimation
of the wealth accumulation equation, it is important to recall some of the limitations of the current data. First, we have no information on either
private pensions or life insurance. Our measure
of household assets therefore understates true
net worth and this understatement is likely to be
an increasing function of income and perhaps of
social security wealth as well. To the extent that
households substitute private pensions and life
insurance for other forms of asset accumulation,
the regression estimates will understate the effects of income on asset accumulation and overstate the effect of social security. These biases
are likely to be relatively small because pension
coverage was relatively poor for this age cohort
of men (born in the decade from 1898 to 1907).
Second, the labor income variable bases an estimate of lifetime earnings on information for only
two years. Although this would be appropriate if
each individual's earnings grew exponentially,
there is in fact substantial variation in earnings
from year to year. To the extent that this introduces random measurement error in the estimate
of both YL and SSW, their coefficients will be

the point estimates generally indicate that each
dollar of social security wealth reduces fungible
net worth by somewhat less than one dollar. The
standard errors are too large to reject the implication of the traditional life cycle model that there

is dollar-for-dollar replacement, but the estimates are also consistent with a rather wide
range of other replacement rates. In general,
however, the estimates are incompatible with the
hypothesis that differences among households in
social security wealth have no net effect on private wealth accumulation.
Before looking at the parameter estimates, it is

useful to examine some characteristics of the
sample and of the population that it represents.
Our final sample contains 126 married couples
plus 12 additional households with a man who
was not married at the time of the survey. The
sampling probabilities imply that these observations represent 4.5 million couples and a total of
4.9 million households. The mean net worth of

these 4.9 million households (as of the end of
1962) was $20,801 and the corresponding stan-

dard deviation was $32,054. Their average labor
income was $5,555 with a standard deviation of
$2,806; median family income (including nonlabor income) for the entire U.S. population was

through 8 make a crude adjustment for the effect
of age by making the equilibrium ratio of wealth
to income (a1 of equation (1)) a linear function of
age. This is equivalent to adding a variable to the

security on saving in particular. We are as conscious as anyone of the limitations of the current
data and of the problems of interpreting our reequation that is the product of the individual's sults. We believe, however, that the current esage and labor income; AYL = AGE x YL. The timates do support the validity of the life cycle
