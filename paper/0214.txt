ASPECTS OF OPTIMAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE: SEARCH,
LEISURE AND CAPITAL MARKET IMPERFECTIONS

I

Unemployment Insurance (UI) can be seen as redistributive with a
trade—off between equality and efficient 'search' to be set beside
the existing 'effort' and 'education' models of optimal taxation

(e.g., Mirrlees (1971), Atkinson (1973)). The redistributive role of
UI is accentuated by capital market imperfections which tend to make
consumption vary more closely with current income.
In this paper UI will be assumed to take the form of a proportional pay—roll tax used to pay a subsidy to all the unemployed.1
However the analysis here, and elsewhere, raises a number of questions

aoout this form of UI. The loss of a given amount of income will
involve a larger utility loss (given a perfect capital market) for an

older man who has fewer years over which to make the adjustment. Should
he be given higher benefits? Shavell and Weiss (1977) argue that if
benefits decline over time their disincentive effect is reduced; however

Flemming (1977, b) has shown that if there is a progressive income tax
on annual income, there is an efficiency argument for benefits increas-

ing with duration. The incentive effects of UI depend on the mix of
benefits in the traditional form of periodic payments conditional on
continued unemployment, redundancy payments (either lump sums or
unconditional payments fr a set number of periods) (Hamerniesh (1977))
and loans (the natural response to an imperfect capital market).

Finally, as Baily (1977) mentions, subsidising search activities by the
unemployed is another element in the potential policy mix.

Baily (1977) presents a two period model of the redistributive
(insurance) argument for UI which involves a curious mixture of perfect

and imperfect capital market assumptions. On the one hand, the

unemployed can apparently not borrow at all against future earnings
(i.e. earnings beyond the second period); on the other hand, the second
period is not homogeneous and borrowing from the second (employed)
section of it to finance consumption during unemployment is not only

possible but costless. The framework is unsuited to the analysis of
unemployment at the beginning of a career and is also inadequate for the
identification of that part of a UI scheme justified by capital market
imperfection.

The object of tils paper is to examine the importance of capital

market assumptions. A special continuous—time model is developed in
sections II —

IV

which is applicable to the perfect capital market case.

It can also be used when there is no capital market at all (section IV).
For 'reasonable' parameter values the optimal replacement rate (ratio
of benefits to gross wage) appears to be less than 20% when capital

markets reperfect but over 70% when they are non existent (i.e. no
saving or dis—saving).

These models follow Baily in ignoring leisure; however, in the
perfect capital market case this produces some rather surprising results, e.g.
the

unemployed spend almost as much money on searching as they would

earn if employed (and sometimes more). This result might be more

plausible if
included

the

opportunity cost of an unemployed man's time

were

in the costs of search, i.e. if leisure is valued. Sections

VI and VII present results for a similar model with leisure (which has

to enter in a rather special way). The result is that in the perfect
capital market case the optimal replacement ratio falls to less than 5%,

while when there is no capital market it falls from 75% when leisure
has

zero value, to 45% when it is valued at one quarter of the wage,

25% at half the wage and 0% at three quarters of the wage.

—3-II

Just as portfolio theory with its multiplicative random rates of
return is facilitated by the assumption of an iso—elastic or constant

relative risk aversion utility function, so the analysis of a random

additive labour income stream is simplest if there is constant aclnte
risk aversion. We therefore assume

U(C) = — cte8C

> o

(1)

As an example of the stochastic dynamic programming techniques to
be used subsequently we examine the following problem: given

(i) initial wealth W;
(ii) the utility function (1);

(iii) a constant interest rate r;
(iv) labour income y generated by a stationary Wiener process
so that (undiscounted) income over any interval h has mean
and

variance

proportional to h;

(v) additive separability over an infinite horizon with pure time

preference at the rate p.
What is the optimal consumption strategy?

is

a solution to our problem (although we have not proved its unique-

ness).

Equation (8) implies that negative financial wealth, which has not

been ruled out, might involve negative consumption. This reflects the
fact that the utility function (1) does not have the property that

U' + +

(U' (0) =

a;

U' goes to plus infinity only as C

goes to minus infinity). To impose a non—negativity constraint on C

without changing U(C), C >

0,

would be both arbitrary and mathematically

difficult but the present tractable model is certainly deficient in this
respect.

Despite this deficiency equation (8) does enable us to identify a
number of distinct potential effects of UI on welfare through its effects
on the distribution or level of consumption.

(a) For a given distribution of wealth UI, if it raises unemploy-

ment, tends to lower mean labour income (m) but the effect of
this on consumption may be offset by a reduction in the variance

(v) of net income.
(b) In the longer run the distribution of wealth itself depends

on m and v; a reduction in the latter will reduce the inequality
of wealth and consumption. Moreover by reducing savings a smaller
v reduces mean wealth and mean consumption unless offset by
macro—policy.

(c) In a general equilibrium context, and in the absence of offsetting macro—policy, UI induced changes in accumulation and labour

lead

to changes in interest rates and wages similar to

of other aspects of social security (see Flemming

If the budget is used to insulate capital accumulation

from these ef2ects UI 1ich raises unemployment must also lower mean
Consumption.

(d) As r +

0

the dependence of consumption on wealth and on

the variance of labour income both decline. This suggests, as we
shall see in subsequent calculations, that the level of optimal

UI will be an increasing function of the real intet rate
tending to zero with the interest rate. However, UI does not, in
the absence of offsetting macro—policy, increase monotonically

with r. The effect of UI on savings, and thus wealth, has an
effect on consumption proportionate to r.

It'

The model of equations (1)—(8) cannot be used as it stands since
it cannot easily admit of search activity undertaken by the unemployed.
In the absence of search it is hard to obtain a disincentive effect of

UI (indeed if one simply pcstulates that unemployment rises with UI

replacement rates the optimum may be a tax on unemployment). Both
search and compensation for the unemployed require that there be an
identifiable unemployment state.

Consider therefore the following model, in which we follow Baily
in ignoring labour/leisure choice; at any one time part of the popula-

tion is employed and earns a gross wage of 1, part is unemployed and

earns nothing. UI changes these numbers to (1 —

t)

and d (for

'dole'). Balance of the UI fund implies

t(1 —

where u is the unemployment rate.
A proportion X of those employed lose their job per unit time

while a proportion C of the unemployed find jobs. We assume here
that A is given by technological change etc. and is independent of

UI.

C depends on search strategy which is influenced by UI. Note

that in the absence of population growth the steady state value of u

is A/(X + c)

so that (9) becomes

=

Xd/c.

(10)

We initially retain the infinite horizon assumption of the previous
section in which case there are two indirect utility functions, of wealth,

one for each employment state, and two consumption functions. Using

subscripts e and u for the states the following equation, comparable
to (3) above, can easily be derived

P(W) = U(Ce(W))

If we assun that there is no externality to search we might consider
the following model of the determination of c.
The th unemployed man's chance of finding a job in a unit

where p, the success rate, is assumed to be exogenously fixed by the
behaviour of employers.3
Equations (32) imply that search, and the duration of spells of

unemployment, are both independent of wealth. This independence
enormously simplifies the dynamics of wealth.

Some idea of the structure of the model can be obtained if we

consider the case of p =

r

As was suggested in relation to

equation (8), and is confirmed below, the optimal dole is zero if

Thus the unemployed

dissave 1.92 times their wage, spending half of this on search and

consuming the other half; as mentioned in the introduction, this

possibly

implausible result is modified in the model of sections VI. and VII
which includes leisure.
At 0.96 the consumption of the unemployed is identical to that of

the employed. This reflects the fact that in the absence of discounting
and with an infinite horizon the unemployed have the same human capital
as the employed while financial assets/liabilities are irrelevant. It

course individuals donot have infinite lives. If we consider
finite lives the- consumption optimization conditions change in three

ways: where we have rW- alone we will find W • a

(r,t) — the annuity

value of W at r for the T years to the horizon; the savings rates
and

y

though still independent of W vary with T, as also does

optimal search s — search, like saving, being less worthwhile the
nearer the agent is to his horizon. These features of the finite horizon
case make the dynamics of wealth very much more difficult to handle than in
the infinite case.

For tractability, therefore, we are restricted to the latter for
which we evaluate below the instantaneous social welfare of a population

of immortals at an arbitrary date T after they set out on the process
with equal wealth W(O) and the equilibrium distribution of unemployment

(which depends on the U[ regime). If T is large enough we can

As described above we took A =

as the

standard values of those parameters. Since most people work for about

40 years we took T = 20

for the standard case although with a mean

duration of five years for employment spell it is rather short for our
asymptotic approximation of the wealth distribution. The standard value

of r

( p) was taken as 10% per annum; as a net real rate this is on

the high side but it should be biased upwards to make some allowance for

finite lives. Given our wage unit consumption is near to unity so that

8 measures both absolute and relative risk aversion; we take 8 = 2
as standard.

Most parameters were also tried at half and twice the standard
value; with three alternative values of each of six parameters we would

have 729 (= 36) combinations. This number reduces to 13 if only one
parameter at a time is allowed to deviate from its standard value.

In the standard case average ring in response to earnings
uncertainty is, in the absence of UI, 0.15% of the gross wage, accumulated
for 20 years this adds 3.0% of the wage to mean wealth (remember that the

accruing interest is all consumed) and thus at the 10% standard interest

rate, adds 0.3% of the wage to mean

consumption.

In this case the error

16

introduced by our partial analysis is trivial. However when r = 50%
this factor adds a non—trivial 8% of the wage to mean consumption in

the absence of UI which falls to 5% when d

30%. For this reason x

is included in the table below, it represents the addition to mean

consumption japardized by UI. x(d*) is also reported; if

x(d*)

x(O) —

> 0.2%

of the wage the savings effect is likely to have a

significant impact on the estimate of the optimal level of UI. In these
cases we also evaluate the optimal UI when its effect on private savings
is suppressed.

The results of these calculations are set out in table 1 below.
Section (1) of the table sets out the different combinations of parameters
in rows 1—13 (rows 14 and 15 repeat rows 4 and 5 but the optimization

(in section (iii)) is with the savings effect suppressed). Section (ii)

gives the values of c, s, u, z, x, V etc. in the absence of UI C

while

section (iii) gives the optimal values of d etc. for these

parameters while the impact of optimal UI on search, unemployment and

the

variance of wealth is set out in section (iv).

Comparison of rows 14 and 15 with 4 and 5 reemphasizes the
importance of the savings effect when r is high. Suppressing this
effect doubles the optimal tdole' at r = 20%.

that changing A changes only the unemployment rates (proportionately).

In practice leisure rather than wealth is what is used up in search

as mentioned in the introduction. It is important for the tractability
of the model that the intensity of search be independent of wealth;
since consumption depends on wealth this means that we need a utility
function with constant relative risk aversion in consumption and the
marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure independent
of the level of consumption.

The function must be

— -(C+O(1h))

U(C,h) =

where the consumer is endowed with one unit

of

(46)

useful time

and h is the proportion of it devoted to work

(9..)

(per

period)

or search (s).

With a wage rate of unity labour income is £ so that it follows from
(46) that

9.,* =

0,1, as e

We assume 0 < I

i.

so that given the opportunity people work full

time. Search, unlike work, is subject to diminishing returns so that
(or search)

s* will be interior. With a dole for the wholly unemployed, work/is
only worthwhile if

but not sufficient.

With the three changes (50) for (19), (52) for (32) and (53) in (35),
the previous computations can be repeated with suitably amended parameter
values.

The results of these calculations are set out in table 3. The

Conclusions

Within

the family of rather special models considered here it seems

that current levels of replacement (50—80% in the U.S. and Western

Europe) could only be rationalised by invoking extreme capital market
imperfections. This naturally raises the question of modifying the

beefit structue tc introduce a loan element. As with student loans it
would probably be necessary to relate repayments to subsequent earnings.
As this would have further disincentive effects some combination of
loans and grants is probably called for.

Although modelling intermediate cases of capital market imperfection would be difficult, variation of the benefit formula to include
lump

sum payments on job loss and subsidies on search would be fairly

simple. Less easy, but also feasible, would be the introduction of a
distribution of skills (gross wages) and the integration of UI with a

The models presented here relate to a population homogeneous both

with respect to the wage and parameters (A) of job—loss and (gp and
Ti) representing the productivity of job search. Cripps and Tarling
(1974) have suggested that the distribution of the length of completed

spells of unemployment implies that C is not constant in the popula-

tion. In our model c would vary with the UI replacement rates but it

is plausible that gp and r also depend on the characteristics of the
individual and the market for his particular skills. Creedy and Disney
(1977) have inferred from the distribution of the frequency of spells of

unemployment that A is also distributed in the population.
If the population were divided into identifiable groups each

characterized by its own w, A, T, and gp, then in principle, we could
identify the tax and dole appropriate to that group. However our knowledge is more likely to be represented by a joint distribution of these
parameters and prescribing for that case is considerably more difficult.
One possible feature of it is that we would expect the parameters
applicable to the unemployed to vary with the duration of their unemployment, introducing yet another reason for relating UI benefits to duration.

A NOTE ON EFFICIENT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE UNDER
PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAXATION

Recent theories of unemployment such as those in Phelps et.al. (1969)

emphasize the search activity of the unemployed. Expenditure of time or
money in search is of the nature of investment. As with other investments
one can ask whether the tax system is neutral with respect to the returns
to search.

Time spent searching rather than working for current income reduces

taxable income and tax paid, to this extent the Revenue subsidis search.
On the other hand, if search leads to the finding of a better paid job

the Revenue takes a share of the gain. If the tax is progressive the
Revenue's share in the gain will exceed its share in the costs thus

discouraging search. At the same time the explicit taxation of the
interest returns on other investments reduces the opportunity cost of
capital used up in search and thus encourages search.
In this note we formalise these statements and use them as the basis
for the specification or a system of unemployment benefits designed to

make the fiscal treatment of search neutral. We consider three separate
cases:

(a) progressive taxation of earned income only (no interest income
tax) on a continuous basis —

the

tax liability accrues as a

progressive function of the instantaneous rate of earnings;

(b) a similar tax on the sum of earned income over a period such
as a year;

(c) the continuous case (a) with income, including interest, as
the tax base.

In each case we consider an unemployed person who has the opportunity

to earn at the rate W, this represents the opportunity cost of continued

search. The person believes that search for an irirvl of time St would

—2—
lead to an employment offer at the earnings level W +

(SW.

Both the

present opportunity and the enhanced offer are expected (correctly) to

provide employment at the respective wages for a period of T years
after which the employee's prospects are independent of the preceding
wage.

(a) On these assumptions the gain from further search is

V(r,T)[N(W +

(SW)

— N(W)]

where V(r,T) is the present value of .1 p.a. for T years at the tax

free interest rate r and N(.) is the net of tax wage. The cost of
obtaining this gain is assumed to be only the net income foregone; this

is the net wage N(W) arising from the available offer, less the net

benefit N(B) for which he is eligible.
Thus the private return on searching for the extra period (St is

V(r,T) .

(N(W +

(SW)

— N(W))/(St(N(W) — N(B))

(1)

while in the absence of any other distortion (i.e. wages equal marginal

social product, r is the marginal social product of capital) the
social return is

V(r,T)(SW/6t . W

(4) is easily applied to a system, like that in the U.K., where

there is a personal allowance (P) of exempt income above ich a wide
band of income is taxed at a constant 'basic' marginal rate b. For

all levels of W taxed at the basic rate

N(B) = — b

.

(W —

P)/W = bP/W

whence

N(B*) = bP.

Since b <

I,

bP <

P

and the benefit will not be taxed. Thus the

optimal gross benefit B* = bP;

1/3) at W = P

(5)

B.*/W has a maximum value of b (about

and declines steadily thereafter.

If the tax schedule were linear throughout, i.e. incorporated a
negative income tax, and was not progressive in the marginal rate,

N(O) = bP

and no specific unemployment benefit is called for. Thus

this analysis calls for positive unemployment compensation on efficiency
grounds alone under any income tax progressive in the marginal rate.
However, the income tax which gives rise to this case presumably
reflects a concern for redistribution which would probably raise the
Baily (1977) and Flemming (1977).)
optimal benefit ratio above the level required for efficiency. (See /

(b)

The analysis of this case is simplified if we ignore spells of

unemployment

which stretch over two financial years. We consider a man

who, having lost his job at the beginning of the year, finds himself in

the position described above after a fraction u of the year has passed.

If u = 0 no compensation is called for as the marginal tax rate

in the current year, which represents the Revenue's share in the cost of

search, is the same as the marinal rate in future fully employed years
which is the Reverue's share in the fruits of search. If

Thus over the course of a year's unemployment the tax—free benefit rate
should rise from zero to m(W) if m(O) = 0.
The result, that benefits should increase with the duration of
unemployment, is contrary to the analysis of Shavell and Weiss (1977)
which points out that falling benefits provide for current consumption
while lending urgency to search by not underwriting future consumption.
The result of the present argument would be reinforced by any tendency

of W to rise during unemployment as a result of search turning up
opportunities superior to the previous ones but still below the

Since r(i — m)

Some light can be thrown on the implications of (8) by considering

This suggests that for realistic parameter values interest income
