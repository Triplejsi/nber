ABSTRACT
THE CUMULATIVE UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES:
EVIDENCE ON THE NISINTERNEDIATION HYPOTHESIS
J. Huston McCulloch

The term structure of interest rates is carefully analyzed

over the period 1947—77 in order to construct a monthly series
on cumulative unanticipated changes in long—term interest

rates. This series is a sort of synthetic interest rate,
changes in which over several months or years represent en-

tirely unanticipated changes in interest rates. The behavior
of this series is examined over recognized business fluctuations, and it is found to be actually more reliably pro-cyclic
than the raw long—term interest rate, in spite of Kessel's
finding that the market tends to correctly predict the direc-

tion of change of interest rates over phases. That the series
is pro-cyclic supports the hypothesis we have put forward in
another paper, tnat business fluctuations may be caused by
"misintermediation", by which we mean the traditional mis-

matching of asset and liability maturities on the part of
financial intermediaries.

THE CUMULATIVE UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES:
EVIDENCE ON THE MISINTERMEDIATION HYPOTHESIS

In

an earlier paper (McCulloch 1977) we have argued that business

fluctuations may arise as a consequence of the traditional mismatching of
asset and liability maturities on the part of financial intermediaries.
We call this mismatching "misintermediation."

Briefly, that argument runs as follows: In the Fisherian model of
the determination of the term structure of interest rates, planned supply
of aggregate output of consumption goods is assumed somehow to match planned

demand for these goods point by point throughout the future.1 As the economy moves forward in time, expectations regarding future interest rates,
as reflected in the original term structure's implicit forward' interest

rates, will, barring unforeseen technological developments or "dynamic

inconsistency" in tastes, be perfectly realized. Furthermore, all supply
and demand plans will be perfectly realized, and the economy will develop
without aggregate excess demand or aggregate excess supply of current output

ever appearing. The economy's growth rate will be relatively steady, and
any residual fluctuations in it will have been fully anticipated.
However, we actually live in a world of institutionalized misinter—

mediation. For centuries banking has been a highly regulated industry,
and this regulation has kept it in its traditional mold of borrowing
short and lending long, in spite of the the risks that that
practice entails.

This misintermediation breaks the link

between current plans for future demand and current plans for future supply,
a link that would exist to a much greater extent in the world of balanced
'For a modern restatement of this model, see 1-lirshleifer (1970), 109—113.

intermediation. Although the present discounted value of planned future
demand must equal the present discounted value of planned future supply,
there is no reason why planned supply will equal demand point by point

throughout the future. As the economy moves forward in time, planned
supply of current output will not necessarily match planned demand. In
the event of a recession (an excess supply of current output in terms of
prior plans), an unanticipated fall in interest rates will be necessary to

clear the market for current output. In the event of a planned excess

demand (a disequilibrius boom), an unanticipated rise in interest rates
will be necessary.1

It is well known that interest rates are pro—cyclic. In fact, the
NBER uses the peaks and troughs in various interest rate series to help

date the standard reference cycles.2 If the yield curve were always flat,
or at least had no systematic change in shape over business cycles, it
would at once follow that the unanticipated changes in interest rates are
in accord with the predictions of the misintermediation hypothesis.

However, Reuben Kessel (whose untimely death in 1975 was a great loss
to the profession) demonstrated, in his classic work on The Cyclical Behavior

of the Term Structure of Interest Rates, that at cyclic troughs the yield
curve

tends

to be unusually upward sloping, so that immediately prior to an

expansion, the market is expecting interest rates to rise. Furthermore,

1Cagan (1969) investigates the relationship between interest rates and
business cycles. We, in contrast, argue that it is not so much the level
of interest rates that is important, but rather whether the current level
was arrived at by unanticipated changes.
2Burns and Mitchell (1947).

—3—

at peaks, the yield curve is often "humped", reflecting a small liquidity
premium at the short end together with anticipations of a fall in interest

rates over the coming contraction (1965, 59—95). The casual evidence is
therefore ambiguous. The market may be correctly anticipating the cyclical
changes in interest rates,

underanticipating these changes, or even over—

anticipating them.

The purpose of this paper is to determine how unanticipated changes

in interest rates really behave over the business cycle. We do this by
carefully analyzing the term structure of interest rates, and constructing
a monthly series on cumulative unanticipated changes in interest rates.
This series is a sort of synthetic interest rate, changes in which over
several months or years reflect entirely unanticipated changes in interest

rates. We then examine how this series behaves over recognized business
cycles, to see whether changes in it are in conformity with the misinter—
mediation hypothesis.

DEFINITIONS
For the specific purpose of investigating the misintermediation hypothesis, the present author has developed a technique of curve—fitting the
term structure of interest rates from security prices, so as to determine

implicit forward interest rates as precisely as possible. This technique
is described in detail in two previous papers (McCulloch 1971, 1975b).

Briefly stated, for each point t in time for which we have security price

11f business fluctuations have any predictable regularity, their being
associated systematically with certain unanticipated changes in interest
rates violates the assumptions of rational expectations. However, in an
earlier paper (McCulloch l975c), we have presented evidence that business
"cycles" have no such regularity. See also Anderson (1977), and Savin (1977).

order to emphasize the importance of comparing the move-

ment over time of the forward rate for a given date in the future.

This

instantaneous forward rate corresponds to a hypothetical forward contract
for a loan one instant in duration, so its value for any one s is not of

any great macroeconomic significance. More important is the

it can be used as a two—dimensional summary of the three dimensional jumble

of mean forward rates. Still, as t changes, p(t, s) may go up for some
values of s at the same time it goes down for other values of s. We want
some sort of average of these forward rate movements for all maturities.
With observations on the term structure tt years apart, we could consider

s*(t) =

min(s(t),

Smax(t + st)),

(10)

and compute the amounts (t) by which the forward rate on a loan to begin
at t + t and to end at s*(t) is exceeded by the subsequently observed
corresponding spot rate:

(t) = ri(t

Then the series

(12)

1=0

would behave like an interest rate, yet first differences in it would,

after adjustment for a liquidity premium, reflect pure unanticipated changes
in interest rates.

However, the series defined in (12) is not entirely satisfactory.
In principle, with ideal data, we could estimate 5(t, m) and therefore
p(t, t+m)

for

arbitrarily large m, even several hundred years into the

future.1 The mean forward rate, because of its property (9), gives equal
weights to p(t, s) for all these maturities. We would prefer somehow to
give greater weight to the immediate future, declining weight to the inter-

mediate future, and little or no weight to the very distant future. Furthermore, in practice S(t, m) can only be estimated with decreasing relative
accuracy as m becomes very large. At some maturity, perhaps 60 to 80 years,
any empirical estimate of it would be insignificantly different from zero,

even though we believe that it is "really" still positive.2 Beyond that
point, mean forward rates defined by (7) lose all statistical significance.

Both these problems could be avoided by arbitrarily selecting a
maturity, say 10 or 20 years, that one feels includes the most important

forward rates. However, this procedure still gives equal weight to all
included maturities. Furthermore, forward rates for the excluded maturities

11n the 1920's, there were railroad bonds outstanding with three, four,
and even five hundred years to maturity.

this has happened, though in principle it should.

do affect to some degree the terms on which current output can be exchanged

for aggregated future output. We would prefer not to disregard them altogether.

This problem can be solved by means of a new concept developed by Burman

and White (1972), called the "par bond yield". It has long been well known
that the notion of a "bond yield curve" is somewhat ambiguous, since unless
the yield curve is flat, bonds with the same terminal maturity but different

coupon rates should not in general have the same internal rate of return

or "yield to maturity") Even using the bond's "average duration" does not
solve this problem. However, there is an unambiguous yield on bonds of
maturity m that just happen to be selling at par. It does not equal the
point payment yield, but is a well defined concept in its own right. It
is now used by the Bank of England as the representative yield curve for
coupon—bearing bonds, though it has not yet been officially adopted by
the U.S. Treasury.
This par bond yield y(t, in) can be computed straightforwardly from

the discount function, using the fact that if a bond is selling exactly

at par, its yield just equals its coupon rate. If we assume continuous
coupons for the sake of simplicity, this coupon rate can be found by solving
the equation2

Equation (16) states that the yield on par bonds with terminal maturity
in

is

a weighted average of the instantaneous forward rates for all

maturities out to in, where the weights are the present value of a dollar

at the maturity in question, and therefore serve as a good index of the

importance of these rates for the current economy. The single payment
yield to maturity r(t,m) as defined in (5) does not necessarily approach
an asymptotic value as in

becomes large, since there is no telling what

instantaneous forward rates will be in the very distant future, so long

as they are positive. The par bond yield curve, on the other hand,
must approach an asymptote, so long as perpetuities have finite prices.
Equation (16), incidentally, answers an objection that is sometimes
raised against the hypothesis that long—term rates reflect averages of

expected future short—term rates. Joan Robinson (1951, 102n.), for
example, has protested that if this were true, anyone who buys a consol

would have "to think he knows exactly what the rates of interest will be
every day from now to Kingdom Come," which obviously no reasonable person

does. However, he does not have to know these rates exactly in order to
define the consol rate to any desired precision. In fact, for any given
precision, his beliefs regarding these rates can dissolve into total ignor—
ance beyond some finite horizon far short of Kingdom Come.1
The approach we adopt in this paper is to compute a forward par bond yield,
and then compare it to the subsequently observed corresponding spot par bond yield

one month later. These differences, adjusted for liquidity premium, are
again pure unanticipated changes in interest rates. When we accumulate
these forecasting errors, changes in the resulting one—dimensional series

over business cycle phases will also represent unanticipated changes in
interest rates.

Three maturities are relevant here:

rn,1, the distance into the

future the implicit forward contract is to begin (which we will set equal
to st), m2, the duration of the forward contract, and m3, the distance

into the future of the completion date of the forward contract. We
have rn1 + m2 =

m3.

The forward par bond yield b(t,

m1, m3) is then the

coupon rate that will make the value of a forward bond, evaluated at time
t's term structure, just equal to par, discounted to time t using time t's

term structure. To find this rate, we solve

'The obverse of this proposition is that when p(rn) is inferred from actual
bond prices, it has an intrinsic tendency to become increasingly poorly
defined as m becomes very large.

By an operation analogous to (15) and (16), it can be shown that this
forward bond yield is an average of the forward rates p(t, s) for s
between t + in1 and t + in3, each weighted by 5(t, s—t). The differences

DATA
In order to abstract completely from default risk, the data we use are

for U.S. Treasury Securities. Price data were assembled for the last business
day of each month, from the end of December 1946 to the end of May 1977,

a total of 366 months. Since these dates represent the dividing line between
two months, they could equally well be associated with either month. We
will refer to them in this paper as representing the "beginning" of the

subsequent month, i.e., January 1947 to June 1977. In fact, the quotations

2Unfortunately, these differences of weighted averages of forward rates have
no simple interpretation in terms of a weighted average of differences in
forward rates, since the relative weights change between t and t + tt.
Nevertheless, it can be shown that an across—the—board increase in forward
rates, whatever the shape of the forward curve, will lead to a positive value
of (t), even though the new term structure will be giving higher weights
to shorter term forward rates, which might well be substantially lower than
the longer term rates.

—11—

are for actual delivery and payment early in these months, about two

business days after the quotation date. The data for January 1947 to
April 1966 were collected by Reuben A. Kessel from the quotation sheets
of Salomon Brothers, and were processed under the supervision of Merton

H. Miller and Myron Scholes. The data for May 1966 to June 1975 were
collected from Salomon Brothers quotation sheets by Joel Messina and

obtained with the assistance of Jay Morrisson. The data for July 1975
to June 1977 were collected from Wall Street Journal composite dealer
quotations by Krista Chinn under the direction of the present author.

All tax—exempt securities were rejected as being non—representa-

tive of the market as a whole. (By the mid—1950's all but a handful
of these had disappeared). "Flower bonds" often sell at a price premium
because they can be surrendered at par value in payment of estate taxes

if they are owned by the decedant at the time of his death. It was not
practical to omit all of them, because for many years they constituted

most if not all of the long—term securities. The following compromise
was adopted for flower bonds: Those that 1) were selling below par;
2) matured after 1982; and 3) were selling within $4 per $100 of face value
of the lowest priced flower bond were excluded.

Any that did not meet

all three of these criteria were included.1 No attempt was made to compensate for the price discount that existed on many bonds in the earlier
part of the period because of their ineligibility for commercial bank

purchase. This discount was greatly reduced after the Accord of March 1951,
and most of these bonds became eligible by the mid—1950's. Except for the

'See MeCulloch (1975b, 817—822) for further discussion of these estate
tax bonds.

—12—

tax—exempts and selected flower bonds, almost all U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes,
and Bonds were included.

From this data discount functions were fit using a cubic spline,

tax—adjusted technique similar to that described in McCulloch (1975c))
This technique was slightly improved by setting the "flat" price equal to
the present discounted value of the sum of the after—tax semi—annual interest

payments plus the principal, rather than using our earlier simplification
of setting the "and interest" price equal to the integrated present dis-

counted value of the after—tax couponspius the principal, which treats
the coupons as if they arrived in a continuous stream. Before—tax equivalent instantaneous forward rates, single payment yields, and par bond

yields were calculated from the parameters of this spline discount curve
for selected standard maturities sufficiently close together to allow linear
interpolation when desired.

Appendix I indicates for each month the largest standard maturity
less than or equal to the maturity of the longest outstanding security

observed. For most months we have more than 20 and sometimes even 30 years
of data, though there were a few years in the early 1970's when our rule

for flower bonds forced us to cut back to 14 or even 13 years. Fortunately,
these months had relatively high levels of interest rates so that forward
rates beyond these maturities would have had relatively little weight in

the par bond yield anyway. Appendix 2 shows the par bond yield for the
longest available maturity for each month. This series also appears on

1The tax adjustment is especially important n the late 1950's and 1960's,
when the long term market was dominated by bonds selling well below par and
having a substantial capital gains tax advantage.

generated them, will be available from the NBER in New York, together with further description. The author takes sole responsibility for them, however.

Chart I. Although these rates (and the other rates discussed below)
are at best accurate to 1 or 2 basis points (.01 or .02 percent per
annum), we have tabulated them to the nearest tenth of a basic point, to
prevent their stochastic properties from being affected in any way by
rounding errors.

THE LIQUIDITY PREMIUM

For
(19),

all 365

pairs of adjacent months, (t) was computed as in

using the longest

maturity available both at time t and

(by inter-

polation) at time t + tat. Appendix 3 shows the accumulated sum of these

increments. We have arbitrarily started the series at 2.241%, the longest
available par bond yield at the beginning of January 1947.
Changes in this series are not pure unanticipated changes in interest
rates, since forward rates are known to exceed expected future spot rates

by a liquidity premium. Long (1972) has recently refuted the traditional
Hicksian explanation of this premium in terms of risk aversion in the
face of interest rate uncertainty, thus confirming the intuition of Bailey
(1964, 554) that risk aversion can just as easily lead to a "solidity premium"

(negative liquidity premium) as a positive liquidity premium. Nevertheless, the evidence indicates that a positive liquidity premium does exist

at the very short end of the term structure. This sort of premium could
be due to the demand for liquid secondary reserves on the part of traditional
banks, as suggested by Lutz (1940, 48), or perhaps to interaction with the
demand for money, as argued by Kessel (1965, 44—58).

For the specific purpose of being able to adjust forward interest
rates to infer participants' expectations of future interest rates, we

have, in a separate paper (McCulloch 1975a), measured the size of this
liquidity premium for a broad range of maturities, using data from 1947

to 1966. We found that if the term premium is not constrained to have
any particular shape with respect to maturity, it cannot be estimated with
any usable accuracy for implicit forward contracts longer than a year or
so in duration. However, if we define the premium rr(m) on an instantan-

eous forward rate p(t, t ÷ m) as the difference between this forward
rate and the market's expectation, as of time t, of the future "spOt"
interest rate p(t + m, t + m),

ir(m) =

p(t,

t + m) —

EP(t

+ m, t + m),

(20)

we found that this premium does not differ significantly from the functional
form
ir(m)

= b(l—e—am),

where

(21)

—l

a = 6.059 yr
and

b = .4335 percent per year.
This functional form implies that the typical shape of the forward curve,

as well as that of the yield curve, increases monotonically towards an

asymptote 43 basis points above its lowest value. For the forward curve,
it more than half—way approaches this asymptote in 2 months (1/6 year).

The yield curve approaches the same asymptote, but more slowly. A premium
like this, that monotonically increases toward an asymptote, is consistent
with the theories of Lutz and Kessel, so for present purposes we accept this
functional form as valid.

Equation (21) implies a very small liquidity premium for forward con-

tracts of long maturity. If m2 is the duration of the forward contract

—15—

(2 — S1 in definition (7)) ,

it

can be shown that the premium is, at the

.95 confidence level, less than 10/rn2 basis points, regardless of the

distance into the future the forward contract is to begin (McCulloch

1975a, 115). Thus, on a 10 year single payment implicit forward contract, the
premium is less than 1 basis point, hardly worth bothering with by itself.
However, in the present paper we propose to accumulate 365 forecasting errors, so these liquidity premia may add up to a substantial

sum. In order to adjust for this premium, we must derive the premium in
a forward par bond yield implied by formula (21). Since expectations
must fluctuate randomly (see McCulloch l975a, 98 text andn.6), we just have

and m2 is again m3m1.
This approximate premium is a function of the exact shape of the
discount function at time t, which makes it difficult to evaluate.

However, by a further approximation, we can obtain a simple expression

for it. Suppose that R(t) is the "general level" of interest rates at

Note that although our specification (21) of the liquidity premium on instantaneous forward rates (and therefore on single payment forward rates as in (9))
does not depend on the level of interest rates, the derived

approximate premium

p(R(t), m1,m2) in (27) does depend on this level. This is because the forward
par bond yield gives higher weight to shorter term p(t,s)'s, (which have the

largest liquidity premia), the higher the level of interest rates. It will therefore be an increasing function of the level. To illustrate, if in1 is 1/12 years,
is 20 years, and interest rates stand at 2½% (R(t) =

.025),

the premium will

be 0.18 basis points (0.0018%). At 5% interest, the premium will rise to 0.22
basis points, and at 107., to 0.32 basis points. By

themselves, these adjustments

are well less than the measurement error in the forward par bond yield, but they will
accumulate to a noticeable amount over 30 years.
Appendix 4 shows the accumulated sum of the increments iy(t) to each of
which has been added a liquidity premium adjustment calculated

with (27). For

each month the current value of y(t, s*(t)_t)/l00 was used as R(t). As with
the series in Appendix 3, we arbitrarily start this series at the initial level

of the longest available par bond yield, 2.241%. In this case, however, it
rises to 3.918%, instead of to 3.203%, a difference of 71.5 basis points over

365 months. This difference averages to about 0.20 basis points per month.

—18—

Our adjusted sum of increments still leaves a little to be desired.

First, there is no reason why it could not go negative, and thus behave

unlike an interest rate series. To illustrate, suppose that initially
the one—year rate stands at 2% and the two—year rate at 3%, so that participants expect next year's one—year rate to be 4% (abstracting from

liquidity premium). If Instead next year's one—year rate is 1%, there
will have been an unanticipated fall of 4 — 1 = 3%.

This fall will take

the cumulative sum to —1%, even though all actual interest rates and

expected rates are in fact positive. Nothing this extreme actually occurs,
though we can find intervals when a rise in yields to maturity was actually
overanticipated, and therefore represents an unanticipated fall in

interest rates. There are only a few individual months for which this

occurred, though it is not uncommon over periods of several months. One
example is the period from January 1947 to August 1954, when the long
term par bond yield rose from 2.241%,to 2.549%, a rise of 30.8 basis points,
yet the cumulative sum of unanticipated changes fell from 2.241% to 1.853%,
an unanticipated fall of 38.8 basis points.

A more important problem is that changes in the cumulative sum of
unanticipated changes series reflect the actual unanticipated change in
terms of percentage points, so that relative changes in this series do not
ref 1ct similar relative differences between the expected par bond yield

and the subsequent spot yield. For example, a rise from 6% to 8% represents the same percentage change in the price of a perpetuity (which a

long term par bond approximates) as does a rise from 3% to 4%. Yet if
the cumulative sum series happened to stand at 3% at the beginning of a
month when the market was anticipating a 6% par bond yield for the end of

—19—

the month, an 8% realization would drive the cumulative sum series to
5%, the same percentage point change, but twice the relative change,
that actually occurred.

In order to correct both these problems, the series we should
actually concentrate on is the multiplicatively cumulative unanticipated

change in long term

bond yields, which we will call y*(t). We again

start this series at 2.241%, and thereafter define it by multiplying

its previous value by the ratio of the realized spot yield to the pre—
vio.usly anticipated corresponding yield, adjusted for liquidity premium:

=

Relative

*(t)Y(tt,
b(t,t,

s*(t) —

t-t)

s*(t)_tJ_pR(t),t,s*(t)_t_tJ

(28)

changes in this series, even over several months or years, then

represent the actual cumulative relative change in interest rates, even for
periods when its value has drifted far away from the actual current level
of interest rates.

In order to make it available for other researchers, we have

shown the full series in Table 1, page 21. It is never accurate to
within less than a basis point, but we have again indicated the tenths
of basis points so that its stochastic properties will be unaffected by
rounding considerations.

If all changes in interest rates were correctly anticipated by the
market, our series would never change, regardless of the behavior of

current long—term interest rates. We therefore see from our series, that
while minor fluctuations in interest rates were almost entirely unanticipated, the secular rise from 2.24% in 1947 to around 4.2% in 1965 was

almost entirely anticipated by the market. On the other hand, the large

—20—

rise in rates from 1965 to well over 7% five years later (following the
adoption of inflationary financing to help acconmiodate the Viet Nam war),

was almost entirely unanticipated, since it is accompanied by almost

exactly the same proportionate change in y. The slight rise in rates
from 1970 to 1977 was actually somewhat overanticipated, as indicated by
a slight decline in y*.

EVIDENCE ON THE MISINTERMEDIATION HYPOTHESIS
Now let us turn to the object of our investigation, the direction of
unanticipated changes in interest rates over historical business fluctua-

tions. The misintermediation theory predicts unanticipated falls during
disequilibrious contractions, and unanticipated rises during disequili—

brious booms. Now the growth rate of the economy during a period of
perfectly equilibrious development need not be constant. It probably
will not be negative, but even that is not certain. Nevertheless, it
seems safe to assume that recognized historical business tcyclesU, at
least the larger ones, represent unanticipated changes in the growth of
output of consumption goods, and therefore represent the sort of disequilibrium booms and recessions we are looking for.

Table 2, page 22 indicates the recently revised standard NEER
"reference cycle" peak and trough dates for the period of our series,

and the corresponding value of y*. Since the peak and trough dates
represent extreme activity during the course of the month indicated, while
our y*(t) series refers to the beginning of each month, we have used the
average of y* at the beginning and end of the month in question as being

representative of the month as a whole. For each contraction and expansion,

we have indicated the percentage change in y*. We have computed this
change logarithmically, as 100 times the change in the natural logarithm
of y*, so that a 10% rise followed by a 10% fall will leave y* exactly

where it started. Since a long—term par bond approximates a perpetuity,
whose price is the reciprocal of its yield, these percentage changes
roughly indicate the unanticipated fluctuations in the value of current

output relative to a constant stream of future output. Thus, output
in April of 1958 was worth 16.4% less in terms of future output than the
market anticipated it would be worth eight months previously.

We see that in all but two of the eleven phases considered, the
unanticipated change in interest rates is, indeed, in the direction pre-

dicted by the misintermediation hypothesis. Although, as Kessel determined,
the market generally correctly determined the direction of change in
interest rates, it systematically underestimated the total change, and

did not overanticipate it. The evidence is therefore consistent with
the assertion that most postwar U.S. business fluctuations were caused
by the mismatching of intertetnporal consumption and production plans

brought about by misintermediation.
The two exceptions are the contraction that set in as a consequence

of the Arab oil embargo in late 1973, and the preceding expansion that was

interrupted by the oil situation. Since it seems safe to assume that
the Arab oil embargo was not caused by the maturity structure of the
balance sheets of U.S. financial institutions, we may conclude that mis—

intermediation is not responsible for all business fluctuations. Nevertheless, in every case when the unanticipated change in the value of output
relative to future output is 10% or larger, the change is in the direction

—24—

predicted by this hypothesis.

Because the Burns—Mitchell reference cycle concept only recognizes absolute reductions in output as contractions, it may overlook
disequilibriously sluggish periods when the growth rate is positive

but not as high as anticipated. Even for the fluctuations it recognizes, it may tend to place peaks too late and the troughs too early,
since when a trend is added to a pure cyclic series, the maxima tend to

be retarded and the minima advanced in time. To avoid these problems,
Ilse Mintz has constructed a "Growth Cyclet chronology, shown in Table 3,

page 25. Essentially, the upturns and downturns in this chronology
identify peaks and troughs in detrended aggregate economic activity.
The direction of change is in the direction consistent with the
misintermediation hypothesis in five out of nine growth contractions
and in six out of eight growth expansions, a majority of cases but not

an overwhelming majority. However, two of the four contractions with
increases in y* and one of the two expansions with decreases in y* have

changes that are smaller than 2% in absolute value. Two of the remaining
three exceptions are associated with the oil recession of 1973—1975.
The remaining exception is the mini—recession of 1966—1967, which on the
one hand was not a major recession, and which on the other hand occurred

at a time of rising inflationary expectations. Even then, there was a
substantial fall in the series during the course of the mini—recession,
from September 1966 to February 1967.

In order to test whether the cumulative unanticipated change in

interest rates is significantly pro—cyclic, we calcu1ted the mean monthly
change in the logarithm of this series, separately for contractions and expansions.

These results are shown in Table 4, on page 27. In each case we excluded
the changes that occurred during the actual peak and trough months, since
it is ambiguous whether they belong to the expansion or to the contraction.

The t tests indicate that log y decreases significantly during reference
expansions and increases significantly during reference expansions. It declines
during growth contractions, though not significantly, and increases signif 1—

cantly during growth expansions. In both types of cycle the difference in
means indicates that the expected change is significantly higher for expansions

than for contractions. The normalized von Neumann ratios ttNVtP (which have
been normalized to have mean 0, standard deviation approximately 1.0, and to be
positive when positive serial correlation is present) throughout indicate no
significant serial correlation.

However, the standarized range statistic "SR", defined as the range
divided by the estimated standard deviation, is highly significant for all
cases, indicating significant leptokurtosis, which violates the normality

assumption necessary to use the t test. The statistic

relying on a normal assumption.'

'We do assume here that the distribution of forecasting errors is more
or less symmetrical, so that the mean and median have the same sign.

We see that this statistic is significantly positive for both types of

expansion. It is negative for both types of contraction, though it is
not significantly so in either case. Since the median
fall during contractions is not significant, it is important to test whether
the probability of a rise is significantly higher during an expansion than

during a contraction. This hypothesis can be tested with a simple 2 x 2

contingency table test (e.g. Mood et.al. 1974, 454). This test produces
a statistic which is asymptotically x2j if the probability is the same.

This statistic is significant at the .95 level if over 3.84, and we see
that indeed the probability of y* rising is significantly higher during
expansions than contractions for both chronologies.
For comparison, we also perform the same calculations for YL,the
par bond yield for the longest available maturity, which is the series

tabulated in Appendix 2. We see that it rises significantly during both
types of expansion, by both the t and Xmed test. It falls during reference
contractions, but not significantly even by the t test. During growth
contractions, the mean and median are actually positive, though neither

is significant. Although the difference between expansion behavior and

contraction behavior is significant for reference cycles by both the t
and

tests, this difference just barely passes the t test and actually

fails the

test for growth cycles.

For further comparison, Appendix 5 shows the behavior of the level of the
additive cumulative unanticipated change y* tabulated in Appendix 4, along

with the level of

our hopes for it. Furthermore, the

pro—cyclic nature of our series is

significant by many tests even when we include the oil recession of 1973—

1975, which our misintemedjation

theory can excusably be allowed not to

1Because of
a mathematical identity, rises in forward rates go hand in hand
with lower holding period yields for longer term
obligations.
Therefore,
the type of evidence we have looked at here is similar in
ultimate-nature
to that investigated by Kessel and Clark (1976). In their Table
they find unanticipated capital losses on long term bonds during 2, Part C,
expansions
from Nov. 1945 to Nov.
1970, and Unanticipated capital
gains during contractions.
These gains and losses are
significant, at least using a t test, so their
findings are in conformity with ours.

QUALIFICATION
The misintermediation theory of business fluctuations predicts
unanticipated declines in the real Interest rate accompanying recessions
and unanticipated rises in the real interest rate accompanying disequi-

librium booms. What we have shown is that historically, unanticipated
changes in the nominal interest rate are in the direction predicted. We
have no way of knowing for certain from this evidence the direction of

change of the real interest rate. It might be that the entire change has
been in the expected inflation rate and that the real interest rate has

had no unanticipated change at all. It might even be that the real interest
rate actually rises unexpectedly during contractions and falls during expansions, and that the change in inflationary expectations more than compensates for this behavior of the real rate.

1

It is not implausible that inflationary expectations are pro—cyclic,
and therefore contribute to the pro—cyclic nature of the nominal interest rate.
However, we have no reliable way of reading peoples' minds to determine actual
inflationary expectations, let alone the term structure of inflationary expec-

tations which, strictly speaking, is the necessary consideration.2 It is
difficult to believe that all of the cyclical fluctuation in the nominal interest rate is due to changes in expected inflation, let alone more than one

hundred percent of this fluctuation. Fisher In particular would be forced
to admit that inflationary expectations change only gradually, and do not

vary much over a business cycle lasting a few dozen months. We therefore
maintain that there is a good case for our interpretation of the evidence.
1lndeed, the monetary business cycle theorists Irving Fisher and Ludwig von
Mises argue that this is in fact the case.
2William Gibson has done some exploratory work in this direction.

CONCLUS ION

The series we have constructed on the cumulative unanticipated change
in interest rates provides strong evidence in support of the hypothesis

that many business fluctuations of the type that have occurred in the
United States since World War II are caused by the mis—matching of inter—

temporal consumption and production plans. We lay the ultimate blame for
this problem on "misintermediation", the traditional failure by financial
intermediaries to match the maturity structures of their assets and liabilities.

Our synthetic interest rate series turns out to be actually more reliably
pro—cyclic than the simple long—term interest rate, this in spite of the
fact that the latter is used to help construct the standard business cycle

chronologies. It is hoped that this series will be of use to other researchers
in macroeconomics, whether or not they accept its interpretation in terms
of the misintermediation hypothesis.
