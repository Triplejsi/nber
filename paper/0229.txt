ON THE ACCURACY AND PROPERTIES OF
RECENT MACROECONOMIC FO!ECASTS

Abstract

The aim of this study is to contribute to the measurement and analysis
of errors in economists' predictions of changes in aggregate income, output,

and. the prIce level. n11 sample studies of forecasts can be instructive,
it their limitations must be recognized. Compilation of consistent forecast
records extending over longer periods of tine is necessary to establish a
reasonably reliable base for assessments of forecasting behavior and. perfor—
mance. Thus the historical record of post—World War II forecasts assembled

in the 1960's by the NB is here extended and updated.
The end—of—year predictions of annual percentage changes in GNP earn

good marks for overall accuracy when judged according to realistic rather
than ideal standards. Moreover, they are found to have improved significantly

in the period since the early l96O s compared with the previous years after
World War II.

The corresponding predictions for GNP in constant dollars (real

growth) and the GNP implicit price index (inflation) are considerably poorer.

The former suffer fran large turning point errors, the latter from large
underestimation errors. Indeed, forecasts of inflation are not much better
than projections of the most recently observed inflation rates, and they lag

behind the actual rates much like such projections. But the errors in
forecasts of real growth are negatively correlated with the errors in forecasts
of inflation, which helped to make the nominal GNP predictions more accurate.

is often d.ifficult to determine what constitutes a suitable

models and. techniq.ues unchanged for long as they seek inprovements and try to

adapt to new developments in the economy. Hence, a particular forecaster's

past record is often a hi.ly uncertain basis for inferences how he will

casters on the evidence of how well they predicted change in. a particular

sce forecasters will, be ahead of others by sheer chance or for some idio-

time would be required to rank the forecasting individuals, groups, or models
with a modicum of confidence, and, such evidence is essentially lacking
(Zarnowitz, 1967, 1971; Christ; McNees, 1975).

The proliferation in recent years of mu.ltiperiod. quarterly macro-

forecastz offers no substitute for long historical series. These are rich
data containing much interesting material that certainly deserves to be carefully recorded and analyzed. However, such forecasts, and. so their errors,

tend. to be internally correlated in at least two ways: (a) serially, Within
each

sequence made from a given base period. and (b) across the successive

sequences, which overlap and thus refer partially to the sane target period.
Each multiperiod forecast is a joint product of the common infornation,
technique, and juderit used, and each depends on previo..s forecasts of which

it is to some extent a revision. Thus, errors in the data, models, procedures,
and jtidents, autocorrelated disturbances, and certain types of distributed

are

all likely to induce interdepend.encies within and between the multi-

Consequently, measures of average accuracy, bias, etc., calcui.ated from such

valid.. First,

small-sample studies cf fore-

casts are still needed and can be instructive, but their llmi tations must be
recognized. Second, it is necessary to compile and. examine forecast records

extending as far back in time as possible, so as to gain information, take a

records of recent predictions in a proper perspective. Historical data on•

high rate. The failure of forecasts during these years was widespread, with
but a few partial except±ons; the develonents of the time could not be
predicted well, with estimates based on data and relationships for the 1930's
and false analogies with the early post-World War I period. When a recession

working of these balancing factors. Thus, it is not surprising that forecasts

These surnary

measures, then, present te annual forecasts of real GNP

in a generally favorable light. However, the accuracy of these forecasts
varied greatly in different years, which at times impaired seriously their
usefulness, and this does not show up

in

the snmmry. As suggested by the

averages with regard to sign (lines 7-9), the usual tendency of forecasts to
underestimate changes prevailed in the first half of the period 1959-76 but

cot in the second. half. Actually, the errors varied considerably in. each subperiod, primarily reflecting cyclical change and. in particular the disturbing
effects of missed downturns. Real. GNP turned down in
19Th1.,

l951.,

1958, 1970, and.

but of the 10 predictions for these years which are available eight

specified continued rises and only two succeeded in signaling declines.

Main, and not surprisingly, nearly all of the significantly large overetimatioa errors refer to the years during which national output grew at
relatively low or decreasing rates, and, most of the larger u.nderestiination
errors refer to the years of high real growth rates.
It is of considerable interest to note that the tn'ning-point errors
are much larger than other errors (on the average about 2 1/2-3 times larger,

for all forecasts in this collection). Thus, even though relatively few,
these directional errors had, a strong adverse impact on the overall accuracy

of the real GNP forecasts, as indicated by the following tabulation.

sively declining as the forecast span is lengthened.). The inevitability
(indeed;

even the existence) of a trade-off between errors at major turning

of economic forecasts to give a great deal of attention to turning-

point errors.

Actually, most of them realize this, as shown by the widespread

practice of analyzing such errors (Hicinan, ed., 1972; studies in I.E.R.,
19714._75). However,

there is certainly much

need for improvement here, and

room for some new initiatives (e.g., on. how to use current signals from
leading indicators, see Vaccara and. Zarnowitz).
The worst single year for the predictions covered. in Table 2 was 19714.,

on

the e'e of which forecasters across the field missed the onset of a serious

recession. This, plus the smaller turnin;-Doint errors for 1970, are

the

main reasons for the rise in the average errors of these forecasts in

1969-76

compared with the earlier years. But the rise in. the absolute errors was not
large, and there was no decline in accuracy as measured by the criteria of
cumparisoris with extrapolations and correlations of predicted with actual
changes

(Table 2, cols. 3 and ii.). Limited evidence

from one longer series of

suggests that real P was predicted with similar average errors in

the two 8-year periods 1953-60 and. 1969-76, with much smaller errors in the

current and. constant dollars. The forecasts underestimated strongly (much

more than the last-change extrapolations) the average inflation since 1961

(lines 7-9). The predicted and. actual percentage changes in the price level

are all positively correlated, but the correlations for 1969-76 are generally
lower than their counterparts for (TP and, still more so, for real GNP (lines
10-12).

Forecasts of inflation often have much in common with projections of

the

last observed rate of inflation. To illustrate, correlations between the
errors of these forecasts and the errors of the correspond.ing extrapolations
produce the following r2

coefficients:

Michigan, 1959-76: 0.51; CEA,

1962-76: 0.78; ASA/NBER, 1969-76: 0.95; Wharton, 1969-76: 0.80. For growth

rates in real G1'TP, the correlations between forecast errors arid, extrapolation

errors are also positive but throughout lower, in most cases much lower.
These results are not surpristng and they have a positive aspect inasmuch as
forecasts shou.ld be closer to extrapolations of a given type in those cases
where such extrapolations are

from the

data prior to the 1976

revision of the national income accounts, serve as

comparable reali-

zations. The full version of the study will include also comparisons with the

revised

data in an integrated treatment of forecast errors and measurement

errors. Adjustments of the

forecasts for base revisions, used in

some fore-

cast evaluations, are regarded as questionable and. are avoided.

The mean absolute errors of GNP

forecasts

are close to one percentage

point (like the annual forecasts, see Table 1) for two quarters ahead, and

half of that or less for one quarter ahead. Over longer spans, the MAE
rise more or less steadily by increments varying from 0.3 to 0.5 of one perabout

centage point for each additional quarter; they approach

and exceed 2 percen-

tage points for l1.-quarter and 5-quarter spans, and 3 percentage points for
7-quarter and. 8-quarter spans, respectively (Table 5,

lines

1-3). Consistent

with earlier findings and interpretations for various types of multiperiod
forecasts (see, e.g., Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 60-72), the MAE increase less than

in proportion to the extension of the span. The errors in forecasts of
percentage

changes expressed on a per-unit-of-time basis (roughly, errors

divided by

the length of the effective span) neither rise nor decline syste-

matically as the forecast reaches further into the future. The same applies
to the errors of the implicit predictions of changes during the successive

common patterns such that their errors depend strongly and similarly on the
characteristics of the time of their origin.

conclusion

is analogous: the type and size of forecast errors depend criti-

cally on the economic properties of the target periods vis--vis those of the
periods of origin. Forecasters perform best when the two

periods

are alike,

belonging to the same already recognized phase, e.g., a continuing expansion
as in 1971-72

(most of

subperiod. I). They perform worst when the target

falls into a new phase, particularly when the latter departs sharply from the
currently established pattern (forecasts made in. subperiods II and. III, and

those for subperiods III and. IV provide many examples, particularly in the

long-span categories). Such period characteristics are much more important
determinants of forecast errors than are any differences among the forecasters.
Chart 1 shows that both Chase and DRI persistently underestimated the
percentage changes in GI'TP for su.bperiods I and., much more strongly, II. Both

forecasters overestimated the changes in their short forecasts for subperiod
III and. underestimated them in their long forecasts for the same phase. Overest.mates prevailed. in all forecasts for the last phase covered., IV, and. here

the average errors behave in an unusual fashion, first increasing and then
decreasing with the lengthening span.. This is due to offsets between. the
real growth forecasts with positive ME and the inflation. forecasts with
negative ME (see Charts 2 and 3).
Chart 2, which covers the real growth forecasts, shows u.nderestimates
dominating the errors for I and. II, much larger MAE aud. positive lylE for III

and. IV. The huge average errors for the two latter phases derive mainly

from the forecasters' failure to predict the declines in real GNPI5 The longspan errors for the 1975 recovery (IV) are strikingly large here.

1975:1 and increased thereafter, the actual changes over longer spans ending
in 1975 are negative; that is, real GNP was lower during period IV than in.
1973 (II) and. during most of l974. (III).

VI. Concluding Observations

The end-of-year forecasts of annual percentage changes in TP earn good

marks for overall accuracy when judged according to realistic' rather than

ideal standards. Moreover, they are found to have improved in the period
since the early 1960' s compared with the previous years after World War ii.

and IPD

(inflation)

are weaker. The former

Forecasts

of inflation are not much better than projections of the most

recently observed inflation rates, and. they lag behind the actual rates much
like such projections. The deficiency of price-level forecasts, documented.

in this and other studies, surely impairs the general ability of economists to
analyze the prospects for the economy. provements will require major
advances in our knowledge, presumably through research based on carefully

worked out data (abstract speculation abounds bat good. information and. observa-

tion are rare in this area).
The favorable record of annual G? pred.ictioris does not imply that fore-

casters can perform well the more difficult task of predicting quarterly
changes in '1P within the year ahead or even beyond it. Forecasts for the
year as a whole can be satisfactory when based on a good record. for the first
two

.6
quarters; they tend. to be more accurate than forecasts witt longer spans.

An examination of the recent xnultiperiod. predictions shows that the errors
for real GNP and IPD cumulated rapidly beyond the spans of 2 to 1 quarters.

Previous studies have shown the cumulation to be as a rule less than propor-

tional

to the increase in the span, but in this period the build-up of errors

was much

greater

than usual. No doubt, in less turbulent times the longer

forecasts can be considerably more accurate, but this fair-weather argument

is

not very persuasive or helpful. At the

of detailed forecasts reaching

out

present

time, the predictive value

further than a few quarters ahead must be

rather heavily discounted. Again, what is critical here is theoretical analysis and empirical research that would lead to improvements in our

ability

to

errors of predictions for the individual parts of the year at
offset each other to some degree (Zarriowitz, 1967; McNees, 1973, i97).
These gains from aggregation over time resemble those from aggregation over
sectors (GNP is predicted with smaller average errors of relative change than
are most of its components; see Zarnowitz, 1967, 1972; Promm and Klein, 1976).
