Family Size and the Distribution of
Real Per Capita Income
By EDWARD P. LAZEAR

AND ROBERT

Per capita income is an important notion
in economics. It is used as an explanatory
variable with great frequency in theoretical
and empirical analyses, and its size distribution is one of the long-standing topics of
economic research. Moreover, it is a concept in which public concern is as deep and
sustained as is professional interest. However, information about income is often
obtained for household units instead of
per capita units, or for only a subset of
persons (for example, wage earners). This
creates difficult problems with the measurement and, indeed, the concept of per
capita income. The problems include: 1)
within any household the apportionment of
household income to members is not in general known; 2) comparison of household
income per capita among households of different structures requires judgment about
the relationship between real income and
family size. Remarkably little study has
been done on the first of these two issues)
This paper is another contribution to the
vast literature which addresses the second
issue.

This latter issue is usually characterized
as one of determining the income equivalence among households of various sizes.
These equivalence scales can either adjust

nominal income in different sized households into a common unit (i.e., into income
in husband-wife-two-children equivalents)
or adjust the number of household members
into a common unit (i.e., into the number of
full-time adult equivalents).
Many studies have estimated these equivalence scales since Engel in 1895 first
estimated the newborn-babyequivalence
amonghouseholds of various sizes. One of
two approaches to the estimation of equivalents has generallybeen used: 1) a revealed
preference approach in which household
size/structure variables are included in
empirical demand studies and the estimated coefficients on these variables are
used to infer equivalence; 2) a judgment
of "experts" is relied upon to yield equivalence on the basis of some quasi-objective
standard (such as daily nutritional needs)
and a cost estimate of these items (food)
for each household type is then expanded
by some factor to approximate an equivalent income level. Most research favors the
first approach (see S. J. Prais and
Hendrik Houthakker; A. P. Barten; John
Muellbauer) while the official U.S. poverty
level equivalents are based on the
Orshansky equivalence measures derived
from a presumed nutritionally adequate
economy food plan (see B. S. Mahoney).
Our work also uses the first of these two
approaches; it differs from many of the
other studies not in basic concept but in its
empirical strategy. While most studies build
family composition effects into a relatively
formal structural model of demand and impose considerablerestriction in order to obtain an estimable system, we use a reducedform approach which requires much less of
the data.
Professional and popular interest in per
capita income is predicated on the assumption that income is an observable, mono-

tonic index of economic well-being. One
way to characterize the problem of family
size equivalenceis to ask about differences
by family size in the transformation between income and well-being. We suggest in
the model developed below that well-being
(or utility) is derived from the service flows
obtained from market and nonmarket goods
and services; the service flows obtained
from any particular bundle of market goods
depends on the environment in which they
are consumed including the quantities of
nonmarket goods and services with which
they are used. Nominal income adequately
indexes the level of market expenditures and
hence the bundle of market goods and
services. However, its rate of transformation into service flows differs by family size
and family structure, because these affect
the environment and the nonmarket goods
and services with which the market bundle
is used. If in circumstance A, a particular
market bundle which costs $1,000 yields 20
units of service flow while in circumstanceB
that same bundle yields 30 units of service
flow, then in real terms the bundle in circumstance B is equivalent to $1, 500 in units
of circumstanceA. If we know the different
rates of transformation between the market
goods and the service flows, we can infer
levels of real income equivalence among
households of various sizes and structures.
In this paper we suggest and implement a
way of inferring the differences in these
rates of transformation from household
spending patterns. We calculate implicit deflators by which nominal income in one
family size can be converted to its equivalence in some other family size.
The logic of our empirical strategy is as
follows: We take as a numeraire an adult
living alone in a single person household.
For a husband-wife (two-person)household
we observe their actual expenditure on some
good (say, clothing) and we independently
estimate the expenditure these two persons
would have made in total had they lived
separately in single person households. We
contend that the change in their expenditure
on clothing in those two circumstances reflects their response to a change in the price
of the service flow from clothing, a price

MARCH1980

change which resulted from the changed
environment in which the clothing is used.
The organization of the household, the nonmarket goods and time with which the
market goods are used, the scale of activities, etc. differ in the two-person household
(circumstance B) from the two one-person
households (circumstance)1), so the service
flow from a given bundle of goods (clothing) differs in these two circumstances.Thus
at constant market prices the service flow
price changes with the circumstance. From
knowledge of uncompensated market-price
elasticities and our estimates of changes in
expendituresfrom circumstanceA (living in
single person household) to circumstance
B (living in a two-person, husband-wife
household) we can infer what price change
the couple acts as if it experienced in going
from A to B. We estimate this price change
for each of several consumption categories
which exhaust total consumption. Combining these price changes into a composite
index we have a deflator by which nominal
income in two-person, husband-wife families can be converted into real income
in single person household (numeraire)
units. This same procedure can be used for
any other family structure as well. We have
used this technique to convert several
common family structures—two-person,

husband-wife families; three-person,
husband-wife-child families; four-and

five-person, husband-wife, two and threechildren families—intosingle person equiv-

alents.

Before discussing the model in more detail it is appropriate to discuss why we ex-

pect the rate of transformation of dollars
into service units to differ by family structure. We suggest three mechanisms:
1) Family goods: There are certain public goods within the family or household,
goods whose consumption by one member
does not diminish their availability to other
members. Examples abound: electric light
in a room, the beauty of art work on the
wall, the security provided by a locked bolt
on the door, etc. Here, if $5 provides the
man with a securely locked door and $5
provides the woman with the same living
separately, then together its price is to each

LAZEAR AND MICHAEL: FAMILY SIZE

VOL. 70 NO. 1

$2.50, a reduction in the price of the service
flow resulting from the change in household
size.

2) Scale economies: Examples include
quantity discounts on larger purchases of
perishables; less wastage per unit (for example, if the last teaspoon of milk is thrown
out with each purchased carton, the larger
the carton the smaller the percentage
wasted); reduced excess capacity due to indivisibility (a telephone, TV, shower, refrigerator space, etc. is often idle and the
utilization rate can be raised by increases in
family size).

3) Complementariry in the use of goods:
Specialization in household duties can result
in greater service flow per dollar spent—if

goods are combined with time in a productive way, then the more time per unit of
good, the higher the marginal product of the
good. Money income may not rise proportionately with family size because additional family members supply less time to
the labor market. So the ratio of nonmarket
time to the quantity of purchased goods
may rise. This in turn should raise the flow
of services per dollar spent on goods.
For reasons of family (public) goods,
scale economies, and division of labor, we
expect the rate of transformation between
market purchases and real service flows to
vary by family size. While most of the examples given suggest a rising level of
services per unit of market purchase as
family size increases,there may be offsets as
well (such as negative externalitiesfrom one
person's smoking, longer travel distance to
work or play for one or for all family members as a result of living in the collectively
optimal location).2 Neither the logic nor the
empirical implementationconstrains the direction of effects of family size on the rates
of transformation or therefore on real in-

come.

I. The Model
Consider an individual with demand for a
particular service flow, S1. That service flow

their own earnings for spouse earnings.

93

is obtained by the individual using a
purchased market input denoted X. As an
example, the individual may obtain entertainment services as a flow from his
purchased market input, a TV set. The rate
of transformationbetween X1 and S will in

general not be independent of the environment in which the individual interacts with
X in securingS. For example, the household
size in which the individual resides may
affect the rate at which X yields units of S.
If there are two household members instead
of one, a TV set may yield more or less
units of entertainment services to the individual (i.e., more if the two share the TV or
discuss the show and less if the second
member interferes with the viewing). As
command over resources in service flow
units (Ss) rather than market goods units
(Xs) constitutes a measure of real income, it
is appropriate to adjust for these differences
in rate of transformation when comparing
income levels among householdsof different
sizes.

Suppose the individual's demand for S1 is

individual's nominal money income. Let a1
be the number of units of S1 produced per

Note that a1 is thus the average product of
where X is analogous to capital and
is analogous to output. Nonmarket time
(analogous to labor input) is suppressed in
our model, but if nonmarket time is used
with X1 in the production of S, then an
increase in time per unit of X1 would raise
the average product of X1, implying a higher
a1. Then

with a1 fixed to the individual, given his
environment. From equations (2) and (4)
the derived demand for X1 would be
(5)

X1=g(P1, Y)/a1mh(P1, Y)

If for any reason a1 were changed, the
demand for S1 would change and the derived demand for X1 might be affected. For
example, suppose a change in the individual's household environment altered the
ratio of S1/XI from a1 to, say, a1(l +J1). If
J1 >0, the effective price of a unit of S1
would fall (see equation (3)), and accordingly its quantity demanded would rise.
Equation (4) would be

The derived demand for X1, however, need

reflects the
percentage by which the price of the
item in service units changes as the environment changes from circumstance A (the
numeraire) to circumstanceB. The nominal
dollars spent on X1 in circumstance B is
the equivalent in real (S1) terms to (l+J)
times that expenditure in the units of the
numeraire. If, for instance, equation (5) reflects the demand for X1 for a person living
in a householdof size 1.0, then equations (5)
and (5') yield estimable relationships from
which we can infer the J1 relevant to a
person living in a household of size 2.0.
Notice that the role of leisure (nonmarket
time), although suppressed, is not ignored.
To the extent leisure is used in conjunction
with market goods its effects are captured:
a. is the average product of X in the production of .S, and (1+.!,) reflects the change
in that average product when an additional
household member is added, so a change in
the amount of leisure time used per unit of
X1 will be reflected in the .1g. If leisure time
produced a distinct service 5, by itself, one
might add 5, to the set of items studied.
We chose not to take this approach for
three reasons. First, it seems intuitively unlikely that leisure produces any substantial
amount of service without the use of consumer goods. Indeed many "leisure activities" require considerable market goods and
services. But if leisure time is always coupled with goods, then the J1 corresponding
to changes in the average product of goods
will reflect the impact of any change in
leisure time.
Second, since most policy decisions are
based on a market goods measure of income
rather than a "full-income"concept, it is useful to put our equivalence scales in a form

consistent with measured income. Third,
since our data do not report hours worked,
it is not feasible to obtain information on
leisure time in our sample; we are therefore
unable to treat leisure time as a distinct
service item even if we thought that desirable. In the following paragraphs we set out
an explicit set of equations from which we
can estimate these Js from survey data on
expenditure and income.

analyses of this type. In empirical implementation, it

The
first set (of which there are n elements) is
simply the actual expenditure on X, by the
couple. It can be obtained from survey data
for persons living in households of size 2.0.
The second set (of which there are n elements) reflects the total expenditure on each
item by the two persons if they lived separately in households of size 1.0. That counterfactual expenditure can be estimated
from survey data on like individuals living
in households of sizes 1 and 2 (as described
in detail below). The third variable includes
the couple's actual nominal income Ymi and
the counterfactual income the two would
have received if they were living as two
separate individuals. The former is available
in survey data and the latter is estimable
from survey data on like individuals living
in households of sizes 1 and 2 (also described below). The fourth and fifth set of
variables include the n income elasticities
and n own-price elasticities and the n(n — 1)
cross-price elasticities of demand. These
should be available in the economic literature on empirical demand systems. With
these five sets of variables known, the system of equations reduces to n equations in n
unknowns—the n values of .J. The system
can be used to estimate the J,s which reflect
the price changes couples act as if they
experience in going from households of size
1 to households of size 2.
In principle, equation (11) could be estimated for each two person husband-wife
couple separately, but as the values of
Pi(Xim + X) and ('m + Yf) are estimated
by regression and subject to nonnegligent
estimation error, we have chosen instead to
use a measure of the average household
values of each as a more reliable estimate.5

In particular, after estimating P(Xm +

their characteristics, we form a ratio of that
estimate for good i to their actual expenditure PiXimj and then select the median value
of that ratio, iPX,, across all two-person
husband-wife households.6 A similar procedure yields a separate LPX for each market
good and an estimated Y. In addition, an
analogous procedure yields independent
estimates of PX for all goods and of Y
for households of other sizes and structures
as well. These procedures and the estimated
price changes and income equivalents are
discussed in the following section.7 To reiterate, these values are used in equation
(11) to permit us to solve for the J1.

Empirical Implementation

The data set used in our study is the

1960—61 BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey of 13 thousand households. Six expendi-

ture groups are used: food; clothing; trans-

couples to obtain J,; use the median PX, and tsY for
the k couples and then estimate from that median.
We used the second method. The first has several
problems: the value of is quite sensitive to iXPX and
in somecases .1 will not be a real number. So measurement error is much more likely to affect each jk
computed separately than it is if is computed from
the relatively robust estimate of the median tsPX.
6The median rather than the mean of the estimated
ratios is used since this ratio has in its denominator a
stochastic variable assumed to be distributed normally,
and thus the ratio has a Cauchy distribution for which
the moments do not exist. The expectation of estimators obtained using, say, the mean will not exist. As is
standard in such cases we assume that the median of
the error is zero across all observationsand so minimizing the sum of absolute errors is accomplished by use
of the median value of the ratio.
7Barten proposed a similar scheme. He suggests
u(x1,...,x,,) where x—q/rn,. with q the quantity of the
purchased good, and irn,(bi
b1) where b is the
number of family members of a given type and rn an
index of the composition of the family, and shows that
"a change in the composition of the family can be
translated into terms of a pseudo-price change" (p.
282). His structure is obviously similar to ours, but the
auggested research strategy differs. Barten argues that
cross-sectionaldata can be used to estimate price elasticities: using differences in mm. among households as
analogues of differencesin market prices, differencesin
spending patterns can yield estimates of "price" elasticities. We suggest, instead, using independent estimates
of price elasticities and the actual (estimated) differences in expenditures to infer the changes in prices.

consumption expenditure.5 For households

This equation is used to estimate for largersized households the expenditures each

demand equations and the husband's characteristics (education, age, race, city size,
region...), the yearly expenditure the
husband would have made on food, clothing, etc. had he lived alone. Likewise using
that equation and these characteristics we
estimate the yearly expenditure the wife
would have made if she lived alone.9 The

unity, implying that the predicted expenditure by the couple living separately as two

"food" which includes restaurant expenses).

estimate of Y,,, + Yf and the couple's actual

Equation (11) also requires uncompensated price elasticities of the six market
goods. One would think that the vast literature on demand systems in the past two
decades would have produced a consensus
about their magnitudesunder various conditions. We have not found that consensus
and have chosen to use elasticity estimates
derived from Michael Abbott and Orley
Ashenfelter's study. We selected the set of
elasticity estimates from the Stone-Geary
linear expendituresystem, evaluated at 1960
prices. These elasticities are shown in Table
2.10 Ideally, we require elasticity estimates
derived from household-size-specific expenditure behavior, not estimates derived
from observations across households of
various sizes. One justification for using the
Abbott and Ashenfelter estimates is that
average household size changed little over
the time span covered by their time-series
study, by less than 1.0 person over the entire
38-year period and by less than 0.1 person

equipment and 57.2 percent tobacco, recreational expenses, reading material, and motels, so we used a
weighted average of "durables" and "other nondurables" (tobacco, oil and gas, other miscellaneous
nondurables). The Abbott-Ashenfelter system also includes a demand curve for leisure time. We adjusted
the discretionaryincome slope coefficientson the expenditure items to remove discretionary leisure from
the demand system.

ably close to the conceptually appropriate
elasticities.
Given these price and income elasticities
and the estimates of M'X1 and Y, equation
(11) can be written for each of the six con-

sumption items yielding a system of six
equations in six unknowns, J1, . . . ,J6. As a
set of quadratic equations there are two
roots for each and it can be shown that
each pair contains a positive and a negative

Economic theory tells us which of the two
roots is relevant: from equations (2) and (3)
we know P,S, PX1 for any a1, so if LPX,
> 1.0, implyingexpenditure on X,. is lower in
the two-person household than in the two
single person households, we know their expenditure in terms of S is also lower. If the
price elasticity Ilul < 1.0, we know that price

economic theory that a positive is necessary in light
of our estimated PX, and ,,, then only one set of the

work we did estimate a few PX,'s which were <1.0.
A different level of commodity aggregation would
surely yield such estimates (for example, smaller

couples are estimated to be only 53 percent

(l/(l +J)) as high as the prices of S faced

by single person households. The relative
prices also are affected: the price of market
"services" fails least (to 60 percent of its
single person level (1/1 + 0.677)), while the
price of services from "food" falls most (to
50 percent of its single personal level 1/(l +
0.995)). The largest gains from the change
in circumstance (marrying, sharing duties,
achieving economies of scale and joint consumption advantages) are in food, goods
and shelter; the smallest gains are in the
purchase of market services, comprised
primarily of medical care and personal care
expenditures. We view this set of estimated
price changes as intuitively plausible. Its
overall magnitude is large and that we discuss below.

Using equation (12) it is a simple matter
to convert nominal family income of a couple into its single person equivalent for the
two individuals: if the couple's observed
nominal familyincome is $10,000, the "real"
income is $10,000 (l+J)=$18,856, as per
capita, the husband and wife realize $18,856
+2=$9,428, as indicated in Table 1. That
is, a couple with observed family income of
$10,000 is estimated to have the same per
capita ircome as a single person with $9,428.
The "economies of scale" are substantial,
although these gains are not simply scale
effects but also include the effects of cornplenientarity in time and money use and the
public (family)goods effects. As mentioned
earlier, we can convert dollars into common
units per person or convert persons into
full-time full-person equivalents, and doing
so in this case yields 1.061 as the full-person

size of a husband-wife family,
Here again the single person is
taken as the numeraire.
To obtain estimates of equivalents for
families of size 3.0 we proceed in the same
manner. We chose to use only three-person
households comprised of a husband-wife
and child under age 18; the survey had
1,162 such families. For each person in the
family we again used the demand equations
estimated on single individuals to estimate
what each family member would have spent
on each of the six consumption items had he
or she lived in a single person household.'4
Summingthese three estimated expenditures
together gave us the estimated expenditure
used in the numerator of equation (11), and
the family's actual expenditure is used in the
denominator to calculate the
for each
item for each of the 1,162 husband-wife and
child families. The median value of the dis-

'4For children in the family we knew age brackets:
0-6, 6-12, 12-17 (and for larger sized families > 18). So
we used piece-se linear demand equations and
assigned ages 3, 9, 15 (and 21) and assigned education
levels 0, 3, 9 (and 15), respectively. For the other
characteristicsof the child, we used father's characteristics (for race, city size, region, year) and for sex we
used the value 0.5.

tribution for each item is shown in the third
column in Table 1. For each family we
again estimated a z Y and its median value
for these 1,162 families was 1.2699. Using
the income and uncompensated price elasticities shown in Table 2, the J's shown in
the fourth column of Table 1 were calculated. Again, all the prices are estimated to
have fallen, with the decline for shelter and
services relatively low and the biggest gains
appearing to be in goods, transportation,
and clothing. Here the average is 1.3384,
so the prices faced by these three-person
families is estimated to be, on average, only
43 percent as high as the prices faced by the
three single person households.
The same procedure has also been applied to the 1,598 four-person (husband-wife
and two children) families and the results
are shown in Table 1. Finally, the procedure
was applied to 1,061 five-person (husbandwife and three children) families as well,
and these results are also shown in Table 1.
(The median values of Y(4) and Y(5) are
1.17 and 1.16, respectively.)
Throughout, our estimates imply quite
large gains in real terms from increases in
family size. Real income (income in service
flow equivalents with single persons as the

J

LAZEAR AND MICHAEL FAMILY SIZE

numeraire) is substantially higher in large
families than is nominal income. We estimate that $10,000 nominal income to a
family of five yields each of the five members the equivalent of $5,922 in a single
person equivalent dollars, or said differently, five can live together about as
cheaply as 2.0 can live separately.
While Table 1 shows estimates of
and equivalents by family size, we have
taken a few steps toward estimating household-specific Js. We computed expenditure
weights for specific family types defined
-over four age-of-head and five nominalincome groups and, using the .1, estimatesin
Table 1, estimated a
for each of the
twenty family types. For smoothing purposes, for each family size we ran a separate
weighted regression across these twenty Js
and used those regressions to assign a to
each household based on its size, age of
head, and nominal income.
As our initial intention was to obtain
comparable per capita income measures
across families of different sizes, we can use
these Js to do so. For each of the five family
types discussed above (single persons
husband-wife and three children families),
we assign a (J=0 for the single persons,
the numeraire))5 There are 7,337 such
households in the BLS data for which we
then have two measures of family income:
the jth household's actual nominal
family income;
= Y(l + J1): thejth household's real

income equivalent.

Table 3 shows the mean and median Y, Y,
and per capita Y and Y5 by family size. In
single person equivalent dollars the real
family income of larger families is quite
high, but the real per capita income is comparatively constant across families of different sizes. As a result, the overall (median)
per capita real income is substantially
higher than the per capita nominal income
among families of sizes 1 to 5 ($4,125 compared to $1,805). Figure 1 shows the

frequency distribution of per capita Y and
Y, emphasizing the far more evenly distributed and larger mean value of the latter.
III. Interpretation

Our estimates suggest that a substantial
adjustment in nominal income is necessary
to reflect real (single person equivalent) income among families of different sizes.
Scale economies, joint consumption of
goods, and complementarity of goods and
nonmarket time account for these substantial adjustments. Other studies have also
emphasized these factors separately, as, for
example, I. A. Sirageldin's estimates of the
distribution of real income including the
market value of the household tasks performed by women, or Reuben Gronau's
estimates of the housewife'scontribution to
full income.
We find that the adjustment in median

income in our sample of families and unrelated individuals raises a median nominal
per capita income of $1,805 to $4, 125 in
real dollars. One might ask what portion of
that adjustment is capturing the nonworking
wife's contribution to full income. Gronau's
estimates (using information on time use
from the Michigan Income Dynamics data)
suggest that for married women of all ages
and education levels combined, the nonmarket work done by women would raise
income by about 60 percent (see his Table
7). Our numbers suggest a far greater adjust-

ment, but ours reflect not only this nonmarket time effect but also scale and joint
consumption effects. Our estimate for each
discussed above and

size separately, indicates the nominal income the family would have received if both
spouses allocated their time as comparable

compare its per capita value with the per

our estimate of the per capita real income
(YB), we find:

The adjustment for labor supply accounts
for only a small portion of the adjustment
from nominal to real income. The remainder may be scale effects, joint consumption effects, possibly complementary
effects of one spouse on the other, or other
effects. It does not appear to be the case
that most of our estimated adjustment of Y
to Y is simply an adjustment for unearned
income of married women.
Another way to isolate the effects of nonmarket time is to look separately at the
implied price effect (or J) for families with

two employed adults and those with only
one employed adult. We would expect a
higher J in the families with only one employed adult, reflecting the greater flow of
services (S) per dollar of market goods (X)
as discussed above. We selected, from our
sample of 2,918 two-person families, two
subsets: (a) a group of 1,043 comprised of
all those couples for which the head was
employed full time and the spouse was not
employed during the year; (b) a group of
362 comprised of all those couples for
which both the head and the spouse were
employed full time. On the basis of the
observed &PX, and Y for these two subgroups separately, the for the one-earner
families was 0.83, the
for the two-fulltime-earnerfamilies was 0.75. 'While the difference is in the expected direction, the for
the two-earner families is higher than might
be expected. This suggestive evidence corroborates the conclusion of the previous

paragraph that much of the gain in real
income comes from sources other than the
differences in labor supply.
Another real income adjustment found
frequently in the literature is the equivalence scale for households of different sizes
and age structures. Perhaps the two best
known equivalencescales are the BLS and
the Orshanskyscales. The BLS scale is used
in their Family Budget series and derived by
inferences based on the notion that families
who spend the same proportion of their
disposable income on an income-inelastic
item such as food act as if they have the
same real income. The Orshansky scale is
used in constructing poverty levels for families of various sizes, and derived from estimates of the costs of purchasing nutritionally adequate diets for families of different
sizes. As our Table 1 indicates the per
capita single person equivalent income of
$10,000 in nominal family income, we can
use these figures to derive a comparable
equivalence scale. That is, Y0((l +
)/
((1 + 4)/k) would be the equivalent nominal income in k-person household units of
the nominal income of Y0 in f-person
households.'6 Table 4 shows these equivalence scales for BLS, Orshansky, and LM
(Lazear-Michael)estimates. For comparison
the first column shows the numbers for the

"We convert nominal income '0 in a f-person
household into real per capita income in single person
household units as Y0(l + 1)/fE 17. This is converted
to per capita income units of a k-person household as

household, multiply the expression by k to obtain
(}7/(I +J6))k.

naive assumption of complete absence of
scale or other effects. Panel A indexes these
equivalencescales based on a family of size
four and since the choice of a numeraire can
affect the apparent differences, Panel B
shows the indices based on a single person
equivalence. Also see Figure 2.
Given the tremendously different algorithms used in constructing these three
equivalence scales, it is interesting to note
how similar they are, at least among families
of sizes 2 through 5. Large differences exist,
however, in going to single person households, where the LM estimate suggests far
more "scale" economy than the other (especially the BLS) estimates. This difference
for single person households is especially
important for comparisons of equivalent
real income over time, as the proportion of
single person householdshas risen considerably in the U.S. population in the postwar
period.
One other comparison which can be performed with our data is to identify the differences in the poverty population when
that population is designated by the official
equivalencescales and by the LM equivalence scales. We calculated the two poverty
benchmarks for each of the 7,337 households in our sample and determined which
households were "in poverty" by each definition. The official level of poverty income
for a family of four composed of husband,
wife, and two children in 1960 was $3,022
and in 1961, $3,054. Using the Orshansky
equivalence scales in Panel A of Table 4 the
poverty level for the other types of households are easily computed (for example, for

104

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

a single person under age 65 in

1960,

the

poverty level was (.53)($3,022.) = $1,602).
Likewise, using the LM estimates of equivalence the poverty level comparable to $3,022
for a family of four is easily computed (for
example, for a single person under 65 in
1960, (.68X$3,022.) = $2,055).

The percentages in poverty, by age of
head, and by family size, using the
Orshansky scale and the LM scale are
shown in Table 5. While the overall percentage is only moderately higher with the
LM equivalence scales, a substantially
higher fraction of single persons or older
persons is estimated as "in poverty"
using the LM scales. Given the substantial
"scale" effects between single person and
four-person households, if $3,000 is the
benchmark for poverty for the four-person
family the single person requires a relatively
larger amount to be as well off.
There are other comparisons and modifications which might be made. We hope in
subsequent work to use more recent data,
containing more complete information on
each family member's demographic characteristics. Our procedure could easily be
extended to families of sizes greater than
five and to different family structures (for
example, female-headed families). Relaxatjon of the assumed homogeneity of all single person households in terms of Js seems
an appropriate extension as does some
additional checking on the sensitivity of our
estimates to the price elasticities which
were employed here.'7 We suggest our procedure for estimating per capita income
equivalence among families of different
sizes has among its other appealing properties the fact that it is embedded in a standard economic theory of demand. We use
changes in expenditures plus price elasticities to infer changes in prices from which
real (price deflated) levels of income can be
inferred.

'7Substantialsensitivity analysis has been done. In
addition to the set of estimatesdescribed in this paper,
three other sets of estimateshave been made. Elasticity

directly in one set of estimates(estimate A). Using the

another
set of f,'s were estimated (estimate C). The estimated J
for families of size 2 through 5 from these three sets of
estimateswere
Text estimates: .89; 1.34; 1.73; 1.96
Estimate A: .84; 1.30; 1.67; 1.92
Estimate B: .76; 1.23; 1.45; 1.68
Estimate C: .83; 1.26; 1.63; 1.89
So while there are not inconsequential differences and
the estimates reported in the text are somewhat larger
than the others, rather large differences in the initial
elasticitiesyield only modestlydifferent averageJs. We
think this comparison implies a substantial degree of
robustness in our estimates.

Sources of Quality Change in Labor Input
By PETER CHINL0Y*
Labor input is the product of total hours
worked and average labor quality per hour.
Labor quality accounts for the level of skill
provided per hour worked, including educational and demographic factors. Change in
labor quality can be expressed as the sum of
main effects associated with these factors
and interactive effects of various orders

tive effects reduces this effect from —.15 to
— .07

percent per annum, accounting for the

skill composition of women.

(d) A watershed develops in the
in assessing the relative importance of total hours and labor quality as
sources of labor input growth. Over
1947—59, labor quality is relatively dominant, accounting for over three-quarters of
labor input growth of about 1.3 percent per
annum. For 1963—74, labor input increases
in growth to 1.9 percent annually, but quality change accounts for only one-tenth.
Quality change in the U.S. labor market
almost disappears, declining from 1.12 percent for 1947—52 to 0.12 percent over
1959—63 period

yielding a growth accounting equation for
labor input. This is applied to a classification of total hours worked by sex, class of
worker (employee or self-employed), age,
education, and occupation for the U.S.
private domestic economy 1947—74. The
main conclusionsare:
(a) The contribution to labor input
growth of education is 0.6 percent per
annum. This effect is reduced by one-half
if interactive effects are included, as the
educated become younger and more female.
The main effect for education declines
by over one-fifth between 1959—63 and
1971—74, which may indicate a decline in
the contribution of education to U.S. productivity growth.
(b) A linear logarithmic quality change
estimate excluding interactions overstates
the growth of labor quality by one-half.'
This suggeststhat the contribution of education and experienceto economicgrowth,for
example, may not be measured by multiplying together indices of each factor. The
overstatement amounts to 0.3 percent per
annum, which at a labor share of two-thirds,
overstates the contribution of labor input to
output growth by 0.2 percent per annum.
(c) The main effect of the substantial
increase in relative share of women in total
hours is negative. The inclusion of interacUniversity of British Columbia. I am grateful to
William Barger, Erwin Diewert, Richard Freeman,
Frank Gollop, Robert Hall, and Dale Jorgenson for
their substantial contributions to this work.
'Richard Nelson has argued that experienced
growth may involve interaction effects as well as main
effects of factors.

1971—74.

I. Labor Input Indexing
The indexing of labor input commences
with a production function aggregatingnonlabor services and the services provided by
different types of labor. An aggregate of
labor input exists if types of labor are
weakly separable from nonlabor inputs. I
assume the labor market is efficient, and
types of labor paid marginal products.
Labor input can increase even if total hours
worked are constant. Suppose there are two
types of labor, skilled and unskilled. The
former receive above average wages, and
both work the same hours. If an unskilled
worker becomes skilled, total hours remain
unchanged, but labor input increases since
the marginal product of this worker increases. The objective is to quantify these
changes in labor input and associate them
with characteristicsof employment.
The production function, separable between labor and nonlabor inputs, is at
time t:
