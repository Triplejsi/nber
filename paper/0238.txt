Abs tract

One major finding of this paper is that prices
producing industries are responsive to demand while
goods producing industries are not. If the reverse
policies would. have more effect in the short run on
on output than is currently the case.

in most basic materials
prices in most finished
were true, stabilization
prices and less effect

A second finding relates to the 1971—4 period of wage and price controls
and the period immediately following their termination. During controls, prices
in most manufacturing sectors did rise somewhat slower than their historical
relationship to costs would suggest. But after controls ended prices rose
relative to costs by considerably more than the amount of their shortfall during
controls. This suggests that some fundamental change in price—cost relationships
may have taken place in 1974.

Price Behavior in the Manufacturing Sector
for Sixteen Industries Classified by Stage—of—Process
by Joel Popkin

In 1970 at a conference on.

the

econometrics of price determination

William Nordhaus [1972a] in his review of recent price behavior analysis concluded,
"Most

of the specifications and interpretations have proceeded without the benefit

of formal. theory." Three years later David Laidler and Michael Parkin [1975] in
surveying

inflation cotntnented that the finding of Nordhaus (and Godley) [1972b]

about price behavior in the United Kingdom was based on an incorrect specification:
"It is at odds both with the usual theory of price setting and with

work .

earlier empirical

. .

These

criticisms

comments are not intended to goad these researchers into further
of each other's work;all three papers are especially valuable contrib-

utions to the literature on price behavior. Instead they are cited to point up the
difficulty of formulating theoretically sound specifications that can be tested
empirically, particularly when the analysis is directed at sectoraLl. price changes
rather

than the aggregate price level.

The research reported in this paper is a further attempt to wed theory and

practice, particularly with respect to

the existence and effect on price behavior

of snort—run disequilibria between production and demand. In this paper
attention is given to the roles of the level and change in capacity utilization
and to a previously untested excess demand variable ——

the

ratio of new orders to

output. But before the reader focuses too intently on the success of this endeavor,
it should be pointed out that the research has a second objective. It is to examine

price

behavior in the manufacturing sector for a disaggregadon of sixteen industries

classified by where they are located in the stages—of—process by which raw materials

are transformed into finished goods. The empirical results of this analysis are
price equations which are imbedded in an integrated model of final and intermediate

demand by stage of process. (For a description of this model see Popkin [1977].)

2

Typically, price behavior analysis for the manufacturing sector is

directed at the twenty 2—digit industries that comprise it. But such analysis
requires treatment of such industries as pulp, paper and allied products and
chemicals and allied products, both of which consist of industries that convert

raw materials to basic industrial materials which are then transformed into
semi—manufactures and finished goods in those 2—digit industries and in others.

On the demand side the sources of derived demand for the basic materials are

lost and the pattern of lagged adjustment processes clouded. On the supply
side possible differences in substitution possibilities, say for iron ore in
steel plants vis—a—vis those for steel—based versus aluminum—based car parts,

are not reflected. Such problems can be alleviated if manufacturing industries
are viewed by stage—of—process rather than the aggregative SIC categories to
which they have been assigned.

The sixteen stage—of—process industries on which this research focuses

fall into three groups. The first consists of six industries that produce
largely finished goods. They are automotive, consumer home goods (primarily
nonauto durables), food, beverage and tobacco manufactures, other consumer

staples (nonedible nondurables excluding fuels), machinery and equipment
other than ordnance and transportation equipment, and an industry composed of

shipbuilding, ordnance, aircraft and railroad equipment. The second group
consists of one industry that produces intermediate, or semi—manufactures.

Finally, there are nine primary industries defined wherever possible as the

first processors of raw materials. They are textiles, lumber, paper, chemicals
fertilizers, stone, clay and glass, steel, nonferrous metals and petroleum
refining.

3

The behavioral hypothesis
The strategy used to analyze price behavior in these sixteen industries
consisted of testing the hypothesis that each consists of competitive firms

but that prices may be in disequilibrium. It was assumed that the firms
produce

Maximizing short—run profits with respect to this production function yields the

In the short run, the cost of capital does not enter the price equation
because capital stock is assumed fixed, only its utilization may vary.
A bridge between short run pricing behavior and the long—run pricing rule can
be established by relying on the first—order profit maximizing conditions

In words, in the short run, equilibrium price depends positively on wage rates
and materials prices, each weighted by their proportion to the sum of both,
and on movements in output vis—a--vis capital stock which may be assumed fixed.

In the long run price depends on, aside from wage rates and materials prices,
the rate at which capita]. grows relative to output. Their relative growth
mirrors what is happening to the cost of capital under the assumption of a

Cobb—Douglas

production function with constant returns to scale.

of supply and demand. If these elasticities are not constant, then the ratio
for any given value of NOIX may vary. For example, if supply becomes more
inelastic at higher output levels, the same gap at higher output levels will

imply a larger gap between equilibrium and actual price. This nonlinearity
may be represented by specifying the output—capital ratio as an exponent of

the ratio of new orders to output. Hence, the degree of price disequilibrium
is represented by (7).

is estimated by ordinary least squares for each of two

sample periods 1960:1—1971:11 and 1960:I—1975:IV, the former period ending with

the institution of price and wage controls. For the longer sample period a
dummy variable for post—controls effects is specified alternatively in some sectorS.
Equation 8 makes explicit the role of the level and change in excess
demand, as reflected in the output—capital ratio which is a measure of capacity

utilization. The level is appropriate only when there is short—run disequilibrium and then only if supply and demand elasticities are not constant. The

the technical progress term from (5) which has an

expected negative algebraic sign. Other factors might obscure this, however,

since

the results depend importantly on the appropriateness of the underlying

assumptions, it would be

prudent to interpret the algebraic signs of the

estimates of 82 and 83 merely as indicators of whether margins behave
procyclicly, anticyclicly or are cyclicly neutral.

The data and estimation

The data are taken from five primary sources: Censuses and Annual
Surveys of Manufactures (Census Bureau), monthly series on manufacturers'
inventories, shipments, new and unfilled orders (Census Bureau), component
series of the monthly wholesale price index (Bureau of Labor Statistics),
monthly series on employment, hours and earnings (Bureau of Labor Statistics)

and components of the monthly industrial production index (Federal Reserve

Board). Capital stock estimates were prepared using perpetual inventory
techniques by extrapolating LS benchmarks by census annual investment data
interpolated quarterly by data from BEA. Data at the three and four digit SIC
level (six and eight digit wholesale price index categories) are combined to

8

form aggregates for each of the sixteen manufacturing sectors. The four—digit
composition of each of the sectors is available on request. All variables are
measured quarterly. For flow variables, the monthly series are seasonally
adjusted and quarterly averages formed. The various series have been
constructed for 1958—1975 and most are available monthly.

A more detailed description of sources of data and methods of
construction of particular series is avaL1able from the author on request.

used to construct single variables incorporating the relevant

obtained by using the Almon technique. Insignificant or negative

lag coefficients were eliminated; those terms remaining were combined

using approximate values of the Almon weights. Separate weights were so
derived for each sample period. Upon analysis, it appeared that where
they differed it was due to the fact that materials prices affect output prices

with a lag structure different from that of labor prices. Accordingly, separate
iags were estimated for materials and labor prices, again based on Almon tcclriiques,

with the result that the same lag structure seemed applicable to both time periods.
The same general strategy was used to develop distributed lag weights
for the other two variables, the change in the log of the output—capital ratio
and the output—capital ratio times the log of the orders—output ratio.

(The

latter measure of disequilibrium is assumed to operate only with a lag.) For
these two variables first degree polynomials were fitted running from t to

t—3 and t—l to t—4 respectively. The technique described above was used to
select the distributed lag weight for these variables as well, except that

9

significant negative weights for the disequilibrium variable were accepted

The

results are found in Table 1.

For the shorter time period more

half of the price variation is explained in only eight of the sixteen

industries. Results are particularly poor for lumber, chemicals, fertilizers, nonferrous

metals and petroleum. In virtually every industry, the amount of explained price

variation increases when the sample is extended through 1975. But in a number
of cases the improvement is associated with the emergence of significant serial
correlation, a sharp rise in the standard error and some unacceptably large

shifts in the estimates of some parameters. In those cases a dummy variable
was incorporated to test for post—control bulges in 1973 and 1974. (In some
sectors decontrol began in the second half of 1973, preceeding the general

decontrol that took place in April 1974.) The result is more rational parameter estimates and the virutal elimination of significant serial correlation;
this suggests that the serial correlation present before the inclusion of the
dummy variable was due to a missing variable during the 1972—1975 period, and
that variable seems to be one reflecting post—controls developments.

The analysis of the results can best be accomplished by looking at the
estimates for the longer sample period, including those that incorporate the

dummy variable where specified. In all but one of the equations, the adjusted
exceeds 60 percent; in ejeven sectors it is greater than 80 percent. The
only disappointing result is in the highly volatile lumber sector, although

most of the parameter estimates are significant and relatively stable when

viewed over both sample periods.

With respect to parameter estimates, the coefficient of the labor and
materials price variable is significant in fifteen of the sixteen sectoral
equations based on the longer sample period (all but five for the shorter period).

In seven of the fifteen sectors the coefficient is not significantly different

from one. The sectors in which such coefficients exceed unity are largely primary
industries while those less than unity are finished goods industries.

The output—capital ratio is significant in eight of the sixteeen industries.
But the coefficient has a negative sign in sectors other than primary manufacturing.

The disequilibrium variable is significant in eleven industry sectors. In
two of these —— consumer home goods and staples ——

the coefficient has a negative

sign. Further tests in which XIK was deleted from the disequilibrium variable
produced results that precluded rejecting the hypothesis that supply and demand

elasticities are not constant. In general inclusion of X/K resulted in a slight
improvement in the fit of the equations.

The hypothesis put forward that price behavior reflects competitive behavior

obscured in some of the other

industries because the production function assumption is too restrictive. The
results show that in eight other industries the behavior of margins, as reflected
by the output—capital ratio and the disequilibrium variable, is procyclical, a

pattern not inconsistent with competitive behavior. Procyclical margin behavior
requires that one or both of the two margin—related variables must be significant,

and when so, the sign must be positive. The eight industries are consumer food,
machinery and equipment, paper, chemicals, fertilizers, nonferrous metals, refined
petroleum products and semi—manufactures, only two of which are finished goods

In three industries the sign of neither margin—related variable is significant,
suggesting constant mark—up or cyclically neutral margin behavior; the three are
autos, steel and stone, clay and glass.

Anti—cyclical margin behavior is indicated in two sectors —— consumer home
goods and staples —— where both variables are negative and significant. However,
the effect of import competition in these sectors should be examined before accepting the competitive implications of the results presented here.

Margin behavior in the ordnance, et al industry cannot be determined because
the two variables have coefficients of opposite sign.

The general picture that emerges from this analysis is that price behavior
in primary industries is consistent with the competitive model while that in

finished goods industries is not. It is interesting however that post—controls
dummies are significant in many of both kinds of industries, not just competitive
industries where controls may have suppressed the response of prices to rising
demand.

Post—controls dunimyvariables are significant in eleven of the sixteen sectors.
Two

of

the sectors in which they are not significant are those with cyclically

neutral or anticyclical margin behavior ——

autos and consumer home goods. Such

variables are also not significant in three industries that fit the competitive
pattern ——

textiles,

lumber and petroleum. In the first two, demand began to

decline in early 1973 when new housing and apparel expenditures weakened at the

final demand level: and petroleum prices have never been fully decontrolled.

That such dummies are not significant in textiles and lumber —— the two
which appear to fit best the competitive hypothesis tested here —— is
understandable in the fact that demand for the output of these sectors began to
decline early in 1973 when new housing and apparel expenditures weakened at the
final demand level.

The extent of the post—controls price rise ——

the coefficient of the dummy

variable times the number of quarters its value was one —— is shown in the first

column of table 2 for each sector in which the effect is significant. In most
of these sectors price behavior is consistent with the competitive hypothesis,

but there are several exceptions ——

steel,

stone, clay and glass, consumer staples

and (possibly) ordnance et al. That most of the sectors in which the dummy
variable is significant are those that fit the competitive hypothesis is to be

expected

since the controls program tended to impose cost pass—through behavior

in most sectors.
The second column of table 2 contains the sum of the residuals during

controls. In all but two instances they are. negative, suggesting controls held
prices down. But the price rise explained by the post controls dummy exceeds

The general picture of price behavior duing 1960—75

that

emerges from this

analysis is that price behavior in primary industries is consistent with the
competitive hypothesis while that in finished goods industries is not. Regardless

of the reason for the finding, it suggests a reason for what is regarded as in-

sensitivity or considerable delay in the response of prices to a change in aggregate
demand policies, particularly a restrictive change. According to this analysis,

the initial response to a restrictive change on the part of most finished goods
manufacturers is a reduction in output, not in the ratio of output to input prices.
This reduction in the volume is greater than would be the case if the output—input

price ratio behaved procyclicly. As a result there are larger cutbacks in orders
placed by finished goods producers for materials and supplies than would occur

otherwise. when these cutbacks in orders impact on those semifinished and primary
manufacturing industries in which the output—input price ratio does behave pro—
cyclicly, prices in these industries weaken. Such weakness then feeds forward to
final demand prices, but of course with a lag, affecting prices in all finished
manufacturing and distribution sectors, whether or not the output—input price ratio

in those industries behaves procyclicly. It would appear that if the findings
reported here were reversed ——

that

procyclical margin behavior were more char-

acteristic of finished goods producers than of primary producers, aggregative demand
policies would be more efficient.
