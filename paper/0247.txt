BANK CAPITAL ADEQUACY: A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Laurie Goodman and William F-. Sharpe

Abstract

-

The first part of this paper provides a historical perspective
on bank risks. Five—year moving average measures of total risk, market
risk, and nonmarket risk are computed for an index of- New York banks

from 1929—1975 and for an index of outside New York banks from 1950—1976.
We use a carefully constructed series of bank balance sheet data to
compute correlations among various components of New York banks' port-

folios and observe trends over time. The time series relationship between
book values and market values is investigated, and classical measures of
capital adequacy are calculated using surrogates for market values rather

than book values. Finally, data are presented on the movement of interest
rates and the term structure over time. Serial correlations and cross
correlations are computed.

The second part of the paper uses the technique proposed in
Sharpe ("Bank Capital Adequacy, Deposit Insurance and Security Values,"
June 1978) to gain information about capital adequacy. lie has shown -

that

for a bank with deposit liabilities that do not extend beyond the

review

-

period a "value preserving spread!' in asset risk is likely to

increase the value of capital. Moreover, the less adequate the capital,
- -

the

larger this effect should be. We outline the method used to develop

an econometric model to test for this effect. - The model is then applied
to-time series data from 1938 to 1975.

SECTION A—i

Historical

Perspective on Bank Risks

In an effort to provide some historical perspective, we have computed
five year moving average measures of total risk, market risk and non—market
risk for a group of New York Banks from 1929—1976 and for a group of Outside
New York Banks from 1950—1976.

The analysis uses Standard and Poor's1 indices of (1) New York City

Bank Stocks, (2) Outside New York City Bank Stocks, and (3) Standard and

Poor's composite Index. Each index is computed monthly, using a weighted
average of market prices on the last Wednesday of the nionth, with prices

weighted by the number of shares outstanding. The changes in the stocks
utilized

in the indices are handled by adjusting a "divisor" to keep the

series comparable.
The banks used in the New York City Bank Index and the Outside New
York City Bank Index are shown in Table A—l.l.. Standard and Poor's composite was composed of 500 stocks in 1976, consisting of 83 industrial groups

totaling 425 companies, 15 railroad companies, and 4 utility groups totaling

60 companies. Monthly data were used for the following periods:

Standard and Poor's Composite Index January, 1929 — December, 1976

1The analysis was repeated using Moody's indices. The results were
virtually identical. The Moody's series used were (1) New York Bank Stocks,
(2) Outside New York Bank Stocks and (3) Moody's Industrial Stock Index.
The latter index utilizes 125 stocks. The correlations between the relative
change in the Moody's Index used and the relative change in the appropriate
Standard and Poor's Index were:

2/29—3/75 Standard and Poor's Composite —— Moody's

City Bank Index
The relative
standard

deviations

changes (monthly) in the indices were computed. The
of the relative changes of the indices were calculated

for the five year moving average periods. TableA—1.2 shows the standard
deviations of the relative changes in Standard and Poor's composite Index,

which measure the riskiness of the market. These data are graphed in

Figure A—Li. For all Tables and Charts in this Section, the year indicated
refers to the year at the beginning of the period. For example, "1930" refers to a period utilizing data from month—end December, 1929 through month—

end December, 1934. Exceptions are made for the first period in each series.
For the New York City Banks, "1929" utilizes data from month—end January,

1929 to month—end January, 1934. For the index of banks Outside New York,
the "1950" period utilizes data from month—end January, 1950 through month—

end January, 1955. Table A—i.) shows the standard deviations of the rela—
tiye change in Standard and Poor's New York City Bank Stock Index which

measure the total risk of the index. This is graphed in Figure A—1.2.
Table A—l.6 shows the standard deviations of the relative changes in the

Outside New York City Stock Index. These data are graphed in Figure A—1.5.
Five year moving average regressions of the form
Relative charge
of Bank Index

——

.

Relative

Market Index

were run for both bank indices. The "Beta" coefficient of this regression
is the sensitivity of changes in the bank index to changes in the market.

Betas for the New York Banks are graphed in Figure A—i.3 and printed in

Table A—1.4. Betas for the Outside New York Banks are graphed in Figure

—3—

A—l.7 and printed in Table A—1.S. With one exception in each, the a coefficient of the regressions were insignificantly different from zero at the
5% significance level for the New York City Banks and the Outside New York

City Banks. The market risk of the bank stocks can be computed by multiplying Beta times the standard deviation of the industrial index. These values
are listed in Table A—l.5 and graphed in Figure A—l.4 for the New York City
Bank stocks; and listed in Table A—1.9 and graphed in Figure A—l.8 for the

Outside New York City Bank stocks. The standard errors of the regressions
measure the non—market risk of the corresponding portfolios of bank stocks.
These values are printed in Table A—l.6 and graphed in Figure &—l.5 for the

New York City Bank stocks, and printed in Table A—l.1O and graphed in Figure
A—l.9 for the Outside New York City Bank Stocks.

SECTION A—2

Historical Perspective on Balance Sheet Data

In an effort to provide historical perspective on bank balance sheet
data, we have computed correlations among various components of New York

Banks' portfolios and graphed trends over time. New York banks were chosen
because balance sheet data could be matched fairly well with available market—value data.

The analysis uses balance sheet data for Central Reserve City Member
Banks of New York City (1928—1941), Reserve City Member Banks of New York
City (1942—1970) and Large Member Banks in New York City (1971—1975). This
information is available in Banking and Monetary Statistics, a three—volume

publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The
Federal Reserve calculates the data by aggregating call report

data on each

central reserve city, reserve city, or large member bank in New York City.
The call report data are gathered from two to four times a year.

In an

effort to make the balance sheet data comparable with market index data,
all call reports filed during the first 15 days of the month were attributed

to the previous month. Thus, September, 1970 can refer to call report data
call refrom September 16 — October 15, 1970. Linear interpolation between

ports was used to produce monthly data.

The data used in our work covered

the period from December, 1928 to December, 1975.
report has changed throughout the period,

The design of the call

hence it was necessary to aggre-

obtain consistent series across the whole

period. The series are described in Table A—2.1.
Variables of particular interest are (1) the amounts of specific
categories of assets or liabilities relative to the amount of capital, and

—19—

(2) the amounts of such categories of assets or liabilities relative to

total assets. The statistics associated with these series are shown in

The correla—

tions among the ratios of the series to capital are shown in Table A—2.4.
The correlations among the ratios of the series to total assets are shown
in Table A—2.5.

The figures show changes in the book values of various assets and

liabilities relative to capital and total assets. Only values on the last
month of each quarter are shown. For example, 1928 4th refers to December,
1928.

SECTION A—3

Historical Perspective on Book Value/Market Value
of Capital and "Classical" Measure of Capital Adequacy

The standard measure of capital adequacy compare book values from the

bank's balance sheet. This section provides a historical perspective on the
relationship between book values and market values of equity over time. We
have computed the measure of market value to book value of equity for a
group of New York Banks from 1929 through 1975 and for a group of Banks Out-

side New York City for the years 1957—1975. For the New York City banks we
present a graphical review of the classical measures of capital adequaéy and
calculate related measures using surrogates for market values.

The banks chosen for computing the book value to market value ratio
were those used in Standard and Poor's New York City Bank Index and Standard

and Poor's Outside New York City Bank Index. These are listed in Section
A—i, Table A—1.l. The New York City index contains 17 banks in 1929 and reduces to 9 by 1975. The Outside New York index contains 10 banks in 1950,
increases to 17 in 1956 and decreases to 16 banks by 1975. These banks were
chosen because they are actively traded throughout the period they are in
the

index.
The

-

book value of equity, the number of shares and the market value

per share were gathered for each bank in the index in each year. The book
value of equity and the number of shares were
Finance

Manual. The book value of equity

taken from Moody's Bank and

was computed as the book, value of

plus surplus plus undivided profits plus dividends declared but not
yet paid. Book values of preferred stock and capital notes were not instock

cluded. An attempt was made to include reserves for contingencies in the

—41—

equity account. Since this could not always be sorted out from reserves for
losses on securities or reserves for loan losses, judgment was used to decide how much of the item called "reserves" was reserves for contingencies.
The market value per share was taken from the Bank and Quotation Record.

Last trading day of the year figures were used to correspond with the year—

end balance sheets obtained from Moody's manuals. Where no closing quote
could be found, the bid and ask quotations were averaged. In the few cases
where year end values could not be obtained, the values for the month before

and month after were averaged. Book and market values for individual banks
were then aggregated. The raw data are given in Table A—3.l and graphed in

Figure A—3.l for the New York Banks. The raw data ar given in Table A—3.2
for the Outside New York City Banks and graphed in Figure K-3.3. Where the
book values appear to rise or drop sharply, banks have been added to or de-

leted from the index. The market value/book value ratio is given in Table
A—3.2 for the New York Banks and graphed in Figure A.3.2. This ratio is
given in Table A—3.2 for the Outside New York Banks and graphed in Figure

A—3.4. Two of the banks in the Outside New York City Index were not.in—
cluded in the 1975 computations as their book values were not available. In
Figure A—2.5 the movement of the ratio is graphed for the two groups of banks.

The balance sheet data (book values), compiled by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from individual bank call report data for
the New York Reserve City member banks, were readily accessible in aggre-

gated form. The exact derivation of the series is described in the previous
section. The December call report data were used to compute measures of
capital adequacy. Market value/book value ratios were compiled for the
Standard and Poor's New York Banks as described above. The market value of
equity for the New York City Banks was estimated by multiplying the Book

—42—

Value of the New York Banks times the Market Value/Book Value ratio for the
Standard and Poor's New York banks.
The market value- estimate for New York City Banks will be excellent,

as banks in Standard and Poor's New York index correspond fairly closely to
the Federal Reserve Board's classification of New York Central Reserve City

Member Banks. Total deposit data were gathered for each bank in the Standard and Poor's index •for the years 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960 and 1970 from

Moody's-Bank and Finance Manual. The deposit data were aggregated and compared with total deposits from the call report data of the New York Reserve

city member banks. The results (in millions of dollars) were;

This high degree of correspondence gives us confidence in our market value
estimates of capital adequacy.

Two important comments are in order. First, the market value of
capital refers to the market value of equity plus the book value pf pre-

ferred stocks and notes. Second, the "market value" of assets was computed
as the book value of assets plus the difference between the market and book

values of equity. This is admittedly a very crude surrogate for the true
market value of assets. It would only be correct if the economic value of
deposits were equal to the nominal value. In fact, the economic value of
deposits is generally less than the nominal value, hence our estimate overstates the true market value of assets.

—43—

All measures of capital adequacy are shown for the 1929—75 period in
Figures A—3.6 — A—3.l7.

It is fairly clear why most of the measures are

considered relevant for estimating capital adequacy.

However, Figures

A—3.l3 and A—3.l4 deserve some comment, as do Figures A—3.l6 and A—3.l7.
in Figure A—3.l3 (total assets, book — cash — U.S. government securities —

agency securities)/6 is a rule of thumb estimate of a "proper" amount of
capital.3 Figure A—3.lO hence illustrates the ratio of this "proper' amount
of capital to the actual amount of capital. Note that in calculating the
measure, instead of agency securities (which were not available separately)
the entire category of other securities was subtracted out. This includes

stock, Federal Reserve stock, Federal agencies not guaranteed and investment
iii

subsidiaries

not consolidated. Thus our estimate of "proper capital" may

be interpreted as a lower bound. Figure A—3.l4 substitutes market values
for book values. Peltzman4 uses capital/ (deposits — cash) as a proxy for

capital adequacy. This measure is shown in Figure A—3.16. It may be viewed
as a measure of capital divided by uncovered deposits. We felt that other
assets are almost as liquid as cash, and the distinction was artificial, so

we used capital/deposits and graphed the results in Figure A—3.17.

3mis was mentioned by Sam Peltzman in his article "Capital Investment in Commercial Banking and Its Relationship to Portfolio Regulation,"
Journal of Political Economy (January/February, 1970), pp. 1-26.

SECTION A—4

Historical Perspective on Interest Rates and
the Return on the Market

This section provides some historical perspective on the movements
of interest rates and market prices

over time. To supply insights into the

changing term structure, serial correlations and cross—correlations are
also presented.

The analysis uses the relative change in Standard and Poor's Composite index as the surrogate for the return on the market each month. Since
dividends are not included, such

changes represent only capital gains and

losses, most of which are unanticipated. Index values for the last Wednesday of each month from January, 1929 to December, 1975 were used.
Total return on treasury bills, computed based on last—day—of—the—

month values were obtained from Ibotson and Sinquefield.5

Only data from

1938 to 1975 were used.

The remaining interest data were based on Standard and Poor's Bond

indices. The four series utilized were:

government short term yields(3

to 4 years), government intermediate yields (6 to 9 years), government long
term yields (over 10 years) and medium grade corporate bond yields. The
medium grade corporate bond index is composed on bonds rated 51+ (until the

mid—1950's) and BBS thereafter. The data, computed as of the last Wednesday of the month are available from January, 1938 for all four series,6
5These data are described in greater detail in Ibotson, Roger G. and
Rex A. Sinquefield, "Stocks, Bonds, Bills and Inflation: Year by Year Historical Returns (1926—1974)," Journal of Business, January 1976, pp. 11—47.
We obtained the data from the authors.
61n the three government indices, the data we used for December; l37
is actually the first Wednesday of January, 1938.

—64—

After 1942 the Standard and Poor's government intermediate and long

term indices were based on fully taxable issues. For the period 1938—1941
the indices were based on tax—exempt series. Both figures were given far
1942. Our results are based on figures obtained by increasing the 1938—1941
tax—exempt yields for intermediate and long term bonds by amounts equal to
the average difference between the tax—exempt and taxable series during the

12 overlapping months of 1942. The intermediate term tax—exempt yields were
increased by 31 basis points and the long term tax—exempt yields by 27 basis

points. During the overlapping period in 1942 there was only a .2 basis
point difference between taxable and tax—exempt short term government yields
so the

original figures for 1938—1941. were used. The four series are

graphed

in Figure A—4.1 (only the last month in each quarter is shown).

From the yields to maturity we computed total returns and capital

gains or losses. This was done as follows.

Let

y0 = yield to maturity at the beginning of the month
y1 =

yield

to maturity at month—end

Both yields are annual yields divided by 12.

P0 = price

When computing price indices, Standard and Poor's assumes a 4 year maturity
for the short term government bond index, a 74 year maturity for the inter-

mediate term government bond index, a 15 year maturity for the long term
government bond index, and a 20 year maturity for the medium grade corporate

bond index. We adopted these assumptions. Monthly total returns were corn—
puted by adding the monthly yield to maturity to capital gains or losses.

Table A—4.l indicates the variable names. Table A—4.2 shows the statistics for the bond series. (yields, capital gains and total returns) and

the return on the market. The table is in absolute amounts, that is, the
mean return on the market was .43 percent per month, the mean yield to maturity on short term government bonds was .26 percent per month, the mean
capital loss on these bonds was .03 percent per month and total returns on
short term government bonds were .23 percent per month or 2.78 percent per

year. Table A-4.3 shows the correlations among the variables. Table A—4.47
shows the results of regressions of the form:

Total Return =

constant

70n following page.

capital gains (—1)

and

—66--

capital gains =

constant + capital

gains (—1)

With the exception of the treasury bills, such regressions have limited ex-

planatory power. Regressions with higher order distributed lags did not
provide significantly higher explanatory power.

Various regressions of combinations of capital gains and market re-

turns were performed tc estimate cross correlations. Representative results
were obtained as follows. Complete regressions were run of the forms:

CGGOVS =

C

+ BlPCSPI + B2•CGGOVI + B3.CGGOVL + B4.CGMEDC

CGGOVI =

C

+ BlPCSPI + B2CGGOVS + B3.CGGOVL + B4-CGMEDC

CGGOVL

C + Bl.PCSPI + B2•CGGOVS + B3-CGGOVI + E4-CGMEDC

CGMEDC

C

+ Bl•PCSPI + B2CGGOVS ÷ B3•CGGOVI + B4.CGGOVL

PCSPI

=

C

+ BlCCGOVS + B2-CGGOVI + 83.CGGOVL +

B4.CGMEDC

Next, all variables with T—statistics less than 2 were eliminated and the

regressions rerun. The results are shown in Table A—4.5.

An attempt was made to find the sensitivities of various elements in

the bank's portfolio to single macroeconomic variables. Our success was
limited at best.

The bank balance sheet data used were computed from the Federal Reserve Board's data on Reserve City Member Banks in New York City as described

in Section A—2. The interest rate data are from the Standard and Poor's
yields, as described in Section A—4. The return on the market is the return
on the Standard and Poor's Composite Index, and the return on the New York
Banks is the return on the Standard and Poor's New York Bank Index.
The regressions on the return on the market were done for the total
period for which all data were available, that is, February 1929 — December,

1975. For a perspective on the overall size of "Beta" we ran the simple
regression:

The

"Beta" coefficient was of the expected sign and magnitude. The constant

term was insignificantly different from zero, as anticipated. We then ran

several regressions using elements in the bank's asset portfolio,
regressions of the form:

SECTION B—2

Responses of Bank Capital to Multiple Macroeconomic Variables
and Implications for Capital Adequacy

The theoretical work in Sharpe8 suggests a potentially useful way to

gain information about capital adequacy. He has shown that for a bank with
deposit liabilities that do not extend beyond the review period a "value
preserving

spread" in assets risk is likely to increase the value of the

FDIC liability and the value of capital. Moreover, the less adequate the

capital, the larger this effect should be. This chapter outlines the method
used to develop an econometric model to test for this effect. The model is
then

applied to the time series data from 1938 to 1975.

We will use the theoretical framework from Sharpe [1978]. To begin,

C = L+A—DF

(1)

where C = value of capital, time zero,
L =

value

of the FDIC liability, time zero,

A =

of the assets, time zero,

identity comes from the bank's economic balance sheet. Hence
EC = L+M—ADF.

(2)

If

assets become more risky but do not change in value, there will

generally be a change in L. This will be a function of the value of the

8W. F. Sharpe, "Basic Capital Adequacy, Deposit Insurance and Security
Values," paper presented at the Western Finance Association Meeting, June
1978.

is a measure of changes of risk in the economy. The constant term

is added to the regression as an additional test of the robustness of the

empirical model. The constant term is expected not to be significantly

different from zero for any of the regressions. Macroeconomic variables
that should affect the value of the assets and liabilities include (1) changes
in the term structure of interest rates, since the bank is an institution
which borrows short and lends long, and (2) changes in the present value of
the market portfolio of risky assets.

The data series we have are so crude that it would be unreasonable to

run a regression of the desired form. Our data force us to use ratios of
book values rather than ratios of economic values for the X.'s. Using book
1

values, multicollinearity of the X.M. independent variables is very high
since the macroeconomic variables have a high variance relative to book values.

Thus the products X1M. and XkM. (for all i, k) will be highly correlated.

—87—

This would be true even if the X1s themselves were uncorrelated or negatively
correlated. For example, for the period January 1938 to December 1975:

where R =

change in the market index,

cggovs =

capital

gains on short—term government bonds,

cggovl =

gains on long-term government bonds.

The book value balance sheet data used in these correlations and in
the regressions for this section were computed from the Federal Reserve data
for Large New York Banks or Reserve City Member Banks of New York as

described in Section A—2. The interest rate data (yields, capital gains,
and total returns) are computed from the Standard and Poor's indices as

described in Section A—4. The return on the market and the return on the
New York City and Outside Mew York City banks were computed from Standard
and Poor's Composite Index, New York City Bank Index and Outside New York
City Bank Index, respectively.

We chose those elements of the bank's portfolio on which each macroeconomic variable is likely to have the largest effect, giving a regression
of the form:

selected i

AX

r rs k

where k is an asset class assumed to be responsible for the risk shift.

Returns on the market were assumed to influence the value of loans, as was

any change in the risk of the economy. Changes in the long rate were assumed

—88—

to affect the values of long—term assets (primarily government securities).

Changes in short rates were assumed to influence deposits. The regressions
could only be run for the New York banks, since balance sheet data were not
available for the outside New York banks.

One would expect that an unanticipated increase in the level of the
stock market would increase the value of risky assets (i.e. loans) and hence

the value of equity. An unanticipated increase in short—term rates should
decrease the value of short—term liabilities, and, ceteris paribus, increase

the value of equity. If (a) there are no monopoly returns to deposits, and
(b) deposits de facto have a duration greater than zero, they may be considered

a bond issued by the bank, which must pay out a fixed coupon consisting of
interest plus services with a total value equal to the short—term market

interest rate. If the short—term rate increases, the bank could buy back
deposits at less than par and incur a capital gain. As a proxy for this
variable one could use either yield changes or capital gains. Capital gains
and yield changes are related by a negative nonlinear transform. We feel
capital gains are a better measure than yield changes for two reasons:
(1) they are in the same units as the dependent variable (relative change

per month) and are hence easily interpretable, and (2) they are expected to
have a linear relationship with changes in the dependent variable, whereas
yield changes are not.11
-

An unanticipated increase in the long—term rate should decrease the

value of long—term assets (i.e., government securities) and thus decrease

the value of equity. The effect of a change in the risk of the economy is
not clear. If capital is completely adequate (that is, in no states of the

tried yield changes in many of the regressions instead of capital
gains. Results rarely changed by more than one—fifth of a standard deviation.
We

—89—

world will the bank default) and the assets get riskier but maintain their
value, neither the value of deposits nor that of chapital should change.
If capital is inadequate and a !•value_preserving spread" occurs, the

economic value of the deposits should fall and the value of the capital

should rise. If an increase in the riskiness of the economy decreases the
value of the bank's assets and increases the riskiness of the bank's assets,
and capital is completely adequate, the whole decrease in the value of.the

assets should fall on capital. If capital is inadequate, an increase in the
riskiness of the economy should not lower the value of capital by as much as
the decrease in the value of the assets, and may raise it. By using both

the return on the market and risk shift in our regressions, we hoped to
capture the effect of a risk shift in one coefficient and the effect of a
change in the value of assets in the other.

Results for the period January 1938 toDecember 1975 are shown in
Table 8—2.1. The difference between the 11118 corporate bond yield to maturity

and that on government long—term bonds was taken as a proxy for the riskiness of the corporate sector.
rs

refers to the first differences of the

series which were used as a proxy for changes in the riskiness of the economy.

Coefficients El and B2 have the expected sign. We anticipated a negative
sign on 83, but the coefficient is effectively zero. The coefficient on 114
suggests that. there was inadequate capital for the New York Banks. To see if
the New York Banks became more risky over time, we divided the data into two

periods 1938—1956 and 1957—1975. The previous equation was rerun for both
groups. Results are shown in Table 11—2.2. The size and sign of the B4
coefficient for the earlier period suggests that we have not adequately

controlled for our "value preserving spread." We partitioned our observations into four equal groups: 1938—June, 1947; July 1947—56; 1957—June, 1966;

—90—

and July, 1966—1975 and repeated the regression. Results are shown in
Table B—2.3. They suggest capital has gradually been becoming more inadequate

over the period. Note the constant term is insignificantly different from
zero in all these results.
tie realized that if balance sheet values have any meaning for capital

adequacy and we repartition by the balance sheet measure of capital adequacy,

our results should be better than partitioning by time. We did not expect
results a great deal better, for as seen in Section A—3, traditional measures
of capital adequacy have deteriorated over tine, and would hence tend to be

heavily correlated with time. This could allow us to choose among various
measures

fits

of capital adequacy. The "better" measures should yield better

(i.e., higher R2) when used for partitioning. We used a "reasonable"

measure of capital adequacy to see if it performed better than time. We
chose the ratio

assets—acceptances—capital
loans

The rationale for this ratio

is that acceptances do not belong on both sides of the economic balance
sheet; only the option value belongs on the liability side. This ratio is

roughly "deposits"/loans. Note that "deposits" includes borrowings and
other liabilities. We included borrowing because when the bank begins to
get risky, borrowing will be the first liability to leave. Dividing our
observations into two equal groups, those in which the New York Banks had a
high "deposit"/loan ratio (safe observations) and those in which they had a
low "deposit"/loan ratio (risky observations), the

tends, on average, to

be higher as shown in Table B—2.4. Capital seems to be adequate for the
-safe group and inadequate for the risky group. The observations were
redivided into four equal parts, and the measure seems to perform somewhat
better than time alone (as shown i.n Table B—2.5).

This experiment was rerun using the ratio

which

assets—acceçces_capita1
——
assets—acceptances

is roughly equal to fldeposits/assets1t. First the observations were

divided into two groups (as shown in Table 3—2.6), then four groups (as shown

in

Table 3—2.7). This ratio did not perform as well as either "deposits"/loans

or time.

Unfortunately, this test is not really powerful enough to assess

various measures of capital adequancy. Our results appear promising enough
to repeat using cross section data.
