UNIONISM AND THE DISPERSION
OF WAGES
RICHARD B. FREEMAN*

This study examines the effect of trade unionism on the dispersion of wages

among male wage and salary workers in the private sector in the United
States. It finds that the application of union wage policies designed to
standardize rates within and across establishments significantly reduces wage

dispersion among workers covered by union contracts and that unions
further reduce wage dispersion by narrowing the white-collar/blue-collar
differential within establishments. These effects dominate the more widely
studied impact of unionism on the dispersion of average wages across industries, so that on net unionism appears to reduce rather than increase wage

dispersion or inequality in the United States.

pay), unionism also increases inequality.

RADE unionism alters

the distribution of
wages in several ways. First, by raising
the wages of organized workers relative to
others, unionism changes the dispersion of
wages in the economy, increasing inequality when highly paid workers are organized

Alternately, however, unions also affect the

dispersion of wages within the organized
sector through the "stanjard rate" policies

stressed in the institutional literature.2

While most economists accept the notion
that standardization of rates reduces dispersion among union members, quantitative estimates of this effect are lacking.
The within-sector effect could be large,
offsetting or more than offsetting the increase in inequality due to the impact on
dispersion across groups, or it could be
small.

workers are organized. On the basis of estimates of the wage effect and its correlation
with wage levels, Lewis concluded that by
raising wages unionism has raised the relative inequality of average wages among industries, as measured by the standard deviation of relative wages, by two to three percentage points.' In addition, simply by creating differentials between otherwise comparable workers (regardless of their level of

INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW

The purpose of this paper is to estimate
the magnitude of the effect of unionism on

the dispersion of wages in the organized
sector and to use the estimates to examine
the potential contribution of the institution to overall wage dispersion. The first
section of the paper reviews the evidence on
trade union standard rate policies and con-

siders the economic rationale underlying
them. The second section contrasts the dis-

persion of earnings among blue-collar
workers in the organized sector with that in

the unorganized sector. Section three examines the effect of unionism on the differential between production and nonproduction workers within establishments. Section
four then compares the dispersion-increasing and dispersion-reducing effects of unionism to obtain an estimate of the overall
effect of the institution on wage inequality.
A final section reports conclusions.

Union Wage Policy andIntrasectoral Dispersion
Unionism is expected to reduce the dispersion of wages among organized workers
because of long-standing union wage policies in favor of the "standard rate," defined
as uniform piece or time rates among comparable workers across establishments and
impersonal rates or ranges of rates in a given
occupational class within establishments.

That unions strive to standardize rates
across establishments has long been recog-

nized by institutional labor economists.
Indeed, according to Slichter, Healy and
Livernash, "wage standardization within
an industry or local product market is the
most widely heralded union wage policy."3
Sufficient examples exist of major collective
bargaining agreements that achieved stand-

ardization of rates to suggest, moreover,
that the goal of uniformity across firms has
influenced the wage structure. The development of the Comprehensive Wage Study
in steel in 1946— 47 appears to have in-

1947 to 1954 eliminated the longstanding
southern "Birmingham" geographic differential. The ILGWU and Amalgamated
Clothing Workers have established uniform
piece rates in their contracts in broad geo-

graphic areas. The Teamsters reduced regional differentials for over-the-road drivers

in 1964 when the National Master Freight
Agreement was signed. In most instances of
multi-employer bargaining (which in 1974
constituted 42 percent of major collective
agreements in the United States), or multi-

plant bargaining (an additional 42 per-

cent5), uniform or near uniform rates are
established across firms.

The policy of standardization of rates
across plants has not been adhered to blindly, of course. "Exceptions" are often granted

to take account of specific competitive
situations, such as the danger of a plant

closing,6 and the relevant sector or wage
"contour" for standardization changes as
market conditions change. There is no deny-

ing, however, that union policies operate
toward uniformity of rates among similar
plants and less dispersion within the organized sector.

The economic rationale and strength of
policies toward standardization of rates
across establishments will depend on market conditions. When firms compete in the

same market, both employer and worker
interest can be expected to favor standard
rates. On the firm side, no enterprise wants

than those of its competitors.7 On the

INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW

It is difficult to see how the union would be
able to maintain its organizational strength

and monopolistic prices, in fact, with significant personal differentials within firms.
Moreover, since presumably all workers obtain higher wages in the presence of the union, there are no 'losers" from the policy but
simply differential gainers.
Not all union wage policies, it should be

nitude of this reduction. Do unions reduce
inequality in wage dispersion within the
union sector by a sizeable amount? And
how does this reduction compare to the increase in inequality due to the potential increase in dispersion of wages between the
union and nonunion sectors?
Dispersion Among Blue-Collar Workers

noted, operate toward reduction of dispersion. The effect of unionism on blue-collar
occupational differentials is unclear, apparently varying by the type of union and
workers organized. Craft unions may widen
the wage structure by raising the pay of the

erated to maintain or increase percentage
skill differentials in response to pressures
from skilled workers. After reviewing the
evidence, Reynolds and Taft concluded that

"any net effect on occupational differentials. . . [isI in the direction of narrowing."2
Whatever unions do to the skill differential
among blue-collar workers, however, they
tend to raise the pay of production workers

relative to higher paid nonproduction

workers within firms and thus narrow that
component of occupational wage differentials.

Finally, note that standardization of piece
rates, as opposed to time rates, has no clear
effect on dispersion. If in the absence of unionism piece rates would be higher in less

productive plants, standardization would
increase dispersion in hourly pay; if, conversely, piece rates would je higher in more

productive plants, standardization would
decrease dispersion.

These complications notwithstanding,

the institutional evidence of wage policies
under collective bargaining suggests that
trade unionism can be expected to reduce
inequality of wages within the union sector,
largely by equalizing rates across establishments and by replacing personal rates by
formal job rates within establishments. The
key issue addressed in this paper is the mag°Reynolds and Taft, The Evolution of Wage Structure, p. 185.

widely used in modern labor economics;
when union wage differentials are measured

in relative rather than absolute terms; and
when earnings are iognormaliy distributed.
In comparison to other widely used measures of wage dispersion, the standard devia-

tion of in wages weights inequality more
heavily at the lower end of the distribution
than at the upper end.'5 Since this will attach less significance to the narrowing of the

white-collar/blue-collar gap in the upper
part of the distribution than to potential
increased inequality between union and
nonunion blue-collar workers in the lower
part, the standard deviation of in metric is
likely to "understate" the equalization of
wages under unionism relative to other
widely used metrics (such as Gini coeff icients, for example).
The principal problem in comparing dispersion of wages between organized and unorganized blue-collar or production workers
is to differentiate between the effect of unionism and the effect of other factors cor-

related (for whatever reason) with unionism. If union workers were more alike in
personal characteristics or in their distributions among industries or occupations than

UNIONISM AND THE DISPERSION OF WAGES
nonunion workers, the variance in in wages

would be lower in the union sector for
reasons extraneous to standardization policies.

This study employs several techniques to
deal with this problem. One is to compare
dispersion within narrowly defined groups,
such as workers in the same three-digit industry with the same age, sex, and education. As comparison cells become increasingly narrow, the possibility of differences
due to omitted factors that are correlated
with unionism is reduced.

Multiple regression analysis provides

another tool for "correcting" for the effect
of different characteristics and identifying
those due to union wage policies. LetX be a
determinant of in wages (W), b, be its coefficient, and be the residual. Then, with the
superscript u for union workers and n for
nonunion workers, we have union and nonunion wage equations:

7

where a 2 (X') is the variance in character-

istic i among union members; a(XXu) is
the covariance in characteristics among
union members and a 2(X) and a2(XX")
are the relevant variances and covariances
for nonunion workers and where bs can be

taken from either the union or nonunion
regressions. Any variation not attributable
to Equation 3 represents the effect of union-

ism on dispersion among similar workers.

The decomposition of differences in

dispersion can be pursued further by comparing the variance explained by the regres-

sions, conditional on similar character-

istics, to the residual variation. With variances and covariances of the Xs fixed, unionism can change dispersion by altering
the effect of wage-determining variables on
earnings, reducing (or increasing) the regression coefficient in earnings equations;
or by altering the dispersion of earnings
among workers with the same wage-deter(1)

be estimated by comparing the dispersion

mates of the dispersion of wages among

and of the contributions of differences in
characteristics, differences in the coeff icients in wage equations, and of residual
variance to differences in dispersion were
made using the Current Population Surveys
(CPS) of the U.S. Bureau of the Census for
May 1973, May 1974, and May l975.' The

May surveys of the CPS contain data on

union membership, usual weekly earnings,

usual hours worked, and other characteristics of workers that permit analysis of differences in dispersion in relatively narrow

groupings. To obtain a large sample, the
three surveys were amalgamated into a
single sample, with earnings in 1974 and
1975 deflated to 1973 levels to maintain
comparability. To reduce differences in the
characteristics of workers, the analysis focuses on male private wage and salary workers, exclusive of students, and treats manufacturing and the rest of the economy separately.

The overall dispersion of wages among
union and nonunion blue-collar workers in

the sample is summarized in Table 1 in
terms of the standard deviation in usual
hourly and weekly earnings for manufactur-

ing and nonmanufacturing, respectively;
the difference in standard deviations; and
the F test for the difference. While lack of
controls makes interpretation of the results
subject to question, the pattern is clear: in

ing, the dispersion of wages among unionized male blue-collar workers is considerably lower than among nonunion workers.
The differences in standard deviations range
from — .10 to — .14 or from 22 to 30 percent
of the standard deviation in the nonunion
sector. By the F test, all of the differences in
the table are significant at better than the
one percent level.
The distribution of in wages in the two
sectors themselves is examined in the figure,
which presents the frequency distribution of
in usual hourly earnings for union and non-

union workers. The figure permits some
evaluation of the possibility that wages are
less dispersed among unionists largely because of some "peculiarity" in the tails of

the distribution, such as the absence of
either very low or very highly paid workers
from the union sector.'6 The figure shows no

striking aberrations in the distributions.
In both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, the upper and lower parts of the
earnings distribution are more compressed
about the median in the union sector, re-

sulting in more "peaked" frequencies.

Measured by the percentage difference be-

tween quintiles and the median, the top
quin tile is twice as far above the median in

the nonunion than in the union distribution in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing while the bottom quintile is twice

as far below the median in the nonunion
than union distribution in nonmanufacturing and 60 percent further below in manufacturing. Overall, the difference between

the top and bottom quintiles is markedly
less in union distributions, with in differences in manufacturing of .519 (nonunion)
and .298 (union) and differences in nonmanufacturing of .653 (nonunion) and .326
(union).17
"This would occur if either low wage firms were
driven out of the unorganized sector by union wage
gains or if high wage workers eschewed unionism because of standardization policies.

of log wages were: percentage deviation of the first
quintile from median: manufacturing, — 0.162 (uniOn), —0.259 (nonunion); nonmanufacturing, —0.164

(union) and — 0.328 (nonunion); percentage deviation of the fifth qu,ntile from the median: manufacturing, 0.136 (union) and 0.267 (nonunion); nonmanufacturing, 0.162 (union) and 0.325 (nonunion).

obtained by division of usual weekly earnings by usual hours worked. To eliminate effect of inflation on wage
differences among the 3 years, the wages of 1974 were divided by 1.0765; those in 1975 by 1.1782 to put them on a 1973

basis, using average hourly earnings of workers on private payrolls [U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Employment and Training Report of the President(Washington, D.C.: G.P.O., 1977) Table C-3, p.296].
Students and persons working fewer than 20 hours per week were deleted from the samples, and samples were limited
to private wage and salary workers.

As a first step toward determining whether the markedly lower dispersion of earnings

in the union sector can be attributed to union wage policies as opposed to the possibly
greater similarity of union than nonunion
workers, the standard deviation of the log of
hourly earnings was calculated within more

narrowly defined industry, occupation,
geographic, education, and age groups.

the differences in the standard deviations

that are statistically significant at the 5 per-

cent level. The data show clearly that in-

equality is smaller in the union sector
within detailed categories. In manufacturing, the dispersion is lower among organized workers in all two-digit industries,
in 68 of 75 three-digit industries, in all but 2
state groupings, and in all other categories.

of .028 versus .015 in the nonmanufacturing sector. The experience differentials are
also markedly lower among union workers,
suggesting flatter life cycle earnings pro-

files. The exclusion of union-negotiated
fringe benefits, which accrue largely to
older workers,'8 however, leaves open the
impact on total compensation, as opposed
to straight-time pay. Only the coefficient
on race shows any divergence from this
pattern, with a smaller impact in the union
equation in manufacturing but not in nonmanufacturing, a result possibly due to the

11

historic pattern of discrimination by craft
unions.
The coefficients on the diverse dummy
control variables listed in line 5 of the table
can be compared in terms of a measure not
shown in the table: the standard deviations
of these coefficients for the union and nonunion groups. In manufacturing, the standard deviation of the estimated coefficients
of the dummy variables among the 21 industry dummies used in columns 1-4 was
0.51 in the union sector compared to 0.55 in
the nonunion sector. The equivalent stand-

ard deviations among occupations were
0.28 (union) and 0.33 (nonunion); among
regions 0.08 (union) and 0.10 (nonunion);
and among SMSA groups, 0.07 (union) and

0.08 (nonunion). Thus in each case the

dummy variables reveal greater differentia-

tion in the nonunion sector. In nonmanu-

facturing, the results are stronger: the
standard deviation of coefficients on the
dummy variables on 2-digit industry dummies is 0.56 for union and 0.92 for nonunion
workers; the standard deviation on the coefficients for regions is 0.07 (union) versus
0.09 (nonunion); while the standard deviation on the coefficients by occupations are

0.51 (union) and 0.56 (nonunion). Comparable calculations based on the regressions with the more detailed controls in
columns 7 — 10 give similar results. With
states rather than regions as independent
variables, the standard deviations of the
dummy variable coefficients on geographic

areas are: manufacturing, union (0.39),
nonunion (0.57); nonmanufacturing, union

(0.29), nonunion (0.57). By contrast, the
standard deviations of coefficients on the
three-digit industry dummies are smaller
than those at the two-digit industry level.'9
Overall, the evidence suggests a diminution
of the effect of the diverse wage-determining

factors in the union sector, as predicted by
the standardization policy.

deviation of earnings in the union sector
due to the reduction in the coefficients on
wage-determining factors as opposed to
differences in the variation of characteristics among workers? How much of the
difference in dispersion is due to reduction
in dispersion among workers with similar
characteristics?

Calculations designed to answer these
important questions are given in Table 4,
which uses Equations 2 and 3 to evaluate the

differential impact of the forces at work.
Line 1 gives the differences in the standard
deviation of the log of hourly earnings between union and nonunion workers. Line 2
estimates the difference that could result if
union (nonunion) workers had the characteristics of nonunion (union) workers. Because workers in the union sample evince, in
general, less dispersed characteristics, the
figures in line 2 show a diminished differential in dispersion, though one that is not
large enough to alter substantially the basic
finding. According to the estimates, if union
workers had the same dispersion of characteristics as nonunion workers, the variance
of their wages would be substantially lower
than the variance of the wages of nonunion

workers. Adjustment for differences in
characteristics has only a "moderate" effect
on the differences in dispersion.
Line 3 of the table calculates the effect of
the difference in regression coefficients on
dispersion, using the characteristics of un-

ion and nonunion workers as weights. It

shows that because of the smaller impact of

measured factors on union than nonunion
earnings, dispersion was lower by 0.050 to
0.078 points in manufacturing and by 0.041

to 0.044 points in nonmanufacturing.

Finally, line 4 of the table compares the
residual variation in the union and nonunion wage equations, as given by the standard errors of estimate at the bottom of Table
3. The standard errors of estimate from the

regressions show that the union sector has
less dispersion in both manufacturing and
nonmanufacturing. Comparing the differences in dispersion due to the smaller regression coefficients in line 3 with the differ-

ences due to smaller residual variation in
line 4 reveals an interesting difference between the manufacturing and nonmanu-

facturing sectors. According to the table,
unionism lowers dispersion in manufacturing largely by reducing the effect of measured characteristics while it lowers dispersion in nonmanufacturing largely by
reducing variation within narrowly defined
groups. What is important, however, is not
the precise route of the impact but the fact
that, corrected for differences in characteristics, union workers have a markedly lower

dispersion of wages than nonunion workers.

Expenditures for Employee Compensa-

tion data set. The effect of unionism on dis-

persion can also be examined with establishment data on the compensation of production workers from the Expenditures for
Employee Compensation (EEC) survey of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The establishment data have both advantages and
disadvantages for examining the standardization hypothesis. On the plus side, the
data relate to total compensation (including fringes), giving a more comprehensive
measure of compensation than earnings on
the CPS tapes. In addition, unionization is
measured by a 0— 1 collective bargaining
coverage variable, which is 1 if 50 percent or

more of the production workers are organized and 0 otherwise. This is presumably
better than the union membership variable
on the CPS, since wages are set by contracts
for nonunion as well as union workers in

the unit. One major disadvantage of the
EEC tape is that the data do not contain information on worker characteristics and are

limited to establishment averages for all
production or nonproduction workers. To
rectify the lack of information on personal
characteristics, the mean education, percent
above fifty and below thirty years of age,
percent male, andpercent black of union or
nonunion production workers in the threedigit industry in which the establishment

was located were added to the data tape,
using estimates based on the CPS files. Detailed industry dummy variables and these
measures partly remedy the lack of informa-

tion on personal characteristics. Another
problem, for which there is no remedy, is
that for reasons of confidentiality the BLS
deleted certain large establishments from
the data set, with unclear effects on dis-

To obtain as large a sample as possible,

the EEC surveys for 1967 — 68, 1969— 70, and

1971 —72 were amalgamated into a single

sample. Despite its problems, the EEC

survey is an especially valuable source of
data on the impact of collective organization on dispersion because it permits us to
check on one of the presumed routes of the
standardization of wages, equalization of
rates across establishments, which cannot
be studied with data tapes on individuals.
Estimates of the link of trade unionism to

the standard deviation of the log of total
hourly compensation for production workers in manufacturing industries in the EEC
data file are given in Table 5. Line 1 records
the number of union and nonunion establishments in the sample. Line 2 gives the
standard deviations in the log of total compensation while line 3 records the standard

error of estimate obtained by regressing
the log of compensation on the variables
listed in line 4. Line 5 gives the R2 from the

regression and line 6 compares standard
deviations within specified narrow categories.

25See Richard B. Freeman and James L. Medoff,
"New Estimates of Private Sector Unionism in the
United States, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Vol. 32, No. 2 (January 1979) for discussion of
this problem.

The principal conclusion to be drawn
from the table is that, consistent with the
standardization hypothesis, unionism is
associated with markedly lower variations
in compensation across establishments.

The "raw" differences in standard deviations in line 2 differ by 0.044 or 15 percent,
yielding an F statistic of 1.37, significant at
better than one percent. The residuals from
the regression differ by 0.033, also 15 per-

cent, and have an F statistic of 1.30, also
significant at better than one percent. The
detailed comparisons in line 6 reveal significantly lower dispersions among union
firms in eight of twenty-one industries compared to a significantly higher dispersion in

just one industry; and significantly lower
dispersions in the union sector in six of nine
size categories and three of four regions.

The results in nonmanufacturing, summarized in Table 6, tell a more complex
story, in part because of the peculiar distribution of firms among sectors. In the EEC
union sample 54 percent of firms are in con-

tract construction compared to 24 percent
of nonunion firms. Given this differential
pattern and the high wages in construction,
the standard deviation of the log of hourly
compensation turns out to be higher in the

union sector (line 1), by a modest but statistically significant amount, contrary to
our hypothesis. This result appears, however, to be due entirely to the sample differences noted above: when we look within industries, the results are reversed. This is clear
in the regression of the log of hourly com-

pensation on the industry controls and
other variables. Because of the "peculiar"
cross-industry distribution of establishments, the regression equation accounts for
71 percent of the variance in the log of earnings in the union sector (largely via the in-

dustry dummies) compared to 48 percent

of the variance in the nonunion sector.
"Corrected" for differences in characteristics, the direction of the difference in
standard deviation is reversed. In line 3, the

residual dispersion of wages in the union
sector is a sizeable 0.062 or 22 percent less
than the residual dispersion in the nonunion sector. Although not shown, the F
statistic between the variances is 1.63, which

is considerably larger than the F of 1.11 in

line 1. More importantly, comparisons of

standard deviations within 27 industry
groupings in line 4 show seven with significantly lower dispersions among union
plants compared to one with significantly
higher dispersion in the union sector. Thus,
although somewhat more equivocal due to

a greater raw standard deviation for the
union sample, the EEC data on nonmanufacturing tend to support the conclusion
that dispersion is lower in the union sector.
Impact on White-Collar/Blue-Collar
Differences
Thus far we have found that dispersion of
wages among organized blue-collar workers is lower than dispersion of wages among

unorganized blue-collar workers for two
reasons: smaller impacts of wage-determining factors on earnings and smaller
"residual variation" among similar workers. Since we included occupation and skill
variables in our analysis and found smaller

coefficients on those variables, we have
dealt with the impact of unionism on blue-

collar skill differences as well as on the
union effect on workers within skill categories.

There is, however, one important effect
of unionism on within-establishment inequality that has been ignored in our analysis, namely, the effect of union wage gains
on the white-collar/blue-collar differential.

Since unionization occurs almost exclusively among blue-collar workers and since
white-collar workers tend to be paid more,
on average, than blue-collar workers, the
union wage effect tends to reduce inequality
in this case.

The magnitude of the impact of trade
unionism on the white-collar/blue-collar
differential within the union sector can be
estimated by regression analysis using the
EEC data set. Let W = wage of blue-collar
workers; X = characteristics of blue-collar
workers; UN = 0— 1 dummy variable for

where

Equation 5 is that it exploits the existence of

data on blue- and white-collar workers
within the establishment to determine the
effect of unionism on intra-establishment
inequality. Because the dependent variable
refers to within-establishment differences,
any "omitted firm factor" that affects both
blue- and white-collar workers has similarly

been differenced away in the calculation.
The coefficient on unionism reflects the
impact of collective bargaining on bluecollar wages relative to its (positive, nega-

three-digit industry on which the establishment is located (from the May CPS tapes, as

described earlier); unionism of blue- and
white-collar workers; and the ratio of whiteto blue-collar workers in the establishment.

average white-collar premium in the establishments; line 3 gives the coefficient on

The calculations show that the whitecollar/blue-collar differential is significantly reduced by collective bargaining of

and nonmanufacturing industries. In man-

lines estimate the contribution of the white-

ufacturing an average differential of .40

persion. The estimate of the differential in

(line 2) is reduced by .12 points as a result of

collective bargaining of plant workers. In
nonmanufacturing, an average differential
of .27 is reduced by .14 points. By lowering
the income advantage of white-collar work-

ers in an establishment, trade union wage
gains reduce inequality in the organized
sector.

Total Effects of Unionism on
Wage Dispersion
Given the preceding estimates of the impact of trade unionism on the dispersion of
wages among organized blue-collar workers
and on the white-collar/blue-collar differential, what is the total effect of unionism on
dispersion in the organized sector? And how
does this effect compare to possible increases

in dispersion due to the union/nonunion
blue-collar wage differential?

The impact of unionism on the dispersion of wages in the organized sector as a
whole can be evaluated by the standard conditional variance formula. Let a be the
variance in in wages for all workers in a sec-

tor and o be the variance for production
(blue-collar) workers and a, the variance
for white-collar workers and let a be the
production (blue-collar) worker share of
workers. Then if (W — Wb) is the differential between the mean in wages of whitecollar and blue-collar workers,

Manufacturing," Re-view of Economics and Slatistics

(forthcoming), Table 2, shows that the division of
production and nonproduction workers differs some-

what between the union and nonunion sectors in
manufacturing in the EEC. In the union sector, production workers constitute 65 percent of total manhours; in nonunion manufacturing, production manhours constitute 72 percent. This difference is too
small to merit analysis with different proportions.
'2This is an approximation as the regression estimates relate to the effect of unionism on the mean In
blue-collar/white-collar differential rather than to the
difference between the mean in blue-collar wage and
the mean In white-collar wage.

this assumption seems sufficiently plausible

that any difference in dispersion of earnings among
white-collar workers could be attributed to "other
factors," it is important to make sure that there are
no enormous disparities that would raise the overall
dispersion in the union sector. Accordingly, I calculated the standard deviation of total compensation per
manhour of office workers in the EEC sample, finding
figures of 0.29 in union manufacturing. 0.40 in non-

union manufacturing, and 0.42 in union nonmanufacturing, and 0.46 in nonunion nonmanufacturing.
Whatever interpretation is placed on these differences, they do not run counter to the assertion that
overall dispersion is lower in the union sector.

variance.

The payoff to the calculations is in the
final lines of the table, which show the esti-

mated variance and standard deviation of
earnings in the absence of unionism and
estimated variance and standard deviation
of earnings in the presence of unionism. In
both the manufacturing and nonmanufac-

turing sectors unionism is estimated to
reduce dispersion significantly. Unionism
lowers the standard deviation by .071 points
or 14 percent in manufacturing, and by .059

points or 11 percent in nonmanufacturing;

unionism lowers the variances by .065
points (27 percent) in manufacturing and by

.059 points (21 percent) in nonmanufacturing.
The final issue to consider is how the estimated dispersion-reducing effects of union-

ism compare to the dispersion-increasing
effects of unionism due to the union wage
effect. Are the dispersion-reducing or the
dispersion-increasing effects of unionism
larger? Calculations designed to answer this
question are presented in Table 9. It uses the
conditional variance equation (Equation 6),

applied to union and nonunion male blue-

collar workers, to estimate the effect of
unionism on the dispersion of wages of all
male blue-collar workers and then considers
the contribution to wage dispersion of the
effect of unionism on the male white-collar/
blue-collar differential. Line 1 records esti-

estimated effect of unions on comparable
workers (Table 4, line 2b) by the proprotion
of male blue-collar workers who are organ-

ized, as given in the figures in Table 1.
Since roughly half of male workers are union members, the figure in line 1 is about

characteristics included in Table 2, the
union premium among male bluecollar
workers was estimated to be 0.12 in manufacturing and 0.32 in nonmanufacturing.24

analysis is based on a regression of log hourly
earnings on all of the control variables listed in Table

the union coefficient and standard error were 0.12
(.005), with the larger set of controls, the coefficient
and standard error were 0.11 (.005). In nonmanufacturing the estimates were 0.32 (.006) with smaller set of

controls, and 0.311 (.006) with larger set of controls.

INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW

Following Equation 6, the premium is
squared and multiplied by the relevant
shares of union and nonunion workers
among male blue-collar workers. Line 2b
uses the estimates of the union premium and

the differential between union and nonunion blue-collar men, uncorrected for differences in characteristics, to evaluate the

dispersion-increasing effect of unions on
male blue-collar labor. The estimates in 2b
take account of the fact that unionized labor
tends to be more skilled and therefore higher

paid than nonunion labor, even in the absence of organization. The estimates are ob-

tained in accordance with Equation 6 by
subtracting the square of the differential be-

tween union and nonunion workers in the

presence of unionism and the estimated

significant difference between the estimated
effect of unionism on the white-collar/bluecollar differential in the EEC file (0.14) and
the estimated union wage effect in the CPS
file (0.32) (a pattern that is consistent only
if unions have a major "spillover" effect on
white-collar labor), two estimates are given.

The first (lower) estimate uses the EEC
estimates of the effect of unionism on the
white-collar/blue-collar differential (multiplied by the union share of blue-collar
labor) while the second estimate assumes
that the differential is lowered by the CPS
estimated union wage effect (multiplied by
the union share of blue-collar labor). Because in manufacturing the estimated effect

The results of these calculations are clear.

nonmanufacturing workers, on the other
hand, the net effects are small, with a slight
reduction in dispersion in the comparable
workers' calculation and an increase in the
all workers' calculation.
Line 4 contains estimates of the change
in the variance of earnings due to the impact
of unionism on the white-collar/blue-collar

differential. In both manufacturing and
nonmanufacturing, the differential in the
presence of unionism is taken to be the actual differential in the CPS files for the relevant sector. In manufacturing, the differential in the absence of unionism is estimated
as the actual differential plus the multiplicand of the union share of blue-collar labor

and the estimated effect of unions on the

white-collar/blue-collar differential in

Table 7. In nonmanufacturing, due to the

the same magnitude, only one estimate is
necessary on that sector.
The final line gives our estimates of the

large. In nonmanufacturing, where the
tial larger, the direction of the effect is
smaller and dependent on whether EEC or
CPS estimates of the effect of unionism on

white-collar/blue-collar differentials are
used.
Finally, what about the effect of unionism

on the manufacturing/nonmanufacturing
differential? Focusing once more on produc-

non workers, the contribution of unionism to the differential wages in manufactur-

ing versus nonmanufacturing can be estimated from the evidence on proportions of
workers organized in the two sectors, the
size of the union wage effect, and the basic
differential between the sectors. Since unionism, by our estimates, raised the wages
of 55 percent of male production workers
in manufacturing by 0.12 points compared
to an effect of 0.32 points on 40 percent of
male production workers in nonmanufacturing, the overall wage of blue-collar manufacturing workers may have risen by 0.06

points compared to an increase of 0.13

points in nonmanufacturing. The differential between nonunion workers in the two

UNIONISM AND THE DISPERSION OF WAGES
sectors was 0.11 in favor of manufacturing
workers. If, in fact, unions raised the earnings of nonmanufacturing workers by 0.07
points relative to manufacturing workers,
the net effect would be to reduce inequality
by lowering the manufacturing advantage
from 0.11 to 0.04, reducing dispersion by a
modest amount, according to the relevant
part of Equation 6.
In sum, the dominant effect of unionism
on dispersion is through the reduction in
intrasectoral dispersion, with the sizeable
reduction in dispersion in manufacturing
leading to an overall reduction in inequality.2

Conclusions, Provisos, and Implications
The major findings of this study can be
summarized briefly as follows:

(1) Trade unions have adopted wage
policies designed to reduce dispersion of
earnings within and across establishments,
for what can be rationalized as plausible
economic reasons.

(2) Other things equal, the dispersion of
earnings is significantly lower among organized blue-collar workers, in part because
of a reduced effect of standard wage-deter-

mining factors on earnings and in part because of smaller dispersion within categories of workers having the same wage-determining characteristics.
(3) Dispersion of average compensation
is also lower among establishments that are
unionized than among those that are not.
(4) Unionism reduces white-collar/blue"These calculations are, it should be stressed, consistent with Lewis's estimates of tise enlarged dispersion of the interindustry wage structure due to unionism. According to Lewis (p. 292), unionism may have

increased dispersion of wages among industries by
0.022 to 0.026 In points in 1958. Assuming a similar
impact in the 1970s, we see that the dispersion-reducing effects in line 1 of Table 9 exceed these figures.

Note that Lewis's estimated 8 percent increase in
dispersion (p. 295) takes as its base the dispersion of
wages among industries, not the dispersion among
people. It is thus appropriate to use his estimates of the
In point effect of unions rather than of the percentage
effect of union wage gains on dispersion.

collar earnings differentials in the organized
sector, further contributing to within-sector
reductions in dispersion.

(5) Overall, the within-sector effect of
unionism on dispersion appears to more
than offset the increase in dispersion of
earnings across industries, so that on net
unionism reduces inequality.
The major weakness with these findings
is that, despite our efforts, at least some of
the lower dispersion in the union sector may
be due to inadequately controlled characteristics of organized workers. While our controls have been at least as complete as those
in other studies, the possibility that more
narrow groupings would reduce the difference in variances cannot be denied. In addi-

tion, to minimize problems of comparability we have dealt exclusively with male
workers, which leaves open the possibility
that if (for some unknown reason) unionism

has a different effect on the dispersion of
wages of women, our results may not be
generalizable. To the extent that reduction
in dispersion of earnings leads to reduced
dispersion of abilities in the union sector,
there may be little or no economywide effect
on inequality or efficiency.
Assuming that the result is correct, however, the welfare implication of a reduction
in wage inequality due to unionism is by no

means clear. To the extent that the dispersion of wages reflects disequilibrium, the
influence of peculiar nonmarket forces, and

the failure of the market to bring about
"equal pay for equal work," the reduction in
dispersion among comparable workers may
have desirable efficiency implications. To
the extent that the dispersion in the absence
of unionism reflects dispersion of marginal
products perfectly, however, the reduction
among comparable workers may cause inefficiencies. Finally, of course, the distributional effects of standard wage policies must
also be weighed in any assessment of their
effect on welfare. Normative issues aside,
what is important is that unions have a sizeable, generally neglected, impact on withinsector dispersion, which may be attributable
to their standardization-of-rate policies.
