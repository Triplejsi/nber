Inflation and the Choice of Asset Life

SUMMARY

Given the current corporate tax structure in the U.S., inflation
may have an important impact on the production decisions of firms,
notably the choice of capital durability.

This paper presents a model of competitive behavior in which

firms may choose the durability of their capital goods. We find that
in the presence of inflation, the taxation of corporate profits may
influence both the choice of asset life and the market value of equity.
In particular, the failure to index depreciation allowances depresses
share values and biases the choice of asset life toward greater durability.

Integrating this analysis with the traditional one-sector monetary
growth model, we study the general equilibrium impact of inflation on
such long run characteristics of the economy as output per capita
and the real rate of return received by investors.

I. Introduction

One of the most important aspects of the one—sector monetary

growth model developed by Tobin (1965) is the analysis of the effect

of inflation on the steady-state

II. The Choice of Asset Life
We consider the steady state of a growing economy with one pro-

duction sector, in which we assume there is perfect competition and

constant returns to scale in production. Firms produce output using
two factors, capital and homogenous labor. The price of new capital

goods at time t is, of course, equal to the price of all "other" goods,
denoted p. The wage rate is w. The rate at which p and w inflate is
denoted ir.

Savings by individuals may take the form of money or firm

equity. The government issues money, which carries a fixed a nominal

return of zero, arid raises the rmirider of its required revenues
through lump sum taxes and the taxation of corporate income.3 The rate
at which equity holders discount nominally measured flows from the firm

is r.
Capital goods decay exponentially at a constant rate, 6. Rowever,

6 is variable ex ante, and subject to choice by the firm. We assume

that increases in 6 increase the flow of capital services per unit of
time from a unit of capital, such increases being subject to diminishing returns. This flow is represented by the function A (6) (A' > 0,
A" < 0). Gross output is defined by:

(1) G

H(KS,L) ; H, EL? H > 0 ; H, E < 0

(8), as having two steps. In the first step, described by equation
firms minimize the implicit cost of capital services, c, by
their choice of 5. Once this is done, labor and capital services are

combined to maximize profits, with their marginal revenue products

IV. Steady—State Behavior

In this section, we incorporate the foregoing analysis of the
firm into a neoclassical growth model. A complete presentation of the
basic model may be found in Solow (1970).

In a steady state, gross output may be expressed as a function

of the capital stock, labor in use, and capital decay rate:
G(KL6)

(31)

H(A(6)K,L)

The corresponding value of

net output is

less capital decay:

F(K,L,5) = G(K,L,6) — 6K

(32)

Since the functions G and F are homogenous of degree one in K

and L, we may divide by L to write each in intensive form:
G

We

assume that the economy has a population growing at rate n,

with labor supplied inelaztically,8 and that government expenditures

comprise a fixed fraction, y, of net output. These expenditures are

financed, in part, by expanding the money supply at a nominal growth
rate, g. The rest of the required revenue is raised through taxes,
including the corporate income tax. Letting m and T represent real

For any particular assumption about the structure of depreciation allowances, equations (12), (13), (35), (45), and (46) comprise a system
of seven equations in eight unknowns: k, p,

, ,
w/p,

q, C, and rr.

By dropping (35.3) and substituting (13) into (35.1) and (35.2), we

obtain a system in k, p, S, q, C, arid r. By differentiating this
system with respect to r, we may assess the impact that a change in the

i-

rate of inflation has on the steady-state values of the other five
unknown variables.

The first thing to notice about (48) is that if the liquidity preference function, 2. (and hence a), is not dependent on , then the system

the failure to index depreciation

It is even more certain that the lack of replacement cost depreciation

leads to a greater shift to long—lived assets. Not only will the increase likely to occur in dk/dir lead to this, but so will the heavier

When depreciation allowances are not

flation will likely lead to even more capital deepening, and a greater
shift to more durable capital, both because of the added increase in

at high levels of inflation. We therefore proceed to a numerical sin—

We can see that, once in.flation reaches 10 percent, additional
increases

in ir may not have the same effects; In particular, q begins

to rise again and k falls, along with C. The marginal product of capital increases, so that ceases to decline. However, the increase in
capital dura.bility continues, with asset life increasing an additional
13.4 percent between inflation rates of 10 and 20 percent.
One should be hesitant to draw firm conclusions from this simple

example. However, it does illustrate the impact that the failure to
index depreciation allowances can have on the choice of asset life, as
well as other relevant economic variables.

VII. Conclusion

In this paper, we have introduced the choice of asset life into
the neoclassical monetary growth framework, and have explored how this

choice may be influenced by the structure of depreciation allowances,

27

particularly tlie fact that such allowances are generally not indexed

to account for inflation. Our results, summarized in the introduction, should serve to emphasize the importance of this question.
