CHI WREN' S HEALTH AND THE FAMILY

Linda N. Edwards and Michael Grossman
ABSTRACT

Th. objective of this paper is to •ine the relationship between a number
of fily characteristics and' the health of white children aged 6 to 11 y.ars
residing in those families. The partial effects of family income on health are
1l and seldom statistically significant. Indeed, some health probimas—high

blood pressure, allergies, and tension——are more likely to occur among children
from high income families •

The

general findii of small partial income effects

is supported by analysis of gross health differences between children from lower
and higher income families. In those cases where significant gross health difference. do exist between children from these two income classes, decomposition of
these gross differences shows thmn to be attributable in large part to factors

other than income itself. The finding that differences in health related solely
to income are safler than oonly believed implies that policies to improve
the well-being of children via income transfers, such as those advocated by the
recent Carnegie Council on Children, would have, at best, very small effects on
health. Indeed, the most important conclusion of our study is that the present
tendency to base government child health programs on simplistic notions that in00.S is the primary source of differences in children's health will not lead
towards fruitful or successful public policy regarding children's health.

Among the other family characteristics studied, our most interesting resuits are for parents' schooling, mother's labor force status, and family size.
Parents' schooling is an important determinant of children's health. In most
instances children of well educated parents are in better health than those of
less well educated parents. In fact, for four of the five health measures that
have a significant gross correlation with income, much of this observed income
difference is accounted for by associated differences in parents' schooling.
Tbs mother's labor force status and family size have small health effects and
are strongly related only to the health variables representing the child's
nutritional status (height, weight, and the periodontal index). Children
whose mothers are in the labor force or who come from larger families are
likely to score more poorly with respect to these nutritional measures • These
results are important in the light of the striking upward trend in the labor
force participation rate of married women with children and the striking downward trend in family size in the United States.

Finally, the frequency with which the child received dental care has large
and significant impacts for most of the health measures • This finding is impor-

tant because the dental care variable serves as a proxy of the price and availability of preventive medical care. If it can be replicated with more direct
measures of preventive care, then policies directed at either improving the
availability of medical care or altering public attitudes towards preventive
care could have large health payoffs for children.

CHILDREN' $ HEALTH AND THE FAMILY

Linda N. Edwards and Michael Grossman*

I•

Introduction

children's health care has been and continues to be provided primarily

within the family. This is in marked contrast to the provision of children'.
education which for the past 100 years has been considered a legitimat. con-

cern of government (see Landes and Solmon (1)).

While no one believes that

the government can replace the family in providing education for children,
state governments do determine how many years children must attend school,

how many days per year they must attend, and, to a large extent, the content

of that schøoling. Further, recent rulings of the Supreme Court stipulate
that all children are entitled to schooling of equal quality. Only recently
has attention turned to the role of the preschool years, and consequently,

the family, in determining the intellectual developnent of children.
In the case of children's health, it has been widely recognized that

it is the family rather than the public or medical care sectors that plays
the fundamental role. For e'campl., a recent Carnegie Council on Children

report says "Doctors do not provide the bulk of health care f or children;

families do" (Keniston (3), p. 179).

With the exception of immunization,

which clearly has important externalities, there has been no form of compul-

sory health care for children,2 and with the advent of relatively simple
and effective treatments for important childhood diseases of the past
(influenza, pneueonia, and tuberculosis), one might even imagine that the

doctor's role i. declining. Indeed, the expanding interest of pediatricians
into the area of the "new morbidity"—"learning difficulties and school
problems, behavioral disturbances, allergies, speech difficulties, visual

—2—

problis, and the problems of adolescents in coping and adjusting"--is a response to the decline in importance of the traditional health problems of
children. 3
While the overall Importance of the family in providing health care for
children is widely acknowledged, information about the nature of the asso-

ciation betwen various family characteristics and the health status of

children is relatively scarce.

Much of the literature conóentrates on two

infant health measures--infant mortality and birth weight—-and docusenta that

infants from both black families and low income filies experience a higher
incidence of mortality and low birth weight (Keniston (3), p. 1561. When

the health of children who survive the first year of life is the subject of
study, much less is known and again, existing studies focus primarily on
health differences associated with income and race .

For

example, there is

evidence that both black families and low income families evaluate their

children's health as poorer than do white or high income families. Similarly, children from black or low income families are reported to exhibit a
higher incidence of "significant abnormalities" on a physical exam.5 The
extent to which these docusented differences are the result of income and/or

race alone, as opposed to correlated factors like parental education, family
size, mother's work status, and place of residence, has hardly been studied.
In order to formulate sensible and effective programs to improve the health
of children, we need a much better understanding of how these and other

family characteristics work in producing healthy children. Our study is a

step in this direction.
More specifically, the objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between a nusber of family characteristics and the health of

children aged 6 to 11 years residing in those families. This aultivariate

analysis is carried out within the framework of an economic aiod.l of the fam-

ily. Such a framework explicitly recognizes not only the family's function

as health care provider, but also that it is faced with resource constraints
and that some of

it.

objectives for its children may conflict with maxi-

mizing their health level.
The data set used, Cycle II of the Health Examination Survey, is an exceptional source of information about a national sample of 7,119 noninstitutionalized children aged 6 to 11 years in the 1963-65 period.6 T1 data
comprise

complete medical and

developmental histories

by the parent, information on family socioeconomic

characteristics, birth

certificate information, and a school report with data on school performance
and classroom behavior provided by teachers or other school officials. Most
important, there are objective measures of health from detailed physical
eirT.lnations. The physical examinations (as wall as associated psychological

and achievement tests) were a%inistered by the Public Health Service. There

is little direct information about the medical care received by these children, but some attempt will be made to control for variations in the avail-

ability of local medical care.
The amount of health information for the children in the Cycle II sample

is prodigious. To illustrate the exact nature of this information and to
provide a description of the overall health of the children in the sample,
selected ssry data are presented in Table I • Panel A indicates that
almost 95 percent of parents rate their child's health as good or very good.
At the same time, however, 19 percent of these parents consider their child's
present health to be a problem. The Public Health Service physicians affirm

the latter assessment in the sense that they find that 11 • 2 percent of the
children had at least one "significant abnormality" (see Panel B). An

indication of the types of probls that may be bothering parents is given
by

the incidence of various itams in the medical history (Panel C). The

total picture, then, is of a cohort whose overall health is good but who

are nevertheless disturbed by particular health problns.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section Il briefly describes the economic model of the family used to generate the relationships to be esti-

mated. Section III discusses the nature of the estimated relationships
and defines the variable measures •

The

estimates are presented and dis-

cussed in Section IV. The final sections highlight and interpret the sta-

tistical findings of the study.
II. The Economist's View of Children and Children's Health

An important focal point of recent economic models of fertility [Becker
and Lewis (14); Willis (15); Ben Porath and Welch (16)] is that children
not

are

homogeneous. In particular, these models distinguish between two aspects

of children that enter the parents' consumption (or investment) portfolio—-

the number of children and the "quality" of each child. By quality of the

child is meant those characteristics of the child which generate utility

(or disutility) for the parents: his health, sex, wealth,
intellectual development, sense of humor, etc. Therefore,

composition, they choose not only how many chil-

they will have, but also what portion of the family's resources will be

devoted to each child. 7 This choice is made in the usual way:

the number and quality of children, as

goods,

so as to maximize their utility subject to the constraints imposed

well as of other consumption

by their wealth (their potential earned income and their nonearned income)

and the various prices they face. In the case of children, there is a
further constraint in the form of children's genetic endowments which in

of a

given quality depends on the prices of the pur-

chased inputs—-parents' time, medical care, food, toys, lodging, etc.——and
on

the efficiency with which these inputs are used. The marginal cost of

a child, then, depends on the quality chosen and on the cost of one unit of

that amount of quality. Similarly, the cost of an increment in quality depends on how many children will receive this increment (i.e. family size)

and on

the cost of

an incremental unit of

quality.9 To take the case of

the aspect of child quality focused on in this paper, children's health,
the

cost (price) of increasing the average health level of all children

in the family depends on the number of children in the family and on the
costs of medical care, nutrition, the parents' or other caretakers' time,
and any other purchased inputs used to improve children's health. In addition, to the extent that there are systematic differences in the ability of
families to produce children's health with given inputs, these differences

in efficiency are also relevant. For example, more

Given

these considerations, the following factors are expected

health inputs (vitamins, sanitation, etc.), the prices of inputs used to
produce other aspects of child quality, and the prices of other forms of
parents' consumption. The relationship between the child's ultimate
health and

these factors may be termed a demand function for the output

health)° In this demand function a positive association between children's health and family wealth is predicted (assuming that child health

is a normal good). Similarly, a positive association is expected between
both parents' education and children's endowed health status and children's

ultimate health status.1' Negative associations would be anticipated between all of the prices of health inputs and children's health, and between

family size and children's health. Parents' wage rates may have negative
or positive effects on children's health levels, depending on whether the
household production of children's health is more or less time intensive
than

the production of other aspects

of child quality and/or other types of

parents' consumption conmodities. Finally, to the extent that there is
substitutability between the various aspects of child quality, the prices
of inputs into the non—health aspects of child quality (say, music lessons)

might be positively associated with children's health.12
These predictions concerning the effects of various family characteristics and market prices do not necessarily apply when some realistic twists

are incorporated into the model. An

of

important instance is the introduction

joint production between various aspects of child quality and/or between

child quality and other consumption commodities. Such joint production can
make both wealth effects and input price effects ambiguous. To take a
simple example, both athletic develor*nent and health may be

regarded as

—9—

aspects of children's quality. If athletic development has a high income

elasticity and also has

some

negative health effects, a negative relation-

ship between income or wealth and certain health measures may be observed.

Indeed, the incidence of broken bones is greater in high income families

than it is in l income families [NCHS (11), Table 141. Alternatively,

suppose that parents' time in child care yields direct utility rather than

generating utility only through its effect on children's quality. In this
case, parents may appear to choose inefficient modes of producing child

quality,

modes that use "too

much" time relative to its cost.

The basic model outlined above is also modified when one takes ac-

count of the fact that the human capital dimensions of child quality are
by necessity embodied in the child. Because of this embodiment, for some
types of human

Recent

models of intergenerational transfers utilize this embodiment

insight in a somewhat different way. In these models investments in children' s human capital are assumed to be subject to decreasing returns in

terms of the future earnings of the child. This assumption, along with

What is striking about this review of the economic models is that although they differ in many respects, they all designate the same set of factors as determinants of children's health—-parents' wealth, wage rates, and

education, family size, other input prices, etc. In addition, they provide
ready structures within which to interpret empirical findings. Thus, the
greater incidence of broken bones among children from high income families
is seen not as an anomalous finding but rather as a result of conflicting

family objectives concerning various aspects of child quality. Or, a finding that for high income families increases in wealth are not associated
with increased children's health is not viewed as evidence that wealthy
parents do not care about their children but rather as a result of the fact
that wealthy parents have already made the optimal health investment for

this type of definition, an

over some time period would be the pro-

portion of potential time that is actually available for the usual consumption, maintenance, and work activities. Similarly, the complementary measure

of ill health would be the proportion of potential available time lost due

to inability to function or to imperfect functioning. While such disability
may seem to be relatively easy to measure when dealing with adults who are
members of the labor force (a good approximation is days lost from work be-

cause of illness), it is

even a measure of days lost from work might not capture losses in consump-

This is because there is a natural sequence of childhood

functioning.

A useful distinction to make here is between "permanent" health, which is
what we mean by health capital, and "transitory" health, those short-run
deviations from one's normal state of health caused by the acute conditions

of childhood.17 It is the child's "permanent" health status that we wish
to study, and we attempt to use those health measures which will be good
predictors of that "permanent" health status.18
In some situations a single overall index of "permanent" health might
be desired——to describe parsimoniously the health status of a population,
or to allocate public funds.

Health,

however, clearly is a multidimensional

concept. Analysis of a set of components rather than a single index allows
us to detect differences in the effects of family background variables on

the various dimensions of health. Such analysis also avoids an essentially
arbitrary weighting of the various dimensions of health implied by a health
index.

19

The actual choice of components of children's health status to be examined is controlled by the Cycle II data set and guided by the child health

literature, 20 as

well as by discussions with public health pediatricians.

The measures are listed and described below.

Meaauramnt of !xplanatory Variables

The theoretical variables needed for investigating children's health
were listed earlier: family wealth, parent.' wage rates,• parents' educational attainment (or other measures of their efficiency in household

production), the child health endowment, the costs and availability of
medical care and other market health inputs, the prices of other inputs

used to produce child quality, the prices of other forms of parents' conausption, and family size.
Not surprisingly, the actual measures available in the Cycle 11 survey
correspond only roughly to the above theoretical variables. We discuss

these measures and indicate how they relate to the theoretical variables

below. A complete list of the measures, their precise definitions, and
their sample means and standard deviations appear in Table Ill.

Family wealth and the father's wage rate are both represented by the
family income measure. Two income variables are used (FINC, 'INC) in

order to allow for the possibility that the relationship between family
wealth and children's health differs for high and low income families.27

The mother's wage rate is not directly available in the survey. We

her educational attainment (MEDUCAT) and two measures of her current work
status (MWOIdPT, NWORXPT) •

Mor. educated women are more likely to have

higher opportunity costs, as are women who are currently in the labor force.
As efficiency (or taste) measures we use mother's and father's educational attainment (NEDUCAT, PEDUCAT) and a dusmy variable identifying

mothers

—

who were under 20 years-old at the time of the child's birth (LMAG).

Young mothers are notoriously less efficient at contracepting and may be
similarly

less efficient in producing healthy children. A supplementary

efficiency (or taste) measure is a variable indicating whether a foreign
language is spoken in the home (FLANG). Foreign born families are likely to

exhibit differences in tastes and/or household production efficiency.

The child's endowed health status is represented by a set of variables
relating to his early health. They are dummy variables identifying children
of low birth weight (LIGHT1, LIGRT2), children with congenital abnormalities
(CABN), the child's sex (MALE), and children whose mothers were over 35 years-

old at the time of the child's birth (HMAG). Low birth weight is a typical
indicator of a less healthy birth outcome • 28 The rationale for including a

variable identifying older mothers is that older mothers are more likely to

bear children with health defects. The child's sex is included because of
the well documented higher incidence rates of certain health probl among
males at young ages [for example, NCHS (11)1.

In addition to these health endowment measures, we also control for

several characteristics of the child which are not necessarily health re—
lated but may cause him to receive better or worse treatwent within the
family
They

in possessing these

characteristics.

are his birth-order (FIRST), whether or not he is a twin (TWIN),

as

well as his sex (MALE). First born children (or non-twins) will have

greater access to individual parental attention because they arrived in

the family first (or they arrived alone). Similarly, male children may
receive larger investments than female children if males are preferred
(see

Ben

Porath

and

Welch (16)).

Direct information about the prices of inputs in the health production

it is not possible to esti-

differences that are not otherwise accounted for.) In addition, information
about

the

child visited a dentist (DENT12 and DENTIST3)

is

used to provide a somewhat nre specific index of the price and availability
of medical care. The latter variables not only

proxy the

of medical care in the area but also the

price and avail-

family's preferences and

attitudes concerning preventive care.3°

Finally,

family size is represented by the nsnber of people in the

family who are under 20 years of age at the time of the Cycle II interview
(LESS2O).

LESS2O may therefore overstate or understate actual completed

family size.

In

are

surveying these variables, it

is imeediately obvious that some of

exogenous measures called for by the theory but rather

are proxies that are

in

part endogenously determined. That is, some of

these variables not only represent exogenous prices
themselves outcomes of
labor

she

or endowments

but are

the family's decision making. For example, mother's

force status represents her wage rate as well as the amount of

time

chooses to spend with her children. Similarly, some of the health

endowment measures—birth weight, mother's age at the time of the child's
birth, and whether or not congenital abnormalities are present—reflect
not only genetic endowments but also family choices regarding prenatal

— 23

—

and the timing of childbearing, both of which condition the birth out-

care

The same

come •

observation can be made about the measures used to proxy

the price and availability of medical care (DENT12 and DENTIST3). They

represent both exogenous prices and endogenous health inputs.
One other explanatory variable is endogenous—family size—but for a

different reason. Family size is endogenous not because it is an imperfect
proxy for a truly exogenous variable, but because in the theoretical model
both family

size and children's health are simultaneously

The endogeneity of family size as well as

estimates

appropriate simultaneous estimation techniques are used. Such tech-

niques cannot be used in this case, however, because appropriate data are
not

available, and

even if they were, the coefficients are not always

identifiable.32 As an alternative procedure, we estimate the children's
health equations two ways, both with and without the set of endogenous vari-

ables included. When they are excluded, the coefficients of the various
exogenous
with

family characteristics will reflect their gross

to what extent the exogenous family characteristics operate through

these endogenous measures.

To recapitulate, the equations we estimate have the health variables

listed in Table 11 as dependent variables and the variables listed in Table
III as explanatory variables. These equations are not pure reduced-form
demand equations for children's health for two reasons • First, the inclu-

sion of family size, an endogenous variable from the structural demand
equation, makes the estimating equation a hybrid of a reduced form and

structural demand equation. Second, measures of some of the relevant

— 24

—

theoretical variables are unavailable and the proxy measures used also repre-

sent endogenous input quantities. The final estimating equation reported on
here, then, is a mixture of a structural demand equation, a reduced form

demand equation, and a production function. Interpretation of our results

will allow for the hybrid nature of these equations.

IV. npirical Results
The equations described in the previous section are estimated using data
for white children who live with either both

of

their parents

or

with their

mothers only. There were 5,768 such children in the Cycle II sample. The
exclusion of children for whom

there

were missing data brings the final

sample to 4,l96. Data for both types of family composition are pooled
for analysis because preliminary estimates indicated that there were no

significant differences in the sets of slope coefficients for all dependent

variables

except SCHABS. A dunmty variable identifying children who live

with their mothers only (NOFATH) is included to allow for differences in

children's health that may
father. We do not use

be uniquely associated with the absence of a

data

for black children in estimating the equations

because preliminary analysis revealed significant race differences in slope

coefficients for about half of our health measures. In addition, since the
black sample is too small to allow for reliable coefficient estimates,
separate estimates for black children are

not presented.

I

— 25

The

—

method of estimation is ordinary least squares. Although this is

not the optimal econometric procedure to use when the dependent variable is
35
dichotomous, use of LOG!?
or another appropriate nonlinear estimation

procedure is not feasible given the sample size and number of variables in

our empirical work. To determine whether this aisspecification is likely
to greatly affect our results, we experimented with alternative estimation

procedures on a subsample of one-third of our basic sple. Using a dependent variables with a low incidence and one with an incidence near •5,
we obtained both OLS and LOG!? estimates of our equations for this sub-

sample. In both cases the differences between alternate estimators are
small: OLS coefficients and the analogous marginal effects in LOG!? are of

similar magnitudes and signs, and the patterns of statistical significance
do not alter. Indeed, the differences between these OLS and LOG!? estimates for the one—third subsample are much less than are the differences
between OLS estimates for the full sample and for the one-third subsample.

On the basis of these experiments we believe that OLS estimation applied to

the full. 5aspi. provides the more accurate picture of the relationship between measures of health and the various explanatory variables •

Of

course,

the usual statistical tests on a single coefficient or on sets of coefficients can only be interpreted as suggestive when the dependent variable is
dichotomous because the assumptions underlying these tests are not satisfied.
We organize our discussion of the results around groups of explanatory
variables • Therefore, rather than presenting estimates of the equations in

a single massive table, we have chosen to partition the results into several
tables, each showing the coefficients of a subset of explanatory variables.

— 26

It

-

should be emphasized, however, that the coefficients in each of these

tables are taken from multiple regression estimates that contain either the
complete set of explanatory variables in Table III or that subset we have
classified as exogenous.
A. Overview

The obvious first question to ask is are these health measures amenable

to statistical explanation with the set of variables considered here? To
answer this question we present adjusted R2 's and "F" statistics for the
health equations both with and without the set of endogenous explanatory
variables (Table IV) • In all cases except for hearing acuity and excessive

school absence the equations are statistically significant at the 1 percent
level of significance in one or both formulations. Further, only for the
hearing variable are none of the individual explanatory variables ever

statistically significant. Thus, we can conclude that for scst of the
health measures we study, observed variations in our sample are not caused

solely by chance but rather are systematically related to the set of family,
endowment, and region and city size characteristics considered here.
B. Exogenous Family Characteristics

Since the prime focus of this paper is the relationship between fam-

ily characteristics and children's health, we begin by looking at the
measures of exogenous family characteristics——income, parents' education,

whether or not a father lives with
eign language
appear

the

family, and whether or not a for-

is spoken in the home. The coefficients of these variables

in Table V (the

bles (in Table VI) that another characteristic of families-—their
location-—accounts for larger differences in children's health than do

those characteristics discussed above. Significant regional differences
exist for the variables PFGHEALTH, AEVIS, ALLEG, AC1IBN, APERI, IHEIGHT,

and IWEIGHT); and significant city size differences exist for PFHEALTH,
AEVIS, HDBP, ALLEG, TENS, IWEIGHT, and

APERI. Regional and city size

differences in children's health are not, however, uniform; there is no

for TENS), though FIRST remains statistically significant. Thus, the
impact on child health of being a first born operates in part via
such endogenous variables as family size, mother's work status, and dentist
visits.

— 36

These

—

reported health differences between first borne and others are

consistent with the notion that first born children receive relatively
more time and attention from their parents than other children: their
rate of physical development is more rapid (despite the fact that they

tend to have a lower weight at birth), but at the same time they exhibit a
greater incidence of allergies and

problems. The latter is a likely

these exogenous child characteristics, in particular with being a first
born child, although these differences are not uniform across the various
measures of health.
E. Endogenous Child Health Endowments

The coefficients of the five endogenous measures of the child's health
endowment appear in Table VII. Three of these measures reflect differences
in the birth outcome (LIGHT1, LIGHT2, CABN), and the remaining two indicate

the mother's age at the time of the child's birth (IMAG, HMAG). One or more

The results for the mother's age variables are less uniform. Children
of young mothers are significantly healthier when health is measured by

PFGHEALTH and significantly less healthy for height, weight, and the pendontal index. Conversely, children of older mothers are significantly less
healthy according to the results for PFGHEALTH and HDBP and more healthy for

height and weight. These observed relationships between mother's age and
children's health reflect two forces that go in opposite directions. Relatively young mothers are probably in better physical health when they give

birth, but they are more likely to have unwanted births and consequently
receive poorer prenatal care and spend less time with their children.

Births at relatively old ages pose health risks both to mothers and children, but older mothers might be more efficient in caring for their
children.

As mentioned earlier, all five of these variables are endogenous in

re-

F. Family Size

size has significant health effects only for height, weight, and

the incidence of allergies (see Table VI). Children from larger families

smaller probability of having allergies. Whether these relationships reflect
quality—quantity substitution on the part of the parents or some alternative mechanism (such as the effects of an exogenous constraint on the amount

of parents' time available to each child) cannot be determined.
G•

Mother' a Work Status

The two mother's work status variables (MWORICPT, *JORKPT) are

not sig-

nificantly related to most of the health measures (see Table VIII).39 When
an "F" test on the pair of variable coefficients is conducted, they have
significant effects only for IHEIGHT and APERI (we do not show these tests).

In both cases, children of working mothers have poorer health than do other

children. The coefficients of the individual work status variables indicate
that working full—time has a greater impact on the periodontal index, while

working part-time has a greater impact on height. In general these results
reveal that participation by mothers in the labor market is detrimental to
the

health of their children only with respect to two of the measures which

re-

flect the child's nutritional status. This finding is especially plausible
in that working mothers are clearly less able to supervise their children's
diets.

children

who last

dentist more than

have never seen a dentist (DENTIST3) appear in Table VIII. These two

variables serve as negative proxies of the amount of preventive medical care

and positive proxies of the price of preventive care: parents of children
who have seen a dentist within the past year are more likely to obtain pre-

ventive medical care services for their children and to face a lower price

onstrate how large a portion of the apparent (or gross) income differences

would be attributed to associated family characteristics, in Table IX we
provide illustrative calculations for the measures PFGHEALTH, IEZIGHT,
IWEIGHT, ALLEG, and APERI •

These are the only health measures for which

statistically significant gross income differences are observed in our sam-

ple. The third column of

Table

measures between children in families with annual income under $5,000 and
those

in

families with annual income of $5,000 or more. A $5,000 family in-

The

"net" income effects are less than one—half (and in some cases, one—

quarter) of the observed gross income differences for these five health measures. The difference between net and gross income effects becomes even

larger when the set of endogenous variables is also held constant [column

(5)]. The conclusion to be drawn is clear: gross income differences in
health greatly overstate the true relationship between family income and
health.

If the reported gross income differences are not primarily a result of
differences in income, what does account for them? To answer this question
we calculate how much of the gross high-low income differences in the above

five health variables can be attributed to specific explanatory variables

or sets of these variables. The procedure is simply to multiply the coefficients of these explanatory variables by the differences in their mean
values in the high and low family income samples of children. The resulting

Stry and Implications

In this study aultivariat. techniques have been employed to

ne the

determinants of eleven components of health in a national sampl. of white chil-

dren between the ages of six and eleven. The most important empirical re-

sults and their policy implications are highlighted below.
Th. partial effects of family income on health are small and seldom

statistically significant. Indeed, some health problems—-high blood pressure, allergies, and tension——are more likely to occur among children from

high income families. This phenomenon can be viewed as the early forerunner of, the positive relationship between income and morbidity and mortal-

ity rates observed for adults in the United States (for example, Auster, et
al. (41) and Grossman (25) and (42)]. The general finding of small partial
income effects is supported by analysis of gross health differences between
children from lower (under $5,000 per annus) and higher ($5,000 per annus and

over) income families. In those cases where significant gross health differences do exist between children from these two income classes, decomposition

of these gross differences shows them to be attributable in large part to
exogenous factors other than income itself.
In contrast to family income • parents' schooling i. an important deter-

minant of children's health. In most instances children of well educated

parents are in better health than those of less well educated parents. In
fact, for four of the five health measures that have a significant gross
correlation with income, much of this observed income difference is accounted

for by associated differences in parents' schooling. This would suggest that

policies to raise parents' schooling would not only benefit their children's
health, but would also reduce differences in health between children from
low and high income families.

to rather complete pre-

with income. Again, our results indicate that there is not much to offset,
even though pediatric care utilization is very sensitive to family income

[Colic and Grossman (45)]. At the same time, however, our findings regarding the important role of the dental care variables suggest that policies
directed at either improving the availability of medical care or altering
public attitudes towards preventive care could have large health payoffs
for children in all types of families.

Other favorable implications of our findings relate to three recent

striking trends in the demography of U.S. families. These trends are the
increase in the proportion of families headed by women, the increase in
the labor force participation rate of married women with children, and the

reduction in family size. We find that the absence of a father in the house—

hold has littl. impact on children's health. Therefore, while the recent
rise in the divorce rate might affect certain dimensions of children's wellbeing, health does not appear to be one of them. The same ccmaent applies

to the increase in labor force participation rates of married women with the
exception that with respect to our two best measures of long-run nutritional
status—-height and the periodontal index——children rate more poorly if the

mother works. Since, however, height is negatively related to family size,

the detrimental impacts of increases in labor force participation rates are
offset to some extent by the beneficial impacts of reductions in family size.

Clearly, more research on the exact role of parents' schooling

is needed.

The diverse findings in this paper underscore the multidimensional na-

ture of children's health. In fact, our results illustrate how the use of
a single index could be misleading since the various family characteristic,

can have positive impacts on some components of good health and

negative

on others. For example, an important distinction is found between

health measures (height, the periodontal index) as compared to measures of

the "new morbidity" (the presence of allergies and

tension).

These two

characteristics have positive impacts on the traditional measures but

negative impacts on measures of the new morbidity. One can speculate that

the likely upward trend in the new morbidity will lead to more utilization
of physicians' services for problems that are in many cases not amenable to
treatment by physicians, suggesting that some modification in the training

received by pediatricians and in the delivery of pediatric care services
would be desirable.

Finally, although we do not

altogether

resist speculating about the

implications of our empirical findings, we fully understand that this

paper falls squarely within the sphere of traditional epidemiological research. We document the statistical relationships between family charac—

teristics and measures of children's health in detail, but even though we

outline the
exact

possible role of economic factors, we cannot determine the

nature of the mechanisms that generate these relationships. Nor was

it possible to establish the causal nature of these relationships in a
definitive sense •

23Ce might argue that corrected rather than uncorrected vision is the

not the child wears glasses is available, but it is not clear that the

glasses he wears actually correct his vision defect. Kessner (9), for example, finds that 40 percent of children in a low income sample who were

241n defining ACABN, we exclude abnormalities resulting from accidents
or injuries because these are likely to reflect transitory rather than permanent health variations.

25The periodontal index suffers from the defect that it is subject to
intra-rater and

inter-rater variability.

We have experimented with a some-

what sore objective measure of oral health, the number of decayed permanent
and primary teeth adjusted for age and

sex,

have

obtained results similar

to those for the peridontal index. Compared to the number of decayed teeth,
the periodontal index reflects more serious oral. health problems.

26There is no school form for approximately 500 children in the Cycle II

data set. Since excessive absence due to illness is the only variable taken
from the school form, children without the school form are eliminated from
the empirical analysis

school absence is the dependent variable.

27A $7,000 cutoff point is used because it is most consistent with
available evidence on the distribution of inheritances across families.
See Edwards and

Grossman (17) for an elaboration of this point. Note that

the family income measure is an imperfect measure of long—run income and has

an endogenous component because

income measure that

held these two factors constant. The adjusted income

variable was very highly correlated with FINC (the corrlation coefficient
was greater than .99) and the regression results were not altered when adjusted income was used in place of FINC. Consequently, we report results

based on the use of FINC in this paper.
28See, for example, Birch and Guesow (28). Cycle II does not distin-

guish children who are born prematurely, so we cannot determine to what

extent low birth weight is a result of prematurity or of other factors.

will enable us to examine the effects of medical care prices on health
outputs.

also available in the data, but would be greatly contaminated by the child's

and medical care.

For example, women who plan to have large families will be less

likely to make large investments in their own education. Or, families for
whom children'. health is an important component of child quality may choose

in our results. One reason might be the high correlation between mother's
and father's education (r — .67 in mother—father families).

38These estimates "ir4mize" the effect of not having a father in the

sense that they are derived under the extreme assition that father's education has the same relationship with child health whether or not the
father is actually present (and that the average educational attainment of

absent fathers is the same as for fathers living with their families).
These assumptions are needed to obtain estimates of the relationship between NOFATH and the various health measures because there is no informa-

tion in our data on the educational attainment of fathers who do not

currently live with their children. Use of the alternative extreme assump-

tion, that there is no relationship between father's education and child
health for children whose fathers are absent from the home, generates

"minimum" estimates of the effect of having an absent father. These "minimum" estimates also indicate that NOFATH has both positive and negative re-

lationships with better health, depending on the health measure used:
significant positive health relationships with NOFATH are reported for
PFGHEALTH, HDBP, and APERI and a significant negative relationship is reported for SCHABS.
39This

lack of significance is especially notable because the endoge-

nous nature of the mother' s work status variables biases their coefficients
towards having a larger negative relationship with child health than they
would have simply as measures of the mother's opportunity cost of time.
