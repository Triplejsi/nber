rtract—The growth in single-person households is a pervasive behavioral phenomenon in the United States in the post-war period. In this paper we investigate determinants of the propensity to live alone, using 1970 data across
states for single men and women ages 25 to 34 and for elderly widows. Income level appears to be a major determinant of the propensity to live alone.

The estimated cross-state equations track about three-quarters of the increase in the propensity to live alone between 1950—1976 and suggest that m-

come growth has been the principal identified influence. Other variables
found to affect (jxsitively) the propensity to live alone include mobility,
schooling level, and for young people a measure of social climate; nonwhites appear to have a somewhat lower propensity to live alone.

have found a positive relationship between income and measures similar to

1940 the "increase in headship rates of the

in their incomes" (p. 36). Likewise, Brady

there is another body of literature which
indicates that income is positively related
to the propensity to marry (see Becker,
1974; Cutright, 1970; Keeley, 1974; and
[weakly] Preston and Richards, 1975) and
for men to remain married (see Ross and
Sawhill, 1975; and Becker, Landes, and
Michael, 1977). Reconciliation of these
opposing influences of income on living
arrangements would appear to deserve a
high priority in subsequent research.

This paper estimates the magnitude

and causes of the growth in single-person
households, but the repercussions of this

growth have not been considered. The
impact of growth in single-person households on health levels, on the demand for
housing and various social services, and
for broader aspects of life-cycle consumption and savings behavior deserves study.
In addition to the growth in single-person households there is also evidence of a

stant, an increase in the percentage nonwhite reflects
an increase in the state's variance in income. If the
influence of income on the propensity to live alone
is nonlinear, as suggested in subsequent regressions,
then an increase in the state's dispersion in income
can affect the average propensity to live alone. (Us-

ing a measure of the dispersion in income within
each state, SD(lnY), the standard deviation of log
income, we regressed SD(hiY) on INCOME and
RACE and found a positive coefficient on RACE
with a t-statistic + 1.86. Using another measure of
per capita income, RACE's effect was stronger (1 =
+3.52). (The dependent variables for these weighted
regressions across states were taken from pp. 180—
182, Chiswick, 1974.) When SD(InY) is added to regression Y3, it has no effect on other coefficients and
a I < 1.0, however.)
