CALCULATING THE PRESENT VALUE OF AN ASSET'S

UNCERTAIN FUTURE CASH FLOWS
Stephen D. Nadauld

Abstract

This paper describes both the theory and a computer program
designed to calculate the present value of an asset's uncertain future

cash flows. In this model expected flows may vary in each of "t" future
periods. Flows are adjusted to a certainty equivalent by a correction
factor derived from a covariance matrix of the flows and market returns.

The flows are discounted by a full specification of the term structure

of the risk—free Interest rate. The specific model illustrated In the
paper is that of expected cash flows from a mortgage portfolio.

The computer program calculates the expected cash flow, the
uncertainty correction, and the term structure of Interest rates.
Algorithms to solve for each of these factors are included.

Alternatively,

options are included to input the factors frm exogenous forecasts or
projections. In addition to calculating the present values under each
specification for the factors, the program compares the present values
derived from each particular specification.

I NTRODUCT ION

This paper explains the application of a multiperiod uncertainty

model whose theory has been discussed in previous articles. The model
makes it possible to calculate the present value of uncertain future

cash flows generated by any asset. The approach may be applied to a
wide variety of asset classes. However, the paper uses as an example an
actual computer program designed to calculate the present value of a
mortgage portfolio and comments on how such a program could be modified
and applied to other types of assets.
For the purpose of illustration, the approach is applied to mortgage portfolio data obtained from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for
18 savings and loan associations in the San Francisco SMSA.
The usefulness of this approach to multiperiod valuation under un-

certainty stems from its similarity to the comon certainty formulation,
which may be written as:

The equation (1) approach of discounting certain future cash flows by a
rate which is the same for each period in the future should be familiar
to the reader.

A similar simple closed fonii equation for discounting uncertain
future cash flows is as follows:

level of proportional risk aversion which will be assumed
equal to one.

Since the theoretical development behind this model has been discussed in previous papers, attention in this paper will be focused on
application of equation (2).

In order to understand the application, it is important to note

both the similarities and the differences of equations (1) and (2). The
two formulations are similar in that both have cash inflows in the
numerator, and both discount the cash flows for time value in the deno-

minator. However, there are three important differences in the two
equations. First, equation (2) uses expected cash inflows in the numerator (E(Xt)) instead of the single point certainty cash flows of equa-

tion (1). Second, equation (2) has a term in the numerator which

2

adjusts the expected cash flows for uncertainty. While this tern appears complex, it may be thought of as simply a dollar amount which,

when subtracted from the expected cash flows, supplies a certainty

equivalent in place of the expected value. Third, the denominator in
equation (2) employs a full specification of the tern structure in place
of the single level rate assumption of equation (1).
As suggested by the differences between equations (1) and (2),
equation (2) is the conceptual basis for a much richer approach to the

valuation of financial instruments. In addition to the obvious allowance for uncertainty, equation (2) allows for the cash flow in each
period to be discounted by the risk free discount factor appropriate to
that period and thus uses all the information available in the tern

structure. Also, the approach is extremely useful in dealing with the
question of interest sensitivity since equation (2) makes a provision
for specifying differences in the response of short and long rates and
allows computation of the resulting impact on valuation.

Because the approach affords important insights into the impact of
interest rate changes on valuation, it is important at the outset to
specify how interest rate changes must be incorporated in the analysis.

Interest rate changes have three separate effects. First, they may effect the expected future cash flows. In the mortgage application, for
example, the impact of rate changes on future prepayments and defaults

may alter considerably the expected cash flows. Second, a change in
interest rates obviously changes the discount factors in the denomina-

tor. Third, and potentially the most troublesome, is the impact of
interest rate change on the risk premium. The risk premium may be
effected a) because of changes in aggregate risk tolerance, or b)

3

through changes in the systematic riskiness of the asset that reflects a
change in the joint distribution of asset cash flows and market returns.
To obtain maximum usefulness from the model, specific equations linking
each of these three areas to interest rate change need to be incorporated into the analysis.

The process of applying equation (2) consists of four steps for any
type of asset:

1.

Determination of the expected cash flows for the asset.

This may be easy or more difficult depending on the nature of

the instrument and the distribution of the cash flows. Mortgages,
for example, require specification of future contract payments,
future prepayments, and some estimate of defaults.

In addition,

time series or cross sectional data is necessary to give some insight into the distribution.

2. Specification of the risk free term structure.
There are several ways to determine the necessary term struc-

tures: a) present or past term structures may be calculated from
risk free government securities, b) future term structures may be
obtained from i) macro models such as the Penn-MIT model, ii)
systematic adjustments of forward rates obtained from present term
structures, iii) arbitrary specifications.

3. Calculation of the uncertainty adjustment term.
In order to calculate the uncertainty term, it is necessary to
make assumptions which allow the computations to be done in the
form

The correlation, standard deviations and expectation must be calculated from time series or cross sectional data obtained for asset
cash flows and market returns.

4.

Computation of the present value.

The respective elements of equation (2) are combined by the
computer program into the calculated present value.

The remainder of the paper will be divided into two sections. Section I will explain the basic calculations in steps one through four and
apply them to the question of valuing a mortgage portfolio, and Section
II will demonstrate the computer program operations and give sample inputs and outputs.

SECTION I

STEP 1: Determining the Expected Cash Flows
The cash flows from a mortgage portfolio are made up of regular
mortgage payments (including principal plus interest) and of mortgage

prepayments. For the typical mortgage, the contract rate and maturity
are fixed at the time of origination. The combination of rate and
maturity specify a. fixed payment cash inflow that the mortgage promises
5

to generate at each point in the future. The payment is made up of
principal plus interest and follows a prescribed amortization schedule

depending on the rate and maturity. Because in the typical situation
the promised individual mortgage payments are fixed, the promised port-

folio cash inflow is fixed. Therefore, in general the value of the
portfolio varies inversely with fluctuating market rates.

The difficulty that financial institutions have with fixed rate instruments is a well-known problem, and a recent attempt has been made by
some mortgage-granting institutions to solve the problem by issuing

variable rate mortgages. A variable rate mortgage allows the institution to raise (or lower) the mortgage contract rate according to the
rise or fall of an index of appropriately constructed market rates.

This kind of mortgage has some advantages to the institution, especially

in times of rising interest rates. Variable rate mortgages have become
popular with selected institutions and are being increasingly issued,

especially by California institutions. However, the trend toward variable rate mortgages is relatively recent. Since the data gathered for
this application are from portfolios formed in 1975 or before, they are
made up almost wholly of fixed rate mortgages; and, for this reason, the
analysis in the paper will concentrate on their behavior.

There are two factors that substantially complicate the cash in-

flows that are generated by a mortgage portfolio. The first of these is
the

prepayment option. Although the contract payments are spoken of as

fixed, the mortgagee has the option to prepay part or
pal in.

all

of the princi-

conjunction with the refinancing or sale of the mortgaged pro-

perty. Because of the mobility of many home owners, the option to
prepay is often exercised, and the resulting prepayment cash flows are a

6

substantial factor in analyzing the total cash flows from

the

mortgage

portfolio. The second factor concerns mortgage defaults. The payments
spoken of as fixed are only fixed in the sense that they are promises to

pay. In the case of default, these promised payments are not realized
by the mortgage granting institution.

Fixed Payments

The basic element of mortgage portfolio cash flows is derived from
the fixed mortgage payment. The standard parameters of the fixed pay-

ment, self-amortizing mortgage, are straight forward. The regular
monthly payment is determined as a function of the principle amount,
contract rate, and term to maturity and may be computed by applying the
following simple payment algorithm:
Principle

payment=l -

where:

t =

rate on monthly basis.

These fixed payment amounts must be adjusted in each period to take into

effect foreclosures or prepayments which occurred in prior periods. The
impact of the foreclosure or prepayment is to eliminate loans from the
portfolio and therefore reduce the fixed payment portion of the cash
flow.

P repaents
Since mortgage holders have the option to pay down their mortgage
by amounts in excess of the scheduled amortization, mortgage portfolios

7

have cash flows which may in any period substantially exceed the pre-

scribed fixed payments for the period. It is important to consider
these prepayments, since their timing may greatly impact the value of

the mortgage portfolio. There are several ways to include prepayments
in the analysis. It is possible, for example, to use an arbitrary set
of prepayment data in the form of annual mortgage termination rates.
Termination rates are defined as a fraction of the portfolio balance

that would be paid off in any year. The rates may be stated as a fraction of the original portfolio amount (fixed basis) or as a fraction of

the remaining portfolio amount (current basis). Typical termination
patterns are available from FHA data.

Another more interesting alternative is available for dealing with
prepayments and illustrates the concept of linking cash flows to inter-

est rate changes. The approach is based on a model developed by Curley
and Guttentag (1972). The model explains mortgage termination rates as
a function of policy year, maturity, the relationship between the current mortgage contract rate and original contract rate, and the discount

points charged in the specified year. Their results are contained in a
single equation of the following form:'

1The numerator of the valuation equation requires expected cash
flows. The prepayment cash flows are determined by finding the prepayment function (TR) which is the analog of the Log TRt equation. It is
clear that E(x)
exp[E(ln(x))]; but it can be shown that the difference
is small. One approach is to suppose the generalized function g(x) =

a + bx + cx2 + dx3 + .... Both ln(x) and eX meet this criterion.
Expanding g(x + ) and taking the expectation (E[q(x + c)]) gives
x0 +

E[O(c)2]. In the same fashion, g[E(x)] =

The termination rate in year t (TRt) is defined as a function of
the portfolio balance that will be paid off in that year.

The prepay-

ment equation estimates current basis termination rates, but these may

easily be converted to fixed basis rates if desired. The prepayment
equation was estimated using FRA annual data covering the period 1951-67

for 20-, 25-, and 30-year mortgages. The absolute level of both longand short-term interest rates was generally lower during this period
than during subsequent periods for which the equation may be applied.
However, the variables in the prepayment equation which would be effected, namely the original contract rate and the mortgage rate in year
t, enter the equation in the form of a yield differential.

Since rela-

tive differentials or spreads have approximately the same range in
subsequent periods as in the estimation period, the prepayment equation
should retain its usefulness when applied to more recent data.

9

The prepayment equation makes it possible to calculate prepayments
and add them to the fixed mortgage payments for each period in the fu-

ture. However, because the equation uses projected future mortgage
rates, it is necessary to supply these rates in some fashion. This may
be done arbitrarily or, since other numerator and denominator changes
are driven by changes in short-term rates, it may be done by attempting
to link future mortgage rates to future short-term interest rates.
As an illustration of an attempt to determine the nature of the
relationship between mortgage rates and short-term rates, a monthly
mortgage rate series from December of 1969 through December of 1975 was
analyzed in conjunction with three month treasury bill rates over the

same period. The most notable feature of these two series is the ex-

tremely high level of serial correlation that exists in each. For
example, a regression of the spread between the mortgage rate and the
treasury bill rate against the treasury bill rate yields the following
equation:

bill rate,

D.W. = Durbin Watson statistic,

and the figures in parentheses are standard errors. The
resulting t-statistics are significant at the 99% level.
The Durbin Watson statistic of 0.1398 shows the high level of serial

correlation in the residuals. This could be anticipated since the mechanism described by several practitioners for mortgage rate determination

10

Is to set the current period mortgage rate equal to the previous period's rate and adjust slightly upward or downward, depending on short-

term rate movements. The autocorrelation is strong enough to require
second-order autocorrelation correction, which yields the following
results:

MRT - TBRT

(0.087)

n = 73

The resulting t-statistics are again significant at the 99% level.
However, there is a difficulty involved in using the above equation to

predict future mortgage rates in the current setting. The prepayment
algorithm requires a pattern of future mortgage rates over a thirty-year

period in order to computea thirty-year pattern of prepayments and the
resulting pattern of cash flows. When the equation is used to predict
beyond five to ten periods, the predicted mortgage rates diverge rapidly
from the average relationship that has existed in the past between mortgage rates and short-term treasury bill rates.

This average spread was

computed for 1961 through 1975 and was found to be approximately 210

basis points. Using the 210 basis point average spread to predict
future mortgage rates was found to produce more reasonable prepayment
patterns than those developed from the autocorrelation corrected
equation.

ii

Defaults

While it is possible to relate the question of prepayments and interest rate changes in a fashion sympathetic to the overall approach,

the problem of defaults is not so easily handled. The numerator related
concern is essentially a question of how the expected value of cash

flows are effected by defaults. Since it is reasonable to assume that
short-term interest rates either directly or as a proxy may have some
influence on default, it should be possible in principle to link rate

changes through defaults to the expected cash flows. However, because
default data were not available for the portfolios in the data sample,
it was not possible to examine the linkage between rate changes and

defaults. Nevertheless, the computer program written to do the calculation allows for the possibility of arbitrarily varying the default rates

by year for each association. For example, the first year foreclosure
rate could be determined as 2 percent, meaning that 2 percent of the
book value of the portfolio would be eliminated for all subsequent

periods. However, the program allows the user to specify an average
percentage of the foreclosed amount to be recovered, and the recovered
amount is added to the normal payment and prepayment cash flows for the

period. The foreclosed mortgages are subtracted from the portfolio, and
future cash flows from both regular payments and prepayments are appropriately reduced.

STEP 2: Specification of the Risk Free Term Structure
As suggested previously, there are several ways to obtain the

necessary risk free interest rates that make up the denominator of

equation (2). To examine the question of how changes in rates effect

12

the resulting present values, it is useful to have both present and
projected future term structures that can be used to discount the projected cash flows.

Current estimates of the term structure may be obtained from an estimation of the discount function accomplished by a computer program

developed by J. Houston McCulloch [1975]. The basic concept is to fit a
discount function to the observed prices of U.S. Government treasury ob-

ligations. The program uses as inputs the bid and ask prices of bill,
note and bond quotes for a given date and applies an instrumental
variables technique to fit the discount function to a cubic spline. (A

flexible curve much like a polynominal.) An example of the program's
output is the point yield for January 2, 1976,

which appears in Table 1.

These data are used directly as inputs to the present value calculation.
The calculations are done in continuous time so that the denominator at
any quarter t is DNOMt = EXP(Kt

*

t/4)

where Kt is the point yield for

period t determined as in Table 1.

The current term structure may be used as a basis for obtaining
future term structures through a technique developed by Morrison [1977].
The technique employs a distributed lead to shift the whole term structure as a function of changes in short-term rates.

Note that the impact

of an interest rate change on a term structure with identical rates in
each period, such as in equation (1), is to shift the term structure

uniformly higher or lower. In other words, in such a case the response
of both long- and short-term rates is assumed to be identical. However,
by using the distributed lead, it is possible to capture in some measure
the empirically observed differential response of short— and long-term
rates to short-term rate changes.

Table 1 contains an example of a shifted teni structure which has

structures and employ them as the denominator of equation (2). An
example of such an arbitrary designated tern structure is also shown in

Table 1. Figure 1 shows the shapes of the January 2, 1976, revised and
arbitrary term structures. Each of these three term structures will

subsequently be used to discount mortgage portfolio cash flows. Of
course, the method used for determining the term structure will restrict
what may or may not be said concerning the resulting present values.

In order to calculate a value for the term, it is necessary to make the
following assumptions:

1.

The level of proportional risk aversion (b) is set equal to
one.

2.

The returns on the maket portfolio are serially uncorrelated
and the variance of market returns is constant.

As suggested previously, the risk premium may be effected through
either changes in aggregate risk tolerance or through changes in the

joint distribution of mortage cash flows andmarket returns. Setting
b —

—1

is theoretically justified (see Hakansson [1971], Rubinstein

[1973]), and in this context it essentially means that interest rate
changes are assumed not to effect the risk premium through any impact on
aggregate risk tolerance.

The second effect, namely the impact of interest rate change on the
joint distribution of portfolio cash flows and market returns, can be

seen quite clearly from equation (4). Equation (4) contains terms for
18

the mean and standard deviation of the reciprocal of market returns, the
standard deviation of cash flows, and the correlation between the cash

flows and the reciprocal of market returns. Fortunately, it is possible
to say something about how expected market returns vary with short-tenii
interest rates as will be shown subsequently.

It is also possible that interest rate changes effect the correlation of cash flows with market returns and/or the standard deviation of

cash flows. For example, in the case where investor expectations concerning interest rates impact on the distribution of cash flows through
defaults, both the correlation and the standard deviation of cash flows

would be effected. To measure the effect requires cross sectional data,
including a number of observations of portfolio cash flows at each of

several different interest rates. Because this data is not available,
and since it is still useful to calculate the correlation coefficient,
it is necessary to assume that the correlation is not a function of interest rates, and it can then be calculated from the available time

series observations. For the same reason, the standard deviations of
both the cash flows (STD[Xt]) and the reciprocal of market returns
(Std[----]) are assumed to be invariant with respect to time and interest
mt
rates. It is useful to note that the data used to calculate both the

correlations and standard deviations of cash flows is actual savings and
loan mortgage portfolio data, which includes the impact of defaults, and
therefore the correlations and standard deviation may be thought of as
including average default characteristics.

Thus, under the stated assumptions, interest rate changes do impact
on the risk premium, but only through an effect on the expected market

return. It is difficult to estimate the size or nature of the bias that

19

may be introduced by the above assumptions. When risk prémia are stated
in terms of yield differentials, the suspicion is that they exhibit

sizable changes. For example, the yield spread between long-term government bonds and mortgage rates ranged from 145 to 375 basis points

over the time period of study. However, it is important to note that a
"yield" calculation assumes that interest rates are level through time
and that contract rates or coupon rates represent certain cash flows.
Therefore, any adjustments in expected cash flows, in the term structure
or in strict risk premium changes, are thrown together into the reported

"yield". Since the above analysis does incorporate interest rate
changes into the term structure, the expected cash flows and the risk
premium, it is difficult to estimate how much of the difference in
observed yield spreads may be unaccounted for.

To incorporate the uncertainty adjustment term in the analysis,
values for each of the four terms of equation (4) must be estimated.
Consider first the term E(rmt) which is the expected one plus return on

the market portfolio. In this application the return is assumed to be a
function of the level of risk-free interest rates. Since the uncertainty adjustment is done on a quarterly basis the appropriate relationship is between the quarterly return on the market and the three-month

One way of obtaining a series of future three month spot rates needed as
the independent variable is to obtain from the term structure the li-

quidity adjusted three month forward rates. (Assuming that the liquidity adjusted three month forward rates are unbiased projection of

from the term structure by using the relationship

Before the calculated forward rate (rt) can be used as a spot rate
projection, it must be adjusted by subtracting off a liquidity premium
the three-month liquidity premia estimated by McCulloch [1975] are shown
in Table 3.

Calculation of the correlation coefficient, COR(x4—) requires cash
flow data from the mortgage portfolio and a corresponding series of mar-

ket returns. For this application, the data employed were six years of
quarterly cash flows from a savings and loan association mortgage portfolio and market return data for the same period from the CRSP tapes.
Since the mortgage portfolio cash flows were separated into interest and
principle payments, three separate correlation coefficients were calcu-

lated. p1 is the correlation between the interest payments and the
reciprocal of market returns, p2 is the correlation between principle
payments and the reciprocal of market returns and p_ is the correlation
between the combined cash flows and the reciprocal of market returns.
Table 4 shows the results of the calculations for a typical savings association1s mortgage portfolio.

When examining the results, it should be noted that the sign of the

uncertainty adjustment term in equation (4) is positive. This may seem
counter-intuitive, since the usual notion is to subtract from the expected cash flow a term that reflects the undesirability of highly corre-

lated cash flows. However, because the correlation calculated here is
between a cash flow and the reciprocal of the market return, the signs

will be opposite those normally expected. Since the sign of the correlation may be either positive or negative, the sign of the whole adjust-

ment term may be either positive or negative. Thus, the sign of the
correlation coefficient determines whether the mortgage portfolio's
value is increased or decreased when held in a portfolio with other as-

sets. For the above example, the combined cash flows have a positive
correlation with the reciprocal of market returns (meaning the correlation betweem cash flows and regular market returns would be negative)
and, therefore, the value of the mortgages is increased when held in
conjunction with the market portfolio.

To complete the risk adjustment term, it is necessary to calculate
the standard deviation of both the reciprocal of market returns and of

the portfolio cash flows. From the CRSP data, the standard deviation of
the reciprocal of the one-plus market return was computed to be 0.0882

for the sample time period. For the portfolio cash flows, the quarterly
standard deviation was calculated to be 1,708 dollars.

It should be noted that for cash flows that are serially uncorrelated and have a growth rate with a stationary mean, the standard deviation can be computed as:

Std(X) = x0 [(o +

24

2)t]l/2

where

X = cash
+

flow at time t

rate

of growth of cash flows

g =

a =

standard deviation of the growth rate

p = mean of the growth rate

However, the cash flows from a mortgage portfolio do not fit this pat-

tern because they do not grow over time. Since regular payments are
fixed, any variation in the cash flows results from variation in the

prepayment or foreclosure rates. It is generally assumed that as a
portfolio ages, the absolute number of foreclosures and prepayments de-

crease. Consequently, the standard deviation of cash flows ought to
also decrease with time. However, because analysis of how the standard
deviation of cash flows behaves as a function of foreclosure rates, pre-

payments, and time was not possible, the program assumes for this application that the standard deviation is constant over time.

Step 4: Calculation of the Present Value
Calculation of the present value requires that each of the previously described steps be combined in the appropriate relationship

according to equation (2). The computer program developed to do the
calculations performs essentially five operations; four operations are

related to the numerator and one to the denominator. These operations
are discussed relative to the mortgage portfolio application and may

need to be altered slightly for use in other contexts. They are essenially a review of steps one through three.
With respect to the numerator, the program first takes the individual mortgage data for each mortgage in the portfolio and calculates the

future fixed monthly payments. Second, it calculates a series of future

25

mortgage rates based on a specified term structure and uses them in conjunction with the prepayment algorithm to calculate the dollar amount of
prepayinents in each period. The program then applies an arbitrarily

determined set of foreclosure rates to the portfolio. The foreclosure
rates can be varied at will but are not included as a function of any

other endogeneous or exogeneous parameters. At this point, the program
combines the fixed payments, prepayments and foreclosures for each loan

into a specified quarterly cash flow for the entire portfolio. As a
fourth step, the parameters of the uncertainty adjustment term are computed and added to or subtracted from the expected cash flow for each
period.

The denominator calculation consists of taking the series of forward

rates describing the term structure and forming the appropriate

discount factor for each period. The discounted, uncertainty adjusted
cash flows are summed over the total number of periods, and the sum is
the resulting present value.

Tables 5 and 6 show the results of applying the approach to 18 San
Francisco SMSA savings, and loan association portfolios. The results in

Table 5 have been calculated assuming uncertainty, no foreclosures and

the term structure and revision discussed in Step 2. Note that the
portfolio values as of January 2, 1976, exceeded the book values in

every case. This is because the rates represented by the January 2,
1976, term structure were lower than the average mortgage portfolio con-

tract rates. Note also that even when the portfolio cash flows were
valued using the revised downward sloping term structure, the present

values remained above book value. This occurred because the portfolio
cash flows are received over a very long period of time; and, even

though the tenTi structure was shifted upward, the nature of the shift

was such as to leave long term rates relatively unchanged.
Table 6 shows the impact of discounting the expected mortgage cash
flows by the arbitrarily designated term structure described previously.
As seen most clearly from Figure 1, the main difference between the revised and arbitrary term structures is that the arbitrary term structure

exhibits higher long term rates. Discounting by this term structure decreases the mortgage portfolio values by more than 6 percent in every
case.

SECTION II

PROGRAM OPERATION AND SAMPLE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS

This section contains more specific information and description

concerning the computer program discussed previously. The first part of
the section describes the real time program requests and the nature of

the inputs requested. The second part contains a sample of the program
output. A listing of the program and sample input data files are contained in Appendices A and B respectively.

The program is currently set to run on a Dec 10 computer system;
however, only slight modifications of certain control statements would
be required to make it compatible with other similar time shared sys-

tems. The input steps correspond with the previous discussion on projecting cash flows, adjusting for uncertainty, etc. Table 7 contains a
sample of the program statements and inputs and should be referred to in
conjunction with the description of program steps.
After logging in and receiving the prompt character, the user types
RUN FLO, and the computer responds with the first input requested.

Projecting Cash Flows

Items 1-12 allow for the calculatior of cash flows for a savings

and loan mortgage portfolio. These items could be modified to accept
coupon bond data or any other data representing cash flows from financial instruments.

1.

ENTER THE SAVINGS & LOAN DOCKET NO. AND THE NUMBER OF LOANS.

The user must input two numbers separated by a coma. The
first number is simply a number that identifies the run. This
number will appear in the heading of the output. The second
number indicates how many separate loans will be entered for

analysis. After the second number, the user enters a carriage
return which tells the computer to go to the next step.
2.

WHEN DO YOU WANT THE CASH FLOWS TO START PRINTING?
User enters a two digit number (i.e., 76) that specifies the
first year the output will begin to appear.

3.

IS THE LOAN DATA ON DISK?

If the user inputs Y11 meaning yes, the computer responds with
statement 4.

If the user inputs "N", the computer responds

with statement 3A.

3A. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL THE FILE?
The user inputs a file name to which the loan data will be
assigned.

3B. ENTER 1 - THE YEAR LOAN HAD THAT AMOUNT.
2 - THE YEAR LOAN HAD THAT AMOUNT
3 - THE CONTRACT RATE

33

4 - THE NUMBER OF MONTHS LEFT TO MATURITY
5 — THE AGE (IN MONTHS) OF LOAN

see Appendix B and file LOAN.A2 for an example of data input.
4.

WHAT FILE IS IT IN?

The response to this statement must be the name of a data file
in which the loan data has previously been put. Loan data

must include for each loan the four items described in 3B. A
typical file for 6 loans would appear as shown in file LOAN.A2
(Appendix B).
5.

IS THE PREPAYMENT DATA ON "DISK" TO BE "HAND" ENTERED OR TO BE
"CALCULATED"?
The user may respond with "D", "H", or "C".

A "D" response means that the user has previously placed in a
disk file the fraction of mortgages in the specified year that

will be terminated. A typical data file would contain thirty
decimal fractions similar to those that appear on the output
for each loan under "has the following prepayment experience".
An "H" response means the user is prepared to input the decimal fractions at the terminal one at a time separated by
commas.

A "C" response means the user wishes the computer to calculate
the prepayment fractions based on the algorithm described in

the text. The calculated fractions are printed out for each
loan on the output. A "C" response invokes statement 6.
6.

DO YOU WANT IT CALCULATED FROM "ARBITRARY MORTGAGE RATES" OR THE
TERM STRUCTURE DETERMINED MORTGAGE RATES?
The user may respond with an "A" or
means the user wants to specify a set
34

"1". The "A" response
future annual mort-

gage rates which will be used in the prepayment algorithm to

calculate the prepayment fractions. This allows the user to
uncouple the prepayment fractions from the term structure and
have them calculated from arbitrarily determined future mort-

gage rates. After an "A" response, the computer will come
back and ask for the file name in which the future mortgage
rates have been stored.

The "T" response instructs the computer to calculate the forward rates from the term structure and use the forward rates
to calculate the future mortgage rates that are to be used to
determine the prepayment fractions.

7. You NEED X PAST MORTGAGE RATES AND DISCOUNT POINTS, WHAT FILE ARE
THEY IN?
The program has been written so that prepayment fractions
would be applied to loans which were closed in previous years.
In order to calculate the prepayment experience, the computer
uses the prepayment algorithm and requires as inputs the past

mortgage rates and discount points. These need to be placed
in a data file. See file MORT PSI.

8. WHERE ARE THE LIQUIDITY PREMIUMS?
The user responds with the file name. The file may specify
the McCollough liquidity premium or any arbitrarily chosen

set. See file L.DT.
9. WHAT SPREAD DO YOU PROJECT FOR THE MORTGAGE RATE OVER THE TREASURY
BILL RATE? (I.E. 0.021)
The user inputs a decimal fraction. For example, the .021
adds 2.1 percent to an 8.0 percent forward rate to give a 10.1
percent mortgage rate.
35

10. WHERE ARE THE EXPECTED FORECLOSURE RATES FOUND?
The user inputs a file name. See, for example, FORC.RAT.
11. WHAT PERCENT OF FORECLOSURES DO YOU EXPECT TO RECOVER?
The user inputs a number such as 50 (50 percent) or 100 (100
percent), which specifies the percent of the value of foreclosed property that will be realized.

12. HOW MANY MONTHS INTEREST WILL BE CHARGED FOR THE PREPAYMENT PENALTY
(ENTER 100 FOR THE FHLMC METHOD)?
User enters a number like 6 (6 months) or 0 (no months interest penalty).

Specification of the Risk Free Term Structure
Items 13-15 relate to the development of discount factors which
make up the denominator of equation (2).

13. WHERE ARE THE K's FOUND?

User enters a file name. See for example K.DT. The K's are
the quarterly rates (on annual basis) obtained from the
McCollough program that specify the term structure.

14. DO YOU WANT TO ARBITRARILY SHIFT THE TERM STRUCTURE?

User responds with "V" or "N". A "Y" response means the user
does not wish to have the term structure shifted by using the
compulational algorithm but prefers to arbitrarily designate a

new shifted term structure. The computer requests the file
name of the shifted term structure. See for example file
AK.DT.

A "N" response means the user wishes to use the algorithm for
shifting the term structure, and the computer responds with
statement 15.
36

15. ENTER RR, RR-HAT, II, AND IT-HAT
The user enters four decimals separated by commas. RR and II
are respectively the real rate and rate of inflation compo-

nents that make up the nominal short term (3 month) rate. RRHAT and IT-HAT are the real and inflationary rate components
that are projected to make up the short term nominal rate in
the shifted term structure.

The_Uncertaiy_juStmeflt_Term
Items 16 and 17 allow for the computation of the uncertainty adjustment term as previously described.
d

16. DO YOU WISH TO ADJUST FOR UNCERTAINTY?
User enters "V'1 or "N". An "N" response sets the uncertainty

adjustment term to zero. If the user responds in the affirmative, the computer proceeds to statement 17.

17. ENTER 1 - THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CASH FLOWS AND RETURN ON THE
MARKET.

2 - THE MEAN OF (1 + THE GROWTH RATE OF THE CASH FLOWS).
3 - THE STANDARD DEVIATION.

Two separate versions of the uncertainty adjustment term are

available in the program. Both use the correlation coefficient, which is entered as the first input. The first version
for uncertainty adjustment uses the mean arid standard devia-

tion of the 1 + growth rates of cash flows. These data would
be entered, for example, as p

= 1.05,

a =

.06.

The second

version of uncertainty adjustment uses only the standard devi-

ation of the cash flows themselves, in which case the mean is

37

entered as zero and the standard deviation is entered as a
whole number.

calculation of the Present Value
In addition to the present value, which is automatically provided
by the program, it is possible to specify more detailed output such as
described by items 18 and 19.

18. DO YOU WANT THE MONTHLY CASH FLOWS PRINTED OUT?
This option allows the user to obtain cash flow figures by

month for the whole portfolio for interest, principal, principal repayments and total cash flow.

19. DO YOU WANT DETAILED PREPAYMENTS, ETC?
An affirmative response for this option gives the user a detailed print out of cash flows by month for each individual
loan in the portfolio.

38

Sample Outp
An example of the abbreviated program output appears as Table 8.
The more detailed outputs are much longer and, therefore, examples have

not been included. The output firsts lists the assumptions that have
been used in the particular run called for. Since many of the data
files are extensive, only the file names are referred to in the assump.-

tions. The output then details each of the loans in the portfolio and
prints the termination fractions that are assumed for the loan prepay-.

ments. The program then prints a present value and book value based on
the initially specified term structure. The output then presents a
second present value calculation, both of which are based on the revised

or arbitrary term structure as specified. The percentage change in
present value is calculated as the concluding data item.

LISTING OF DATA INPUT FILES

The computer program allows the user to set up input files which

contain data needed for performing the various calculations. The user
simply references the file name at the appropriate place in the program,

and all the data in the file is made available automatically. The following pages contain examples of exact data with the name of each data

file in capital letters preceeding the data. The nature of the data in
each of the files has been discussed previously at the beginning of
Section II.
