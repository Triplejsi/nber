MALE WAGE RATES AND MARITAL STATUS

Lawrence W. Kenny

Abstract

Numerous studies have found that married men earn considerably more than single men of the same education, experience, etc.

There are several possible explanations of this phenomenon. Recent
theoretical developments in the economics of marriage predict that males

with higher wage rates have a greater gain from marriage and are

therefore more likely to marry. Alternatively, one of the benefits of
marriage is specialization in the labor force; married men spend more
hours in the labor force than single males and thus have a greater
incentive to invest in human capital.

The empirical work in this paper suggests that a large
fraction of the unexplained wage differential between married males and
unmarried males may

be

attributable to the former explanation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Numerous studies have found that married men earn considerably more

than single men o the same education, experience, etc. There are several
possible explanations of this phenomenon. Recent theoretical developments
in the economics of marriage predict that males with higher wage rates
have a greater gain from marriage and are therefore more likely to marry.
Alternatively, one of the benefits of marriage is specialization in the
labor force; married males spend more hours in the labor force than single
males and thus have a greater incentive to invest in human capital.
This paper attempts to ascertain the relative importance of the
selectivity and investment explanations which have been outlined above.
The empirical work accordingly focuses on the determination of wage rates
and on the determination of the number of hours worked.

II. THEORY

Let us briefly reconstruct the marriage model which was developed by

Becker (1973) and Keeley (1974). It is assumed that both married and

single persons produce some aggregate commodity Z. The total gain from
marriage (C) is the difference between married real income and single real
income,

G=zmf —zm —z,
f
where

total real income of m and f when married,

income of the male (in) when single,

income of the female (f) when single.

increase

as the male wage rises.

The theory of marriage (Becker 1973) predicts

that male wages will be

negatively correlated with female wages; that is, ceteris

high

wage males will marry low wage females, and low wage males will marry high
and
wage females. Low wage males then specialize in household production,
an increase in their wages will decrease their gains from marriage. The

incidence of male specialization in household production

appears to be

quite low. Thus, there will be a predominatelY positive association
between male wages and the gain from marriage;

higher wages than single males partly

and married males will have

because those males with high wages

have found it worthwhile to marry. The positive

relation between marriage

and the male wage rate therefore in part reflects a selectivity phenomenon.
As we have seen, married males will tend to work more hours, other

things equal, than single males. The

marginal revenue of an incremental

unit of human capital investment increases as

the number of hours spent

working rises.2 Married males accordingly have a greater incentive to
invest in human capital, and marriage—associated
part of the observed wage

investment will create

differential between married arid single males.

2See, for example, Polachek (1.975)

5

A symmetrical argument relates female wages to marital status. Single
females have higher wages than married females partly because single
females spend more hours in the labor market than married females and also
partly because high wage females have not found it worthwhile to marry.
It is surprising to note that in the literature on the determination of
female wages there are few, if any, references to marital selectivity.

In the empirical analysis that follows, we will try to ascertain what
part of the male wage differential may be ascribed to selectivity and what

part may be attributed to marriage—associated investment. The fact that
some marriage—associated investment may occur prior to marriage and between

marriages makes this a difficult, if not impossible, task. For, as the
number of hours spent working over the life cycle increases (e.g., the
benefits of specialization in marriage increase), the marginal revenue of
investment in human capital increases in each period, whether the individual is married or single, leading to an increase in investment in human
capital in each period.

For seyeral reasons, married males face a lower marginal cost of

investment in human capital than otherwise identical single males. A man
is able to borrow at lower cost from a wife than from other sources to
finance investment in human capital; this is partly because alimony reduces
the risk faced by wives when they finance their husbands' investment in

human capital. It is reasonable to assume that the marginal cost of hourly
investment in human capital is an increasing function of the quantity of

investment per hour. A given level of annual investment in training will
then be cheaper to individuals when they are working many hours (e.g.,

married) than when they are working few hours (e.g., unmarried). Thus,
although there is likely to be more annual investment in human capital when

6

an individual is married, the difference between an individual's annual
rate of investment in human capital while married and an individual's
annual rate of investment in human capital while singlo, other things
equal, provides only a lcwer bound on the

quantity

of marriageassociated

investment.

Let

us now more formally specify the relation between wage

This specification allows individuals working 2000 hours per year to

in investment due to marriage—associated investment. The rest of marriage—
associated investment, that part due to the lower cost of investment during

marriage, is captured by the terms (M)

are predicted to invest more resources annually in human capital accumula-

tion than single males (i.e., (AI)

>
t ,n,m

0) because wives help to finance

this investment and because a given annual rate of investment is cheaper

when spread over many hours. The latter argument predicts that the hourly
rate of investment will be less for married males than for single males
(i.e., (td)tnm < 0). The increase in annual investrnei-it b'ought about by
the wife's financing of her husband's human capital accumulation may,
however, cause (tI)

to be positive.

As men move through their life cycle, the marginal revenue of invest-

ment in human capital falls and assets accumulate. Moreover, as assets
accumulate, the benefits of financing investment in human capital wit;hin

the marriage decrease. It therefore follows that

The growth in the wage rate over time therefore is positively related to
the growth in previous investment over this period, is negatively related
to the fall in current investment, and is positively related to the change
in wage compensation (D.+k — D

particular, if (tI)

then wage growth is predicted to be negatively related to initial marital

status (6) and positively related to final marital status

In the

empirical work that follows this section, equation (5) will also be estimated.

We will now compare people to themselves. We will compare the growth
in wage rates in adjacent married years to the growth in wage rates in

adjacent unmarried years. Suppose that a person is married in years j+k
and j+k+l and is unmarried in years j and j+l. Equation (4) implies that
the annual growth in wage rates in married years less the annual growth in
wage rates in unmarried years equals

The term in brackets is predicted to be positive since (AI)tnm is expected
to fall over t.he life cycle. This specification has the advantage that the
bias brought about by the presence of term individual—specific terms appears

to be negligible, for the term r(X+k — A.)

equals zero if labor supply

in period j+k equals labor supply in period j. Moreover, the assumption,
found in equations (2) and (3), that annual individual—specific investment

in human capital varies with current labor supply, may be questioned. The
predictions of equation (7) will be tested in section III.

It has been argued that marriage leads, through an increase in hours

worked, to higher wages. Knowledge of the relation between the number of
hours worked and wages, together with information about the effect of
marriage on labor supply, will enable us to ascertain what part of the
observed wage differential between married and never—married males is

attributable to differential labor supply. First, some additional structure must be given to the investment profile.

III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
The primary data set used in this preliminary investigation is the
seven year Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

Variables are defined in the

appendix at the end of the paper. The sample consists of males who were
in the sample for the entire seven year period (1968—1974), who had earnings in 1973, and whose estimated wage rate exceeded $0.50. Unless otherwise specified, all empirical work will refer to this data set.
The Project TALENT data set has been used to supplement the results

obtained from the Income Dynamics data set. Project TALENT is a stratified, random sample of all students in grades nine through 12 in 1960.

3me specification in equation (9) assumes that the rate of investment per hour is unrelated to the number of annual hours spent working.
In future work1 this assumption will be relaxed.

have selected a subsample of the twelfth grade males; observations where

information was missing were deleted. There were follow—up surveys in
1961, 1965, and 1971; the response rate to the 1965 and 1971 surveys was

in the vicinity of 30 percent. It will soon be seen that

the

intermittence

of the folloc—up surveys severely limits the usefulne-s of this data s't

for probing the relation between wages and marital status. Again, all
variable definitions are given in the appendix.

A. Labor Supply

It has been predicted that married men will work more hours than

unmarried men. If married males work many more hours than single male3,
then married males have a much greater incentive to invest in human capital,
and marriage—associated investment in human capital is likely to be an
important component of the difference between the wage rate of married

males and the wage rate of single males. With this in mind, let us turn
to the regressions in Tables 1 and 2, which explain variatioa in the total
number of hours worked in 1973 among those aged 64 dr less.

Most of the variables have a significant impact on labor supply. A
10 percent increase in the wage rate leads to a 34 hour reduction in the
number of hours worked per year. The number of years of schooling (Eli) is
significantly positive oniy when the log of the wage rate (LW4) is one of

the regressors.4 The positive sign of age (ACEH4) and the negative sign

4It is puzzling to find that LW4 and EU take on opposite signs. If
art increase in education generates a neutral increase in household productivity, then labor supply will be unaltered. Under this neutrality assurnp—
don, educational attainment and wages both measure human capital. Borjas
(1978) offers an explanation of the then inconsistent signs. He shows
that the often observed negative relationship between the wage rate and
labor supply may he spuriously induced by estimating the wage rate as the
ratio of earnings to hours worked.

of age squared (AGE2) imply that the life cycle profile of labor supply
resembles an inverted U; labor supply is estimated to peak around age 36.
Students (STU4=l) are estimated to work nearly 1800 fewer hours per year

than non-students. An additional year of seniority on a given job (EXPCU4)
is associated with approximately 11 more hours of work per year. When LW4
is not one of the regressors, union members OJN4) work significantly fewer

hours than non-union members. Nonwhites (RACE11) work between 101 and 153
fewer hours per year than whites, and individuals who were sick 10 hours
over the 1967—1973 period (SICK) are estimated to work one less hour in
1973.

Let us now examine the relationship between marital status and labor
supply. Variables measuring the wife's education and the 'presence of

children are found in Table 2 but not in Table 1. Consider first the
regressions in Table 1. As predicted, married males (MARR4=l) work significantly more hours than unmarried males. Married males are estimated to
supply approximately 250 more hours per year to the labor force than
unmarried males; this estimate is quite close to Parson's (1977) estimate,

which was obtained from another sample. In the third and fourth regressions, widowers are estimated to work nearly as many hours as married

males. However, the coefficient of W1D4 is estimated very imprecisely;
widowers do not work significantly more hours than the group of divorced,

separated, or never—married males. The MARR4 coefficient is again significantly positive in Table 2.

If education increases market productivity

more than household productivity, then men married to more educated women
will have smaller gains from marriage and will work fewer hours than men

married to less educated women. On the other hand, men married to highly
educated women may have more human capital and may therefore work more

16

hours than men married to women with little education.5 Neither the education of the wife (EW4) nor the number of children in the family unit
under 18 years of age (CHIL4) significantly affect the husband's labor
supply.

The marriage coefficient in Tables 1 and 2 may be biased. Married
males may work more hours than single ma1e because they have nore human
capital than single males rather than because of the specialization that

accompanies marriage.6 Some insight into the importance of this bias is
gained by explaining changes over the life cycle in the number of hours
worked.

The regressions in Tables 3 and 4 explain part of the variation
across individuals in the change in the number of annual hours worked

between 1967 and 1973 (HOUR84). Most of the variables are significant
only in the full sample and in the subsample of those who were married in
1968; variables which are significant in the subsample of those who were

not married in 1968 will be noted. The growth in hours between 1967 and
1973 falls with age; moreover, the coefficient of ACEH4 in Tables 3 and 4
is close to the coefficient that would have been predicted on the basis of
the regressions in Tables I and 2 (i.e., 12 times the coefficient of AGE?

in Tables 1 and 2). The signs and magnitudes of the coefficients of change
in the number of hours sick (SICK84), change in the wage rate (W84), and

change in job tenure (EXPC84) are also consistent with Tables 1 and 2. In
every sample, the change in student status (STUS4) is significantly and

negatively related to the change in labor supply. Married students have a
much greater increase in labor supply when they leave schooi than do
5Note that this argument assumes a positively sloped labor supply
curve.

Again, a positively sloped labor supply curve must be assumed.

unmarried students. Part of this difference may be attributed to the role
that wives play in the financing of their husband's investment in human

capital. The positive sign of change in union status (UN84) is puzzling,
for in the hours regressions, union members are estimated to work fewer
hours than individuals who do not belong to unions.

Only in one regression in Table 3 does change in marital status

(MARR84) have a significant impact on HOUR84. Males who get married
experience approximately 40 hours greater growth in hours worked than

males who remain single; this difference, however, is insignificant. If
the sample of those who were not married in 1968 is divided into two sub—
samples——those who in 1968 had never been married and those who in 1968
were divorced, widowed, or separated——then the MARR84 coefficients in
comparable but unreported regressions approximately equal 20 and 210 in
the two respective samples; in these small samples, neither coefficient is

significant. Those who marry for the first time appear to experience vir—
tually no increase in time spent working. The coefficients in the third
and fourth regressions in Table 3 imply that males who become separated or
divorced experience significantly less (180 hours) growth in hours worked

than males who remain married. Change in widower status (W1D84) is not
significantly related to the change in labor supply over the life cycle.

Why

does

male labor supply change so little at first marriage when

the response to other changes in marital status is so great? There are
several possible explanations. A large expenditure is associated with
getting married; this goes to acquiring furniture, taking a honeymoon,

having a wedding reception, perhaps buying a house, etc. If capital
markets are imperfect, then one way to acquire the desired funds is to

increase labor supply prior to marriage. The observations that wedding-

20

related expenditures tend to be smaller in subsequent marriages and that
males are older when they remarry and therefore have assets upon which to
borrow may help to explain the observed asymmetry in labor supply.
It could be argued that the coefficients in Table 3 result from the
tax on earnings associated with alimony and child support payments; however, this argument is inconsistent with the Large (although insignificant)
increase in labor supply with remarriage and is inconsistent with evidence
(from unreported regressions) that males who become separated decrease

their the spent in the labor market by nearly 160 more hours than males

who become divorced7
It could also be argued that differences in human capital rather than
specialization generate the differences in labor supply between married

males and single males which are found in Table 1. The change in hours
worked would then be unrelated to the change in marital status. This line
of reasoning would not explain the fall in labor supply that accompanies
divorce or separation.

Consider now the marriage and family structure variables in Table 4.
The change in the number of children under 18 in the household (DKID) and
the change in widower status have positive but insignificant coefficients.
MARR84 is significantly negative in the sample of males who were not mar—

ned in 1968 and is significantly positive in the sample of males who were
married in 1968. The change in the wife's education (EW84) is significant
and positive in the former sample and is significant and negative in the

latter sample. Because the wife's education takes on a value of 0 when
the male is not married, EW34 and MARRS4 are highly positively correlated;

the correlation coefficient equals 0.88 and 0.45 in the unmarried and
7The latter difference is not significant.

21

married subsamples, respectively. The flip-flopping of coefficients across
samples may thus be caused by multicollinearity and may not reflect a

behavioral relationship. The pattern of coefficients would be difficult
to explain if multicollinearity were not a problem.

Additional evidence on the relation between marital status and labor

supply is found in Table 5. Since the regressions in this table are
similar to regressions which have already been discussed, let us turn

immediately to the marriage coefficients. In the subsample of those who
are not married in 1968, those who are married in 1974 work over 250 more

hours in 1967 than those who are not married in 1974. In the subsample of
those who are married in 1968, future marital status does not have a signi-

ficant impact on current labor supply. These results are consistent with
the imperfect capital markets argument which was put forward earlier in

this paper. Moreover, the regressions in Table 5 are not explained by the
tax on wages which is brought about by alimony payments. Why would single
males who anticipate getting married work additional hours?
The evidence which has been presented on the relation between labor

supply and marital status suggests the following scenario: prior to marriage, single males increase the number of hours supplied to the market in

order to accumulate savings. Because of the specialization that accompanies marriage, this high labor supply continues through the marriage. With
divorce or separation, there is less specialization in the labor market,

and male labor supply falls. An alternative scenario that appears to be
less supported by the data would explain the observed differences in labor
supply with differences in human capital and with the tax on wages that
accompanies divorce.

B. Wage Rates

Much of the work in 8ection II was devoted to showing how marital
history and marital status may affect wages. Let us first explain some of
the variation across individuals in the level of wage rates. The regressions in Table 6 test the specification implied by equation (4). MARR4
measures current marital status (6 ), and MARRYR and SEC together measure
j

li—i

the number of years married prior to the current year I

ó

.

We

do not

t=O
know exactly how many years these respondents have been married prior to

1968. All that is known is the age of first marriage, how many years the
respondent has been separated, widowed, or divorced by 1968 if separated,

widowed, or

divorced

at the time of the survey in 1968 (a bracketed

answer), and whether or not the marriage in 1968 (if married in 1968) is

the respondent's first marriage. MARRYR incorporates the first two pieces
of information, and SEC, a dummy variable which equals one if the 1968
marriage is not the first marriage, incorporates the third piece of infor-

mation. The error in the measurement of MARRYR is thus expected to
increase with age. In the full sample, the correlation between the number

of years married (MARRYR) and experience (EXP) is quite high. Because of
this high correlation, it is difficult to separate the impact of marriage

from the effect of experience. In younger samples, the correlation
between MARRYR and EXP is lower. Younger samples are used in Table 6 to
take advantage of the smaller correlation between MARRYR and EXP and to
take advantage of the reduced error in the measurement of MARRYR.
These regressions explain variation in the log of the wage rate (LW4).
The coefficients are both more plausible and more significant in the older
subsample, which has more than twice as many observations as the subsample

of those 29 or younger. In fact, the only two significant variables in

state's average July temperature (JULY4), and JULY4 squared (JULY42) do
not significantly affect wage rates.

Since the significant results for the most part replicate the results
of earlier earnings functions studies, we will proceed to a discussion of

the coefficients of the three marriage variables. Those who are currently
married (MARR4=l) have significantly higher wages than those who are not

currently married. This may reflect either a positive correlation between
i—i

a,, the unobserved Individual—specific component of
t=0
investment which is independent of current marital status, or a lower rate

MARR4 and ar At —

of hourly investment among married males than among single males (I.e.,

(I)jnm < 0).8

Controlling for years married results in only a 20 per

cent drop in the MARR4 coefficients. The number of years of previous
marriage experience (MARRYR) is correctly positive but Is significant only

younger. Using the coefficients from the second and fifth regressions, it
is estimated to take between 1.4 and 5.3 years of 2revious marriage experience to generate the unexplained 98 cent wage differential between married

ma1c aud never—married males found in similar regressions using the fdi
sample.

There is also weak evidence supporting the expectation that the additional annual investment that occurs within marriage falls as the number

of years of marriage increases. In the sample of those 29 or younger
(where the mean value of MARRYR equals 5.99), one year of marriage

increases the wage rate by 2.6 percent, while in the sample of tho;e 34 or
younger (where the mean of MARRYR equals 8.02), one year of marriage

increases the wage rate by oniy 1.2 percent. However, regressions using
the natural logarithm of MARRYR instead of MARRYR were less successful in
explaining variation in LW4 than were the regressions reported in Table 6.

Similar regressions, estimated from the Project TALENT data, are

found in Table 7. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the
wage rate in 1971 (WYEAR11). Years of schooling (EH) is significant and
positive. Recall that this sample comprises but one cohort; therefore,
one additional year of schooling is obtained at the expense oi one year of

on—the—job experience. The number of jobs held between 1965 and 1971
(JOBS), the fraction of the year spent sick in 1961 (SICK1), and race

(RACE) do not significantly affect wages. Those who grew up in rural—farm
or small town areas (RURAL) are more likely than others to be living in

1971 in these areas, where the cost of living is low. It can therefore be
plausIbly argued that the significant negative coefficient of RURAL captures
a compensating wage differential associated with differences in the cost of
living.

In this sample, a sizable part of the wage differential absociated
with marital sLatus appears to be attributable to differences in invest—
inent. Married males (MARR=l) are estimated to earn 14 percent more per

hour than unmarried males. Huwever, when variables measuring the number
of years married prior to ]971 enter the regression, this coefficient drops

by nearly 50 percent. MARR is significant in both regressions. Our knowledge of the respondent's marital history is extremely limited; we know his
age at first marriage, his marital status in 1965, his marital status in

1971, and the number of marriages in 1971. MARRYR measures the number of
(j—].

years of previous marriage experience

•

I; it equals 28 less the age at

t=O

first marriage and is constrained to be nonnegative. NOMARR1 is also used
to measure the number of years of marital experience. NOMARR1 equals the
nt.mher of marriages in excess of one. As predicted, MARRYR is significantly

positive and NOMARR1 is significantly negative. One year of previous mar-

riage experience increases the wage rate by 1.8 percent. Using th

coeffi-

cients from the second regression, it is estimated to take nearly four years
of previous marriage experience to produce the observed unexplained marital

wage differential. Being married twice is estimated to be equivalent to
losing five to six years of marriage experience; these estimates are quite
close to the actual median time between separation and remarriage.9
Finally, the fourth regression is estimated using a sample in which our

knowledge of marital experience is fairly precise: the sample of once
married, currently married individuals. This regression is quite similar
to the others. Finally, note that unreported regressions using the log of
MARRYR are less successful in explaining variations in WYEAR11 than the
regressions reported in Table 7.

9See Becker, Landes, and Michael (1977), p. 1172.

29

Returning to the Income Dynamics data, regressions are presented in
Table 8 which attempt to explain differences across individuals in the

increase in wage rates between 1967 and 1973 (W84). The regressions are
based on equation (5) in section II. Wage growth is estimated as a function of educational attainment (EH), change in union membership (DUN84),
the number of hours sick between 1967 and 1973 (SICK), race (R.ACE1),

change in city size (DCITY84), change in average state January tempera—
tures (DJAN84), a dummy variable indicating whether or not the individual
changed states (DSTATE), experience (EXP), the number of years married
between 1968 and 1973 (MARRYR2), marital status in 1968 (MARR8), marital
status in 1974 (MARR4), and dummy variables measuring changes in marital
status over this period.

In order to hold marital status in 1968 ()

constant,

the sample has

been split into two groups: those who were not married in 1968 and those
who were married in 1968. Let us first examine the first three regressions, which are based on the former subsample. Surprisingly, a move to a
warmer climate is associated with a significant increase in the wage rate;

DJAN84 is significantly positive)0 The cross sectional evidence, however,
shows that workers are willing to work for lower wages in warmer climates.
The positive coefficient of DJANB4 may be reflecting the migration of pre-

dominantly skilled workers to the sunbelt. Changing states (DSTATE) leads
to a significant increase In wages in the first regression. The marriage

variables support the predictions of equation (5). Those who marry between
1968 and 1974 (NNARR=1) are estimated to experience nearly a $1.00 greater
increase in the wage rate than those who do not marry in this period; the

101n unreported regressions, the significance of the positive coefficient of DJAN84 persists even after the distance of the move has been held
constant.

average value of W84 is $2.00. The number of years married between 1968
and 1973 (MARRYR2) also has a significant and positive impact on wage

growth. When final marital status (MARR4) is held constant, an additional
year of marriage is estimated to increase the wage rate by 43 cents. It
should be noted that the significant positive coefficients of NMARR and
MARRYR2 may result from a positive correlation between these variables and

a1. MARR4 has a negative but insignificant coefficient; currently married
males experience a wage growth which is 63 cents less than the wage growth

of males who are not currently married. It therefore would take nearly
four years of .arevious marriage experience to build the unexplained 98 cent

wage differential that is observed between married males and never—married

males. None of the remaining variables are significant.
The only variable that is significantly associated with wage growth
in the subsample of those who were married in 1968 is educational attain-

ment. Wage growth between 1968 and 1974 increases by 13 cents with every
additional year of schooling. The marital variables often have a plausible,
although insignificant, impact on wage growth. Males who were not mar-

ried for at least one year in the 1969—1974 period (LOSS1) are estimated
to have a 29 cent smaller increase in their wage rate than males who were

married continuously in the period. When MARR4 is held constant, an additional year of marriage leads to a 17 cent larger increase in wage growth.
The MARRYR2 coefficient in regression (5) is approximately 40 percent of

the size of the MARRYR2 coefficient in regression (2). Since the mean
number of years married is 13 years greater in the latter sample, this
finding is consistent with the additional annual investnitnt that occurs

In the subsample of individuals who were not married for at least
one year in the 1969—1974 period, MARRYR2 is significant at the 10 per
cent level; its coefficient equals 0.20.

Additional evidence on wage growth during marriage comes from unreported

regressiDns.

If

widowhood

is not as

anticipated as marital disso—

lution, then m31es who become widowed will experience a greater rate of
wage growth during their married years than males who become s€parated or
divorced.

This

prediction receives weak confirmation.

In the subsample

of individuals who become separated or divorced in the 1969—1974 period,

the coefficient of MARRYR2 approximately equalled 0.17. In the subsample
of males who became widowed during this period, an additional year of

marriage led to more than a 30 cent larger wage growth. However, in these
small samples, neither coefficient is significant.

The final regression in Table 8 utilizes the full sample. As before,
EFI and DSTATE are significantly positive. MARRYR2 is correctly positive

and is significant. Final marital status (MARR4) is negative and is again
insignificant. The coefficient of initial marital status (MARR8) is nega—
tive and is significant at the seven percent level; this finding lends
some support to the hypothesis that married males invest less per hour in
the accumulation of human capital than single males (i.e.,

m

<

0).

Additional evidence on the determinants of wage growth comes from the

Project TALENT data. Table 9 presents regressions estimating the growth
in wage rates between 1965 and 1971. The average growth in wage rates
over these six years in this young and highly educated sample is close to
$3.

Educational

attainment is the only variable that has a significant

impact on wage growth. Those with a B.A. are

esrimated

to have approxi-

mately $1.00 greater wage growth than high school graduates. The first
three regressions examine the sample of males who were never married in

1965. In this sample, those who marry by 1971 experielice a 16 cont greater

wage growth than those who do not marry. As predicted, wage growth is
positively related to MARRYR and is negatively related to NOMARR1. One
year of previous

s'arriage

experience is estimated to increase wages by

seven cents. Current marital status (MARR) has a positive but insignificant
coefficient. The coefficients of regression (2) imply that 10 years of
previous marriage experience would be required to increase wages by 72 cents

(14 percent of the 1971 wage rate). In the fourth regression, the subsample
of never—married males in 1965 who were married once in 1971 and married in

1971 is used. With MARRYR more accurately measured, its coefficient jumps
by more than 50 percent; one year of marriage is now estimated to raise

wage growth by 11 cents. MARRYR is, however, still insignificant. In the
fifth regression those who are unmarried in 1965 and married in 1971 experience 18 cents greater wage growth than those who were unmarried in both

years. In the sixth regression, males who were married in 1965 and unmarried in 1971 are estimated to have 71 cents smaller wage growth than those
who were married in both years.

Let us now compare individuals to themselves. A subsample has been
formed from the Income Dynamics data set to test the specification found
in equation (7). Males were included in this data set if in the 1968—19714

period they spent at least two adjacent years married and two adjacent

years unmarried. DIFF equals the average annual wage growth between adja—
cent married years less the average annual wage growth between adjacent
unmarried years.

Males are estimated to experience an 18 cent greater annual increase in
wage rates when married than when not married; that is, the mean of DIFF =

0.18.

This difference is, however, not significant. The mean of DIFF is

significantly positive at the six percent level in the subsample of males
who become unmarried with age (i.e., k <

0).

It should be noted that

since in this subsample the married years precede the unmarried years, the
significant sign of DIFF may reflect nothing more than the concavity of
the age—wage profile.

The average change in city size in married years less the average change
in city size in unmarried years (DCITY), a similar variable for January

temperatures (DJAN), and k do not significantly affect wage growth. The
negative sign of k is predicted by equation (7), but the signs of DCITY

36

and of DJAN are inconsistent with cross sectional results. As retirement
approaches, the benefits of the additional investment in human capital

associated with marriage fall, causing (XI)tm to fall. The significant
and negative sign of the average age in the married years (MACED) is consistent with this expectation.

The decline over the life cycle in the additional investment that occurs In

marriage can be seen in Table 11. The regression estimates that at age 20,

the

annual growth in wage rates is 58 cents greater if an individual is

married than if that same individual is not married. By age 40, the difference has fallen to 14 cents. Neithe: of these differences, however, is

significant.

How much of the unexplained wage differential between married males
and never—married males is attributable to differences in labor supply?
In equations (10) and (11), labor suppy and experience arc the principal

explanators of variation across individuals in wage rates and in wage
growth. There is no information in the Income Dynamics data set about the

number of hours worked prior to 1967. Moreover, since this initial stock

of human capital (W5) is unobservable, the coefficients of a regression
estimating equation (10) may be biased. Accordingly, equation (11) rather
than equation (10) has been estimated. The sample consists of the set of
males who reported a wage rate (<$9.98) for regular work on their main job

in 1970 and in 19/4.

Change in union membership (DUNO4) has a significant and positive impact
on wage growth, while changing states (DSTATO) is associated with signif 1—
cantly smaller wage growth.

What does this regression imply about the wage differential between
continuously married males and never—married males of the same age?

Assume that there is no difference In labor supply between the two groups
In the first two years of experience and that group A (married or about—
to—be—married males) work 250 more hours annually than group B (never—

married males) over the rest of the life cycle. The wage differentials
13The regression of coefficients obtained from this sample will be
less biased than regression coefficients estimated from a sample in which
wage rates must be estimated.

38

under these assumptions between groups A and B at several points in the

life cycle are shown in the second column of Table 12. A continuously
married male with group A characteristics and 20 years of experience is

estimated to have a wage rate which is 7.4 percent greater than a never
married male with group B characteristics and 20 years of experience.
Thus, over one—third of the unexplained wage differential hetween narried
and never—married males appears to be attributable to differences in labor

supply. The third column in Table 12 is calculated under the assumption
that the difference in annual labor supply between the two groups equals

100 hours rather than 250 hours. The estimated wage differentials urder
this assumption are correspondingly smaller.

IV. CONCLUSION

The evidence presented in this paper suggests that marriage—associated
investment in human capital is a small but important component of the wage

differential that is observed in many earnings regressions. Married males
are shown to work over 10 percent more hours than single males. However,
no significant increase in labor supply accompanies marriage, despite the
fact that males significantly decrease the time they spend working when

they become separated or divorced. The evidence on the extent of the
specialization in the labor market that accompanies marriage Is thus mixed.

Furthermore, reasonable estimates of this specialization are shown to
account for less than one—half of the unexplained wage differential between
married males and never—married males.
The direct evidence on the relation between marriage and wages Is weak.
Introducing variables measuring the number of years married into earnings
regressions causes marital status coefficients to fall by 20 to 50 percent.
Wages are significantly related to the number of years married in the

Project TALENT data but not in the Income Dynamics data. Furthermore, in
the Income Dynamics data, a significant relationship between wage growth
and the number of years married is found; a sizable wage differential
between married and unmarried males emerges after three and a half years

of marriage. Of course, the significant relationship between wage growth
and the number of years married may reflect a selectivity phenomenon. In
the Project TALENT data, the number of years married is unrelated to wage

growth. Finally, evidence from the Income Dynamics data suggests that the
annual growth in wage rates when an individual is married is greater than
the annual growth in wage rates for the same individual when he is not
married.
