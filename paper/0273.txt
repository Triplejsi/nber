ABSTRACT

This study presents new estimates of collective bargaining coverage and

union membership for detailed U.S. industries. It compares the new coverage
and membership figures with each other and with figures derived by researchers

for the early 1960's and analyzes the divergences. This analysis leads to three

primary conclusions:

1) Estimated coverage percentages are on average higher

than estimated membership percentages; 2) This relationship is primarily the result
of the absence of union security clauses (under which covered employees must at
some point become union members); 3) Even among production workers within detailed
industries, private sector unionism has been dwindling during the past two decades.

New Estimates of the Industrial Locus o
Unionism in the U,S.*
One prerequisite for analysis of the economic effects
of trade unions is a sound set of estimates of the percentage

organized by industry. Existing estünates of the 1ndustiiaI 'ocus
of unionism in the United States

have been obtained by piecing together

data from diverse sources. The widely used estimates of Lewis (1963), Weiss
(1966), and Fuchs (1968) rely on establishment surveys and union membership
data from the 1950's and early 1960's, supplemented when necessary by "gues—

timates." Because of the lack of comprehensive data, differences in adjustment
procedures, and problems of allocating members of particular unions among
industries, the various estimates diverge noticeably and differ from comparable

estimates by Troy and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)) The divergence in
estimates and patchwork nature of the figures raise the possibility of sizeable
errors in the various unionization series which could, by the usual errors—
in—variables argument, bias the estimated impact of unions downward in econometric work.

This study offers new estimates of the industrial locus of unionism that
are based on larger and more comprehensive surveys, which do not require

supplementation from scattered sources. Section I describes the potential
sources of data on unionism by industry and the methods by which previous

estimates have been obtained.

P. Voos for their itmiense assistance in the production and presentation of
these estimates. The research reported here Is part of the NBE1s research
program in labor studies. Any opinions expressed are those of the authors

I. Sources of Data and Past Estimates
Data on the union organization of the work force are obtained from

three basic sources: establishment surveys, membership figures of unions,
and household surveys. Each source provides conceptually different data,
which have both advantages and disadvantages for determining the industrial
locus of unionism.

The principal establishment survey which provides unionization inf or—

mation is the Expenditures for Employee Compensation (EEC) survey, adminis-

tered by BLS.2 Its major advantage is that the union data relate to coverage
by union—management agreements (for both the office and nonoff ice
workers in the establishment taken separately), which is probably themost relevant

concept for analysis of the impact of unionization in the labor market.
The EEC survey also reports the total number of off ie and nonofficé
workers by establishment which can be used. to construct estimates of the

percent of workers covered by collective bargaining in each nonagricultural

industry. The biggest disadvantage of the EEC is that establihhments are
not asked the percentage of workers covered by contracts but rather

whether more.than 50 percentof theQfice or nonoffice
workforce are covered; measurement problems thus arise when part

of the relevant group is covered and part not. (Analysts have usually felt
it reasonable to assume that if a majority of the relevant work group is

(not) covered, then all (none) of it j3) Another disadvantage is that
establishment figures provide no inorniation on the demographic

characteristics of workers nor on the particular unions in a given industry.
Union membership data have many disadvantages as the source of infor-

mation on the industrial distribution of unionized employment.4 The figures
reported to BLS are union "guestimates," as membership and dues data are not

gathered on an industrial basis. Several unions fail to provide any information,

— 3_

and thus force BLS to make its own approximations. Definition of membership also varies; for instance, there is variation in the treatment of the

unemployed, and, more importantly, the retired. (Most unions include the
unemployed; a few unions, for example the United Mine Workers, also include

the retired, whereas most do not). In addition, employment figures used in
computing the percentage organized figures must be taken from other sources.
The advantage of the membership figures is that they provide data on specific unions.

Household data sources have the advantage of providing detailed

and economic facts about individuals in unions. A principal
drawback is that in most household surveys, including the Current Population
demographic

Survey
which

(CPS), one

member of the family responds for all family members,

could lead toerrDrs due to inaccurate knowledge (of membership status,

occupation, and industry). Another problem is that in the main household
survey, the CPS, the union question relates to membership rather than

coverage by a collective contract. The effect of collective bargaining
is likely to be misstated if, as turns out to be the case, a significant
number of nonmembers are covered by contracts or if members are without
contracts.

Extant estimates of the industrial locus of unionism rely on membership

figures and establishment surveys, generally compared in some fashion. In
Unionism and Relative Wages, Lewis estimated the fraction of production
workers in the United States who were organized at the 1—digit Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) level using membership information, and obtained
noticeably different figures from those of Troy (1953) and BLS (1960), who

used similar basic data. He explained the divergence in terms of "differences
in the way different persons have allocated the membership of unions by
industry... [which are] large [because of] the unsatisfactory state of our
knowledge regarding the distribution of unionism among industries."5

—4—

Lewis' estimates for detailed industries (presented on pp. 254—255
of his book) were obtained as the "central tendency" of membership figures
allocated to industries, scattered establishment surveys on collective bargaining coverage, the BLS wage structure series (which provides, as a byproduct, figures on coverage), and articles and books on unionism in spe-

cific sectors.6 As a result of the requisite patchwork,the figures are
"even more.., subject to the hazards of estimating union membership by
industry from fragmentary information "7thàn are the 1—digit SIC figures.
The Douty (1960) estimates, which are given at a 2—digit SIC level
of aggregation for each of the country's four regions, were based on a 1958

survey of manufacturing establishments conducted by BLS. These figures have
a reasonably close correspondence with the BLS industrial estimates of union
membership for 1958 that were based on information supplied by the unions
for the 1959 edition of the Directory of National and International Labor

Unions in the United States.8 Douty's estimates are also quite correlated
with the later Lewis figures, but are typically about 20 percentage points
higher.

9

Weiss' estimates of production worker unionization for 3—digit 1960

Census industries were derived from several sources:1° the BLS Industry
Wage Surveys, supplemented by selected unpublished 3—digit SIC estimates
of collective bargaining coverage made by BLS for Douty, other published and
unpublished coverage estimates, correspondence with research directors of
major unions, union membership data from the BLS's Directory of National and
International Labor Unions in the U.S., major contract coverage given in
Major Union Contracts in the U.S., Monthly Labor Review lists of "Major
Agreement Expirations and Reopenings," and "guesses based on qualitative
information."

—5—

The estimates of Fuchs, giving the unionization of all workers,
rather than of production workers only, in 3—digit 1960 Census industries

are based on Weiss' and Lewis' figures "with modifications." Fuchs assumed
that no nonproduction workers were organized and multiplied previous estimates of production worker coverage by the ratio of production to total employment in
ti-E relevant industry. Fuchs' "final estimates of all industries

were submitted

to Lewis for review and modified In accordance with his suggestions."11 The
principal modification appears to be a significant downward reduction In
Weiss' estimates to place the data on a membership rather than coverage
basis.

While Lewis and Fuchs provide reliable estimates for some nonmanu—
facturing

industries such as coal, utilities, and transportation, none of

the existing studies contain adequate figures for industries In the service or trade

sectors. In Fuchs, for example, frequently the same unionization figure is given
to several 3—digit Industries, due to lack of disaggregate data.

In sum, while carefully put together, available union-

ization by industry data involve considerable guesswork and have incomplete
coverage, in addition to being seriously outdated for the 1970's and 1980's.

II. New Estimates of Percentage Covered and Percentage Members
In this section we present new estimates of the industrial locus of
unionism in the U.S. ,

fer

production workers and for the total work force, derived

from establishment 'data on coverage by collective bargaining, and derived fror

household survey data on union membership. The estimates ar presented for
three industrial classification schemes: (1) 3—digit 1970 Census, for use
with the 1970 Census of Population; (2) 3—ditlt SIC, for use with the myriad
data sources, such as the Census of Manufactures and Annual Survey of

tures, which employ the SIC scheme; and (3) for manufacturing, 2—digit SIC,

—6--

for comparison with the 1958 estimates of Douty.

Unlike most previous estimates, our coverage and membership percentages

are based on only one data source, which should enhance their validity
relative to previous estimates based on an amalgamation of numbers from different sur-

veys. While by no means optimal, we believe that the new figures offer a
superior picture of the industrial locus of unionism and will, hopefully, be
of use to other researchers.

Coverage Estimates
Coverage by collective bargaining agreements data come from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics' 1968, 1970, and 1972 Expenditures for Employee Compensa—

tiøn surveys, each of which was based on a probability ample of establishments in the private nonf arm sector of the United States and the District of

Columbia. When pooled, these surveys contain information on the compensation,
employment, and hours of office and nonoff ice workers for more than 13,000

establishments. On the EEC questionnaire, establishments were asked if a
majority of nonoff ice employees were covered by union—management agreements
and if a majority of office workers were so covered. Office employees were
defined iinplicitlyby the following directions:

Include all employees in executive, administrative,
and management positions, above the working supervisor
level. Also include supervisory and non—supervisory
professional employees and their technical assistants;
employees engaged in office clerical operations; and
all salespersons whose sales activities are primarily
performed outside of the establishment (e.g., real
estate salesmen, and door to door salesmen).
For nonoffice employees, the q.i'estionnairc states:

Include all employees, except office employees as
defined above, in nonsupervisory, nonprofessional
positions. Include employees engaged in fabricating,
processing, or assembling; building or excavating;
mining, drilling, or pumping; maintaining or repairing;
shipping, receiving, handling, warehousing, packing
or trucking; retail sales; operating or working on
moving vehicles (buses, boats, etc.); janitoral work;
guard or watchman work; and similar activities.

—7—

We will treat "nonoff ice employee" as synonymous with "production worker"

and "office employee" as synonymous with "nonproduction worker."
For each industry in an industrial classification scheme we used the
EEC establishment data to calculate a figure giving the percent of nonpro—
duction employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and the percent

of production employees so covered. The formula employed in deriving the
percentage of office or nonoff ice workers organized in an industry is:

=

1.

where C

ijk ij

/

• 100

k is the percentage of employees in group k in industry j
who are covered by union—management agreements, with k

iet officà

k is a dichotomous variable that equals 1 if a majority of the
workers in group k -i-n estab1-islmnt I are covered by unisn—
management agreements and 0 if not,

w1. is a sampling weight giving the number of establishments represented by establIshment I,
and
£i4k gives the number of workers in group k who are employed
in establishment I.

The fraction of all workers organized was derived by ein. the number
of office and nonoff ice workers covered by agaments
dividing by total employment in the sector (E E

E ôJWj ijk and

wijiik)..

The basic data for the estimates were obtained from thepubliclyavailable EEC
tapes. For reasons of confidentiality, however, these tapes excluded inf or—
mation on a small number of very large establishments.

ELS kindly pro-

vided weighted counts of covered and total employment in the excluded estab—

lishments on a 3—digit SIC basis. These figures were used along q1th those from

thetapes

to derive estimates of the fraction organized by industry
(Cik)

—8—

on a 3—digit 1967 SIC industry basis. The 3—digit SIC figures were then
used to obtain estimates of coverage on 3—digit 1960 and 1970 Census industry classifications, using mappings that are available on request.
Table 1 presents the EEC—based estimates of the percent of all workers
and the percent of production workers who are covered by union—management

agreements by 3—digit 1967 SIC industry. In addition, it presents a lower

bound to the number of establishments used in deriving these etimates. The
number of establishments figure is a lower bound since (to preserve confidentiality) BLS did not provide information on the number of establishments
represented in its weighted counts of covered and total employment for
establishments excluded from the publicly available

tapes. It should

be noted that since the establishments which employ 6,500 or more workers
were supposed to be sampled with a probability of one, those whose employment was greater than or equal to 6,500 in more than one sample year can

be expected to have been included in more than one sample. Table 1 also
includes the number of workers in total and the number of production workers
in establishments surveyed in 1968, 1970, and/or 1972.
Because the EEC files were not designed to provide coverage estimates
on a 3—digit SIC basis, some of the percentages in Table 1 are likely to

have large standard errors associated with them. Still, the "raw" infor—
mation and counts in the table are likely to be of use to researchers, both as
a direct input into studies and as a guide to assessing the validity of

industry coverage estimates. Obviously, the percentages for some
industries will be inaccurate due to sample size and should be treated
cautiously.

Membership Estimates
Union membership data for private sector wage and sa1ary employees came from the

1973, 1974, and 1975 Nay Current Population Surveys, Since 1973, the
May questionnaire has asked about the union status of each individual

who is in the labor force. The question reads, "Does.., belong to a
labor union?" The three years were pooled to obtain 119,706 useable
records for employed private sector (wage and salary) workers.
The May CPS files code the respondent's industry in a number of ways.

We have used two of these codings: The first is based on the 2—digit
SIC industry classification scheme; the second is the 3—digit 1970 Census
industrial classification.

We defined the production worker group to include all private sector employees
in the following occupations:

Craftsmen and kindred workers; operatives, except
transport; transport equipment operatives; non—farm
laborers; private household workers; all other service workers; and farm laborers and foremen.
The non—production worker group was defined to include all private sector employees hD ere:

Professional, technical and kindred workers;
managers and administrators, except farm; sales
workers; clerical and kindred workers; and farmers
and farm managers.
The key difference between the EEC and CPS definitions 4.nvolves salesworkerg whose

sales activIties are primarily performed inside the establishment; they

to

are defined

be in the production grcxip uxler the for erhthtle nonnroduction group under the latter.

We

calculated

separate union membership percentages for production

and nonproduction employees in the private sector of each 3—digit
1970 Census industry according to the formula:

2.

where

Mik =

6ik Wijk/

Wjj)

100

M.k is the percentage of private sector employeea in occupa—
tion k (k indicates production or nonproduction) in industry j
who are union members,

-16-

k

is a dichotomous variable stating whether employee I Is
a union member (Sjjk = 1) or not (Sjjk = 0),

and

Wijk

is the CPS sampling weight attached to employee I.

Table 2 presents the CPS privLtte sector union membership percentages

on a 3—digit 1970 Census industrial classification basis,'4 and gives comparable figures for the percent covered by collective bargaining from the

EEC surve• The total number of workers and the number of production workers in the CPS sample are also given. As is the case with the Table 1 percentages, those in Table 2 must be approached with caution, since the estimates for some industries are likely to have large standard errors.

Comparisons of the New Coverage and Membership Estimates
How do the coverage (EEC) and membership (CPs) percentages of. unionism

compare? By which concept is unionism larger and why? Are there systematic
similarities or differences by industry?

One difference in the picture of unionism given by each set

of estimates can be observed by deriving comparable weighted average
unionism figures for the economy as a whole under the coverage (EEC) and

membership (CPS) concepts. Table 3 presents such economy—wide figures
for production workers and all workers in the private sector. These estimates
show that for both the production andtotal workforce, the fraction covered. by collective bargaining is substantially greater than the fraction who have joined
unions.

Table 4 takes the comparison a step further by tabulating the distri-

bution of differences, between the percentage of

production workers

covered by collective bargaining and the percentage who are union members

in the 193 3—digit Census industries for which both estates jst.

totil

— 25—

the two sets of figures are reasonably highly correlated (r — .87 for
production workers; r —

.89 for all workers), there are noticeable sys-

tematic differences in the patterns of organization shown by sector.
Overall, Table 4 shows that

in

124 out of the 193 industries, the EEC—

based coverage percentage for production workers

was greater (in many

cases substantially) than the comparable CPS—based union membership

Interestingly, Table 4 also demonstrates that

percentage.

while

the coverage estimates are more likely to be greater than

the

membership figures in the "traditional" union sectors (mining, con-

struction,

manufacturing, and transportation, communications, and other

public utilities (1970 Census codes 047—479)), this is not the case in the
"traditional" non—union sectors (agriculture, forestry and fisheries, wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance and real estate, business and
repair services, personal services, and entertaiiunent and recreation (codes

017—028 and 507—897)).

Reasons for Differences
There are three potential reasons why the EEC—based coverage percentages
are on average larger than the comparable CPS—based membership percentages.

First, since many union—management agreements do not have union security
provisions and at least some workers may choose not to join unions in their
absence, it can be expected that some covered production (or nonproduction)

workers will not be union members. Second, as suggested earlier, the individual responding to the CPS survey might have a tendency to state that
other family members are not

even though a
workers

union members when in fact

they

are. Third,

majority of an establishment's production (or nonproduction)

are covered by union—management agreements, all of the workers may

not be so covered.

Table 5 uses data from the 1971 National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS),

which containaa questionrelating to the membership of workers covered by
collective contracts to assess the first of these possibilities. The NLS
data suggest that a significant fraction of all workers who are covered by
collective bargaining agreements are not union members, and that younger,
female or Southern workers are especially likely not to be union members even

though the union is representing them. While the NLS sample is drawn from
groups encompassing only half of all employees, the NLS age—sex boundaries would
seem to permit a reasonable estimate for the employed labor force as a whole.
When the percentage for each age—sex category is weighted by the category's fraction

of the employed civilian labor force in l97O membership is about 17.5 percent less
than coverage. If this were the sole reason for the difference between membership and coverage estimates, the membership percentage would be 5.3. per-

centage points less than the coverage percentage. Thus, more than 85
percent of the 6.1 percentage point divergence between the CPS and EEC all—
worker unionism figures is most likely explicable by the fact that many covered

workers do not join unions, presumably becáse a relatively
large number of contracts (17 percent, according to the latest BLS tabulation
of major collective bargaining contracts)16 do not contain union security clauses.
With respect to the second possible explanation, it appears that some
of the divergence between the CPS and EEC unionism estimates that cannot be
explained by the membership status of covered employees can be explained by

reporting errors on the part of CPS respondents. This claim is based on a
comparison of the CPS membership percentages with membership statistics pro-

vided to BLS by unions. The percentage of the employed private sector civilian
labor force in unions in 1974 tccording to the reports of the worker organiza—

t1on was 26.4 which is moderately above the 226tpercent estim&te based on
to 1975 May CPS surveys.

it

Is difficult to use this difference to assess the magnitude of under-

reporting on

the part of CPS respondents.

Finally, bargaining units that encompass less than 100 percent of an
establishment's production or non—production employees undoubtably also
contribute to explaining the difference. Unfortunately, at present the
contribution of this factor cannot be quantified.

As Table 4 indicates, despite the overall pattern of greater unionizion
implied by the coverage as opposed to the membership data, in over 60 percent of traditionally non—union industries, the CPS—based membership figures are larger than the

corresponding EEC—based coverage figures. There are three potential explanations of why the CPS estimates are often greater than the EEC estimates

in these industries. First, collective bargaining units
which include less than one half of all production workers are probably

more coon In the traditionally non—union industries. Second,
when unions achieve recognition In the traditionally non—union sectors,
they are more likely to demand and receive union security agreements.
In 1975, 92 percent of the major (more than 1,000 workers) contract
workforce in the traditionally non—union sectors of whàlesale trade, retail
trade, hotels and restaurants servjces,. and miscellaneous mon—manufacturing
were covered by agreements with a union shop or modified union shop trovislon,
whereas only 64 percent of the major contract workforce in the traditionally
union sectors of manufacturing, mining, crude petroleum and natural
transportation, coiMmunlcation, utilities, and construction were covered by

agreements with either of these provisions. While this could not explain

membership greater than coverage, it would,be expec-tedtojnove the two
closer together.

—30-

Finally, as stated àboe, the EEC andC.PS

ciassificatiens treat

one important occu—

tional group differently. By the EEC definition, sales workers operating
inside establishments are nonoff ice or production employees. In the classi-

fication used in tabulang the CPS data,-é11 sales workers are treated as non—
production workers. Since sales workers are especially important in the
traditional nonunion sectors and are likely to be less organized than other
nonoff ice workers, this difference is a possible explanation of the observed

sectoral pattern of divergences between the EEC and CPS estimates. One way

Comparison with Previous Estimates
In addition to examining the

systematic relationships between the EEC—
based and CPS—based

estimates, it is also fruitful to compare he new

figures with some of the

earlier figures discussed above. Our comparisons
will be with the estimates
of Weiss, Fuchs and Douty.

-31i-

The correlation coefficient between Weiss' union coverage esttates for
80 industries in 1963 and our comparable production worker EEC estimates is

.71., A simple tabulation shows that Weiss' figures exceed ours in 50
industries, while ours are larger in 30 industries. Weiss did not calculate
a weighted average unionism figure based on the industrieá in his sample.
We derived this number using 1960 Census industry employment weights mulöiplied by

the ratioof productionwor'kers to all workers in each industry; it equals 70.0.

The coaparable w.ih aVag. f our

ns'

coverage estiaatco for the 80

industries in the Weiss sample is 64.3.

The correlation coefficient between our CPS membership estimates (which
appear most comparable to those of Fuchs) and Fuchs' percentage unionized

estimates is .82. In 84 out of the 131 industries for which both figures
exist, Fuchs' estimate of membership exceeds ours. The 1960 Census employment
weighted average of membership percentages for the 131 industries is 31.3
percent with Fuchs' figures and 26.3 percent with

ours.

Because Fuchs assumed

that no nonproduction workers are unionized, however, these comparisons are

biased toward showing our figures to be closer to his figures. We adjusted
for this bias by recalculating our membership percentages for Fuchs' 131 industries under his assumption that no nonproduction workers were unionized.
Under this assumption, our figures are smaller' than his in 91 out of the 131 in-

dustries and our weighted average unionism figure of 21.9 percent is 9.4 percentage points below his.

Finally, Table 6 presents our 2—digit SIC coverage (EEC) and membership
(CPS) percentages for manufacturing production workers and Douty's estimates

for 1958. Since Douty's figures pertain to coverage, the relevant comparison
is between our EEC—based estimates and his. As the table indicates, Douty's
estimate of the percentage of production workers covered by collective bar—
gaining in all manufacturing in 1958 (67) is significantly larger than our

EEC—based percentage (61). Moreover, in only 3 out of the 21 2—digit SIC
manufacturing industries is our estimate of production worker unionism
above his.

The comparisons of our unionization estimates for the period since
the late 1960's with Douty's 1958 estimates, Weiss' 1963 estimates and
Fuchs' early sixties estimates18 are consistent with the dwindling of
U.S. private sector unionism that has been occurring since the mid 1950,8.19

Moreover, they indicate that explanations of the current trend in the percentage organized in the U.S. based solely on changes in the industrial and

(broad) occupational composition of the labor force are incomplete. Thus,
our new estimates of the industrial locus of unionism have raised an

important question: Why has unionization been declining within detailed
industries in the private sector?
