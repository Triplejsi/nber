also interpret wage growth across jobs as being due to changes in the

search) and losses of specific training incurred when job separation

takes place.
Given this framework vs tackle two important questions in labor

economics.3 The first is a variation of the old question of whether
mobility "pays." Note that the cross-section comparison of movers to

A second related question we will analyze is the effect of labor

on wage growth within the job. It is quite

that mo-

bility shifts the earnings profile after each separation occurs. It
is less obvious, but equally important, that an individual's intentions

to separate from a firm will

affect the rate of growth of his earn-

ings in the current job. In particular, we hope to establish that job
iimnobility

(i.e.,

longer tenure) is associated with steeper wage growth

than would occur otherwise for a given individual.4 This finding should

prove useful on several grounds. First of all, it establishes that
indeed wages grow with tenure for a given individual. Although this
may seem like a somewhat trivial empirical result it should put to
rest doubts about the interpretation of the observed positive relation-

ship between wage levels and

tenure. In particular, there exists the

individuals.

Then a cross—section correlation of wages and tenure

would be positive even if wages did not grow at all in the job.5
More importantly, by establishing that wage growth on the job
is

related

to the separation probability, we can obtain some

esti-

mates of the importance of specific training in the labor market.
In particular, as long as specificity is an important component of

and complet.d

job tenure. Since lower probabilities of separation are

associated

with larger incentives to invest, we should observe steeper earnings

profiles in longer jobs. Note that the prediction implies not only
that wages grow on th. job for a giv.n individual, but that they
gri faster the better th. match (i.e., th. longer tenure). Therefore, in a sense, the "gains to immobility" are due to the fact that
job tenure "matters" over and above the accumulation of labor market
exposure.
The

is to provide a systematic

I. Labor Turnover and the Wage Profile Across

Jobs

In this section we use the NLS Young and Mature Men samples to anal-

yze the effects of labor turnover on wage growth across jobs. There are
several important restrictions in our use of the data. First of all we
define labor mobility to occur when an individual changes employers.
Thus transfers within the same firm are viewed as part of the returns

investigation or who did not leave the labor force after the separation

took place. Thus individuals who were either retired or in school at
the

beginning of the period or whose job separation was followed by

either retirement or by a return to school are deleted from our sample.7
For both data sets we concentrate on the interval between 1967 and 1973,

and partition this long period into three two-year intervals, 1967—69,
1969—71, and 1971—73.
intervals

We then pool the information in each of these

across the individuals in our sample, in effect tripling the

nanber of observations

The labor turnover variable is defined to

equal unity if the employer at the end of the two—year period is not the
same as the employer at the beginning of the two-year interval. Part A
of this section reports the results of comparing the two-year price deflated wage growth of individuals who separated from their jobs during

the period with

the relevant wage increases reported by stayers. In

Part B we return to the question addressed earlier of whether mobility
"pays" for a given individual.

A. Comparing Movers
Table

to Stayers

1 contains coefficients on dummy variables that indicate

the individual's mobility status over a two—year interval. These coefficient. are taken from regressions using absolute or percentage
wage growth over the two—year period as th. dependent variable and

holding constant a set of standardizing variables listed in the note

to the table.9 It is important to note that these standardizing variables are measured as of the beginning of the two-year period.
The coefficients of the separation dummies may be broadly inter-

preted as estimates of the "gains" to mobility. Table 1 shows that
among the young men a quit is associated with an increase in earnings

but for the older

men

a quit has either a negative or zero effect on

wage growth. Thus, for example, young men who quit receive a wage in-

crease of 11 cents an hour more than those who stayed, while for older
men the wage increase is

approximately

minus

3 cents an hour.1° On

the other hand, in both samples being laid off from a job leads to
lower wage growth than for stayers, although in the young men's sample

the difference is not very significant. For the older men, however,
layoffs reduce wage growth over the two-year period by about 19 cents

per hour, An interesting result is obtained by making a direct comparison of quits versus layoffs. In the

worth about 14

cents more than a

case of young men, a quit is

layoff; while for the older men, a

quit is worth 16.3 cents more than a layoff. Thus although who gains

and loses relative to stayers varies over the life cycle, the gains to

A further decomposition of the variable QUIT is examined in coltunna 13 and

1.6

by segmenting job-related quits into quits due to dis-

satisfaction with the current job (PUSH) and quits occurring because

the individual found a better job (PULL).12 One may argue that it is

individual's situation relative to the old

job. Although essentially

correct, this line of argument ignores an empirical peculiarity of the
data: most of the individuals who said they were pushed from the cur-

rent job gave reasons relating to the

non—wage

aspects of the job.

Thus there is no obvious reason to expect any kind of wage increase for

this group. Indeed, Table 1 shows that the effect of quits on wage

that the nature of a quit is a very important determinant of the gains
to mobility. Moreover, the results obtained with the detailed decomposition of QUIT provide one explanation, though not a very convincing
one, of the fact that the QUIT coefficient varies over the life cycle.
In particular, a quit is more likely to be due to finding a better job
at younger ages, while at older ages the quit is mainly due to dis-

satisfaction with the current job. These results, however, are not

The fact that our data show the opposite is somewhat puzzling.
Finally, one way of measuring the magnitude of the wage increase
due to PULL is to calculate the present value of this increase assuming

that

both that the individual works full-time until his retirement and

the

wage increase due to the quit is general in the sense that it re-

mains with him throughout his working life.13 From column 1.3 the observed wage increase is worth

Move

In the previous section we conducted an analysis

calculating

the

"gains" to mobility by comparing movers to stayers. As was pointed
out earlier, this procedure could create problens if population heterogeneity is an important phenomenon in the labor market. The existence

of heterogeneity raises two distinct types of problems. First, the
separation dumeies that compare movers to stayers can be proxying un-

observed individual characteristics indicating both the propensity for
turnover and

the

individual's ability to "g"

the job. Since in-

dividuals with high propensities for turnover find it harder to "hold
onto a job," population heterogeneity would create a negative correlation between wage growth and the separation probabilities. Moreover,

Thus unless we resort to somewhat more complicated statistical
procedures, ordinary least squares comparisons of movers to stayers

will yield hopelessly biased estimates of the returns to moving. A
correct answer to the question of whether the individual gained by
moving can be obtained only by a comparison of the individual's new

wage progress to that which he would have obtained had he stayed at
the

previous job. Clearly the relevant alternative wage is unavail-

between

the two

groups of men lies in their 1969—71 separation pro-

pensities. Suppose that we estimate wage growth equations similar
to those given in columns 3 and 6 of Table 1 for each of the subperiods:

The reader can easily verify that almost (qualitatively) identical
results are obtained for the other types of voluntary

the NLS Young Men's sample. For the mature men, this exercise yields

mixed results. The reason is probably due to the fact that

II. Labor Turnover and Wage Growth Within the Job

In the previous section we have shown that labor turnover affects

the wage profile across jobs. In this section we demonstrate how labor

turnover also affects the earnings profile within the

job.

In

Part A

we present a simple framework for analyzing the relationship between

labor turnover and

on—the—job

wage growth and in Part B we document

empirically that labor turnover systematically affects the slope of
the earnings profile within the job.

A Framework for Analyzing On-the-Job Wage Growth
One way in which on—the—job wage growth can be studied is to inter-

capital

pret it as the result of human

curs during the period t—l

to t, then the absolute change in the indi-

vidual's earnings capacity during that period can

be written as:

Since, by assumption, no job change has

can introduce the relationship between labor turnover and on-

level of the investment profile (measured

by C) and expected completed job duration. In other words, the in-

If longitudinal data are used, information on t is generally available
as long as actual events closely parallel expectations. If we make

the

simplifying assumption that actual completed tenure equals t as a

first-order approximation, and if we observe a sample of individuals

changing jobs at some point during the survey, then it is possible to
estimate the parameter n (times a constant). In particular, rewrite

tn

as:

tn —en +Rn

where en is current job tenure and Rn is time remaining in the current
job. Using equations (4)—(6) we can derive:

job will be longer (the investment effect p). The key to demonstrating that labor turnover and on-the-job wage growth are related is the
availability

of longitudinal data which enable us to observe an

dividual s completed tenure. 18

It is important to note, however, that an alternative interpretation can be given to the observation of a positive coefficient on R.
One could simply argue that in jobs where an individual is progressing,
i.e. where his wages are growing faster than they would elsewhere

(perhaps because of better opportunities for investment), the individ—

ual will have an incentive to stay. Again, we would observe a positive
correlation between on-the-job wage growth and completed job tenure.

Actually, either interpretation highlights the importance of human

capital in explaining labor turnover.

to

sample,

in fact, stayed

20 years on the job (15 years prior to the survey and 5 after the sur-

vey). Therefore, from an ex ante point of view, staying an additional
20 years on the job is equivalent to an increase in annual earnings of

$514. The present value of this increase in annual earnings over the
completed job span (20 years of tenure) is $4,446. Thus there is substantial wage growth

on the job over and above that obtained if there

were no positive correlation between wage growth and
tenure.

the case of young men, even though the coefficient of REHTEN

is 8.4 cents, the completed tenure is significantly smaller, only 6.6

pleted job tenure and wage growth

is

we recognize

that the insignificance of REMTEN in our equations indicates the need
for further research on this question.

III. Labor

Parts

Turnover and

Lifetime Wage Growth

I and II of our paper have shown the role that labor turnover

plays in determining wage growth both across jobs and within the job. We

have

observed that individuals who change jobs voluntarily experience

wage gains while individuals who stay on the job appear to experience

steeper wage growth within the job. Thus one can xt predict a priori
whether turnover leads to smaller or larger lifetime wage growth. In

section we suggest how this question can

this implies less turnover in the individual's previous experience t-e.
But under the assumption that mobility pays, the net effect of current
tenure should then be negative' On the other hand, if wag. progress

over the life cycle is a function not only of total experienc, but of
current job tenure, we would

expect

13 and 14 to be positive and nega-

tive respectively in equation (9). If this is the case, however, the
results can be interpreted as an indication of the fact that specific
training is an important component of wage determination.24 In other
words, job tenure matters over and above the passage of labor market
exposure.

Unfortunately, the two data sets we use in this paper do not con-

tain any information on initial earnings in the life cycle. Moreover,
in the Young Men NLS the individuals are much too young and both labor

of the parameters. However, in the older men NLS we do have a measure

of labor market progress made by the individual over the life cycle

since we are given the Duncan scale for the initial and current occu-

pations. One
fact that the

distinct

advantage of using the Duncan

scale

is the

measure of "earnings" is of a sore permanent nature.25

Table 4 presents the lifetime earnings growth regression estimated for

the Older Men NLS. In each case the linear job tenure coefficient is

positive and

significant

indicating that holding total labor force ex-

perience constant, longer

job tenure is associated with higher levels

of total life cycle wage growth. Therefore, the results unambiguously

that while mobility that

IV. Effects of Other Variables
In the previous sections we have documented that turnover is an
important

determinant of wage growth. In this section we explore in

more detail the other determinants of wage growth for both the Young
and Mature NLS

samples.

The basic results are

presented

in Table 5

where wage growth regressions are estimated separately for stayers,
quitters and

layoffs

in both age samples. In order to conserve space

we present only the results using arithmetic wage growth.

The effects of the other variables are interesting. For example, education has

a

strong positive effect on the wage growth of

young men. Moreover, within the young

men's sample, education

V. Suay
In this
of

paper we have presented a systematic empirical analysis

wage growth in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young and Mature

Men. We have demonstrated that labor turnover is a significant factor
in understanding wage growth since it affects both wage growth across
jobs and wage growth within the job. Some specific findings are smmarized below.

1. Although the gains to quitting appear to be positive for young
men and zero

or negative for older men, this was

guishing among

quits

due to being dissatisfied with the current job and quits

uals who

quit because

significant wage gains. At older ages a quit is mainly due to dissatisfaction with the current job and these types of quits do not in
general

significantly increase earnings. Since the nature of a quit

changes over the life cycle, this is the reason for the age differences in the impacts of quits on wages.

2.

We extended our analysis of the wage gains from mobility by com-

paring not only movers and stayers but individuals to themselves in the
sense that we analyzed the individual's wage profile before, during and
after the move to determine whether it had been significantly affected

by mobility. It was shown

that

at least for the young men, this type

exercise led to the conclusion that a mover significantly gained

through the observed positive correlation between wage growth

growth in

i.e. leading to wage gains across jobs but

shorter jobs, its

effect on lifetime wage growth

could not be predicted. Our empirical analysis showed, however, that,

even after holding total labor force experience constant, there exists
a strong positive correlation between length of current tenure and
total life—cycle wage growth. Thus, while early mobility may pay, in-

dividuals who are still changing jobs later in life experience lower
overall wage growth.

In summary, this paper has tried to show that labor turnover af-

fects not only the growth of wages across jobs but also the rate at

which wages grow on the job. It is therefore an important factor that
must be taken account of in any study of the earnings distribution.

is.. Mincer (1970) and Sahota (1978) for surveys of alternative

explanations of the determinants of the earnings distribution.
exceptions are found in the papers by Lazear (1976) and
Wise (1975).

31n previous work (Bartel and Borjas, 1977) we have analyzed the

problem of y people move. Mere we concentrate on establishing the
consequences of labor turnover for the individual' s wage-experience

profile.
4Jovanovic (1978) provides a model that predicts wage growth on

the job based on the matching process between the individual and the
firm.

5An extensive discussion of the role and effects of heterogeneity
in the labor market is given in the Heckman article in this voltvne.
Further analysis of the problem, with labor turnover used as the focus,
is provided by lovanovic and Mincer in this volune.

Bartel (1977) for a detailed analysis of the relationship
between job turnover and migration.

pear to be. In particular, in the extreme age groups sampled in the
NLS, a significant portion of turnover may be due to either retirement

or

school enrollment changes.

8There are two important qualifications to be noted here. First,

men's

in the young

NLS, many individuals were enrolled in school in

early years of the survey. Since we concentrate on the labor market behavior of men permanently attached to the labor force, we do not

observations for these individuals in the

series less than triples the number of

observations. Secondly, the efficiency of ordinary least squares can
be improved upon

for pooling

by utilizing one of the many methods ni available
and

time-series.

We do not pursue this re-

in this paper.

An exact description of these variables is given in Appendix A.

'°Recall that these

numbers refer to the gains made over the two-

year period. To obtain annual effects of labor mobility, simply divide
the coefficients by two.

job—related quit is one that occurred because (a) the individual was dissatisfied with wages, hours, working conditions, and/or
location of his job, (b) he disliked his fellow employees, or (c) he

found a better job. A personal quit is one

that

occurred because of

(a) health problems or (b) family reasons. For young men, 85 percent
of the quits were job-related while for the older men 73 percent were
job related.

particular, the analysis would

be conducted in terms

time—equivalent investment ratios. These ratios, in turn, would

then be expected to decline both over the life cycle and within the

job. Moreover, if higher levels of investment can only take place by
spending a larger portion of work time investing, one would expect a
positive correlation between these investment ratios and completed

job tenure. Thus the analysis may carry

over

to percentage wage

growth.
19These sample

restrictions,

of course, raise the possibility of

sample selection bias; see Heckman (1978) for a thorough discussion of
this problem.

There are two possible reasons for the insignificance of REMTEN

in the Young Men NLS. First, these men are in the very early years of
their jobs when investment may not

be taking place. Second, the usable

sample is very small because during 1967—69 approximately half of the
individuals

were enrolled in school and are deleted from the sample;

anng the remaining 50 percent, the job separation rate is very

high thus resulting in further deletions. It is interesting to note
that by enlarging the young men's sample to include individuals who did
not

leave the job by 1973 and assigning an arbitrary value of 10 for

REMTEN for these individuals, the REMTEN coefficient becosies positive
and significant.

22Note

that the coefficient of REMTEN is never significant in

with percentage wage growth. In principle,
the correlation between investment and completed tenure need hold
we deal

only in terms of dollar investment costs and not in terms of time—

equivalent investment ratios since it is not clear a priori how
initial earnings capacities are correlated with completed job tenure.
problem of heterogeneity versus state dependence is discussed in detail in the Heckinan and Jovanovic and Mincer papers in-

cluded in this volume.
