DO MULTINATIONAL FIIUIS ADAPT FACTOR
PROPORTIONS TO RELATIVE FACTOR PRICES?
Robert E. Lipsey, Irving B. Kravis, and Romualdo A. Roldan

Abstract

It has been alleged that multinational firing fail to adapt their

methods of production to take advantage of the abundance and low price of
labor in less developed countries and therefore contribute to the unemploy-

ment problems of these countries. This paper asks two

questions:

do multi-

national firms adapt to labor cost differences by using more labor—intensive

methods of production in LDC's than in developed countries and do multinational
firms' affiliates in LDC's use more capital—intensive methods than locally-owned firms?

We concluded that both U.S.—based and Swedish—based firms do adapt to
differences in labor cost, using the most capital—intensive methods of
production at home and the least capital—intensive methods in low—wage

countries. Among host countries, the higher the labor cost, the higher the
capital intensity of production for manufacturing as a whole, within Individual
industries, and within individual companies.

When we attempted to separate the capital—intensity differences into
choice of technology and method of operation within a technology we found

that firms appeared to choose capital—intensive technologiesin LDC's but
then responded to low wage levels there by substituting labor for capital

within the technology. Similarly, U.S. affiliates appeared to use technologies
similar to those of locally—owned firms but to operate in a more capital--

intensive manner mainly because they faced higher labor costs.

DO MULTINATIONAL FIRS ADAPT FACTOR P0P()PTIONS
TO RLLATIVT F'ACTOP rICTS?

Introduction
A major issue in the discussion of the effects of multinational firms'
operations on host country employment has been whether these firms use

"inappropriately" capital—intensive methods of production and are therefore

responsible in some degree for underutilization of the presumably abundant

labor, or unskilled labor, resources of less developed countries. T''e attempt
here to answer two questions about factor use by multinational firms. One

of Commerce for 1966 and 1970 and similar data for Swedish—based multinational
firms collected by the Industriens Utredningsinstitut of Stockholm for
1970 and 1974.

The

question

of the degree of adaptation to LDC factor costs has

received the greatest amount of attention. Unfortunately there are many
possible definitions of adaptation and a good deal of effort has been
spent, often unprofitably we

believe,

in attempting to distinguish one from

another.

A question frequently raised is whether any observed differences
between production methods in developed countries and those in LDC's are
the result of factor substitution within a single technology (along a
single production function), as in Figure 1 or the result of the

attempt to divide the observed differences betweenDC and LDC factor use
ratios (k1 and k3) into the unobserved differences between k1 and k2
(cx ante substitution in their terms) and between k2 and k3 (ex post sub-

each industry, one for developed country affiliates of each firm and one
for affiliates in LDC's, and fit production functions accordingly.
In our study we have fitted production functions to data for individual
affiliates in an industry across all countries, treating the degree of

development as a continuum rather than as a dichotomy. The framework can be
described as viewing the parent firm as having a technology set consisting
of knowledge of a variety of ways of producing which differ in their
capital intensity. The question Is whether the parent firtn's choices from
this technology set for use in different countries reflect differences in
factor costs.

Even this viewpoint is most appropriate for a single product rather
than for the heterogeneous Industries of any available collection of data.
Production functions fitted to aggregate data or to heterogenous firm
or establishment data may be regarded as fictions which provide insights into

factor substitution but which must be taken with some reservations as

explanations of aggregate production relationships. We therefore concentrate

—5—
first on the observed differences In factor proportions (the difference
between k1 and k3 in Figure 3), and relate them to differences in factor

prices. We examine the relationships, taking as our units of observation
for a country, in turn, manufacturing as a whole, broad industries, and

individual firms. e ask, in this part of the paper, what adaptation
there is to host—country factor prices, how much of it takes place through
the selection of labor—intensive industries and how much through the selection of labor—intensive firms for production in low—wage countries, and
finally, how much takes place through the choice of factor proportions
within industries or firms.
At the most aggregative level, broad Industries, adaptation by
selection (Figure 4) means that labor—intensive industries establish production

abroad,especially in low—wage countries, more frequently or, at a higher
level relative to home output, than do capital—Intensive industries. In other
words,

if

Industries

there is adaptation by selection, the share of labor—intensive

will be higher among affiliates, particularly among affiliates

in low—wage countries, than among home—country industries.

Since virtually all industries defined by statistical classifications

Selection of Investing Firms

That would be adaptation by selection of firms within an industry.
In the cases of selection of investing industries and investing firms

there are, of course, influences on location other than labor cost. It has
been suggested, in fact, that the typical advantage of U.S. firms, which
enables them to compete effectively in foreign markets with host—country

and other foreign firms, Is technological skill. If high technology is
associated with high capital—intensity there will be a tendency for capital—
intensive firms and industries to locate abroad that will operate in the
opposite direction to the influence of labor costs.

abroad exactly as at borne. One wa

test for this possibility is to make

comparisons of capital intensity within industries, as in

If

all the differences in Table 1 were accounted for by industry selection

there would be no differences within industries. If industry selection
were unimportant, the differences in Tables 2 and 3 would be as large as
tliosein Table 1.

It is clear that,

even

within broad industry groups, home production

is most capital—intensive, production in developed—country affiliates next,

and production in LDC affiliates least capital—intensive. In Table 2,
for the United States, 22 out of 24 comparisons show parent production more
capital—intensive than that in develored—country affiliates, 16 out of 16
show developed—country affiliates more capital—intensive than those in
LDC's, and 16 out of 16 show parent production more capital—intensive than

affiliate production in LDC's. Adaptation, in other words, is visible
within industries, at least within industry groups as broad as these. That
impression is strengthened by the averages. The average of the industry
relatives of affiliate to parent capital intensity show at least as much
relation to the type of host country as do the aggregates, and possibly more
in the case of LDC's.

The adaptation in capital intensity shown

by manufacturing intlustry as

a whole in Table 1, put in index form in the All Manufacturing lines of Table 2,

can be divided into two parts. One is the adaptation within industries and
the other is adaptation by

selection

of industries discussed earlier. Adaptation

within industries is shown in the indIvidual it'dustrv lines of Table 2 and

summarized in the Average of Industry Relatives lines. It is calculated by
putting each industry line into relative form (parent capital intensity = 100)

and averaging across industries with narent employment as weights. If
within—industry adaptation were the only type that took place, the All Manufacturing

in the home countries. however, the opposite seems to be true for

less developed countries. The industry selection seems to lean toward

industries there and offsets, to a small degree, the

effect of adaptation within industries. Thus not only does selection of
industries play a small role in the total extent of adaptation for
manufacturing as a whole, but it even r1ays an apparently perverse role

in LDC's. The major adaptation takes place within these broad industries.

with the averages of industry ratios for fire insurance values we find
for LDC's that the aggregate is a bit lower, indicating some selection of

labor—intensive industries for production in LDC's. Fowever, the effects
of that selection were again, as in the United States, minor compared with
the use in LDC's of relatively labor—intensive production methods within
industries.

we have assumed that capital

costs are identical for the firm in any location, and that ratios of labor

cost to capital cost are therefore proportional to labor cost alone. The

cost of capital may be considered to consist of to elements, one the
opportunity cost to the firm of tying up assets in a particular form, and
tile

other the cost of a physical capital good. Capital costs in the first

construction cost and labor cost are rositivelv correlated we exaggerate
the differences between countries fri relative factor prices and under-

estimate elasticities of substitution.

—21—

The labor cost we would like to measure is that for pure unskilled
labor or for labor of a given quality. Lacking any such cost measure we
have

used several approximations or proxies, Including real CDP per capita,

average

wage paid by all manufacturIric' affiliates in a country, average wage,

and the latter two deflated by an inde: of the

average quality of labor.

Real CUP per capita is of course not a measure of labor cost. It was
used as a proxy under the assumption that the higher the real GDP per capita,
the

higher the standard of living and the higher the cost of unskilled labor.

The estimates are from Kravis,

Peston, and Summers [1978b]. Average wages

come closer to cost measures but obviously reflect differences in quality
as

well as differences in price. To remove the effect of quality dif-

ferences we have devised a rough index of labor quality from various
measures calculated by others including L)enisori [1967], Harbison and

Myers [1964], and Krueger [1965], which covers about fifty countries.

In using the quality index to deflate money wages for a specific industry,
for example, we In effect assume that each company within a country

hires

workers of average quality and that any deviation of a company's

wage or an industry's wage from the average wage represents a higher cost

rather than higher quality. Where
distinguishing

we use average country wages without

companies or industries, however, we are making a very differ-

ent assumption, namely, that all companies and industries in a country face

the same..labor cost and that any variation represents differences in quality.
Measures of capital intensity raise at least as many problems. We
have experimented with assets per worker, book and market values of property,
plant, and equipment per worker, value added, and nonwage value added per

per worker have the advantage of being coiprehensive. If

— 22

—

one thinks of inventories, bank accounts, and loans as being production
inputs, that comprehensiveness seems desirable. However, for a singlecompany,
there is no assurance that the financial assets of a subsidiary are held

entirely to assist production in that country. It is quite conceivable that
a parent company might arrange to have the subsidiary hold assets for the use
of the parent or of other affiliates, and

it would then be improper to

treat the nor.production assets as necessarily belonging to the host—country's

production function. Similarly, the parent might hold financial assets for
the use of all its affiliates, In which case we might be understating the
amount of capital involved in a given affiliate's production.
We have, for these reasons, leaned torard fixed assets, or property,
plant, and equiptaent per worker. flost of the data are for net property,
plant,

and equinmcnt, with all

the associated problems of depreciation

rates, valuation of assets purchased in the nast, etc. However, for
Swedish affiliates and their parents and for Swedish domestic firms in

each industry we also have data on the valuation

for fire insurance of

gross property, plant, arid equipment.

It would be desirable to have a measure of the flo, of capital
services instead of the stock of capital, since that would be the appro-

priate measure of the contribution of capital to production. We do not
have adequate measures, however, and proxies which have been suggested,
such as value added or nonwagc value added per worker5 do not seem satis—

See, for example, Lary [19G8].

— 23 —

factory,

especially for comparisons within firms. The problem centers on

the ability of the firm to manipulate the location of profits, presumably
to minimize taxes or to evade other host-country or home—country regulations.
The result is that there are large numbers of affiliates with negative or
zero value added and others in which value added has been inflated for

similar reasons. To the extent they are used, value added per worker is
taken to represent total returns to capital per worker, including returns to
human capital, following Lary, and nonwage value added is taken to represent
returns to nonhuman capital.

We

should

have liked to investigate differences in skill mix and

prices of skilled labor but the data are poor for this purpose. The U.S.
survey forms included questions on the breakdown of the labor force and
payments by type but the answers were considered unsatisfactory by BEA

and were not used. We could not treat differences among countries in average
wages as representing skill differences, as one might within a country.
The average wage

measure of the cost of standard labor, although it can incorporate

skill differences as well. To the

the

cost and capital intensity is blurred. A possibility that

be worth exploring would be to measure labor cost by average wage

for the country as a whole dated by

the

average labor quality index and

measure skill intensity for a given affiliate or group of affiliates by the
ratio of average wage paid to the average national ¶lage.
The Swedish affiliate data did include a usable distinction between
production workers and others. We have made some use of the proportion of
nonproduction workers as a measure of skill intensity.

— 24 —

Labor Costs and Factor Proportions in
Individual

Countries and Industries

We begin our analysis of the

impact

of labor costs on capital intensity

with a

series of regressions across countries, using data on the character—

regressions, summarized in Table 4, the data

manufacturing

affiliates In each country

show that

capital intensity responds significantly to country differences in wage
costs. Equations 5 and 6, which make use of our best measures of wage
costs, the average affiliate wage divided by

quality in

our

measure of average labor

each country, suggest an elasticity of substitution of between

.7 (for fixed capital) and .8 (for all capital). A comparison of equations
1 and 2 with equations 3 and 4 indicates that adding more countries to the
38 covered by our labor quality index would tend to raise the coefficients,
their

significance, and the r2, but would not change the main findings.

Real CD? per capita, which we expected to be a good proxy for labor

cost,

performed poorly, explaining very little of the variation in capital

intensity. To check whether

might

the greater explanatory power of the wage rates

be spurious, stemming from a common price level effect on both labor

cost and

the capital intensity measure, we ran

equations 7 and 8 with price

level as the explanatory variable. Price level had no

apparent

explanatory

power and the coefficients were not statistically simificant. However, the
fact that the coefficients were positive and fairly large does raise the
possibility that the

elasticity of substitution we calculate may be somewhat

exaggerated by spurious price effects.

— 26 —

The Swedish data of Table 5 again show strong effects of labor cost
on capital intensity. The coefficients for average wage and quality—adjusted
average wage range from .75 to .87, somewhat above those in the U.S. equations.
What is different about the Swedish results is that both price level and

real GDP are related to capital intensity. The high price level coefficient
hints at some exaggeration of the calculated substitution elasticities but
the considerable explanatory power of real GDP, the labor cost proxy most
clearly cleansed of price effects, shows that labor cost is an influential
factor.

If we accept the results of Tables 4 and 5 as indicating significant
response to labor cost, we still would wish to know whether the response
involved only the choice of industries for investment (labor—intensive
industries in low—wage countries) or choices among companies or production

methods within industries. We can get some notion of the answer to this
question from Tables 6 and 7 which show the same relationships within broad
industry groups for both U.S. and Swedish affiliates.
The U.S. equations for aggregate manufacturing (Table 4) and for pooled
individual industries (Table 6) are quite similar, except that the latter
imply lower elasticities of substitution, .50—.55 instead of .6—. 7. In other
words, the substitution between labor and capital in the manufacturing aggregate owes a little to the choice of industries hut mostly takes place within
the

broad industry groupings found in the table. There is some tendency

for labor intensive industries to be more heavily represented in lower
income countries but it accounts for only a small part of the apparent
substitution of labor for capital there. We can judge from equation 2
that the elasticity of substitution estimated in equation 3, limited to

128 observations because of the lack of complete coverage in the labor
quality

in

variable, is not higher than that of equation 1 because of differences

country coverage. The coefficient for a,erage wage among the countries

included in the quality data is almost identical to that calculated from data
for all countries.

The equations for individual U.S. industries almost all show significant labor cost coefficients, implying substitution of labor for capital in

low—labor—cost countries. The exception was transport equipment, for which
the number of observations was very small. The largest coefficient, suggesting an

elasticity of substitution above "1" was for the chemicals indus-

try.
A similar analysis of Swedish affiliates is made in Table 7. Since

we had no wage data by country for these affiliates the elasticities were

using average wages paid in each country by U.S. affiliates: the
same wage variable as in Tables 4 ard 5. Both 1970 and 1974 equations indiestimated

cated strong response to labor costs, as measured by average wages or by

quality—deflated average wages. However, both real GDP and price level
were also related to capital intensity and, in fact, explained it better
than the presumably appropriate wage variable did.

Although there were not enough observations to calculate an equation
for each industry among Swedish affiliates, there did seem to be some indus-

try differences large enough to affect the elasticity measure. When we
distinguished two industries, which seemed to be outliers, Paper Products &
Printing and !eta1 Products, from the others, we found them to have somewhat
higher elasticities and the explanatory power of the equation increased greatly.
In

any case, the Swedish affiliates appeared to respond to labor costs as the

U.S.

affiliates did, and perhaps to a greater degree, with elasticities of

substitution mainly over .7.

Labor Costs and Factor Proportions Within Firms
The degree of adaptation we have found to exist within industries might
still be a matter of selection, either among sub—industries or among companies within each industry, with each company producing in the same way at

home and abroad and in each foreign location. We cannot work with much finer
industry classifications than those of Table 6 for lack of data or of sufficient numbers of observations but we can, for both the United States and
Sweden, use information for individual companies and their affiliates to look

for adaptation within companies. The within—company adaptation might be
within a given technology (Figure 1 in the Introduction), between technologies
(Figure 2), some combination of these (Figure 3), or some selection of

processes for LDC production (Figure 6). In addition, the capital/labor
ratio may reflect the effects of scale economies or diseconomies within the
firm (Figure 7).

A sampling of U.S. results for all industries pooled in 1966 and 1970

is given in Table 8. Since we are using individual affiliates as the units
of observation

but

also

here we can

include not only labor cost in the host country

scale of operations for the affiliate itself as explanatory variables.

The data for 1966 have sonic advantages and some drawbacks compared with

those from the 1970 survey. The main advantage is that they are from a complete census of foreign direct investment, and the number of observations is

therefore much greater. Secondly, the 1966 questionnaire was much more
detailed than the later one, a fact that permits us to measure more and

different variables. On the other hand, the 1966 census does not include as

much parent data as in 1970, or less were tabulated than in 1970. Therefore,
the capital intensity variables for 1966 could not be calculated relative to

those of parents because we lack parent data. The result is that some selection of parents may be mixed in with the adaptation by individual companies.

The labor cost coefficients in equations 2 and 3 are close to, but

a little smaller than, those of Table 6 where we used country aggregates

of affiliates. Most of the response to labor cost within industries takes
place within individual companies but there is also a tendency for firms
with low capital intensity to operate in low wage countries, reinforcing

the effects of intra—firm adaptation. Thus, we have evidence of adaptation
by the definitions of Figure 5 and of Figure 1 or Figure 6 of the
Introduction.

The scale variable proves to be highly significant and in the expected
direction for capital intensity as measured by physical plant and equipment.
That is, larger scale is associated with more capital—intensive methods of

production. But this was not true where capital intensity was measured by
total assets per worker. By that measure, larger size was associated with
lower capital intensity, although the effect was not strong when the quality—
adjusted wage was used as the labor cost measure.

The labor cost measure used here is different for each affiliate. It
is the affiliate's average wage per worker deflated by the average labor

quality of the country in which the affiliate is located. Use of the
individual firm average wage as a labor cost measure implies that, within
a country, higher wages represent higher cost for standard labor rather than

higher labor quality. If this is not the case (if internal labor markets
are competitive, for example) labor cost might be better measured by average

manufacturing affiliate wage for the country as a whole. Equations 3, 7,
and 11 of Table 8 use this labor cost measure but the results are not
consistently higher or lower labor cost coefficients than those of equations
2, 6, and 10.

* 36

—

The pooling of all industries implies that labor cost and scale
effects are identical among all of them, an assumption that we have no great

confidence in. Separate equations for the various manufacturing groups in
1970 are given in Tables 9 and 10, the former using property, plant, and
equipment as the capital measure, to give physical capital intensity, and
the latter using assets per worker, or total capital intensity.
Physical capital intensity is clearly responsive to labor cost differ-

ences. The variable is significant in 11 out of 14 equations, not counting
groups such as chemicals for which we also have subgroup equations, and the
average elasticity of substitution is about .60, very close to the estimate
from the country aggregates in Table 6.
Scale, which appeared important in the pooled data, rarely appears significant in the individual industry equations, although it is positive, as ex-

pected, where it is significant. The implication is that we were observing
an inter—industry effect in the pooled data rather than a true effect of

scale on capital intensity within industries. That possibility is suggested
also

by the fact that two of the three significant scale effects in Table 9

are for combinations of industries: other chemicals, and other non—electrical
machinery.
Somewhat surprisingly, in view of our doubts expressed earlier about
assets as a capital measure for individual affiliates, we are better able to
explain variation in total capital per wor:er than in physical capital per

worker. The levels of the

in Table 10 are substantially above those in

Table 9 and the average estimated elasticity of substitution among the signi-

ficant coefficients is also somewhat higher, at almost .70. The scale variable,

however, is negative where it is significant. Taken in conjunction with
the positive scale coefficients in equations in which physical assets alone
were the dependent variable, the negative coefficients seem to imply that
larger affiliates economize on non—physical assets per worker.
Some equations based on the 1966 data appear in Tables 11 and 12.

They differ from the 1970 equations in several respects. As mentioned
earlier, affiliate capital intensity is not calculated relative to that of
the parent, and we have omitted the equations for net property, plant and
equipment per worker because they are similar to those for gross P.P.&E.
but show slightly lower elasticities and R2s.
The impression of strong response of physical capital intensity to
labor costs from the 1966 data is quite similar to that from the 1970

survey. However, there are many more significant scale coefficients, all
positive. The main reason seems to be the use of gross rather than net
physical assets, since the equations for net property, plant, and equipment

per worker in 1966 do not show such strong scale effects. The 1970 equations
in Table 8 also showed larger scale effects when gross, rather than net,
property, plant, and equipment was used in the capital intensity measure.
As in the 1970 data, the equations using assets per worker (Table 12)
• give the highest estimates sf the elasticity of substitution and the highest
levels of a2,

the former averaging about .70. Also, there is again a strong,

although not universal, negative scale effect. The larger the affiliate the
lower the total assets per worker even though some of the same industries'
equations showed that the larger the affiliate, the higher the gross property,
plant, and equipment per worker.

The negative scale coefficients in the equations using assets per
worker as the measure of capital intensity are a surprise. There is
virtually no relationship between size of affiliate and assets per worker in
simple regressions within industries and the few significant coefficients

are split between positive and negative ones. However, there is a strong
relationship between affiliate size and gross property, plant, and equipment
per worker, and all the statistically significant coefficients are positive.
These results suggest that indivisibilities in machinery and equipment are
responsible for the relationship and that the effect of these is offset
in other types of assets.

The data for Swedish firms and their foreign affiliates differ from the

U.S. data in several respects. One

of

the chiefadvantages of the Swedish

data is that they give production, by industry, for each parent and

affiliate. We can thus distinguish industry—mix choices even within the

firm from

choices of factor proportions within an industry in a way that is

impossible with the U.S. data in which each parent and affiliate is charac-

terized by only one industry. We do this by calculating, for each parent and

affiliate, capital intensities at Swedish industry coefficients. Any differ
ence between the capital intensities of parents arid affiliates at Swedish

industry coefficients then represents a choice of industry mix, while the
difference between the actual capital intensity of an affiliate and its
calculated capital intensity at Swedish industry coefficients represents a
choice

of production methods within industry. Thus we can calculate the

affiliate's inputs at Swedish coefficients as

— 47 —

SW

m

AK E Aq i
i1

SW

and

ALSW =

SW

SW

where AK and AL

Aq1

are affiliate capital and labor inputs at Swedish industry

coefficients, Aq is the affiliate's production in industry 1, K is capital
input and LW is labor input in the domestic Swedish industry i, and

is

output in Swedish industry i. We can similarly calculate parent capital and
labor inputs at Swedish industry ratios, PKSW and PLSW, and we can compare all
of these with actual affiliate and parent inputs, AK, AL, PK, and PL.
Another advantage of these data is that both numbers and payroll are
given separately for wage and salaried workers, enabling us to calculate aver-

age earnings for each. The wage per wage worker, while not standardized for
quality, may be a little less subject to wide differences in mix than the
average wage in the U.S. figures, which lump wage and salaried workers together.
This possibility of breaking down the Swedish parents and affiliates by
industry is particularly important for our purposes because the number of
Swedish affiliates in any one industry is small, and we were therefore unable

to run separate equations for individual industries. All the equations reported on below are, therefore, pooled over all industries.
Affiliate industry mix was not explained well in any equations and in

fact, two measures of wage cost gave effects with opposite signs. When we
measured wages by money GPP per capita deflated by average quality we found
that higher wage levels were associated with less capital—intensive industries,

— 48 —

but

when we measured wages by average affiliate wage deflated by average

country labor quality, as in the equations for U.S. affiliates, we found,
as expected, that high wages were associated with more capital—intensive

industries. However, in neither case did we explain more than a very small
fraction of the industry mix variation.

When we tried to explain the adaptation of capital intensities within
industries,

the variable that seemed most effective was the ratio of real

GDP per capita to the average labor quality, a kind of labor productivity

ratio

with the labor input adjusted for quality. The variable may be a

proxy

for capital input per unit of standard labor input, in which case we

would be using something like the same variable on both sides of the equation

and the results would be meaningless. The equations were:

results as quite inconclusive as to the existence

We must describe these

Since most of the equations for Swedish data were run only in arithmetic

form, they do not yield elasticities of substitution directly and, to judge
from our experience with

between

the U.S. affiliate data, the degree of association

labor cost and capital intensity is probably understated. However,

the direction of the relationships found Is of some interest for confirming,
contradicting or supplementing, the

results

of the U.S. analysis. We can

summarize the results from equatious on Swedish affiliate data briefly as
follows:

1. Affiliates in

industries

of

low capital

intensity,

relative

to parents

tended to be in higher income countries —— Non—adaptation.

2. Parents in industries with high capital intensity tended to have
affiliates in high—income countries —— Adaptation.

3. Affiliates in industries of high skill intensity relative to parents
tended to be in high—skill countries —— Adaptation.

4. Affiliates, individually and in the agqregate, produce with hicher
capital intensity relative to parents or Swedish industry in high—
income and high—wage countries

——

Adartation.

— 50 —

5.

Affiliates use higher skill ratios relative to parents orSwedish
industry in countries whose salaried work is relatively cheap ——

Adaptation.
In all these calculations we have looked at relations among affiliates.
We can also use the affiliate data to compare affiliates in general with
their parents and with Swedish industry, taking advantage of the information
on industry composition instead of relying on the single—industry designations

as in the earlier comparisons of aggregates. For example, the average ratios
of affiliate/parent industry capital Intensities and skill intensities at
Swedish industry coefficients were:

affiliate industry mix was more ca'ital intensive than Swedish output

general

in

and very slightly more skill—Intensive. Thus there is no evidence

here of adaptation to lower labor costs outside Sweden in the form of
selection of industries.

However, the actual capital intensities of the affiliates were substantially below the Swedish and parent levels for the same industries.

used the same ratio of capital to labor as In Swedish industry

a

the

\aL /

capital intensity was 19 per cent lower. The actual parent capital

intensities, on the other hand, were slightly above those of the corresponding

Swedish industries. The affiliate capital intensities therefore represented
even a little more than the 19 per cent adaptation relative to the parent
capital intensities.
On the whole, then, the Swedish data suggest considerable adaptation
within industries between the very high labor costs in Sweden and the lower
labor costs in host countries, and between developed and less—developed

host countries. The evidence on adaptation within firms was mixed, but it
did predominantly point to some degree of adaptation to differences In
labor cost.

Adaptation as Factor Substitution
and Technology Choice
The tests of individual firm adaptation up to this point have attempted
to determine whether there was any effect of differences In labor costs on

factor proportions. Here we look at adaptation as the product of two
decisions the parent company makes about affiliate production methods. One

— 52 —

is

the choice of technology, which might be the choice of machinery or

plant design, or even of product mix, and is represented by a family of

isoquants belonging to a production function. The other is the way In
which the affiliate operates within the chosen technology, which might
include decisions regarding multi—shift operation or ancillary services,
and is represented by the choice of a location on the isoquant defining
the technology.

This conceptualization is broad enough to include all the variables

that influence the choice of factor proportions. Factor prices will
determine the factor substitution effect, i.e., the choice of location on

the isoquant. The choice of technology can be thought of as an ex—ante
decision determined not only by technological considerations but by eco-

nomic variables as well. Some of these variables are the product—mix,
the availability of skilled labor force and the scale Of production.6

6

See Roldan [19781, pp. 40—58.

Across countries these variables are assumed to be correlated with the

level of development of the country. The factor intensity technology
parameter of a production function is specified as a function of the per

capita income of the country in which the affiliate is located. The
elasticity of substitution parameter and the factor price ratio determine
the magnitude of the factor substitution effect.

The results for the predicted relative capital—labor ratios and

their component technology selection (T) and factor substitution (S)
effects are presented in Tables 13 through 16.
The main result is the opposite direction in which the technology
selection and the factor substitution effects work in all industries.
T is always less than one, meaning that the technology used by the LDC
affiliates is more capital intensive than the one used by developed

country affiliates. The situation can be represented graphically in
Figure 10, a version of Figure 3 where the isoquant representing the

LDC's affiliates technology is to the right of the one for DC
affiliates. The selection of technology effect could be represented by
the distance ab. However, the factor substitution effect from the relatively lower labor costs in LDC's will operate in the direction of using

relatively more labor than capital. This effect can be represented by
the shift from b to c in the isoquant for LDC

affiliates, and it can

be strong enough to make the capital labor ratios in use in some industries significantly higher for DC's than for LDC's affiliates.
Figure 10 has to be interpreted carefully since it is only a two—

dimensional representation of our empirical results. Failure to understand
that would lead one to conclude that country L would be better off——given

its factor price relationship (w/r)__oPeratin somewhere on the isoquant
of the DC's, instead of in the isoquant for LDC's as the graph shows.
That situation cannot materialize becau8e both the isoquants and factor

price relationships of DC's and LDC's are assoiated with different values
of variables affecting the choice of technology.

The Chemical industry and its subsections, Drugs and Industrial
Chemicals, are among the ones with higher capital labor ratios for DC.

affiliates. Since there is no selection of technology effect in these
cases, the factor substitution effect alone explains the differences
found.

The result that multinational finns use comparatively capital—

intensive technology in less developed countries is a surprise. If the
apparent choice of capital—intensive technology is genuine, it may be
that the multinational finns are selecting technologies that reduce the
need for skilled labor, scarce and expensive in LDC's, but can use large

amounts of unskilled labor where it is cheap. This choice of capital—
intensive technology may

apply

to the production process itself, but the

affiliate may find it profitable to use unskilled labor extensively in

ancillary activities. There has also been a good deal of evidence that
exchange—control regimes in some LDC's have encouraged overinvestment in
capital9 although it is not clear that such overinvestment would show up

9
See Bhagwati [1978), Chapter 5.

as choice of technology rather than factor use within a technology.
We should point out that the estimates of production functions here
are made from data that are far from ideal, and the results may at least
reflect the compromises made necessary by data inadequacies rather than

the realities of technological choice. One problem is that our measures
of technology and factor use are identical——both being capital 8tock per

worker. That fact alone causes difficulties in making the distinction

— 63

—

we are aiming at. Furthermore, the industries we deal with are very
broad and it is likely that the nature of the activity differs substan—

tially from country to country. The return to capital is calculated as
the ratio of nonwage value added to the stock of capital and therefore
suffers from all the defects of the value added including that mentioned
in Appendix A and also the many vagaries of corporate accounting methods
aimed

at minimizing the tax burden. The estimates of labor cost, presumably

far more reliable than the figures on returns to capital, are subject to
the

problem of our inability to distinguish among types of labor and

therefore

to distinguish those differences in payroll per worker that

represent differences in quality from those that represent differences
in the price of labor of some standard quality.

Choice of Factor Intensities by
Multinationals and Host—Country Firms
Even if there is considerable adaptation among affiliates to
differences in labor cost, U.S.—owned or other foreign—owned affiliates might

fall short of the labor intensity of local firms. The affiliates might
enjoy lower costs of capital than native firms through their parents' access

to capital markets, particularly developed country capital markets. They
might face a need to pay higher wages than native firms because of host—

country government or union rules. Even if factor prices were identical
to those paid by native firms, the foreign affiliate may select a more
capital—intensive technology than a native firm because the foreign parent
may be familiar with such technology from its home environiient and find the

costs of adapting the technology uneconomically high. In this section we
attempt to measure the differences in capital intensities between U.S.
affiliates and host—country firms.

— 64 —

Since our source of U.S. data for the previous section did not cover
host—country firms other than affiliates, other sources had to be used.
These did not provide data on individual firms, but only on aggregates by
industry within each country, and the affiliate data were therefore aggre-

gated to the same level for comparison. Country data were derived from
the Growth of World Industry reports of the United Nations and from other
sources.

10

The fact that each country's report has its peculiarities

10

See Roldan [19781, ippendix I, Sections 2 and 3.

with respect to definitions, coverage, etc. may introduce some biases in
our analysis.

We make our comparisons between affiliates and host—country firms.
The alternative would have been to compare affiliates with the domestic
sector of the industry, defined as host country data minus affiliate data.
We felt, however, that the first alternative would avoid the mixing of

information obtained from different sources. Most of the variables used
in the analysis are ratios of original categories of information (for
example, the wage rate is calculated in our study as a ratio of payroll to
employment, both of which are obtained from the same original country source)
and a number of measurement errors are more likely to cancel out if the

information comes from a common source. Thus, the conclusions of this
section viii deal basically with differences in factor intensities between
affiliates and host—country firms instead of domestic firms, although
inferences with respect to the last ones can be easily made.

— 65 —

Information

on capital stock by host—country and industry is not

available, precluding a direct comparison of capital—labor ratios between

and U.S. affiliates. The method followed here involves

host—country firms

obtaining estimates for these capital—labor ratios by means

of

a produc-

tion function approach. The available data allow the calculation of the
price response (elasticity of substitution) and the factor intensity

parameter of the technology. These two parameters, given the knowledge
of

the factor prices paid by affiliates and host—country firms, will be

enough to calculate
method,

estimates of the factor intensities. This indirect

however, does not solve all the problems. In particular, the

exclusion

of the rental cost of capital from the regressions, because of

the lack of host—country data, introduces some estimate biases that need
to

be considered to assess the nature of the results obtained.
The regression model used in the following analysis is limited to

the CES production

function to allow for the possibility that elasticities

substitution could be different beteen affiliates and host—country

firms.
Let us assume a CES production function,

V = A

(sK + (l-s) LP)V/P

(13)

where V is value added, K denotes capital stock and L employment. The

parameters A, s, , and v correspond to the efficiency, factor
intensity, substitution and scale parameters, respectively. Let w and
r be the wage rate and the rental cost per unit of capital respectively.

In the process, the scale parameter has dropped outs meaning

that condition (14)is independent of the degree of returns to scale.
From (14) it is clear how s is the capital intensity parameter: given

a factor price ratio and the value for the elasticity of substitution
(denominated as c

hereafter), the

larger s is, the larger K/L will be.

The factor intensity of the technology described by the CES production

The variable for product price that should have entered as a divisor
in the term for labor costs has been omitted because we lack information.
The bias introduced by this omission will be positive if prices and wages
are positively correlated across countries.
The empirical analysis has been conducted for the industries and years
for which a relatively large number of matching observations could be
obtained from country sources and the U.S. Department of Commerce surveys
of direct investment abroad (see Table 17).

The results for the estimation of the elasticities of substitution
for affiliates and host—country firms are presented in Table 17, along
with results of the Chow test to determine whether the functions differ

between country and affiliate data. In eight out of the ten equations the

estimates for the elasticity of substitution are higher for the
affiliate data than for country data. This result could be taken as

Table 18 presents for some industries estimates of the elasticity
of substitution obtained with specification (16). These estimates
differ as expected from the ones obtained with equation (20) because of
the different biases they are subject to.
Tables 17 and 18 suggest that, a) estimates for equation (16) are
lower than those for equation (20) for the same industries and, b) that

elasticities of substitution estimated from affiliate data are higher
than those from country data.

The

direction of the biases will be determined by the correlation

between in w and in r for equation (16) and in w and in p for equation (20).
Rental

cost of capital figures are not available for country data, nor

prices for either data set, but for affiliates we found that the
cost of capital was not statistically different between developed

product
rental

and less developed countries, while wages differed between

them.

The assumption that rental cost of capital is constant for affiliates,
with wages varying across countries, implies that product prices must vary

as wages do. In other words we can assume that prices and wages are
positively correlated for the affiliate, while wages and rental cost are

not correlated at all. Thus the affiliate elasticity estimates given by
equation (16) would
would

be

unbiased while the ones given by equation (20)

be biased upwards.
As for the country firms, the very limited information given by

Minhas [1963) on rates of returns for various industries in U.S., Canada,
U.K., Japan and India suggests that in Japan and India, rates of return
were larger or at least equal to those in the U.S., Canada and U.K., with

the exception of the Non—Electrical Machinery Industry. This Is obviously

not

hard evidence, but in absence of other alternatives, we can interpret

it as suggesting that lower wages across countries are accompanied by

higher rates of return. In other words, the correlation between r and w
is negative, implying a downward bias in the equation (16) elasticity

estimate for the country data. How prices are correlated with wages in
a cross—country sample is not clear from the above since higher costs of

capital are offset by lower wages. An hypothesis is that at the country
level, prices are correlated with wages. A country with higher wages
presumably has a higher standard of living and an output composition
for a given industry with a larger share of more sophisticated and

expensive goods. This hypothesis implies that the elasticity of substitution estimates from equation (20) for country data will be upwardly

biased, as the estimates for the affiliate data are. Although we lack
information on the extent of these biases the fact that they work in the
same direction for equation (20) reinforces the presumption that the
elasticities of substitution for host—country firms and affiliates do
not differ.

Differences in capital—labor ratios. There are at least
two

alternative

ways to proceed to the calculation of capital—labor

ratios starting from specification (16). The first is to run separate
regressions for affiliate and country data. A Chow test would indicate
whether the regressions are significantly different or not. If the
regressions are shown to be statistically different, we can proceed to
introduce the point estimates of the parameters for affiliates and country

data in expression (17) to calculate k/k and the technology (T) and
substitution (S) effects. If the parameters for the affiliates and host—

— 75

country

—

firms are similar, the ratio k/k will correspond to the substi-

tution effect S given in expression (19), with

—

The common

value for a can be taken from the estimate of the pooled affiliate and
host—country regression.

The results for these calculations are given in Tables 18 and 19.
The poor fit of equation (16) shows in that estimates were obtained only

for five industries. The Chow test in Table 18 shows that for two cases
the functions are statistically different. For these two industries,
Table 19 shows the choice of technology effect T smaller than 1, meaning
that affiliates use a more labor—intensive technology than host—country
firms.

However, the factor substitution effect S is larger than 1 for two

reasons. First, the value of the point estimates for the elasticity
of substitution appears to be higher for affiliates than for host—country
firms

(0.41

versus 0.37 for Food Products and 067 versus 0.37 for Other

Chemicals). Second, affiliates face higher wages on average: $3,260 for
affiliates

versus $2,031 for host—country firms in the Food industry,

and $4,723 versus $3,330 in the Other Chemicals industry (Table 20).

As Table 19 shows, this brings ka/kc close to 1 for the Food Products
industry.

Thus the equation predicts that on the average, affiliates will

country firms. In three other industries shown in Table 19, for which
the Chow test shows the functions do not differ significantly between
affiliates and host countries, the substitution effect S, and hence
is larger than 1, reflecting the fact that affiliates pay higher wages on
average than host—country firms.

The second alternative way of calculating the ka/kc ratios
is to assume from the start that the elasticities of substitution of

affiliates and host country firms are similar. This similarity has
been suggested above, in the section analyzing this parameter. This
assumption is equivalent to assuming that the only difference between
the affiliate and host country production function can arise from

the factor intensity parameter. We can proceed to test the difference
between the two production functions by introducing a dummy variable

in the pooled regression of affiliates and host countries. The cast

utilize tecnnologies of capital intensity lesser than or equal to that of
host—country firms. This conclusion is also supported by Table 19, where
the estimates for T are very similar, and by the Leipziger [

study.

With

respect to the elasticities of substitution, the main result

appears to be the absence of statistically significant differences in the

estimates. Although the magnitude of the biases to which those estimates

could be subject might affect this conclusion, we have pointed out that at
least in one of the estimation equations (equation (20)) the direction of

the biases that could be present are similar for both data set. This fact
would tend to further support the notion of similarity of the elasticities
of substitution between affiliates and host—country firms.

When predicted differences in factor intensities are viewed as the
product of a choice of technology effect and a factor substitution effect,

multinational firm affiliates are shown to utilize technologies of lesser

or equal capital intensity than host—country firms. However, the substitution effect is always larger than 1, making affiliates relatively more
capital intensive than host—country firms, given the common (or larger
for the affiliates) value for the elasticity of substitution, and more

importantly, the higher wages paid by affiliates. Thus the higher estimated
capital intensities of affiliates are attributed entirely to higher wages

and, in a few cases, higher elasticities of substitution, but not at all
to their choice of technology.

Results of Other Studies
The study most similar to ours was that of Courtney and Leipziger

(1975] who used the same data on U.S. affiliates abroad. As already noted,
their study concentrated on the issue of separating observed differences
in capital intensity between affiliates in developed countries and those
in

LDC's

choice

into

the unobserved differences in the

of technology (k1 and k2), or "ex ante substitution" in their terms,

— 83 —

and the unobserved substitution within the chosen technology (k2 and k3),
or "ex post substitution." Courtney and Leipziger assumed two technologies in each industry, one for developed country affiliates and one for
affiliates in LDC's, instead of the many that we allowed for.
-

Their

results contained some of the same puzzling findings as those

of our production functions. They found significant differences in technology
between affiliates in developed countries and those in LDC'S in 6 out of 11
industries and in three of these it was the affiliates in LDC's that were

using the more capital—intensive technology: that is, they were using, by
the authors' interpretation, more capital-intensive plant designs. However,
the response to lower labor costs in LDC's was so large that even industries
using more capital—intensive technologies in LDC's ended up with comparatively

labor—intensive production there. Since the most capital—intensive technologies in LDC's, relative to developed countries, were associated with the
highest elasticities of substitution, there Is a question, as in our own
results, as to whether the authors were really successful in separating the
choice of technology or plant design from the response to factor prices.
Other studies of factor use in multinational firms' operations in LDC.'s

have been mainly case studies of particular industries or groups of plants.
On the whole, the results have been inconclusive, with some reporting exten-

sive adaptation and others virtually none. Since adaptation is not always
clearly defined, or the definitions differ among studies, and since most
studies refer to narrow segments of industry, It is not certain whether
they contradict each other or simply observe actual differences in behavior
among industries or countries.

— 84 —

A study by Morley and Smith [1974] examined the choice of technology

by multinational firms

in

Brazil, largely on the basis of interviews and

the authors' views rather than any substantial statistical evidence on the

operation of plants. Their main conclusion was that there were very large
differences in technology between the U.S. firms at home and their af fill—

ates in Brazil. However, they explained the difference as an adaptation
to differences in the scale of production rather than in relative factor

prices. They argued that the production function is not homothetic and
that at any factor prices small—scale production would be relatively labor
intensive and large—scale production capital intensive.
It is worth mentioning that a major role for scale in determining
factor proportions does not preclude a role for factor costs in adaptation
even if there is no response to factor prices at a given level of produc-

tion. It may be only the cheapness of labor in LDC's that permits the
existence of small, labor—intensive plants which could not survive in the

high labor—cost environment of the developed countries. The amount of
protection required to sustain small—scale, labor—intensive production
may be much less in an LDC, with low wages, than in a developed country

with its high wage levels. The adaptation by multinational firms may thus
be attributable to both the smallness of LDC markets and the low labor
costs.

Examples of adaptation in the sense of both selection of stages of
production and selection of production techniques were found in a study

by Finan (1975] of U.S. direct investment and technology transfer in the

semi—conductor industry. American firms tended to place the labor—intensive
assembly stage of production in low—wage foreign countries, while confining

the more capital—intensive and technology—intensive wafer fabrication stage

— 85

to

—

the United States and to affiliates in developed countries. However,

within the assembly

stage,

production was more capital—intensive in the

United States than abroad. A substantial number of automated assembly
lines were in operation in the United States, but none in foreign operations.

Cohen [1975], in a study of foreign— and locally—owned plants in
Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore, not identified by industry, found the
foreign firms more mechanized than local firms in Taiwan but not consistently SO

in the other two countries. No generalization seems possible from the data
he presents. Outside of his sample of firms supplying statistical data on
mechanization, he reported his impression that General Electric and Philips
were more capital—intensive than local firms in radio manufacturing, although

Philips did adapt somewhat to local conditions. National Semiconductor and
Texas Instruments were producing integrated circuits using very automated
techniques in these countries, a fact that he interprets as lack of adaptation although he presents no comparison with home country methods of production.
The finding from his questionnaires that there was little or no difference
between foreign and locally—owned firms in several industries presumably implies
adaptation by the foreign—owned firms relative tc their

In

a study comparing 14 U.S.—owned operations with locally—owned

counterparts spread over nine industries in the Philippines and Mexico
Mason [1971] found that U.S. firms used more total capital assets and more

buildings but nor more equipment per employee than local firms. By measures
of the flow of capital and labor services the difference was not significant,
although it was in the expected direction.

— 86 —

Wells (1975), comparing foreign—owned with domestically—owned
plants in Indonesia, reported that the former almost all used what he

classified as "capitalintenaive" technology, and the latter almost all
"intermediate"

or "labor—intensive" technology. No ratios of capital to

labor input were used, but

the differences to presumably lower capital costs and much

wages for the foreign companies. The wage differences, for

"comparable jobs...in each industry," were particularly striking between
foreign

and domestic firm costs of unskilled labor, with the foreign

firms paying wages about 2 1/2 times those of private domestic firms.
Conclusions

The purpose of our investigation was

to learn whether multinational

firms responded to differences among countries in labor cost by using more

labor—intensive methods of production in low—wage countries. We found that
for both Swedish and U.S. multinational firms, parent company or home country
capital intensities of production, as measured by total assets per worker or
by fixed assets alone, were higher than those of affiliates in developed
countries and

that these in turn were higher than those of affiliates in

less developed countries. These differences were not the result of industry
selection; in fact in some cases It was capital—intensive industries which
tended

to invest

abroad, particularly in less developed countries.

Among countries in which affiliates were located, higher labor costs
were associated with higher capital intensities of affiliates in the aggre-

gate for all manufacturing and within manufacturing industries. Some of

— 87 —

the relation for manufacturing as a group represented a tendency for af fill—
ates in labor—intensive industries to settle in low—wage countries but the
main element was the relation of capital intensity to wage levels within
industries.

Within individual companies there is again a strong effect of labor

cost on capital intensity. Some of the intra—industry effect noted above
was the result of selection among companies, more labor—intensive companies

being more attracted to low—wage countries. However, the main intra—industry
effect was the result of adaptation within companies. We also found, in
the data for individual companies, a strong effect of scale of operations
on capital intensity when that was defined as property, plant and equipment

per worker. Scale had very little effect, and sometimes a negative one,
on capital intensity measured by total assets per worker.
We attempted with the use of fitted production functions to separate
capital intensity differences among affiliates into differences in the choice
of technology and those in the method of operation within each technology.
We found that multinational firms appeared to choose more capital—intensive

technologies in low income countries but then to operate them in a more labor—
Intensive manner than in higher—income countries to such a degree as to more

than offset the capital intensity of the technology itself. This choice seems
paradoxical and we are far from certain as to our ability to distinguish
between technology choices and

methods of operation within any technology.

This is especially true because we are operating with data not collected
with a view to making such distinctions.

— 88 —

Our attempt to use production function8 to study differences between
U.S. affiliates and native firms

in

host countries produced similarly

surprising results. U.S. affiliates were found to use technologies of the
same capital intenaity as native firms or even lower capital Intensity.
They nevertheless operated in a more capital—intensive way, partly because
their elasticities of substitution were higher than those of native firms
but mainly because they faced higher labor costs.

APPENDIX A
Effect of Protection on Measured Economies
of Scale When Value Added is Used as the Production Measure

The observed value added V equals the true value added \/

(value of services of production factors measured at zero effective

protection level) plus a surplus derived from protection. We chose

to describe it here as TV, where I is the rate of effective
protection, i.e.,

V = V(l÷T)

Since the level of protection can be assumed to influence the
employment of capital or labor, the error term will be correlated with
the independent variables giving rise to a simultaneous equation type
of bias.

The expression for the bias can be obtained as follows. In

tion form (so we can ignore the constant term) as
