HOW IMPORTANT IS DISAGGREGATION IN STRUCTURAL MODELS OF INTEREST
RATE DETERMINATION?

Benjamin M. Fnedman*
A rapidly developing literature is currently investigating the determination of interest rates through the
conceptual approach of the structural model.' In brief,
a structural model of asset prices (yields) is simply the
combination of a representation of investors' demand
for securities and a representation of borrowers' (or
equity issuers') supply of securities, together with a

market clearing condition. Such a model stands in

contrast to the traditional approach of modeling interest rate determination using an unrestricted reducedform equation with the particular interest rate in ques-

tion as the dependent variable. Since the structural
model's implied expression for the interest rate is (except for any nonlinearities) a reduced-form equation
that is restricted by the underlying asset demand and
supply equations, the distinction between the struc-

have typically done so within the context of at least
some sectoral disaggregation, estimating several component demand and supply relationships for any one
asset. This popularly presumed connection with sectoral disaggregation has led many economists to avoid
the structural modeling approach, as small-model enthusiasts have shunned estimating so many sectoral
equations, forecasters have despaired of formulating
priors for future values of so many "exogenous" sectoral variables, and some economists have even rejected a priori the notion that sectoral detail matters
for macroeconomic outcomes.3
The presumption of any necessary connection between structural interest rate modeling and sectoral
disaggregation, however, is simply false. The structural versus reduced-form choice, and the aggregated

tural and the traditional approaches is essentially versus disaggregated choice, are separate issues.
equivalent to the difference between restricted and While a structural model may incorporate sectoral deunrestricted estimation.2
A frequently expressed reservation about the structural modeling approach is that, while it is sound in
principle, it is useful only in the context of a detailed
sectoral disaggregation which creates added work in
model-building and near impossibilities in forecasting
applications. One of the key advantages of the struc-

tural approach is indeed the facility it provides for
incorporating information pertinent to heterogeneous
groups whose behavior may differ because of any of a
number of economic or institutional factors. Hence, to
date, economists who have developed this approach

Applied to the familiar question of the determination of
long-term interest rates given short-term rates, for ex-

ample, the structural model need do no more than
replace the traditional single term- structure equation
with one aggregate demand equation and one aggregate supply equation for long-term securities (plus the
market clearing condition). At the aggregate level,
therefore, the cost at which the modeler or forecaster
need buy the advantages of the structural approach is
just the replacement of one estimated equation by two.
The results presented below demonstrate that the
structural modeling approach to interest rate determi-

nation not only stands apart from the sectoral disaggregation question conceptually but also performs
fairly well without sectoral disaggregation empirically.
