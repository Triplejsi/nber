A Model of Diffusion in the Production of an Innovation

Summary

This paper is an attempt to explain diffusion in the production of an

innovation. Diffusion in production is defined as the increase in number
of producers, or net entry, in the market for a new product.

It is to be

distinguished from the more familiar problem in the literature on technical
change, namely, the diffusion among

producers

in the use of new products and,

hence, of changes in production processes for "old" products (or services).

The empirical results confirm that a simple model —
number of variables ——

is

simple in tenus of

sufficient to explain most of diffusion in the

duction of an innovation. The principal variable that explains

pro-

diffusion of

entry is the demonstration effect. The principal variable that retards entry
is the accumulated experience and goodwill of existing firms. A limiting

force is the population of potential entrants. None of these variables
appears to lend itself readily to influence by public policy.
The first stage in diffusion ——

the

Interval from first commercial

introduction of the product to entry by competitors ——

varies

greatly in

duration. Institutional variables, including public policy, may

have

a greater

impact on the length of this first stage, which is not covered by this study,
than

on

the diffusion process in the periods examined in this paper.

—6—

We have now specified the demonstration effect as controlling perceptions
of risk and we have specified our proxy for transitory disequilibrium.

Next,

consider the attributes of existing firms in the market and of the population of

potential entrants. As a simplification, and in the absence of contrary information, we assume that both sets of firms are drawn from a coimnon universe except

with respect to one class of attributes. Existing firms will have accumulated
over the period they have been in the market a stock of knowledge and experience,
of human capital that is not rapidly reproducible, and of goodwill in the market.
Consequently, they have an advantage over new entrants which is an increasing
function of the accumulated volume of past production (and sales). We approximate
the effect of such accumulated experience by

Eq1/Zq where Eq_1 is the

accumulated aggregate output from the initial introduction of the product to t—l.
It is deflated by

the accumulated aggregate output to the end of the

interval covered by our data to permit the use of pooled cross—section as well
as time—series data.

The effect of accumulated experience

will, ceteris paribus, steadily increase

over time until it becomes a prohibitive barrier to entry for most firms. However
the faster the rate of technical change in production processes or products, the
less is the relevance of past experience for the future, and the higher the
technical change in products the smaller is the effect of accumulated goodwill.
A proxy for technical change should therefore have a positive sign in our model.
To conclude the discussion of gross entry, we specify that the population of

potential entrants, ,

is

proportional to the number of firms in the host industry

of the product innovation. Implicit in this is the assumption there are
technological and marketing linkages among product markets in the same industry.
It further assumes the size of the population of firms technically equipped to
enter an industry (though not already in it) is related to the number of firms

Obviously, there will be instances of exit arising from unique

cumstances such as the retirement of an

produce a product that appeals to end users. But how important these

firms to

special circumstances are is an empirical question to be tested indirectly by
the adequacy of the general variables as explanations of the relevant phenomenon.

To test our hypotheses on exit, we employed a method first developed by Solow.1

$a].y, we constructed a number of hypothetical series of expected output and
pric, by the model of adaptive expectations. The model specifies that

we took two—year averages of the error rates in expectations as well as the

decisions, but partly also to differentiate between immediate (short—run) and

lagged (long—run) effects. Accordingly we used q for output (or p for price)

Data
The sample of product innovations was selected from a set of forty—six
product histories developed in connection with a related research project.2 Of
the forty—six, only six had data on output, prices, number of firms, and

patents, over the entire period necessary for our analysis.
Our method of analysis involves tKe pooling of cross—section and

time—series data

so that complete, or almost complete, histories were essential.

Information on number of firma was obtained from Thomas'

Register

Manufactures,. supplemented by correspondence with industry experts and

of American

by

a

variety of other trade sources. Annual data on the number of patents issued for
each product were obtained from the United States Patent Office. Data on prices
and output were derived from a variety of government and private sources,

including trade publications and information provided by companies in the relevant
product markets. Counts of product and process improvements subsequent to the

initial introduction of each of the six products were also derived from a wide
variety of published and unpublished sources, including product histories
provided by individual companies. N was based on data from the Census of Manufactures for 1947, 1954, 1958, and 1963.

As previously noted, the period chosen for each of the six products,
encompassed the interval from take—off in entry or the time when the complete

errors in output expectations and a much faster adjustment, A —

errors in price expectations. The reversal of signs on current and lagged errors
in expectations is, a priori, plausible. Greater expected than realized values
reflect optimism and, in the short run, should not lead to exit. It takes time
for disappointments to take their effect on decisions to leave the market.

Among the negative results, dynamic adjustment costs leading to disequilibria——
at least to the extent that this variable can be measured by the growth rate in
output per firm——did not have a statistically significant effect on entry.

Neither did the proxies for rate of technical. change. In the case of the

annual volume of patenting, the deficiency is in the choice of proxy. The number
of

patents does not capture

technological change for two reasons: first, impor-

The positive results appear to be quite robust in the sense that minor

changes in either the list of variables (as indicated in Table 1) or the choice
of a lag (to conserve space, results using alternative lags are not shown) do
not

markedly change th. a's and 8's.

Similarly, the use of alternative speed

of adjustment coefficients for expectation errors, while it reduces the R2, does
not, in moat instances, change the signs or the statistical significance of the

key variables. In contrast,

stituted

if inequality constrained least squares is sub-

by ordinary least squares estimation——a procedure we have indicated is

inappropriate——the results are materially affected.

Pinally, a question might be raised whether, because of unidentified
structural changes, net entry declines simply as the time approaches the point
at which the number of

producers is at a historical peak. Using T as the

symbol for that point, we added T—t to the list of variables in the model
specified by equation (10). The

explaining

additional variable contributed nothing to

net entry and, in fact, R2 adjusted for degrees of freedom declined.

Conclusions

The empirical results confirm that a simple model—simple in terms of
number of variables——is sufficient to explain most of the phenomenon of diffusion

in the production of an innovation. The principal variable that explains
diffusion of entry is the demonstration effect. The principal variable that
retards entry and finally brings it to an end is the accumulated experience and

goodwill of existing firms, operating as a barrier to entry. A limiting force
is the population of potential entrants approximated by the number of firms in
the host industry of a product innovation (minus, of course, the number that

have already entered). None of these variables appears to lend itself readily
to influence by public policy.

Our study begins with the point in time corresponding to entry by the

first

competitors of the

initial innovators. The first stage——the interval

from first commercial introduction of the product to entry by competitors—
varies greatly in duration. It may

well be

that institutional variables,

including public policy, have a greater impact on the length of this

stage than on

the diffusion process

in the

first

periods icmined in this paper.
