Capital Taxation and Accumulation
in a Life Cycle Growth Model
By LAWRENCE H. SLJMMERS*

Almost all of the serious economic work
on savings decisions within the past decade
has relied on some variant of the life cycle
hypothesis in which savings arise out of individual choices of an optimum lifetime consumption path. This paper reexamines the
incidence and welfare consequences of capital

income taxes within a realistic life cycle
model. The results suggest that the elimination of capital income taxation would have
very substantial economic effects. For example, a complete shift to consumption taxation
might raise steady-state output by as much
as 18 percent, and consumption by 16 percent. The long-run welfare gain from such a
shift would for plausible parameter values
exceed $150 billion annually. Stated somewhat differently, shifting to consumption
taxation would raise the lifetime utility of the
representative consumer by the equivalent of
about six years' income in the new steady
state. These estimates dwarf estimates of the
static welfare cost of taxation, and significantly exceed even extreme previous estimates of the dynamic loss.
This study departs from earlier analyses of

the effects of taxes on capital income in
several respects. Probably the most im-

savings are very interest elastic. This implies
that shifting away from capital income taxation would significantly increase capital formation, making possible long-run increases
in consumption.

Many studies of the welfare effects of
capital income taxation have ignored the
general equilibrium effects of increased
capital formation. In an economy with life
cycle savings, there is no presumption that
the undistorted growth path corresponds to

any sort of social optimum. As Peter
Diamond has shown, life cycle savings can
lead to a steady-state capital intensity either
greater or less than the Golden Rule level.
More generally, it is clear that there is no
reason to believe that a life cycle economy
will maximize any particular intertemporal
social welfare function. A fundamental tenet
of welfare evaluation is that preexisting distortions must be considered in evaluating the
consequences of tax changes. The results presented in this paper take explicit account of
the nonoptimal character of the no-tax steady
state. This explains in large part why such a

sizeable welfare effect of capital taxes is
found. In an economy far from the Golden

Rule level of capital intensity, there are sub-

parameter. This parameter is also central to
questions ranging from the potency of monetary policy to the appropriate discount rate
on public investments projects.' Both empirical and theoretical considerations have led
most economists to conclude that the interest
sensitivity of aggregate savings is likely to be

quite small. This section examines the implications of the well-known life cycle hypothesis for the interest elasticity of aggre-

gate savings. It is shown that the theory
when formulated realistically implies interest
elasticities well in excess of unity.
Most commonly, the impact of capital in-

come taxes has been considered within a
two-period framework, in which all income is
received within the first period.2 That is, the
representative individual is assumed to maxi-

mize an mtertemporal utility function of the
form U(C1, C2) subject to a lifetime budget
constraint:

where W1 represents labor income in the first

period. It can be shown3 that the interest
elasticity of savings depends on the elasticity

of substitution between present and future
consumption. If the elasticity is greater than
one, savings respond positively to the interest rate, while an elasticity less than one

are independent of the interest rate. Sinct
the last case seems reasonable, and theor)
does not offer an unambiguous verdict or

the sign of the interest effect, it is frequenti)

held that savings are likely to be interest

insensitive. This notion is supported by verba

reference to conflicting substitution and in
come effects. Martin Feldstein (1978) ha
shown that in a two-period setting, savingt
may be usefully viewed as expenditure or
future consumption. The case where saving

are insensitive to the interest rate occurt
when the price elasticity of demand for fu
ture consumption is one.

The usual two-period formulation of thi
savings decision obscures two importani
aspects of reality. In all modem theories,
saving is carried on to provide for futur
consumption. All savings are eventually dis

saved. Net positive savings arise only be

cause the young who save are more afflueni
and numerous than retired dissavers. In ordei

to realistically model the determination o

net savings, it is necessary to take account ol
the dissaving of older generations. This is not
usually done in two-period formulations ol

as equivalent to the choice of C,.
The second difficulty with the usual two

period formulation is that it obscures thi

role of future labor income. In a multiperioc

setting, the endowment W, in equation (l

reason to expect interest rate effects in usual
empirical specifications to differ from those

rate changes exert their effect in part through
changes in wealth, this procedure is likely to

obscure the impact of interest rates. The

It is widely believed that taxation of labor

of tax collection is very different under wage

taxation is optimal, replacing capital taxes
with taxes on labor income may not be de-

sirable.
The sense in which consumption and labor
income taxation are equivalent is easily dem-

onstrated by specifying the individual's
budget constraint in each case. With wage
taxation the budget constraint is

where t is the ad valorem tax rate on consumption. It is apparent that if t =1L' the
two tax regimes offer consumers equivalent

choice sets, and, in a present value sense,
raise equal revenues. Since consumers have
the same opportunity set, they will choose
the same optimal consumption path under
each regime. It is in this restricted sense that
wage and consumption taxes may be said to
be equivalent.
In a life cycle setting, savings arise because

S=(1â€”tL)+rA,â€”C,

Quite clearly there is no reason why these
expressions need be equal period by period.
Consumption taxation extracts revenue later
in the individual's lifetime than does wage
taxation and so causes more savings in the
younger years. The difference in the aggregate savings rate between the two types of
taxes depends on the age structure of the
population. But it is clear from (10) and (11)

that there is no a priori reason to expect
equal savings rates.

Equations (9) and (10) illustrate an im-

portant property of consumption taxation. It
is completely neutral with respect to the sav-

ings rate. It is clear from (9) that for any

path Ce/I â€” will be the same for any value
of t. This implies, using (10), that savings at
all ages and hence aggregate savings are also

unaffected by the tax rate. Equation (11)
shows that this property does not hold for
taxes on wage income, since the time path of
savings is altered. In fact, as the results in the
next section demonstrate, wage taxation significantly reduces capital intensity relative to
consumption taxation.

rate of population growth. As long as r>n,
the government can meet its budget constraint, and reduce the present value of the
taxes each individual must pay by postponing the extraction of taxes. As noted above,
consumption taxes postpone tax payments
relative to wage taxes. Hence, with consump-

steady-state present value of taxes paid by
the representative individual.
Feldstein (1978b) has observed that wage
and consumption taxes involve quite different transition paths. To see this, consider the

sudden imposition of a consumption tax.
Consumers of all ages are equally affected.
On the other hand, imposition of a wage tax
has no effect on the retired segment of the
population. Loosely speaking, the consumption tax is less burdensome on workers in the
steady state, because it taxes more heavily
those who are alive at the moment when it is
imposed.

Ill. Steady-State Comparisons
of Tax Alternatives

In this section, the effect of replacing
capital income taxes with wage and consumption taxes is examined by comparing
steady states. In order to make a general
equilibrium comparison of tax alternatives, it

is necessary to join a production side to the
life cycle savings model examined in the first
section. James Tobin and Robert Hall have
shown this can be done diagramatically.
Above, it was shown that life cycle savings

gives rise to a savings-labor income ratio
which is a function of the interest rate. Under the steady-state assumption, this can be
readily converted into a capital-labor income
ratio by dividing by the growth rate. This is
represented by the SS curve in Figure 1. The
production function also implies a relationship between the capital-labor income ratio
and the interest rate. This is plotted as PP in
Figure 1. (In the Cobb-Douglas case it is a
rectangular hyperbola.) In the no-capital tax
case, equilibrium occurs where the curves
cross. Now consider the effect of imposing a
tax on capital income. This drives a wedge
between the gross interest rate determined by

the production function and the net rate
received by savers. The new equilibrium occurs where the difference between the interest rate along the PP and SS curves is equal
to the tax. It is clear from the figure that as

long as savings respond positively to the

interest rate, imposition of a capital tax raises

the gross return and reduces the net return
on capital. Hence capital taxes will be partially but not completely shifted,

and the production function.
In calculating the effects of tax changes, it

is necessary to make assumptions about
parameter values. The parameters of the savings function are the same as those assumed

above. In the results reported below, logarithmic utility (y=0) is assumed. As will be
shown, the main conclusions are not sensitive to this assumption. Tax changes are
analyzed with elasticities of substitution in
production of 1 and 1/2.14 In each case,
parameters of the production function were
chosen so that the capital share was .25. The
appropriate value of the tax rates is not easy
to determine. The capital tax is presumed to

represent the combined effect of corporate
taxes, individual income taxes on dividends
and interest income, and property taxes. Re'4These numbers represent bounds on the true elasticity. Cross-section estimates typically imply that a is

is close to the historical rate.

The shift away from capital taxation has

very substantial effects. In the Cobb-Douglas

case, steady-state income rises by about 14
percent if wage taxation is used and 18 per.

cent with consumption taxation. The increase in income occurs because the high

interest elasticity of savings leads to a large

increase in capital intensity. Indeed the

capital-output ratio rises by almost 75 percent in the consumption tax solution. This
increase drives down the gross return on

capital from 10.5 to 6.1 percent. Conse-

quently the owners of capital do not benefit
greatly from the removal of the capital tax.

On the other hand, the increase in capital

intensity raises the gross wage. The increase
'51t is the effective marginal rate which is at issue
here. This will depend critically on the method of financing of marginal investment. Joseph Stigjitz has
argued that complete debt financing at the margin would

imply a zero effective rate. This view has been challenged by Feldstein, Jerry Green, and Sheshinski, among
others.

taxes are replaced by the payroll tax.
Since the gross rate of return in the equilibnum with capital taxes is well above the
Golden Rule level, steady-state consumption
is increased as capital intensity rises. When

capital taxes are replaced by wage taxes,

consumption rises by 14.2 percent, while it
rises by 17.1 percent with consumption taxes.

Of course these gains cannot be interpreted
as a measure of the steady-state welfare increment from eliminating capital taxes. The
appropriate criterion is the utility of thtrepresentative individual.

Welfare V can be compared across alternative steady-state paths. However, in order to
yield a meaningful result, it is necessary to
express the welfare difference in operational

units. This may be done most easily by
calculating the percentage change in lifetime
earnings in the base steady state which would

be necessary to yield the welfare level
reached in the altered steady state. To do
this, it is necessary to solve the equation:

These large gains are smaller than the gains

ficiency advantages of consumption taxation

in steady-state consumption shown in the
top half of the table. This is because the
increase in the net interest rate leads individ-

uals to consume later in their lifetimes, reducing the increases in welfare. There are
two reasons why the welfare gain tends to be
smaller for lower values of y. First, a lower
value of y implies a lower savings elasticity,

and hence less gain from approaching the

Golden Rule. Second, a small 1' implies only

a small distortion of the shape of the consumption path.

A very surprising feature of the results is
the large difference in steady state welfare
between consumption and wage taxes. For
example, in the Cobb-Douglas y 0 case, the
steady-state gain in welfare arising from
shifting from labor to consumption taxation
approaches $100 biffion a year. The greater
welfare under consumption taxes occurs for
two reasons. As noted in the previous section, capital intensity is higher with consumption taxes, which raises welfare by mak-

ing possible a higher level of steady-state
consumption. The second reason is probably

more important. Consumption taxation re-

The calculations presented here indicat
that partial equilibrium calculations of th4
welfare consequences of capital taxes an
likely to be very misleading. Such calcula
tions focus on the welfare loss which take
place because the taxation of interest distort
the shape of the consumption profile. Th

results here indicate this effect is of oni'

minimal importance. Since in a realistic lifi
cycle model, savings are very interest elastic

changes in capital taxes have only a smal
effect on the net interest rate. Thus partial
equilibrium analysis by assuming a constan
gross interest rate greatly overstates the im
portance of intertemporal substitution ef
fects.

The important effect of removing capita
taxes on welfare is not captured in partial
equilibrium analyses. The large increase is
capital which results raises real wages anc
leads to a larger level of sustainable con
sumption. It is the interaction of increasec
capital intensity with the preexisting distor

Golden Rule, which causes the removal ol
capital taxes to lead to such large gains is

SUMMERS: CAPITAL TAXATION AND ACCUMUL4 TION

There are two potentially important difficulties with the analysis. First, no allowance
is made for variable labor supply. The distortion of the labor-leisure choice is not considered in evaluating the welfare consequences
of wage taxation. It seems unlikely that re-

laxing the assumption of inelastic labor
supply would alter the results in an important way. The general equilibrium effects
described above imply that shifting to wage

taxation changes real wages only slightly.

Hence, labor supply is likely to be little
affected. Allowing for intertemporal variation in labor supply might actually increase

the estimated gain from reducing capital
taxes. Similar conclusions apply to consumption taxation.

Second, the analysis here is confined to
steady-state comparisons. Higher steady-state
consumption is achieved only at the expense

of consumption during the transition to the
new steady state. Hence, the costs of transition must be weighed against the long-term
gain. This issue is considered in my 1979
paper where the transition path following the

elimination of capital income taxation is
simulated numerically. It is shown there that

convergence to a new steady state is quite
rapid, and that at plausible discount rates,
the gain far exceeds the transition cost. It is
also demonstrated that it is possible to reform taxes in a Pareto-superior way; that is,
so that all those alive on or after the day of
the changeover are made better off.
IV. Conclusions

The results in this paper suggest that the
welfare cost of capital income taxation may
have been seriously underestimated. For reasonable parameter values, the annual welfare
gain from a shift to consumption taxation is

conservatively estimated at 10 percent of
GNP. This surprising conclusion emerges
from an examination of tax effects in the
context of a realistic life cycle growth model.
The large estimates reported here differ from

previous estimates for two main reasons.
First, the multipenod model used here suggests that a very high interest elasticity of
savings is likely to obtain for almost any
reasonable parameter values. Second, the

543

estimates in this paper incorporate the general equilibrium effects of tax changes. The
most important of these is the increase in
gross wages which results from the increased
capital intensity arising from eliminating
capital taxation.
The model used in this study, while more
realistic than the conventional two-period
formulation, could usefully be extended in

several directions. The discussion in this
paper ignores the financing of investment. In
effect it assumes that all investment is equity

financed at the margin. Recently Joseph

Stiglitz has suggested that the corporate tax
may in reality be a lump sum tax, as corporate investment is completely debt financed
at the margin. If this controversial conclusion is correct, it is clear that the analysis
here greatly overestimates the welfare cost of
capital taxes. The results in this paper underscore the importance of empirical and theo-

retical research bearing on the effective
marginal tax rate on capital income.
This analysis has not considered differen-

tial taxation of different types of capital.
Alan Auerbach has shown that optimality
does not dictate uniform tax rates if overall
capital intensity is not at the Golden Rule
level. It would be useful to extend the current analysis by examining a corporate tax
which falls on only some of the capital used
in production.
While these extensions would be valuable,
it is unlikely that the basic conclusion of this
analysis would be altered. Capital income
taxes are likely to appear very undesirable in
any sort of realistic life cycle formulation. A
question of central importance is the realism
of the life cycle hypothesis. While its implica-

tion of a high interest elasticity of savings
may seem implausible, it is the only framework currently available for evaluating com-

peting tax policies. Examining its realism
and/or devising an alternative to it seems a
necessary prerequisite to a fuller understanding of the effects of capital taxation.
