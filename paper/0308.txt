INCOME AND RACE DIFFERENCES IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH

Linda N. Edwards and Michael Grossman

ABSTRACT

this paper we explore income and race differences in nine measures of the health of children aged 6 through 11. We show that when
health measures from mid-childhood are the subject of analysis, both income and race differences are much less pronounced than they are in in—
f ant mortality and birth weight data. We do find differences in the
health status of black and white children and of children from high and
low income families, but these differences by no means overwhelmingly
favor the white or high—income children. With respect to differences
by race, whether or not they are adjusted for differences in associated
socioeconomic factors, black children in many cases are in better health
than their white counterparts, In the case of income differences in
health, the high income children do appear to be in better health according to most measures, but their advantage is greatly diminished when one
controls for related socioeconomic factors like parents' educational
attainment. Even so, for measures relating to the "new morbidity," such
as the presence of allergies or excessive tension, children from higher
income families are in worse health.

INCO€ AND RACE DIFFERENCES IN CHILDREN' S HEALTH

Linda N.
I.

Edwards and Michael Grosslnan*

Introduction
Recent

studies of children's health in the United States have stressed

the differences between black and white children and between children in high

and low income families. Newberger, Newberger, and Richmond (1976), for example, cite mortality rates for both infants and older children that are

over 50 percent higher for blacks than for whites (pp. 252—53). They also

point

out that the incidence of low birth weight (a good negative indicator

of whether an infant will survive his first year and of his successful future development) is more prevalent among black and poor families. Similar

statistics

are cited by Keniston (1977) and the National Research Council

(1976).

The income and race comparisons in children's health status cited above,
as well as those cited elsewhere, rely primarily on measures that relate to the

first year of the child's life. This results largely from the unavailability

of comprehensive measures of morbidity for older children. Recent publication
of data from Cycles II and III of the Health Examination Survey, however,

makes it possible to explicitly study the health of older children. In this
paper we use data from Cycle II, which covers children aged 6 through 11 years,
to explore income and race differences in nine measures of children's health.

We report two kinds of results. First, we show that when health measures
from mid—childhood are the subject of analysis, both income and race differences

are much less pronounced than they are in infant mortality data. Second, these
differences do not uniformly favor children from white or higher—income families.
Indeed, children from toor families and black families are found to be in better
rather than worse health when measures that reflect the "new morbidity" are

examined. This is the phrase originated by Haggerty, Rcghmann, and Pless
to

describe "learning difficulties and school problems, behavioral disturbances,

difficulties, visual problems, and the problems of adolescents

(p. 316). They observe

that

over this century

the

childhood diseases have been declining in importance while health

problems associated with the new morbidity have become

more widespread. That is,

growing levels of family income in this century have been accompanied by an increased

prevalence of the new morbidity. This observation is remarkably parallel to our
own findings of a positive association between family income and the incidence
of this type of health problem.

II. Measuring Health in the Cycle II Sample
Cycle II of the Health Examination Survey is an

exceptional source of in-

formation about a national sample of 7,119 noninstitutionalized children aged
6 to 11 years in the 1963-65 period.1 The data comprise complete medical
developmental

and

histories of each child provided by the parent, information on

family socioeconomic characteristics, birth certificate information, and a
school

report with data on school performance and

classroom

behavior provided

by teachers or other school officials. Most important, there are objective
measures of health from physical examinations administered by the Public Health

Service. Together, the data provide an unusually detailed picture of the health

of children in this cohort.
Given the unusual detail and diversity of the health data in the Cycle II
survey,

the

choice of health status measures is not dictated by data availabil-

ity but rather is an issue that must be faced directly. The problem of defining
and measuring children's (and adults') health is very much an unresolved one,

even among professionals in the area of public health.2 The economist's

—3—

approach is to define health as a form of human capital which determines the
anunt of time available for consumption and for work in the home and labor

market.3 (Individuals
state

may also derive disutility, or even utility, from the

of being ill.) With this type of definition, an appropriate measure of

health status over some time period would be the proportion of potential time
that is actually available for usual consumption, maintenance, and work ac-

tivities. Similarly, the complementary measure of ill health would be the

proportion of time lost as a result of imperfect functioning. Such disability
may be relatively easy to measure when dealing with adults who are members of

the labor force (a good approximation is days lost from work because of ill-

ness), but it is not easy to measure for other adults or for children.
Therefore,

in economists' studies of adults' health, both

(1975)].
We use the same type of restricted, morbidity—oriented, definition of

children's health——focusing on the child's physical health rather than his

overall

well—being——and similar types of measures—disability, physical con-

ditions, and parental assessment of health status. Even some of these measures, however, may not

reflect their

capital or "permanent" health. A useful distinction to make here is

between "permanent" health——one's prospect for life preservation and normal
lifetime functioning——and "transitory" health—-short-run deviations from

one's normal state of health. It is the child's "permanent" health status

—4—

that we wish to study, and we seek to use health measures which are good in-

dicators of that "permanent" health status.4
In some situations a single overall index of permanent health might be
desired——to parsimoniously describe the health status of a population, for

example, or to allocate public funds. Infant mortality statistics are fre-

quently used in this way. Health, however, is clearly a multidimensional
concept. Consequently we use a set of health measures rather than
index.

race.

The actual choice of components of children's health status to be ex-

amined has been guided by

the child health literature ,6 as well as by dis-

cussions with public health pediatricians.7 The measures are listed and
described below.

1. The parent's assessment of the child's overall current health,
represented by PFGHEALTH. PFGHEALTH is a dichotomous variable indicating

whether

the

parent views the child's health as poor, fair, or good (as

opposed to very good).
2.

indicator

Current height, represented by IHEIGHT. Height is a standard
of children's nutritional status [for example, National Center

for Health Statistics (1970) and (1975); Seoane and Latham (1971)], and
good nutrition is an obvious and natural vehicle for maintaining children's

health. Since it is well known that physical growth rates differ by age
and sex, IHEIGHT is computed as the difference between the child's actual

—5—
height and the mean

height

for his or her age—sex group divided by the

stan-

dard deviation of height for that age—sex group.8

3. The child's visual acuity, represented by the dichotomous variable

ABVIS. ABVIS indicates if the child has abnormal distance vision. All
children were examined without their eyeglasses; their uncorrected binocular
distance vision is defined as abnormal if it is worse than 20/30 (NCHS (1972)].

4. The child's blood pressure, represented by HDBP. HDBP is a dummy
variable which indicates if the child's diastolic blood pressure exceeds the
95th percentile for his or her age and sex.
5. Whether or not the child has hayf ever or other allergies, represented by the dummy variable ALLEG.

6. An assessment of the child's level of tension, represented by the
dummy variable TENS. TENS characterizes children who are rated by their
parents

as "high strung" or "moderately tense." Both the

tension and al—

lergy variables may be regarded as measures of the "new morbidity."
7.

The

presence of one or more "significant acquired abnormalities"

on physical examination of the child, represented by the dummy variable
ACABN. These abnormalities include heart disease; neurological,
or

muscular,

joint conditions; and other major diseases.9
8.

The

child's periodontal index, represented by APERI.

APERI

is a

good overall indicator of oral health as well as a correlate of nutrition
(Russell (1956)3. Since the periodontal index is known to differ systematically by age and sex, APERI it is standardized by age and sex in the

same

manner as is height. Higher values of APERI denote

oral

health. 10

poorer values of

—6—
9. Excessive absence from school for health reasons during the past
six months, represented by the dichotomous variable SCHABS. This variable
is taken from information provided by the child's school.11

Precise definitions of the above health measures appear in Table 1
along with a notation concerning the source of each variable (medical his-

tory, physician's exam, birth certificate, or school form). As is implied
in the above definitions, IHEIGHT is a positive correlate of good health and
PFGHEALTH, ABVIS, HDBP, ALLEG, TENS, ACABN, APERI, and SCHABS are negative
correlates of good health.

III. Race and Income Differences in Health
atus in the Cycle II Sample
Table 2 presents the mean levels of these nine health measures for

the whole sample as well as by family income and by race)2 The two fam—

ily

income classes are under $5,000 per annum and $5,000 or more per annum.

This income cutoff is selected because it identifies the lowest quartile

of the income distribution for the Cycle II sample. For purposes of comparison, Table 2 also includes statistics on infant mortality and the incidence of low birth weight for corresponding income and race classes.

they exhibit a lower incidence of allergies and tension (favorable differences
are also apparent for ABVIS, APERI,

IV. Decomposition of Observed Race and Income Differences
We have docwnented the fact that race and income differences in health
status in the Cycle II

sample

children are much less sharp than are corre-

sponding differences in measures of infant health. Nevertheless, some differences still do exist. To what extent are these uniquely associated with
income and race and to
socioeconomic factors?

what

extent can they be attributed to correlated

— 11 —

A.

Race Differences
It is well known that race and

income are themselves highly corre-

lated. Thus it is not surprising that the four health measures displaying significant race differences also exhibit significant income differ-

ences (see Table 2). An obvious first step, therefore, is to try to
determine if these observed race differences are really just a result of

differences in income. To do so we obtain mean values for the nine health
measures

addition,

for APERI the race difference is now significant where it was not before.
For all three of these measures, however, black children are found to be
in better health than white

children from

families of comparable low in-

come levels. In high income families, significant race differences still
exist for PFGHEALTH, ALLEG, and TENS, with black children in worse health
according to PFGHEALTH and in better health according to TENS and ALLEG.
Thus, within income classes significant health differences still exist between black and white children. As before, these differences do not urii—
formly favor children of either race, but most of the significant differences show blacks to be better off.

15

A further way of investigating the nature of race differences in children's health is to look at residual race differences after a much larger

list of socioeconomic variables is held constant. This is done using
multiple regression analysis. The dependent variables in the regression
equations are the nine health status measures. For the explanatory variables we use a set suggested by the economic model of family investment

clear: gross income differences in health greatly overstate the true relationship

Our findings with respect to race and income differences may be compared with those in a recent study of infant mortality by Gortmaker (1977).
He

attempts to determine what portion of the large income

and race differ-

ences in infant mortality can be explained by differences in parents' edu-

cational. attajnient, mother's age, the child's birth order, and the previous pregnancy experience of the mother • He finds that poverty families
and black families still display a much higher incidence of infant mortal-

ity

even when these factors are

controlled for.

V. Conclusions

The first point that we make in concluding is that income and race
differences in infant mortality provides a poor, and even misleading
description

of income and race differences in the health of older children.

It may be appropriate to use
country comparisons

of the

infant

mortality statistics in broad across—

health status of various populations but these

statistics should not be used to indicate the health status of various
groups of older children within the United States.
We do find differences in the health status of black and white children and of children from high and low income families, but these differences by no means overwhelmingly favor the white or high—income children.
With respect to differences by race, whether or not they are adjusted for
differences in associated socioeconomic factors, black children in many
cases are in better health than their white counteroart.g. In the case of
income differences in health, the high income children do appear to be in
better health according to most measures, but their advantage is greatly
diminished when one controls for related socioeconomic factors like par-

ents' educational attainment. Even so, for measures

relating to the new

out of the divergence between infant mortality statistics and our

mid—childhood health measures. Why are the income and race differences in

infant mortality so striking when corresponding differences in mid—childhood

morbidity are not? This divergence is not simply a result of the type of
measure

(mortality versus morbidity); differences in the mortality of older

children are also less striking. Perhaps the health differences of various

demographic groups are minimized in the mid—childhood years. If so, we

need

to know why. The answers to these questions are clearly pertinent to

the conduct of public policy towards the welfare of children.

description of the

sample, the sampling technique, and the

data collection is presented in NCHS (1967). The one deficiency of this
sample from the point of view of studying children's health is the exclu-

sion of children in institutions. To the extent that these children are

more

likely to have serious and

disabling physical conditions, the re-

ported incidence of certain conditions will be lower in our sample than

the entire population of children. In addition, if the probability of
the institutionalization of a child with a given condition depends on inin

come and race, our results will incorporate unknown biases. The number of
institutionalized children is small, however, at about four-tenths of a
percent of all children aged 5 through 13 years.

[This is the proportion

of 5—13 year—olds living in "group auarters" in 1970 according to the U.S.

Bureau of the Census (1973), Tables 52 and 205. The corresponding percentages by race are .38 percent for whites and .7 percent for blacks.]

ware (1976).

to that proposed in Torrance (1976).

40f course, there is a positive relationship between "permanent" and
"transitory" health status in the sense that a child with low health capital is more likely to contract some acute conditions and to have them for

a more extended time period. For example, Birch and Gussow (1979) discuss

how nutrition (which is clearly a determinant of "permanent" health

status) and disease are intimately related.
51n earlier work some attempts were made to condense the health in-.
formation using principal component analysis. The analysis yielded al—

most as many

equally

weighted components as there were initial health mea-

sures.

IHEIGHT can be translated directly into the child's height percentile.

91n defining ACABN, we exclude abnormalities resulting from accidents

or injuries because these are likely to reflect transitory rather than permanent health variations.

The periodontal index suffers from the defect that it is subject to
.

intra—rater arid inter—rater variability. We have experimented with a some-

what more objective measure of oral health, the number of decayed permanent

and

primary teeth adjusted for age and sex, and

have obtained results simi-

lar to those for the periodontal index. Compared to the number of decayed
teeth, the periodontal index reflects more serious oral health problems.

11There is no school form for approximately 500 children in the Cycle

II data set. Since excessive absence due to illness is the only variable
taken from the school form, children without the school form are eliminated
from our working sample only when school absenteeism is examined.

12These means are computed using only 4,777 of the 7,119 observations

because our working sample only includes children who lived either with
both of their parents or with their mothers only (no step-parents, foster

parents, grandparents, etc.). In addition, the 72 children who turned 12
years old after having been chosen fro the Cycle II survey are excluded as
well as those children for whom there were missing data on either these
health measures or on the socioeconomic

variables used in the next section.

Comparison of these means with corresponding means for the entire Cycle II
sample reveals that there is very little difference between the full sample

and

our working subsample.

13This difference between the relative health profile of blacks in

infancy and in midchildhood is not simply a result of differences in data
sources or differences between sample data and population data. Available
data on the Cycle II children during their infancy (birth weight, the
incidence of congenital abnormalities, and the parents' retrospective
assessment of the infant's health) indicates that the black children had
significantly poorer health in infancy.

L4income differences were also computed for an all—white sample with

virtually identical results (see Table 4). Thus, these reported income
differences in health are not the result of the higher proportion of blacks
in poor families.

15These
two

results can again

be contrasted with comparable data for the

infant health measures discussed earlier. Even within income classes,

race differences in infant mortality and in the incidence of low birth
weight remain large and consistently favor whites:

16Net differences are computed in two different ways depending on
whether or not there are significant race differences in slope coeff i-

cients in the underlying health equations. If there are no significant
differences in the slope coefficients by race (as in the case for the
dependent variables HDBP, ABVIS, TENS, ACABN, and SCHABS), the "net" race
difference is represented by the regression coefficient of a race dummy
variable (black = 1) from a pooled regression of black and white children

that holds constant all other dependent variables. In this case, the
"net" difference is that portion of the gross difference that remains

after holding constant differences in the mean values of the explanatory

variables. When there are significant race differences in the slope coefficients (as in the case of the deoendent variables APERI, IHEIGHT,

PFGHEALTH, and ALLEG), the net differences is computed as the difference
in intercepts from race—specific regression estimates with the set of ex-

planatory variables held constant. In this case the net difference represents that portion of the gross race difference that remains after allowing for race differences in both means and in slope coefficients.

17The list of health measures for which there are significant income

differences is the same for the white sample as it is for the full black
and white sample reported on in Table 2.

18Unlike in the case of race differences in no cases were there significant references in the slope coefficients in the two income classes.
