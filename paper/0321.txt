ABSTRACT

THE EFFICIENT LEVEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES

Criteria for determining the efficient mix of branches,
hours, stock, and new acquisitions are developed and applied to

the branch operations of the New York Public Library. A method
based on travelling costs is used to value library use at each

branch. The relationship between library operations and library
use is estimated using a two—stage technique. The costs of library
operations are explored. Marginal benefit-cost ratios are presented.
The study finds that the New York Public Library operates too many
branches for too few hours of service.

THE EFFICIENT LEVEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES

Malcolm Getz1

In the era of fiscal austerity and Proposition 13 fever, the
issue of determining the efficient level of local government services

is particularly acute. Public libraries are more vulnerable to cutbacks
than other services because library closings do not represent the
irmiiediate threat to public health or safety which fire, police, and

sanitation cutbacks imply.
In fact, public library budgets are subject to wide swings.
For example, the Buffalo-Erie County Public Library suffered a 27-percent
cutback in budget in 1977; 11 percent was restored in 1978.

Such

erratic budget changes tend to destroy the morale of library employees,
disrupt orderly management, and disturb public habits of library use.
Because library use and public sentiment toward libraries are not subject to such severe short-term swings, it would seem that budget
officers make changes with little evidence to guide them.

They may be

experimenting to discover the effect of different budget levels.
Formal methods for evaluating the efficiency of different
levels of operation might lead to greater budget stability by making

specific requests for change more defensible. Of course, formal
methods involve aggregation, abstraction, and wrestling with difficult
problems of valuation; and they do not replace informed judgment.
However, a formal approach to budget evaluation can pinpoint the area

3

4

in which judgment must be applied and thus help avoid the destructive
pattern of budget instability which characterizes many public libraries.
Formal analysis can also provide insight into the efficient

mixture of library expenditures. Perhaps more benefits can be derived
per dollar of expenditure by changing the mixture. Rather than choosing
between spending mare and spending less, public library managers can use
formal budget evaluation to spend more wisely.
In the discussion which follows, previous studies of library
services are reviewed to establish the state of the art in evaluating

libraries. The problem of determining the efficient number of branches
is then discussed, using evidence from the branches of the New York

Public Library. Efficient levels of hours and book stock are addressed,
again using (data from the New York Public Library. Finally, a possible

realloctioq of expenditure with fewer branches operating longer hours
is evaluated.

STUDYING EFFICIENCY IN LIBRARIES

Efficiency is used here to mean deriving as much benefit as

possible from expenditures. Benefits are consumer valuations of
services, and expenditures include the full social costs of activities.
In competitive private markets, prices carry information about social

costs and allow consumers to judge the level of service that makes

them best off. Producers use revenues from sales as signals of how
much to produce. However, when goods are provided collectively, as
with public libraries, other means must be used to determine the
efficient level of activity.

5

The decision rule for a pattern of expenditure that will make

consumers best off is simply stated: the additional benefit from one
dollar of expenditure should be just one dollar.

If the additional

benefit were greater than one dollar, then the total benefit, net of
costs, would increase with the additional expenditure, and the

additional expenditure would be justified. If the additional benefit
were less than one dollar, then reducing expenditures by one dollar
would reduce costs more than benefits; thus benefits, net of costs,

would be increased by cutting back. Of course, in order to operate
the enterprise at all, total benefits must exceed total costs. But
in most situations, the problem of choosing the most efficient level
of operation--the level that makes consuniers best off—-is the problem

of identifying the level of service where the extra benefit of
additional expenditure matches the cost.

The linkage between library expenditures and consumer benefits

must be carefully defined and measured. First, how do expenditures

generate services (the cost function)? Second, how much use is
generated by the services (the production function)? Third, how do
consumers value the different kinds of use (the valuation problem)?
Other authors have considered the problem of evaluating library services.
Their efforts are reviewed briefly here as background for the investigation to follow.

Several economists have applied benefit—cost analysis to

library services. Newhouse and Alexander [13] focused on book selection
in the Beverly Hills, California public library. They assumed that use
of library materials represents some fraction of the value of ownership

6

of the materials. Consequently, they suggested that the value of use
of library materials is directly related to the purchase price of the
materials (art books are more valuable than juvenile books, for example)

and that value is directly related to the amount of use. By assuminq
that the same proportion of users would be likely to buy each type
of book if the library copies are unayailable, Newhouse and Alexander
estimated a valuation for each category of book and compared the values

to the costs of the books. As a result of this analysis they recommended
that the Beverly Hills Library buy more expensive and fewer inexpensive
books.

The Newhouse and Alexander study is valuable because it deals
directly with the problem of valuation, but the study has several

limitations. Because they were uncertain how many users would buy
books if the library copies were unavailable, the authors were unwillinq
to state the value of library use; they limited their conclusions to
defining the best mixture of book purchases, given the book budget.
Of course, the book budget is only one part of the design of a library.
Newhouse and Alexander did not deal with the geographic character of
public library services--namely, the number of branches--nor did they
consider the issue of hours of service.
Hu, Booms, and Kaltrieder [10] used benefit—cost methods to

compare mail—order and bookmobile services in rural Pennsylvania. The
average cost of the bookmobile service was $0.62 per circulation, while
the average cost of the mail—order service was $0.69 per circulation.
The mail-order service was more expensive because of the cost of preparing

and mailing catalogs for selection. Estimated cost functions revealed

1

that the operating cost per book circulated by the bookmobile service
was $0.48; the operating cost of the mail service was $0.60.
The authors considered five different methods for establish-

ing the benefits of the rural library services. First, they
determined how much time was saved by users ordering books for

delivery instead of making trips to the library. Second, they
estimated the additional amount of money that users would have

spent buying books if library service were less convenient. Third,
the authors asked users what they would be willing to pay for the

service. And fourth, they determined at what price books might be

rented, if rentals were available. In addition, the authors
considered the value of the option to use the service by people
who do not use it, that is, the options demand for service. Because asking
what users would pay is an unreliable method and because no rental
services were in fact available in rural Pennsylvania, the analysts
surmned the time saved, the value of books not purchased, and the

value of the options demand for service to establish the benefit

for each service. They calculated the marginal benefit of rural
delivery at $.29 for the bookmobile and $.47 for mail delivery.
Thus, while mail delivery yields more benefits per dollar of expenditure than the bookmobile service, the benefits of neither system

cover operating costs. The authors concluded that consumers in
rural Pennsylvania are better off with the tax saving of visiting

the library than with elaborate delivery systems. The Hu, Booms,
and Kaltrieder study is noteworthy because it employs surveys of

users and nonusers in developing estimates of benefits. Of course,

8

the study of rural delivery is only tangentially relevant to the
design of an urban system.

Other economists [7, 17] estimate cost functions of quasiproduction functions without trying to establish values for benefits, but they do not claim to identify efficient levels of service.

In the best of these studies, Feldstein [6] estimated cost and
circulation functions in 371 cities using a 1968 Office of Education
survey of public libraries.

In estimating a use of relationship,

Feldstein recognized that the library activities, branches, hours,
and book stock might be shaped by library managers in light of

patterns of use. Thus, the simple correlation between use and
service level reflects both consumer behavior and managerial choice.

While Feldstein used an instrumental variable technique to try to
control for the simultaneity, it is not clear what variables were

used as instruments. The use of city library systems as units of
observation also caused some trouble because no distinction was
made between a system with a large central library and small branches

and one with a smaller central library and larger branches. Consequently, Feldstein could not develop statistical results to validate
the claim that 'fewer large branches is preferred to more small
branches.

Feldstein found that library use is sensitive to the

level of service and that expenditures are shaped by local demographics
and local government revenue services.

In an earlier study of library economics, Black [3] examined

expenditure and use in a dynamic context. He recognized that library

9

use would change with changes in population level, income, and wages.

Assuming that the efficient level and mixture of services would be
determined in response to use in this demographic context, Black
emphasized the fact that efficient library service would change

with time. Baumo] and Marcus [1] considered the changing costs
of academic library services, but did not provide an analytic

framework; The fact that library costs are rising faster than
other costs is not in itself a clue to determining efficiency.
Operations research analysts have studied libraries in

some detail. Although Hamburg, Clelland, Bommer, Ramist and
Whitfield [8] have surveyed a substantial amount of this literature,
they have contributed little to the problem of estimating the

valuation that consumers place on library activities. They note
that the average rate of return in the private sector is 12.5

percent. "By assuming that the average public library has behefits
that exceed costs by 12.5 percent, we estimate the dollar value
imputed to an exposure hour' [8, p. 33].

Operations research analysis appears to offer a better
understanding of the production function than the more aggregate

methods generally used by economists. In the best example of
such work, Morse [2] analyzed the operation of the MIT library.

He used queuing theory to determine the optimum numberof multiple
copies and a markov process to predict book use. Morse also
considered the optimum length of loan period and the optimum number

of reserves. These techniques are readily applicable in many
library situations and deserve wide use. However, because Morse
studied an academic library and emphasized operation issues, his

10

approach offers little guidance in making budgetary choices for
public library systems.

Raffel and Shishko [15] also used operations research in

a study of the MIT library. The authors asked 283 students and
faculty members to allocate a budget over 20 service chanqes.

According to the responses, the authors distinguished two groups

of users. The first (mainly students) preferred outside use: more
duplicate copies for loan and longer loan periods. The other group
(generally users engaged in research) favored increased acquisition,

a messenger service with the Library of Congress, and department

libraries. Using answers to hypothetical questions by relatively
uninformed users may not be a reliable analytic technique. Nevertheless, the Raffel and Shishko study represents a creative effort
to investigate the valuation of services in the context of an
academic library, where the valuation problem is especially difficult.
Librarians, of course, have also been interested in evaluatinq

library services. Lancaster's [11] comprehensive survey illustrates
the strengths and the weaknesses of studies by librarians. Their
main strengths are close attention to detail and sensitivity to

nuances of service quality. For example, a study conducted by
Crowley and Childers [4] assessed the quality of available reference
services by asking a set of topical questions during anonymous
telephone calls made at random times to public libraries in New

Jersey. The authors found that the libraries generally did a poor
job of responding to questions which required very current information

(recent Presidential cabinet appointments, for example). It is easy

11

to see how such surveys might be used by libraries to monitor their
own telephone reference services and even to make judgments about
the effectiveness of different training methods and work assignments.
Another study by Seymour and Schofield [16] reported on the use of

card catalogs. "Failures" were classified as follows: (1) item
in catalog but not found; (2) item in library but not cataloged;
(3) item on order; (4) identified item not in collection; and (5)

unidentified citation. Clearly, an analysis of the first group of
failures might lead to revision of catalog headinqs(if inexpensive);
failures in the fourth category might give a clue to collections

development. These detailed performance studies reflect the librarian's
concern with the quality of individual library activities.

Another attempt by librarians to develop performance mdicators casts a broader net. DeProspo, Altman, and Beasley [5],
under the auspices of the Public Library Association, propose a more
comprehensive data-gathering effort using sampling techniques to
describe the user success rate in finding materials (the probability
of finding particular items from standard bibliographies in the

catalog and on the shelves). A study of the scope proposed by the
authors would include consideration of facilities use, reference,
outreach, circulation, materials available, users, and in-library

activity. The specific purpose of the proposed methods is to develop
a broad base of information useful to library management, and,
clearly, the use of sampling techniques represents a substantial
improvement over current practice.

12

The main deficiency of most evaluations by librarians is

the lack of concern with costs. Lancaster gives little information
about bench marks for the costs of different kinds of library activity,

nor does he suggest how costs might usefully be measured. Even the
comprehensive approach proposed by DeProspo, et al. is aimed at
improving performance measures and gives short shrift to costs.
Efficiency, however, cannot be defined without reference to costs.
The lack of concern with costs leads librarians into several

traps. First, they like to talk about the number of people unserved
by libraries. Usually, this' seems to mean the residents of juris-

dictions which have not chosen to build public libraries. But
DeProspo, et al .

broaden the reference: "Iowa and Minnesota show the

percentage of population unserved by libraries, although it is not
clear if the figures relate to the lack of a library in a given area
or, more important, that a percentage of the population does, not avail

itself of library service" [5, p. 23J. The implication seems to be
that, whatever the cost and whatever consumers' preferences, more

should be spent on libraries until everyone uses them. Lancaster,
only slightly more conservatively, cites the view that libraries
should strive to satisfy 90 percent of the population's needs [11,

p. 166]. The notion that the benefits of library services must be
balanced against their costs is not reflected in the concept of an

unserved population. Moreoever, this concept rejects consumer
preference as a criterion for judging service levels.
A second trap created by the lack of concern with costs is

the application of standards. The Public Library Association

13

promulgated standards for public libraries in 1966 [14], specifying

space, book stock, staffing, training, and so on. The description
of a successful public library may be helpful. But the standards
seem

to suggest that comunities which do not choose to buy elaborate

library services are not acting responsibly. That some communities
have difficulty raising taxes and do not value library services
highly while others want to pay for high levels of service is
easily understandable when efficiency is recognized to account for
both benefits and costs and consumer preferences are used. as the

criteria for judging service. As costs, productivity, and tastes
change, the level and mixture of library services different conriunities

desire also change. The efficient set of public library activities

has changed since 1966 and will continue to change. Since standards
are fixed and unresponsive to change, they are not very helpful in
evaluating the efficiency of library services.
Finally, a study of efficiency—-that is, how benefits relate
to costs——should focus on the cost of major library activities.
For example, perhaps the most fundamental cost consideration in an
urban public library system is how many branches of what size to
operate; the second most important issue is how many hours to operate;
the third is how many new books to add each year; and the fourth is

the size of the central library. These are the major decisions
that determine the size of a public library budget and to a sub-

stantial degree, the quality of service. Therefore, these items
shoul.d be the principal target of evaluation.

If the Lancaster

survey is any indication, librarians appear to prefer to evaluate

14

catalog use, reference service, information retrieval, and book

collection. Lancaster's discussion of the evaluation of library
services hardly mentions the number of branches, hours of service,
or numbers of books, except to say that more is better.
In the analysis described below, cross—sectional evidence

from the branch libraries of the New York Public Library is used
to determine the efficient number of branches, books, and hours of

service. Analysis of the efficient size of the central library
services reqUires a different methodology because the central facili-

ties in library systems are unique within each system. The present
exercise is limited to a cross—sectional study focUsing on neighbor-

hood branches. The New York Public Library has been chosen for
evaluation because its large number of branches facilitates a
statistical analysis.

HOW MANY BRANCHES?

The first priority in judging the efficiency of an urban

library system is determining the efficient number of branches. The
evaluation paradigm is straightforward: the benefits and costs of
each branch are measured and compared. Each branch is considered in
turn as the marginal branch. The actual use of each branch is valued
from the consumer's point of view. Because the estimates of costs
and benefits are approximations, choices are made so as to give low
estimates of costs and high estimates of benefits within the range
of plausible values.

15

The New York Public Library, a private, nonprofit, research
library, operates branch libraries under contract from the City of

New York in three boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island
(Richmond County). Because the facilities of the research libraries
are generally used on premise, their services are not close substitutes for the traditional public library services of the branches,
and •so they are ignored here. The branch libraries include a facility
for the handicapped that provides services throughout the City and

beyond. The service to handicapped persons is also not a close
substitute for the traditional library services, so it too is excluded
from the analysis.

The branches are classified as centers, regional libraries,

and neighborhood libraries. The centers are the largest facilities;

there is one in each borough, plus one for the whole system. The
centers have an average book stock of over 120,000 volumes. The 13
regional libraries have an average stock of 33,000 volumes. There
are 59 neighborhood libraries in the system; each has a permanent

book stock, anaverage of 24,000 volumes, and staff. Two former
neighborhood libraries which are operated at a marginal level without
a permanent book stock or staff are not included in this analysis.
In all, the branch libraries operate 76 regular, general-

purpose facilities with permanent book stocks and staff. They serve
an area of 122 square miles which in 1970 had a population of 3.3

million. Summary information for an average branch of each type
and totals for all 76 facilities are reported in Table 1. The three
types of branches seem to differ in terms other than the size of the

aTotal Use is reference questions plus 1.183 times circulation. The
1.183 factor is to account for in-library use.

It is an average figure from

a survey of library users in a sample of 15 neighborhood branches in the New
York Public Library.

bCost is based on the operating budget for each library. Reported
budget figures anticipated for 1976-77 are adjusted for part-time staff

shifts among branches as reported in library budget documents. In addition,

17

TABLE 1-—continued

Comprehensive Employment and Training Act Employees are added in at $9,000

each. Operating costs are inflated by 20 percent to reflect the administrative overhead costs of the system. Rent payments actually paid are excluded
from costs, but $5 per square foot are included for each facility reflecting

an approximation to the annual lease value of space. Actual rentals varied
from under $3 to over $9 per square foot for the small number of facilities
actually rented.

book stock. The centers have larger staffs and operate more hours
than the regional libraries, and the regionals operate with larger
staffs and are open more hours than the neighborhood facilities.
They also differ in respect to the proportion of professional staff,
with the larger units having more professional staff than the smaller

ones. Note, however, that the regional branches are much more like
neighborhood branches than like centers.

The patterns of use of the three types of branches also differ
The amount of use per volume in stock is much larger for the library
centers than for the regional libraries and somewhat larger for the
regional than for the neighborhood libraries, whether use is defined
simply as circulation or as the sum of reference questions and

weighted for in-library use circulation. Consequently, the cost per
use is lowest at the centers, and is somewhat lower at the neighbor-

hood than at the regional facilities. The greater intensity of use

probably reflects th fact that the larger facilities operate longer
hours, have larger and more varied collections, add more books to

their stocks, and have a more professional staff. On the other hand,
the neighborhood libraries circulate a larger share of juvenile

materials than the library centers. Surprisingly, however, juvenile
materials are about as important at regional libraries as at neighbor-

hood locations. The proximity of the neighborhood branches does not
seem to dominate the regional facilities for juvenile use. Note that
with 76 locations serving 122 square miles, the average branch serves

1.6 square miles. A circle with a radius of -71 miles subtends such
an area.

19

Cost of Branches
The first step in defining efficiency is an analysis of costs.

The budgeted costs of the New York Public Library branch library

system for 1976-77 are used here. The operating costs for each facility
include staff costs with fringe benefits and supplies; the budget for
the acquisition of new materials inflated by 34 percent to account
for system processing costs; and plant security and maintenance costs.
The operating costs are modified in several ways to reflect actual

social costs. First, the staff work part-time in other branches. An
approximate net value for such reassignments is used to adjust the

budget figures. Also, Comprehensive Employment and Training Act
supported employees are added in at $9,000 each. Second, operating
costs for each facility do not include the administrative overhead

costs for borough and system offices: 20 percent is added to approxi-

mate such costs. Third, the budget includes rent expenditure for 15
facilities that are rented. In order to make the cost figures used
in this study reflect the full social opportunity cost of the system,

an annual lease value is assumed for each facility. Therefore a $5
per square foot lease charge is included in the total costs. For
this reason, the social cost figures used here exceed the budget for

the library system by about $4 million. The cost figures used here then
are an attempt to estimate the full social costs of each facility
including the local budget, federal support, and the value of facilities owned by the Library.

The costs of each facility can be related to the level of

operation. The operations are summarized in three variables: annual

20

hours of service, the total stock of materials both book and non-book,

and the number of gross additions of stock during the year. The
possibility that high levels of use raise costs given hours

and books is ignored. The analysis reported in Table 2 indicates
the marginal cost of an additional hour of service annually is

approximately $2,317, that is $44.56 for a single hour.2 Maintaining

an additional item in stock for a year is estimated to cost $393•3
The acquisition of a new item has an estimated marginal cost of $7.31

including average processing costs.4 While over half of the variation
in costs across neighborhood branches is accounted for by the three
operations variables, it is a little disappointing that more of the

cost differences are not explained. This weakness may be due in
part to the fact that the budget and actual operations may not be for
exactly the same time period, and expenditures may be somewhat
different than budgets.

Benefits of Branches

The second step in the evaluation of branch activities is

the evaluation of the use of the libraries. Library use is recorded
in more detail by the New York Public Library than by many libraries.

The circulation of books and other materials outside each branch is
recorded separately for adult and juvenile materials.

In addition

the Library makes an effort to count the reference questions asked

during several sample periods each year. Thus, the total number of
reference questions asked can be estimated. The only major category
of use that the Library does not routinely monitor is attendance;

maximum, the value of the nearest library branch is the cost in tinie
and money of travelling to the next nearest facility. Whether library
use continues at another facility or ceases, the cost of travel to the
next nearest facility is an upper bound estimate of the value of its
services.

The method of valuing library use by lookinq at the cost of
the next best alternative defines a value for an individual branch
considered by itself.

It does not reveal the value of the full librar

system. If a single branch closes, some users will be diverted to
other branches, and so the use of other facilities will change. In
addition, the next nearest branch for

some facilities may change

when one facility is closed. Thus the proposed method for valuinn
the library services is appropriate for valuinc-i branches individually.
The value of use of a particular branch is then assumed to be
the cost of travelling between that location and the next nearest

24

I!

facility. Two uses are assumed to occur on each round trip. To
calculate the travel time, straight—line distances are measured,

and travel is assumed to take place at five miles per hour. Travel

time is assumed to be valued at $4 per hour. This implies a
valuation of each library use of $0.80 for each mile from a- particular
branch to the next nearest branch.

In addition, $0.50 additional

transit fare is assumed each way of the round trip to the next

nearest branch. For regional branches, the distance to the library
centers is used. For the three borough centers, the Mid—Manhattan
Library Center is taken as the alternative. No effort is made to
value the services of the MidManhattan Center.

-

According to this method of valuation, branches with-greater
use and those located at a greater distance from regional libraries
provide more benefits than the branches that are used less and those
located near to other branches.

The valuation technique obviously does not give any clue as
to the relative value of juvenile versus adult circulation, or of

circulation versus reference versus in—library.use. In order to
account for the possibility that different uses will be valued

differently, a second benefit calculation is made. Adult circulation
is treated as before, whereas juvenile circulation is assumed to be
worth 50 percent more than adult in light of the greater difficulty

juveniles may have in travelling to another library. Reference
questions are valued at half an adult circulation rate because many

questions can be answered by telephone. In-library use is treated
like circulation just as before.

25

The estimated benefits and

costs of the branches of the New

York Public Library are reported in Table 3. Of the 59
nelghborhoo

branches, 12 are estimated to have

benefits greater than costs while

47 have benefits less than costs. Of the 12 with positive
net
benefits, 6 are in Staten Island, 5

in Manhattan. Of the 47

are in the Bronx, and only one is

neighborhood branches with negative net

benefits, 26 have benefits that

are $100,000 less than costs. Of

these 26 branches, 22 are within one mile of the next nearest branch,
including 7 that are within a half mile of the next nearest branch.
Thus the close proximity of branches
the low level of benefits of

seems to be important in explaining

many branches. A second factor, of

course, is low levels of use.

Among the 13 regional libraries, 5 show negative net benefits

according to these estimates. Of these 5, the Francis X. Martin
Regional Library and the Grand Concourse
benefits less than costs of

Regional Library show

more than $100,000. Martin and Grand

Concourse are about a mile apart and the Martin Regional is within
a mile of the Fordham Library Center.
These facts may explain the
low level of benefits indicated

for these regional branches.

The Fordham and St. Georges

Library Centers show benefits

substantially greater than costs. The

valuation method does not

allow an estimate of the benefit of the MidManhattan Library,
the
largest library in the branch system. The Donnell Library Center

shows negative net benefits in

the MidManhattan. The Donnell

part because it is within a mile of
Library Center may have specialized

collections for Young Adults, however, and so the MidManhattan

may

not be a close substitute. The valuation method is on a firmer
footing in evaluating the neighborhod and regional facilities.
When use of juvenile materials is weighted 50 percent more
than the use of adult materials, and reference questions are weighted
at half the value of use of adult materials, the net benefit picture

changes little. Only the Throgs Neck Branch moves from negative net
benefits to positive net benefits. The number of branches with net
benefits less than minus $100,000 drops from 26 to 24.

The estimates of benefits and costs presented here indicate
that the New York Public Library operates many more branches than is
dictated by efficiency criteria; that is, the consumers of library
services in the city would probably be better off with fewer branches
with the savings used either to lower taxes or increase other aspects

of library services. Because the number of branches has grown since
1960 -(and an additional branch is planned), one might conclude that

efficiency has not been the operational criterion in the design of

this library system. Library systems in other older cities may also
be over branched, for example, in Chicago, Philadelphia, and San
Francisco.

The analysis presented here could be improved in several ways,

First, the estimates of use would be more accurate if attendance
information were available for each location, even if only for sample

periods. Second, the valuation of service might be improved with more
detailed information about user travel time and costs in making
library trips.

29

HOW

MANY HOURS AND BOOKS?

In the above exercise the hours of operation, books in stock,
and books added during the year are not taken into consideration.
Because these characteristics of public library service are also very
important budget items, it is appropriate to try to determine whether

they are provided at efficient levels. Of the three steps in an
efficiency calculation, the main emphasis here will be on determining
how use varies with differences in service——namely, the production
function.

Explaining Patterns of Use
Three characteristics of library service are related to use:
the size of the stock, the number of additions to it during the last

year, and the number of hours the facility is open. The size of the
stock of materials in the library indicates the variety of materials

available. Presumably, the larger the stock, the more likely that a
user will find material of particular interest. Inforniation from the
branch libraries of the New York Public Library allows disaggreqation
of stock into adult and juvenile categories and book and nonbook

(mostly recordings) categories. However, paperback stock volumes are

not recorded for each facility. Therefore, the book stock figures
understate stock by the amount of paperbacks on hand. Further disaggregation might be useful (for example, fiction and nonfiction), but
only if use information were similarly disaggregated.
The number of materials added during the most recent year

indicates the currency of the material. Recently published materials,

30

(for

example, best sellers) are more in demand than older materials.

Also, the library with a high volume of additions can respond to
changes in users' tastes more quickly than the branch with a low
volume of new materials, and should therefore be characterized by

a higher rate of use. Additions are disaggregated in the same way

as stock. No information about the addition of paperback books by
branch is available.

Finally, the more hours the facility is open, the more
accessible are the materials and the less planning a user must do

in order to arrive when the library is open. The number of hours
per week is calculated by dividing the total number of hours of
service for the year by 52.

In addition to the above three service characteristics, one
might also consider the proportion of staff that is professional.
A predominantly professional staff may be better able to respond to
reference questions than a nonprofessional staff, and may also play
a role in improving the selection and presentation of materials.
Libraries also sponsor programs, such as story hours, films, book

talks, and the like. If these are viewed as promotional activity
for the library, more programs might generate more library use.
However, the proportion of professional staff and the number of
programs offered appear to be secondary to stock, additions, and
hours as indications of library use, and preliminary statistical

investigations confirm this supposition. Also, because only 59
neighborhood libraries are available for observation, the cross—branch

31

statistical study has limited power to make fine distinctions in

many dimensions. Therefore, these two secondary characteristics
have not been taken into account in this analysis.

Library use can be disaggregated in several ways. The
characteristics of service may influence different types of use

differently. The most comonly observed indicator of use is circulation outside the library. Cross—system studies must control for
differences in circulation caused by differences in the length of
the loan period and in renewal policy; renewals typically are counted

as additional circulations. By using branches within one system,

such variation does not arise. Circulation statistics are disaggregated into adult and juvenile, book and nonbook categories,

as is the stock information. The circulation figures, however, include
the circulation of paperback materials, since library records do not

distinguish between hard cover and paperback circulation. It is
unfortunate that paperbacks are excluded from the stock figures
but included in the circulation figures.

Circulation is only one component of library use; another is

reference questions. The New York Public Library records the number
of reference questions asked at each branch by adults and by juveniles

during sample periods. Reference questions might be further disaggreqated
according to the skill and effort required to answer them. Such distinctions demand careful definitions and increase the cost of gathering

the information. It is unusual for a library to keep detailed records

32

of reference questions, and this •study benefits by the quality of

information from the New York Public.

The third major component of library use entails the use of

materials and facilities in the library. For example, Newbouse and
Alexander [13J found that a substantial number of visitors to the
Beverly Hills Public Library did not use any library materials, but

simply used the facility as a study hall. Thus, an important category
of library use is not reflected in data on circulation and reference

questions. The simplest approach to monitoring in—library use would
be to collect attendance information at each location.

Sample surveys

might provide more detailed data on rates of use of materials in the

library. Because the New York Public Library does not maintain branch
attendance records, we are unable to explore how service characteristics
affect in-library use.

In all, 12 measures of use are related to service characteris-

tics: total circulation (book plus nonbook), book circulation, record
circulation, and reference questions are each examined for adults,

juveniles, and all users (adult plus juvenile). In terms of adult
users, the stock and additions of adult materials are used as service
characteristics; in regard to juvenile users, the stock and additions

of juvenile materials are used. In examining the use of books, the
stock and additions of books are used as service characteristics;
for records, the stock and additions of records are used.

Thus, each

use is related to the most relevant feature of the service.
In addition to the service characteristics specific to each
branch, the location of each library relative to others may influence

33

use.

Forty—one of the 59 neighborhood branches are located within

one mile of another library facility. About one-sixth of neighborhood branch users indicated they live within 10 blocks of the library

they use in a survey at 15 neighborhood branches. Library users do not

seem to be clustered near the library. Therefore, it seems approriatc
here to take explicit account of the spatial relationship among

branches. Hours of service is used as the most important service

of competing branches. For each branch, the number of hours

feature

of

service at every other branch is divided by the square of the

distance

between branches and summed.

In the case of a branch loc&ted

near other libraries offering many hours of service, the library

interaction variable will be large. Where other libraries are distint
and offer few hours of service, the library interaction variable will
be small. A significant negative coefficient on the library interucti'jr.

variable will indicate that the proximity of a competing branch tends
to reduce library use at particular locations.
Library use is also determined by the tastes of people wh

live in the vicinity of the library. Berelsor. for exan;ple,citcs
several studies indicating that library use tends to increase with

income and decline with age [2]. Feldstein emphasizes the findino
that use increases with education [6]. Because income and education
are closely related, it is difficult to distinguish the two effects:
however, income is used here. Age distribution is measured in tenIn!
of the percent of total population enrolled in school below the
col

lege level
In

addition, access to libraries nay be influenced by thc:

density of population in an area. Transit service, for exanple, ma

34

be better in a high—density area. People choosing to live in high—
density areas may have different tastes than individuals living in
low—density areas, even controlling for income and age distribution.
The use figures are not deflated by population, so one would expect

greater use in higher density areas. Other neighborhood population
factors which may influence library use include ethnicity, sex,

occupation, and length of employment. However, these characteristics
are thought to be secondary to population density, income, and school
enrollment, and preliminary statistical investigation confirms their

secondary role. Because the neighborhood characteristic variables may
reflect a constellation of neighborhood attributes, it is cltfficult

to predict the signs of the coefficients of these variables; thus,
two-tailed tests are applied.
Information about the three neighborhood attribute variablc•s

are available for 1970 by census tract. With over 700 tracts in the

three

boroughs, there is no obvious way to match tracts to libraries;

the New York Public Library has approached the problem by definin

catchment areas for each branch using census tracts. Several catchment

areas are defined for planned branches or for branches that have

been scaled down to station status. Some catchment areas, comprised

of several tracts, are quite large, while others are small.
the

assignment of tracts to branches

Moreover,

ultimately involves some arbitrary

decisions. Obviously, the residents of one tract may use several
different branches, depending on their location in the tract and their

preferences. Consequently, the catchment area notion is ignored here.

Instead, the tract attributes are each weighted by the square
of the distance to each branch and sunmied over all tracts. Each

is treated separately in this manlier. By squaring diStc

borough

t,

the attributes of nearby tracts are heavily weiQhted, while the value

of attributes of distant tracts drops rapidly toward zero. Distaicti

library users might yield a more precise parameter value. Et SLn

Three groups of variables are used as instruments. Each
reflects an influence on library decisions other than the desire

to meet the demands of users. The first group is the cost of space.
The cost of buying or leasing space for a library differs substantially
within the city, and more branches can be efficiently provided in low-

cost areas than in high-cost areas. Because no index of the cost of
space for small areas in the city is readily available, land use

information is used. The percent of land in residential use, and
the percent of land in high—density areas with residential, industrial,
and commercial use are entered as instruments relating to the cost

of space [9]. The land use zone characteristics are weighted by the
reciprocal of the squared distance to each library and summed.

Nineteen—seventy census tract data on the value of housing units and
contract rents is also used.

The second group of variables reflects the fact that library

managers may be responsive to political pressures. The percent of
votes for Mayor Beam in the 1973 election is used as an indicator of

the political power of an area. This is, of course, a less—than—
perfect measure of political power. The percent of registrants voting
was used in preliminary investigations, but it proved no better than

the Beam vote variable. Political power is a subtle, shifting
attribute, and ethnic ties are often more important than geography.
Although the mayor may be less important than other political figures,
it nevertheless seems appropriate to include some measure of political

activity, no matter how primitive. The Beam vote variable is recorded

37

for a random sample of 987 electoral districts, weighted by the
reciprocal of the square of the distance to each library, and summed.
The third group of factors influencing library decisions con-

sists of lagged values of the variables. Branches are costly to move
or expand, and book stock is likely to expand to fill the available

space. Moreover, additions to stock and hours of service may tend
to follow past patterns. Thus, inertia in the design of the library
system is substantial; the current pattern of branches, stocks, and
hours is not likely to be modified instantly to respond to each

variation in use. Therefore the hours, stock, and additions in 1960
are included as predetermined variables and used as instruments in

estimating use relationships. In the case of 11 neighborhood branches
which were not open in 1960, zeros are entered. (Two of these branches
were closed for renovation in 1960.)
The estimated use relationships are reported in Tables 4 through

7: Table 4 covers total circulation (bock and nonbook), Table 5 covers
book circulation, Table 6 record circulation, and Table 7 reference

questions. Each relationship is estimated for the 59 neighborhood
libraries. The regional branches and centers are excluded because
they may offer a wider assortment of services not reflected in the

service attributes measured. (In fact, results with regional libraries
or with centers do differ somewhat from those for neighborhood branches

alone.) An ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate and a two-stage
least squares (TSLS) estimate are reported for each relationship.

One—tailed tests are applied to the four library attributes: positive
coefficients are expected for stock, additions, and hours, while a

negative coefficient is expected for library interaction. Two-tailed
tests are applied to the other coefficients.

The most dramatic result is the relationship between use and
hours of service; the amount of use of a library is very significantly

associated with the number of hours of service. Currently, the
neighborhood branches average just under 20 hours per week of service,

down from 39 hours in 1960. The association between use and hours
holds for both adult and juvenile materials, for books and records,
and for reference questions.

Moreover, the result for hours persists in the two-stage
estimates, where, for the most part, the influence of the other

service attributes does not remain statistically significant. If
the two—stage estimates are interpreted as the more correct estimates
of user response, with the influence of library decisions purged by
the first stage, then consumers seem much mo.re responsive to changes
in hours than to other attributes of service.

Stocks and additions also have statistically significant coeffi-

cients. Additions seem to be more important in relation to book circulation, while the quantity in stock is a more important variable in

record use. Thus, it seems that books become obsolete faster than
records. Perhaps best sellers are more important to public library

patrons than are the largest selling records. The number of additions
also appears to be important for reference questions, since currency
of materials is associated with use.

Stock and additions do not appear to be significantly associated
with use in the two—stage estimates, except for record circulation.
In terms of book circulation and adult reference questions, the stock

43

of materials and additions to stock do not appear to be significant

factors in use decisions. This lack of significance may be due to
the weakness of the instruments in explaining library decisions; two—
stage estimates are not as reliable as ordinary least squares.
The library interaction variable has a statistically significant negative coefficient in the total circulation and book circulation
and in the juvenile reference question ordinary least squares estimates.
The statistical significance of these coefficients reinforces the
finding that the existence of nearby branches tends to reduce the use
of a neighborhood library.
The three neighborhood characteristic variables yield some

surprising results. First, population density shows a statistically
significant negative relationship with book and record use by adults

and no significant positive coefficient. Thus, the notion that
library use will be greater in higher density areas because of easier

access does not seem to hold. Rather, the tastes of people livinq
in high— and low—density areas differ: those living in low—density
areas appear to have a stronger preference for library services than
those living in high—density areas, with income held constant.
Income has the expected positive coefficient for adult book
use, but a surprising negative coefficient for juvenile book use.
Since juvenile books are relatively inexpensive, perhaps higher-income
households buy more juvenile books than low-income households and rely
on the library to obtain the more expensive adult books.
The percent of population enrolled in school has an unexpected
negative coefficient for adUlt book use and no other significant

44

coefficients. Because school enrollment is closely related to the
number of young persons living in an area, and because library use
is generally thought to decline with age, a positive sign would be

expected. The negative coefficient indicates that adult book use
is greater where there are fewer children.
The overall statistical power of the relationships -is

significant in all cases except the two-stage results for juvenile

book use and for reference questions. The library service characteristics are strongly associated with library use in expected ways.
The neighborhood characteristics also help explain library use, but in

somewhat surprising ways. The two-stage results, while generally weaker
than the ordinary least squares, emphasize the importance of hours of
service as a determinant of patterns of use.

Efficient Operations

Using these careful estimates of relationships between library
service characteristics and use, it is now possible to determine service

efficiency in terms of hours, stock,and additions. The marginal costs
of each activity were reported in Table 2. The marginal benefits of an

additional unit of each activity are calculated in Table 8. The coefficients of the regressions in Table 4 and 7 are estimates of how
use will respond to an increment in a particular library activity,

other things equal. By weighting circulation by 1.183 to account
for in—library use and adding reference questions one arrives at an
estimate of the total increase in library use associated with one

more unit of activity. Marginal use figures are reported in column
(b) of Table 8. Thus an additional hour of

with 11,392 more uses of the library using the ordinary least squares

results, 14,475 using the two—stage results. Because the coefficients
are subject to statistical error, it is appropriate to report a 90

percent confidence interval for the associated difference in use. The
90 percent confidence intervals are reported in column (c).
By dividing the marginal cost of an activity, say an additional
hour of service, by the expected increase in use resulting, one can
estimate the marginal cost of increasing library use in different ways,

as reported in columns (d) and Ce) of Table 8. The ordinary least
squares estimates indicate that an additional library use could be

generated for each $.19 spent in expanding hours. Spendinq $3.12 in
expanding the size of the book stock at a branch will be expected to

increase library use by 1. Spending an additional $.94 for new
materials would expand library use by one.
An efficiently designed library system would expand each
activity as long as the marginal benefit of an extra unit of the
activity--for example, an extra hour of service--exceeds the cost of
providing the extra unit.

If the cost of an extra unit of the

activity exceeds the benefit derived, then consumers would he better
off with the savings in tax dollars or expenditure on a more productive

item, and that activity should be cut back. As an activity is expanded,
we expect that less benefit will be derived from each additional unit.
As an activity is reduced, we expect each additional unit of cutback

to have a larger impact on benefits. Thus, the estimates of marginal
benefits presented here reflect the marginal values of current levels

of library activities. The marginal benefits will differ at different
levels of activity.

47

The average benefit of a library use at the 59 neighborhood
libraries presented in Table 3 is $1.32, although there is substantial

variation among the branches. The marginal benefit of an additional

unit of activity can be compared with the marginal cost of the activity
either by comparing the marginal cost per use of columns (d) and (e)
with the value of benefits, $1.32, or by multiplying the estimated
changes in use, columns (b) and (c) and comparing with marginal cost
of the activity, column (a).

The marginal benefit of an additional hour of service each
week substantially exceeds the assumed niarginal cost.

Using either

the ordinary least squares or two—stage estimates, the point estimates
or the 90 percent confidence intervals, the marginal gains from additional

hours substantially exceed the marginal cost. The average of 20 hours
per week offered at the 59 neighborhood branches of the New York Public

Library is too low for efficiency. Expanded hours of service would
generate substantial increase in library use worth more to consumers
than the costs of the expanded service.

The marginal benefits of maintaining more volumes in stock

is less than the marginal benefits derived. Thus, on average the
neighborhood branches of the New York Public Library seem to be too

large for efficiency. Because the biggest impact of stock on use
seems to be for recordings, it may be that nlaintainiriq a larger

stock of recordings is justified.

The acquisition of new materials seems to have benefits that

exceed costs, at least for the point estimates. Thus, while the
evidence is not as clear as for hours, there does seem to be a case

48

for acquiring more new materials. New materials seem to generate use
worth more than their cost.

FEWER BRANCHES OPERATING MORE HOURS

Overall, then, there seems to be too many branches operating
too few hours, buying somewhat too few new materials, but maintaining

a stock of materials that may be somewhat too large. The evidence for
the number of branches and the number of hours of service is quite

clear, the evidence on stocks and new materials is less clear. Because
the current mix of library activities favors extra branches rather than
more hours of service, it is not possible to say whether the current

budget is at the right level or not. The important finding is that an
efficient library design would have fewer branches and operate more
hours per week.

The influence of a hypothetical reallocation of budget to
fewer branches operating longer hours can be estimated using the

information developed above. The first step is closing branches.
For the sake of the exercise, suppose that the seven branches with

benefits at least $175,000 less than costs were closed. None of the
seven are next to each other.5 The closings would lead to an annual
cost savings of $1.9 million dollars including the rental value of the

space. With the branches closed, some of the library use would shift
to remaining branches. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume
that all the use shifts to nearby branches.

In addition, some of the

branches that are closed may have been nearest to some remaining

branches. The best alternative for these remaining branches will now

49

be a more distant branch. Consequently, the value of library services
at the next nearest branches will be greater.

The second step of this exercise is to assume that the cost
saving from closing the seven branches is used to increase the hours
of service at the remaining 69 facilities in the system. At $2,317
per hour, the $1.9 million made available by closing the seven branches
will buy 11.9 hours each week for each remaining facility in the system.
If each hour added 14,475 uses as suggested by the two—stage point
estimates, the use of each branch would be expected to increase by
more than 172,000.
The costs and benefits of each branch if 7 neighborhood
branches were closed and the funds reallocated to longer hours are

reported in Table 9. Of the remaining 53 neighborhood branches, only
4 have negative net benefits following the branch closinqs and expansion

of hours. The assumption that the hours would be expanded the same at

every facility is perhaps overly simple. Theassumpticn that each
additional hour will have the same impact in increasinq use as the

estimate of the first hour may be too strong. Nevertheless, the change
in the efficiency of the operation--in the quality of service given

the budget--is striking. Of course, the changes will make people in
areas where branches are closed travel farther to get library services,

and so they can be expected to oppose the shift. On the other hand,
perhaps a branch system with fewer branches should have locations

different than the current locations. The relocation of branches
is not examined here.

A POLICY PERSPECTIVE

The above findings may be difficult to convert into policy.
The political process shapes library expenditure patterns, and
efficiency considerations may not dominate the political scene.
First, the political process recognizes the history of the institutfdh

and the possibility of seemingly irreversible changes. Second, equity
consideration may play some role. Third, federal policy may have some
impact on local choices. Fourth, the political process may be simply
imperfect.

The current operation of the New York Public Library reflects

the severe budget cutbacks of the l7O'5. Instead of cutting back
both hours and branches in an effort to retain an efficient mix, the
Library has cut back hours severely while retaining almost all branches.
Cutting back hours has been politically easier than closing branches.
In January, 1976 the Library announced the planned closing of B branches

as a way of coping with budget cuts. The announcement of closings
created a substantial political reaction that prevented closings.
Neighborhood citizen groups coalesced around the preservation of

individual branches. While reductions in hours might be seen as temporary,

the closing of branches may have been seen as permanent. Rather than
accept the budget cuts as permanent, the political friends of the
Library may have viewed cutting hours as a way of preservino the option
of restoring former service levels.
On the other hand, the Library had been expanding the Library

system into the 1970's. In 1960, 48 of the present 59 neighborhood

53

branches were operating and two others were closed for renovation.
Thus, the number of neighborhood branches has

grown by more than 15

percent over the last 20 years. Of the nine new neighborhood
branches, six have opened since 1970. While the opening of new
branches may have been an appropriate response to the changing
location of library use, it may be that older branches should have
been closed at the same time.

In 1960 neighborhood branches were open an average of 39 hours

each week. Other urban library systems currently average in excess
of 40 hours per week at branch locations.

In 1970, however, the

neighborhood libraries in New York averaged 48 hours of service per

week, an above average number. The substantial growth in branch
library activity during the 1960's, even as library use began to

decline (it peaked in 1964), did not put the Library in a very good
position to deal with the budget cut; in the 1970's.
Equity considerations may also play a role in shaping political

support for the Library. Public library services are sometimes discussed in terms of their value for poor people. At the turn of the
century and again during the Great Depression, the public library
provided recreation without charge and offered access to learning

for adults eager to better themselves. Evidence of the distributional
consequences of library activities is not overwhelming, however.
If the net effect of the local

government's library expendi-

tures is to improve the relative position of poor people, then the
beneficiaries of the services must have lower incomes on average than
people who bear the burden of the taxes used to pay for the services.

54

The question of the incidence of the taxes used to pay for the library

is not simple. Currently, over a quarter of the employees of the
branch libraries of the New York Public Library are paid with federal

Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) funds. Presumably,
general revenue—sharing funds also have an impact. Federal revenue
sources are moderately progressive. The ihare of library revenues
accounted for by local tax sources may be less than 50 percent. The
most important local tax is the property tax. Recent literature on
the property tax indicates that it may be capitalized into land values

or borne by the owners of capital. Therefore, the property tax is
likely, except for administrative deviation, to be somewhat progressive.
Those individuals earning higher incomes piy relatively more in taxes
supporting local services than those earning lower incomes.
The beneficiaries of the service also seem to be disproportionately higher income earners.

In particular, we find that adult use of the

library is greater in areas with higher—income residents, whereas the

use of juvenile materials seems greater in lower—income areas. Use as
reflected by reference questions appears to be unrelated to income.
Because the use of juvenile materials accounts for less than 30 percent
of total use, the aggregate effect seems to be that higher income

households use the library more than lower income households. This
finding is generally in conformance with those of other studies,
although the others do not differentiate between adult and juvenile

use. Because the income variable is a distance-weighted index of
census tract information, the coefficients cannot be used to calculate
income elasticities of use.

55

If both the sources of finance and the use of the library are
dlsproportionateiy represented among higher-income groups, it Is possible that local expenditure on

public library services is distributionally

neutral. However, since neither the distribution of those who finance
libraries nor the distribution of those who benefit from library
services is very carefully observed, no firm conclusion about distributional consequences can be made.
Note, however, that just because the beneficiaries tend to
have higher incomes or the services

are distributionally neutral, this

does not mean that the services should

not be performed in the public

sector. Even though not all citizens use the library, it may still
have characteristics that make it

substantially public in character,

justifying its support by general taxes. That library users gain by
library expenditure relative to nonusers does not in itself prove an

inequity in the fiscal system. Nonusers
the library, and so the

may value the option of using

apparent inequity may overstate the underlyinq

welfare effect. Moreover, the important equity result is the net effect
of the full fiscal system. Nonusers

may gain disproportionately from

other government services. The important equity result is that for
the full fiscal system; there is no reason why each service matched

with its source of finance should be

distributionally neutral or

progressive. Finally, the net benefit of services may be capitalized
into land values.

Since in—library use has not been observed, we do not know
the distributional gains from such use. Is in—library use greater

56

among lower—income groups? A better understanding of the distributional
consequences of library activity requires more information on in-library
use, particularly attendance data by branch.

Suppose that we accept the view that library services are

distributionally advantageous. Suppose, too, that library services
are used effectively by poor people, especially children, and that
library use improves school performance and literacy levels, and is an
important vehicle for social advancement by low-income urban families.
(Note that each of these claims is unproven and indeed difficult to
prove; the important issue is the effectiveness of libraries relative

to other expenditures.) How would public library services best be
provided to low-income households? The very substantial response of
use of all kinds to the number of hours of service suggests that even

low-income households respond to the number of hours. The htgh density
of branches in low—income areas of the city, on the other hand, does

not appear to have generated very high levels of use. It seems likely
that the results of this study may also apply to library use by lowincome persons; that is, low—income library users, like the average
user, might be better served by longer hours in fewer larger branches.
Low—income families may also value their time at lower rates than high-

income families. Thus, it is not obvious why library services should
be characterized by more branches and fewer hours of service in
consideration of equity.

The combination of more branches and fewer hours of service
may also be explained by the political environment that shapes the

library system. Perhaps public library service is quite local relative

57

to the size of the city. The
location may be concentrated

represents a substantial simpli-

fication of a complex historical
process which deserves more careful

study. The point is that distributional

impact across neighborhoods

may play some political role.

Federal policy may have some impact on Library decisions.
As already noted, over 25

percent of Library employees are federally
financed CETA workers. President
Carter has proposed new restrictions
on CETA funds that would
prevent professional librarians
being employed
with CETA funds. The central
fact is that a substantial part of

Library operations are contingent

58

Finally, one must question whether the political constraints
on the Library that have prevented a more rational response to budget

cuts are perfectable. Presumably library users who live near branches

that would be closed would be made worse off by the closing. At least
those who have flexible enough schedules to be able to use the facili-

ty when it happens to be open may be worse off. Are such the dominant
force in shaping the library services? Or is the tactic of preserving
locations at the cost of low levels of operation throughout the system
one that will yield more funds for libraries over some longer term?
Perhaps better information about Library operations will improve the
political outcome.

FURTHER RESEARCH

This essay may set the stage for additional efforts to under-

stand efficiency in public libraries. The library use relationships
might be estimated with different functional forms. They might also be
explored overtime in an effort to discover why use began to fall perhaps

a decade before services were cut. The lack of annual demographic
information may hamper this inquiry. Finally, a study of individual
users might refine the estimated relationships presented here.

this study.

recruit professional librarian has an annual salary of about
$11,220 and works a 35 hour week.

Fringe benefits are about 30 percent

of base salary. These figures imply a recruit librarian costs about

$8 per hour. $44.56

per hour of library service suggests that the

observed marginal costs of additional
well above the extra cost of

hours of public service are

an additional librarian for a single hour.

3The relationship between stock and cost can be explored

by relating

costs to square feet and square feet to stock. The number of
square
feet in a facility are
regressed on the stock of materials:
Square Feet =

6633.29 +

0.029 juvenile stock + 0.024 adult stock

(3.647) (0.187)
+

2.200 record stock

(0.233)

R—squared=O.07 n=59

(2.192)

Among the neighborhood branches, there seems to be little relationship
between the stock and space. For the whole system, the relationship

is stronger. The number of square feet in the facility are related
to maintenance and security costs:

60

Maintenance Cost =

5249.0

+

$1.29 square feet R—squared = 0.70

(4.554) (11.80)

n = 59

The marginal maintenance cost of $1.29 per square foot plus the
approximate annual lease value of $5 per square foot suggests an

annual space charge of $6.29 per square foot. Because the link
between stock and space seems so weak among neighborhood branches
it is not possible to relate the estimated space costs to the stock
cost.

4The average cost for an adult hardback book including library
discounts was $7.09; for a juvenile hardback the average price was

$4.16. The average price for an adult paperback was $1.98 and for a
juvenile paperback $1.26. About 28 percent of library acquisitions

are paperback. Processing including ordering and cataloging adds an
average of 34 percent to the cost of the materials.

The processing

costs on paperbacks are much lower than for hardbacks. These figures
confirm the estimate of $7.31 for the average new addition to stock.

5The seven marginal branches are: Mott Haven, West Farms, Woodstock.
and Francis X. Martin Regional in the Bronx, and 125th Street, Seward
Park, and George Bruce in Manhattan.
