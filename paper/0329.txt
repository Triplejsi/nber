Summary

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS AND UNANTICIPATED MONEY GROWTH
Robert J. Barro and Zvi Hercowitz

An important "empirical regularity" is the strong positive effect of money

shocks on output and employment. One strand of business cycle theory relates
this finding to temporary confusions between absolute and relative price

changes. These models predict positive output effects of unperceived monetary
movements, but the quantitative importance of unperceived shifts in nominal

aggregates is subject to question. Another strand of theory, based on long-term
nominal contracts and analogous price-setting institutions, generates output

effects from unanticipated, but not necessarily contemporaneously unperceived,

money shocks. However, the real effects of unpredicted, but contemporaneously
understood, monetary changes are not obviously consistent with efficient

institutional arrangements. The present paper provides some empirical evidence
on the two types of theories by analyzing the output effects associated with
revisions in the money stock data, where the revisions are interpreted as

components of unperceived monetary movements. The revisions turn out to
have no significant explanatory power for output. Previous findings that
innovations from an estimated money growth equation have a significant output
effect remain intact when the revisions are included as separate explanatory

variables. Overall, the study provides a small amount of evidence against
the special role of unperceived, as opposed to unanticipated, money movements
as a determinant of business fluctuations.

Business cycle theories of the sort constructed by Friedman
(1968), Phelps (1970), Lucas (1972, 1973, 1975), and

Barro

(1976,

1978b) assume that individuals can be temporarily confused between

absolute and relative price changes. Monetary surprises have transitory
real effects in these models because these disturbatices are temporarily

misperceived as real shocks. The dependence of these theories on unperceived movements in nominal variables may be a shortcoming. In
particular, if more rapid observation of general price indices or money
stock measures would substantially lessen the amplitude of business
cycles, then it is surprising that this mOre rapid observation does

not take place through a combination of individual information-gathering

efforts and improved government reporting. One counter-argument is
that individual fortunes may be much more dependent on relative price

and income changes than on general business fluctuations. In this
circumstance it may not pay for individuals to spend a great deal of
effort in assessing contemporaneous movements in global variables ex-

cept to assist in gaining a clearer view o local changes.
Another argument is that, for example, the existing money stock
data provide conceptually inappropriate measures of the pertinent
underlying "nominal't disturbances. This view seems to underlie the
approach of Sargent and Sims (1977), who model the business cycle as

being generated by inherently unobservable shocks. However, this
approach does not account for the apparently strong explanatory power

—2—

of monetary shocks--as measured from standard money stock
definitions--for the business cycle, as reported, for example,
in Barro (1977a, 1978a).

A different theoretical argument is that purely nominal shocks
influence real behavior not because these shocks are contemporaneously
unperceived, but rather because these shocks were unpredictable

at earlier dates. The imposition of unanticipated, but not
necessarily contemporaneously unperceived, money movements on an

economy with long-term nominal contracts is viewed as a source
of business fluctuations in models constructed by Gray (1976) and

Fischer (1977), among others. These models have the strength of
relying on unpredictable money movements--which can plausibly be
assumed to be of substantial magnitude--rather than on unperceived

monetary changes. The shortcoming of these theories, as discussed
in Barro (1977b), is that the real effects of unpredicted, but
contemporaneously perceived, monetary changes are not obviously

consistent with efficient contractual arrangements
The empirical analysis in Barro (1977a, 1978a) reports
substantial effects on unemployment and output of discrepancies
between actual money growth and the growth that could have been

predicted from a set of explanatory variables. These results are
consistent with either the unperceived money or unpredicted money
models (with predictions generated one year earlier) and do not
discriminate between these two varieties of business cycle theories.

—3-.

Therefore, a comparison of these theories--which have some differences
in terms of policy implications--requires some additional empirical
evidence.

One part of monetary surprises that seems classifiable as
temporarily unperceived is the amount that corresponds to revisions

in the published data. Further, these changes--even measured in
terms of growth rate effects, rather than as changes in the
measured levels of the money stock (which sometimes apply equally
to past dates)-—are occasionally substantial, amounting to as much

as 1-2% of Ml on an annual average basis. However, the average
magnitude of the revisions, in terms of growth rate discrepancies,
turns out to be only about .OOLL on an annual average basis from

l98 to 1975.
The objective in the present paper is to test whether
Ytunanticipated money growth,t'

as

measured in the research cited

above, has explanatory value for unemployment and output because
it proxies for unperceived money growth, as measured by the

data revisions. However, this test cannot fully discriminate between the unperceived versus unpredicted monetary-effects models,
since a one-to-one identification of unperceived money growth with

the data revisions does not seem reasonable. To preview the
results, it turns out that the measures of unperceived money growth

based on the data revisions have no siificant explanatory value
for unemployment and outut.

-4-

Measure of Data Revisions

Regular revisions of the money stock data published by the Federal
Reserve involve refinements (benchmark adjustments) to estimates of deposits

and vault cash at nQm-member banks. Changes in seasonal adjustment
factors are not considered in the present analysis, which deals

only with annual average data. Some other revisions involve shifts
in concepts--for example, the change in October 1960 to include

in the money stock the demand deposits that are dte to mutual
savings banks and foreign banks--or shifts in procedures, such as
the change in October 1969 that eliminated the (incorrect) subtraction of cash items in the process of collection at foreign

branches of U.S. banks. Another important change was the shift
in October 1960 to daily average figures, as applied ex post to
data starting in 1947.

Definitional changes that produce a shift in the overall level
of the measured money stock seem unlikely to have significant
real effects, especially since estimates of different concepts of
money could already have been generated prior to the revisions.
In order to filter out this type of effect, we base our analysis

on monetary growth rates. Our basic series is the growth rate that
could have been calculated from the annual average of the first
reports of money for each month (which appeared with a one- to
two morth lag over the sample period), relative to the annual
average of money applicable to dates 12 months previous. That is,

—5—

for year t, the first reports on Ml for each month are averaged
to obtain the contemporaneously perceived level, tMt, where the
first time subscript denotes the date at which estimates are made

to apply to the date indicated by the second subscript. The
values for each month in the preceding year--as reported at the
time of the first report for each corresponding month this year--

are averaged to obtain M_i. The annual average perceived money
growth rate is then calculated as tDMt
The perceived money growth rate is compared with the estimate
of money growth that is available later based on "final" revised
figures, DMt E

We have also considered an alternative concept of measurement

error for money growth rates denoted

(table 1, col. 10) that

comprises only the benchmark adjustments to the money stock. For
example, this concept eliminates the effect of the conceptual and
procedural changes in 1960 and 1969 that implied large "revisions"

for those years. With only benchmark changes considered, the average

ranging from 6 to 2L.. The overall conclusions are, first, the measures
of unperceived money growth based on the data revisions add nothing
to the explanation of unemployment and output, and second, the measure
of unanticipated money growth (DMR) does not have explanatory power because of a proxying for the unperceived money growth measures.

Relation of Initial and Final Money Stock Data
We have briefly considered the possibility that the initially
published money stock figures are not efficient predictions for the
?Ifinal?! data. An estimated equation over 1950-75 yields

value for money growth from date t-2 to t-1, as perceived at date t

(table 1, col. 9). The measurement error for last year as perceived

currently, (tDMi -

_iDMt_i),

does not have significant explanatory

value for this year's error. Although the constant in eq. (1)
differs significantly from zero, the addition of a constant to the
c-values would not alter the above analysis of monetary effects on

economic activity. The variable, tDMt_l, and monetary variables
referring to earlier dates are also insignificant in equations with

(DM

the dependent :variable.

The Durbin-Watson Statistic for equation (1), 1.3, indicates
significant positive serial correlation in the residuals-- in

particular, the final residual for date t-l, (DMi -

does have significant explanatory value for the current error,
(DMt -

DMt).

However, last year's residual, which depends on

DMi, is not observable at date t.

Conclusions
The principal conclusion is that the discrepancy between initial
and final reports on money growth rates has no explanatory power

for unemployment and output. A possible interpretation is that
unanticipated money growth, as measured in earlier studies, has
strong explanatory power because it reflects unpredicted monetary

movements, rather than unperceived money growth, per se.1 This
interpretation

is disturbing

because the strongest

series on initial and final money stock reports begins

with 1947 because of the changes instituted in the October 1960
Federal Reserve Bulletin, which were not applied ex post to data

before 1947. "Final" money reports are not yet available for 1976-77,
but the main revisions for 1975 and earlier years have probably
already occurred.

out

to be insignificant for samples that exclude the l946-48 years.

Another suggestion is that measurement errors in the money
stock have not had much significance for the business cycle.

There-

fore, improvements in reporting procedures, such as more frequent
sampling of non-member banks (or the information gains yielded by

an increase in Federal Reserve membership), would not have important
implications for the behavior of unemployment and output.

Notes to Table 1:

The basic data are three different monthly series of Ml, obtained
from the Federal Reserve Bulletin from January 1945 to March 1978.

The first series consists of first reports on Ml, made a month or

two after the date to which the figures correspond. The second is
the money stock as published 12 months after the first report. These
figures include, therefore, the revisions made to the Ml measures

during these one-year periods. The third series consists of the
"final" figures for Ml--that is, they include all the revisions
through March 1978.

The annual averages of the three series appear in Table 1, where
tMt in column 1 is the first reported money stock, t+lMt in column 2
is the one reported one year later, and Mt in Column 3 is the final

measure of Ml.*

log(M/M1) in column 4 measures the annual average
growth rate of the money stock as it could be computed during year t

with the data published up to that time. DMt

column 5 is the growth rate of M1 based on the "final" reports for

Column 10, the discrepancy between DM and tDMt with only
benchmark revisions to the money stock data considered.

The revisions made to the reported money stock are of four

types: a) Benchmark adjustments, b) Revisions concerning "cash
items in the process of collection" and Federal Reserve float,
c) Changes in coverage and d) Updating of seasonal adjustment

factors. The last type is not considered in the present analysis
of annual average data.

Benchmark adjustments;

Daily data on demand deposits and vault cash held at member
banks are reported to the Federal Reserve for the purpose of

computing required reserves. Since similar data are not available
for non-member banks, their deposits and vault cash are estimated
by the Federal Reserve based on call reports made twice a year,

or since 1973 four times a year, and from current data from member

-3-

banks. These adjustments were made regularly during the entire
period of the sample. By their nature, these revisions affect only
the current growth rate without changing past levels of Ml.

The largest benchmark revisions correspond to February 1973--

an increase in the reported money stock for 1972 by $1.6 billion,
or 0.7 per cent; and to February 1974--an increase in the reported
Ml figure for June-October 1973 by 2,5 billion, or 1.0 per cent.

A large downward adjustment was made in December 1970, which produced
a decrease in the reported Ml figure for June-October 1970 by about

$1 billion. However, this revision was obscured by an even larger

upward "cash items" adjustment. See below.

"Cash items in process of collection" and Federal Reserve float
adjustments;

Until the clearing of checks is completed, the amounts
involved appear as demand deposits in the books of two banks at

the same time. Double-counting is avoided by subtracting these
items and the Federal Reserve float* from gross demand deposits.

However, the "cash items" reported by banks contain amounts that
should not be subtracted from demand deposits--for example, checks

credited to the account of a commercial bank. The large revisions
*

The Federal Reserve float is the credit that member banks
have received for checks forwarded to a Federal Reserve Bank for
collection, before the collection has been accomplished. The
float was first subtracted from the reported Ml figures with the
October 1960 revisions.

-4-

made in October 1969 and December 1970 were aimed at correcting
downward biases in measurement of Ml because of excessive "cash

items" deductions. The-February 1973 revision involved a similar
bias in the Federal Reserve float.

In the late 1960's the accelerating amount of Eurodollar

borrowings and repayments inflated the "cash items." Before
July 1969 "cash items" at foreign branches of U.S. banks were
subtracted from the domestic bank demand deposits for the

purposes of determining reserves and money stocks.* The October
1969 revision corrects this bias in the reported money stock.

Since these "cash items" were rapidly increasing, the correction
implied that Ml was growing in 1968 and 1969 much faster than had
been reported previously.

The similar revision of December 1970 involved the clearing
of checks of some increasingly active financial corporations.**
This revision implied an even faster reported growth rate of Ml for

1969 and a higher rate for 1970 than reported initially. This change
was partially offset by the large downward benchmark adjustment in
1970, as mentioned above.

Changes in coverage:

Deposits held by foreign and mutual savings banks were added

to the Ml measure in the October 1960 revision. In August 1962
foreign balances held at Federal Reserve banks, including those due
to foreign governments, central banks and international institutions

were added to the Ml measure. (The appropriateness of these changes

can be debated, but the aiounts involved are small). In December
1970, deposits held in U.S. agencies of foreign banks and in

internationally-oriented agencies of U.S. banks were added to Ml.
These extensions of coverage did not materially affect the
measured growth rates of M1.
