SUMMARY

This paper presents estimates of static and dynamic general equilibrium
resource allocation effects for four alternative plans for corporate and

personal income tax integration in the U.S. A medium—scale numerical general
equilibrium model is used which integrates the U.S. tax system with consumer
demand behavior by household and producer behavior by industry.
Results indicate that total integration of personal and corporate taxes
would yield an annual static efficiency gain of around $4 billion (1973

dollars). Partial integration plans yield less. Dynamic effects are larger,
and our analysis indicates that full integration may yield gains whose present
value is as large as $400 billion or 0.8% of the discounted present value of
the GNP stream to the U.S. economy after correction for population growth.

Plans differ in their distributional impacts, although these findings depend

on the nature of replacement taxes used to preserve government revenues. The
size of dynamic resource allocation effects are sensitive to the choice of
the replacement tax, while static gains are reasonably robust.

This paper presents estimates of static and dynamic general

equilibrium resource allocation effects for four alternative plans
for corporate and personal income tax integration in the U.S. A
medium—scale numerical general equilibrium model is used which integrates
the U.S. tax system with consumer demand behavior by household and

producer behavior by industry.

Results indicate that total integration of personal and corporate
taxes would yield an annual static efficiency gain of around $6 billion

(1973 dollars). Partial integration plans yield less. Dynamic effects
are

larger, and our analysis indicates that full

integration

may

yield

gains whose present value is as large as $400 billion or 1.0% of the
discounted present value of the GNP stream to the U.S. economy after

correction for population growth. Plans differ in their distributional
impacts, although these findings depend

on the nature of replacement

taxes used to preserve government revenues. The size of dynamic resource

allocation effects are sensitive to the choicfe of the replacement tax,
while Static gains are reasonably robust.
I. The Taxation of Corporate Income

A corporate tax which operates separately from the personal income

tax

is widely acknowledged to lead to a number of problems. It creates

a ttdoubletI taxation of

net

of corporate

corporate income. Dividends

tax profits and

are

are paid out of

further taxed under the personal

income

tax. Retained earnings, to the e:tent they are capitalized in

higher

share values, are also taxed twice, although

1

only fractionally

2

and on a deferred basis by the personal incon tax. This double taxation
may reduce overall rates of return and adversely affect capital accumu—
latiori.
A second problem is often referred to as the ttlO_iflIt effect.

The efficiency of capital markets is iaired due to the deferral advantage
given to retained earnings; firms can reinvest retained earnings in
projects with a low yield and their shareholders can still earn a higher
net of tax return than if the funds were distributed as dividends and
reinvested

elsewhere. Thirdly, since only equity returns are subject to

corporate taxes, there is a bias towards debt finance, potentially dis-

torting corporate financial policies. Finally, the corporate tax
introduces higher effective tax rates in soms industries than others,

due to special provisions in the corporate tax law and to the varying

to

degrees

which industries are incorporated. These tax rate differentials

further disrupt an efficient allocation of capital. 1 Integration plans
seek to remove or mitigate these features by linking personal income

tax liabilities of stockholders (either on dividends or on all earnings)
to the corporate tax liabilities of the firms.
A variety of plans have been proposed over the

years, but these

move only part way to a full integration of personal and
corporate taxation. The coon objective of all these tax integration
plans is to improve the efficiency of the ecOnomy through beneficial
typically

resource

reallocation in both a static and a dynamic sense. In this

paper four corporate tax integration alternatives are considered, each
differing in the extent to which they remove the undesirable features
of the present corporate income tax mentioned above.

3

Plan 1: Total Integration: Under this alternative the corporate

tax is eliminatd, and the personal income tax is modified to
tax total shareholder earnings rather than just dividends. When capital
gains are realized, the tax basis is set at the original purchase price
income

plus the retained earnings cumulated during the holding period. This

last feature avoids a double tax on retained earnings capitalized in
higher stock prices. However, if the basis is not re—setfor inflation,
the base for capital gains tax will include pure nominal appreciation.
This amounts to a capital wealth levy. We evaluate this partnership
integration plan with and without inflation

total integration plans are the most comprehensive we consider

and contain modifications to the income tax which, if they had originally

been made, would

have

dispensed with the need for a separate corporate

tax. Industrial distortions through the corporate tax

are

removed as

is the corporate tax distortion of interteniporal consumption choice.

Plan 2: Dividend Deduction from

Corporate

Income Tax Base: This

simply removes the "double" taxation of dividends by making them

deductible from taxable corporate income. Capital gains taxation of

is unaltered, and the corporate income tax

is

effectively

into a tax on retained earnings only. If current differences

in- retention policies by industry

remain, then some industrial discrixn—

ination would continue within the corporate tax.

Plan 3: Dividend Deduction from Personal Income Tax Base: An
alternative

a

way of removing "double" taxation of dividends

dividend deduction from

is to allow

personal income tax rather than from the

corporate income tax. Capital gains taxation is again unaltered.

Under

4

this

plan, all corporate earnings are taxed at the corporate tax rate,

and none are taxed at the persona]. 1ncoa tax rate. As with Plan 2,

different retention policies by industry, soa industrial discrimination will remain under the corporate tax.
under

Plan 4: Dividend "Gross Up": This was the plan most actively
discussed in the U.S. tax reform debate during 1977. It seeks to

reduce rather than remove the double taxation of dividends. Part of
the

to

income tax paid by corporations is

given as an income tax credit

stockholders when dividends are distributed.2 The credit is taxable,

hence the description "gross up." Because of the partial nature of the
credit, none of the distortions listed above can be wholly removed.

integration plans should incorporate the interacting nature of the

efficiency and distributional effects involved. While a new post—•

balanced growth path in terms of the 1973 data we use. Savings decisions

in each period are based on myopic expectations on the rate of retuni
to

capital; only in a steady state are these expectations correct.

Nineteen producer good industries, 16 consur expenditure
items, and 12 consumer types classified by income range are identified

and shown in Table 1. These dimensions are governed by a trade—off
between model complexity, data availability, and computational expense.
Capital and labor services are the primary factor inputs used by
industry, and these are owned by consumer groups in different proportions.
These two factors are zobile between industries, and their use is
dictated

by the zero profit conditions of perfectly competitive markets.3

Over time the capital service endowment can
and

grow through investment,

the labor service endowment changes through labor force growth. A

labor—leisure choice for households also enters the model. More details

on the structure and specification of the model and its data are given

in Fullerton,

King, Shoven, and Whalley (l979).

II.A Data Sources and Procedures

The ndel requires the assembly of a comprehensive and consistent
microeconomjc data set. Such a data set has not been constructed before
for the U.S., but is essential for general equilibrium analysis of tax—

ation policy.4 This data set provides information on factor use by
industry (and taxes paid for these), intermediate use of products, outputs
of both producer and consumer goods, purchases of consumer goods by
household types, incomes by source and by household type, income taxes
paid, and several other items such as business investment and foreign

trade.

merged tax file.
Inconsistencies between'these data sets and general equilibrium
conditions are resolved using systematic adjustment procedures described
in Fullerton, Shoven and Whalley (1978). Effective tax rates and
parameters for equations in the model are estimated from the benchmark

equilibrium data set so as to replicate the consistent 1973 data base.
Economic effects of each tax policy proposal are then estimated by
changing the tax rates and recalculating a simulated equilibrium.
II.B Production
Each

of capital

industry produces a single producer good from a combination

the outputs of other industries.
Factor input decisions are assumed to be made on the basis of cost
services, labor services, and

minimization, and these decisions are affected by the tax system since

the relative producer prices of inputs are altered for each industry
by

taxes.

The use of primary factors by each industry is described by a
separate C.E.S. or Cobb—Douglas production function. The model embodies

a capability for preselection of functional form in addition to selection
of parameter values. The intermediate use of products by industries is
described by a conventional fixed coefficient input—output matrix. This
matrix is derived from published 1970 input—output data for the U.S. and.

9

updated to 1973. No substitution between primary factors and inter-

inputs is permitted.
A number of ttlegalft taxation instruments are treated as

mediate

production taxes and directly affect costs of industries. The corporate
income tax, corporate franchise tax, and the property tax are in
combination

treated as ad valorem taxes on the use of capital services.

The social security tax,

compensation

unemployment insurance, and public workman's

are treated as ad valorem taxes on the use of labor serivces.

It is, of course, debatable whether these treatments are appropriate. Some
recent literature argues for treating the social security tax as a
benefit—related contribution and

for

treating the corporate income tax

as a lump—sum tax or as a tax on the use of equity

instruments.

The distinction we

make between producer and consumer goods enables us to simultaneously
use national accounts data on a producer good classification and the

and

the recently released 1972—73 Consumer Expenditure Survey defined

for consumer goods. The G transition matrix solves the problem of
distinguishing consumer demands for outputs of the trade and transpor-

tation industries from the demands for goods purchased at retail. Each
consumer good requires some trade and transportation for its production.
It also solves the problem of rare consumer purchases of goods such as
"mining"

consumer expenditure Item is savings, and the G matrix

to treat it like other goods. We assume that the demand

for savings depends upon the current rate of return on capital, given by
the

current price of

new

capital goods.5 We thus assume myopic expectations in the sense that

capital services relative to the purchase price of

the current rental and purchase price of capital is expected to prevail
in all future periods. Actual patterns of investment good purchases

are the basis for constructing the co1ui of the transition matrix

which

converts the consumer's demand for savings into demands for producer

goods. This treatment assumes an equality between savings and investment.

Savings of one period result in an equl—proportional increase in the
capital service endowment of households where the conversion between net
investment and capital service units uses a real net—of—tax rate of

return of 4 percent.

Progressive personal Income taxes are incorporated by a sequence

of linear tax function for each consumer. With an intercept that is
usually

negative and a marginal tax rate applied to all income, we can

13

replicate observed 1973 tax payments and still subject income changes

to the appropriate marginal rate. State and local income taxes are
nxdelled as "piggyback" or percentage surcharge taxes applied to the
Federal levy.
Treatment of persona]. income taxes is complicated by the need

to recognize the preferential treatment of certain types of capital
income. Corporate retained earnings which are converted to capital
gains have a lower present value tax liability than do earnings paid
as dividends. Similarly, the extent to which capita]. earnings are
sheltered by the unincorporated Investment Tax Credit will differ by

industry. Thus, the effective personal income tax rate on capital
income will differ by industry. Later we discuss the procedure used
to introduce these preferential tax rates on some personal capital
income, and we discuss their treatment in our ndelling of the
integration plans.
Government purchases are derived from a Cobb—Douglas demand

function defined over producer goods. Government real expenditures

are assumed to equal tax receipts less transfers since the general
equilibrium approach requires that the government budget must be

balanced. The foreign trade sector receives a simple treatment in order

to close the ixdel. By assuming that the net value of exports less
imports for each producer good remains constant, we can calculate the

net quantity transactions at any given vector of

i. Corporate Financial Policies and
the Lock—In Effect
-

There are two important aspects of corporate tax integration

which our xidel does not directly consider, although we have made some
efforts

to examine the sensitivity of our findings to alternative

assumptions on these issues. One problem is the role of corporate
financial policies and the other is the so—called "lock—in" effect.
In recent years a number of authors (Stiglitz, 1973, 1976; King,

1974) have emphasized a view of the corporate tax

as a differential tax

the various financial instruments available for transferring capital
income from firms to individuals. Under this view there are three
on

different ways by which capital income of corporations can be "paid" to

the owners of capital: through interest payments, dividends, and
retentions which are assumed to be converted into capital gains. Each
of these instruments has tax and non—tax advantages and disadvantages

that govern their relative use by industry. By using debt finance,
interest is deductible from the cotporate tax base. This tax advantage
is counteracted by the disadvantage that a heavily debt financed
has

company

a higher probability of bankruptcy and/or takeover. Equity financing

cannot avoid corporate taxation but may result in a large reduction in

personal taxes if a retention policy is employed. Alternatively, though
they have no tax advantage, dividends may

be paid for a variety of other

reasons.

the purposes of the present paper, the important point is
that with changes in tax law, fir-ms can be expected to idify their
For

financial policies. For example, if Plan 2 (dividend deduction from the

13

corporate tax) encourages firms to pay out all earnings in dividends,

then Plan 1 (total. integration) and Plan 2 are identical in their effects.
Lacking good estimates of financial policy elasticity parameters,
we examine various extretre behavioral reactions and calculate the effects
of the tax change given the assumptions involved. We thus cannot claim

a "true" general equilibrium treatnt of corporate financial policies
since adjustments are made to the dividend/retention ratio to estimate
vdel equivalent tax rates before we make our general equilibrium
calculation.
-

With

the "lock—in" effect, the issue is that the deferral advantage

under-the existing personal and corporate tax structure gives a tax

preference to retention by existing firms. New firms entering financial
markets must borrow at higher interest rates than those at which existing
firms can implicitly borrow through retentions. Thus, if existing firms

are slower growing and less efficient, the proper reallocation of
resources to new firms need not take place.
Since we consider a general equilibrium model with constant

returns to scale technology, we do not incorporate an explicit theory
of individual firm behavior, and a reallocation of capital between firms
within an industry does not affect the industry production function. We
ar therefore unable to incorporate efficiency aspects of the lock—in effect.
The resource allocation effects of corporate and personal tax
integration we consider are restricted to interindustry and intertempora].

distortions. Interindus try distortions enter through differential
capital incorre tax rats by industry, and intertemporal distortions affect
savings behavior in the economy and change capital allocation over time.

of reasons, but primarily because of their different dividend and
retention policies. In addition to the corporate income tax, corporate
franchise tax, and property tax, we add another factor tax at the

Bailey

(1969) has shown that close

one—half of long term capital. gains are realized in a relatively

short period, while the remainder is held for varying durations,
averaging perhaps 35 years or more. Weighing.. the advantages of exiusion

and deferral in light of these observations on holding periods leads to a
conclusion that about 25% of nominal capital gains are effecive1y included

in the base of the personal inco tax. Accounting for inflation, however,
we calculate that 73% of real capital gains in 1973 were fully taxed at the

personal level, implying .73 as our g for retained earnings, g.
Each of the four integration plans imply different values for f
and for capital tax rates. Because of the government's balanced budget,
however, it is important that they receive the same real tax revenue in
the simulated equilibrium. Otherwise, the change in the pattern of
government expenditures and transfers would affect the outcome and prevent

the isolation of the effects of the capital tax rate changes. Tax rates
under each plan are therefore modified during computation until the
resulting equilibrium tax yield allows government to make the same real
purchases and give the same real transfers to consumer groups, based on

Laspeyres price indices.7 Different yield preserving taxes, both on
personal income and on capital income by industry, are considered. In
dynamic analyses we consider equal yield tax replacements on a period by

period basis.
The modifications used in our model to represent each plan are
as follows:

from the numerator of the new capital tax rate calculation.

The

taxes and

time with increment of the capital and labor service endowments of the economy through
savings and population growth. We consider
e_ui1ibria at 10 year periods with an

appropriate treatment of the terminal conditions. The dynamic compensating variations

the first period discount factor is unchanged.

earlier, such that taxes are scaled up to

meet tax revenues

the corresponding period of the previous tax regime. We consider

lump—sum adjustments to income taxes along with additive and multiplicative

scaling of marginal income tax rates.
Interindustry discrimination is reduced enough to provide a $6

billion static welfare gain ineach year (in 1973 dollars) for the cases with

either

multiplicative or additive scaling and inflation indexation of capital gains

taxes. Without this price level correction, the efficiency gains are

less. Dynamic gains are sensitive to the replacement yield

slightly

preserving tax considered. With lump—sum replacement a gain of $404

billion occurs, and with multiplicative scaling a gain of $180 billion
occurs. These figures are to be compared with a $42 trillion discounted
present value of the future income stream for the U.S. economy under the

present tax system (after correction for population growth, in 1973 prices).
The sensitivity of these dynamic results to the replacement tax can be
explained

by the positive correlation between income and proportion

of

income saved. Since multiplicative scaling collects more tax revenue
from high—income groups, it creates a greater distortion in their inter—
temporal

choices.

Static equity effects provide progressive gains to income brackets,
shown in Table 4, with every class enjoying increased real income. The
importance of the structure of the replacement yield preserving tax is
apparent from Table 4, multiplicative scaling helping lower—income groups

substantially more.
We do not need to consider changes in financial policies under this

plan. With full integration, all forms of capital income are taxed

26

identically. Since the tax does riot depend on whether capital inco
is paid in interest, dividends, or retained, a change in either the
debt/equity or dividend/retention ratio will not alter the new effective

tax rates or the new f1 for the revised equilibrium calculation. The
resulting solution would thus be the same even if the ratios changed.

Plan 2: Dividend Deduction from Corporate Income Tax Base: Here
dividends are treated like interest for tax purposes, and we first assume
that

corporations continue to retain the same portion of income. The

reduction of the corporate income tax base causes some levelling of

capital tax rates and a resulting $3 billion increase in yearly national
income. Dynamic gains der multiplicative scaling of tax rates are $114
billion. Under a lump—sum

dynamic gains are $196 billion.

The reduced spread of dynamic

results

associated with Plan 2: there is less distortion of intertemporal choice
through scaling. The static distributional impacts are disadvantageous
to

the higher—income groups, reflecting the fact that less income is

taxed at the flat corporate rate and more at the progressive personal rates.

Under our "standard" treatment of Plan2, dividend/retention ratio
is assumed constant even though there does exist an incentive to replace

retained earnings with now non—taxed dividends. For this reason we also
consider the extreme case where all corporate earnings are distributed.

The corporate income tax would thus be effectively eliminated, and

calculations would proceed on the assumption that all corporate earnings

dynamic gains are also comparable. These welfare gains are substantially
above the fixed—behavior estimate because corporate decision makers have,

27
in effect, reduced the distortion of the corporate income tax with its

differing effective capital tax rates. The static distributional results
of the Plan 2 extreme—behavior case show nre progressive gains among
consumers.

Plan 3: Dividend Deduction from Personal Income Tax Base: The
reduced tax on dividends again implies lower tax rates on heavily incor-

industries and a levelling of all rates in general. This occurs
through the lower f for dividend paying industries. Static welfare

gains

are about $2 billion per year; dynamic gains under multiplicative

scaling are about the same as Plan 2, at

$113 billion, but under lump—

replacement are lower than Plan 2, at $175 billion. The multiplicative results reflect the importance of the deduction from the upwardly
scaled income tax. As might be expected, Table 4 shows that Plan 3 has

all taxed at the corporate rates instead of being taxed at progressive

with and without the extreme—behavior assumption is less than for Plari 2
because the personal income tax deduction does less to eliminate interindustry dis—

be a trade—off between achieving progressive or proportional income gains

VI. Conclusion
In this paper we have analyzed four alternative plans for corporate
and personal income tax integration in the U.S. by using a recently constructed medium—scale general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy and

tax

system. The paper includes a brief discussion of the model and its

use of data, in addition to outlining characteristics of the integration
plans and their representation in model equivalent form..

Total integration of personal and corporate income taxes is shown
to yield static efficiency gains of $6 billion per year using 1973 data;

29

and the present value dynamic gains range from $414 billion to
$96 billion in 1973 prices, depending on the yield preserving

tax. Dividend deductibility from either the corporate income
tax or the personal income tax results in a static efficiency

increase of slightly less than half of the gains from full

integration. A 15 percent dividend gross—up scheme yields
somewhat less than dividend deduction from the corporate tax but

a little more than deduction from the personal income tax. The
distributional impacts vary among plans; full integration with
a multiplicative scaling of marginal income tax rates to preserve
tax yields is shown to imply a progressive change in the distribution of real income even though every class is better off.

Dividend deductibility from the personal income tax is shown to
have a beneficial impact slightly more advantageous to high—income
groups, while dividend deductibility from the corporate income

tax redistributes from high to low income groups. The dividend
gross—up plan is roughly proportional. In the sensitivity of
dynamic gains to the yield preserving tax we find an interesting

result. It suggests that the potential gains under integration
from removal of intertemporal distortions would be significantly
reduced if marginal income tax rates are raised, particularly if
the higher—income groups, who are also larger savers, face larger
tax rate increases.

1. The competitive model implies net of tax rates of return on capital
are equalized across industry. In a situation where capital tax
rates vary by industry, this equalization requires that the gross

marginal

productivity of capital differ among the industries. The

efficiency gain accomplished by reducing the differential capital

tax rates is

due to the reallocation of capital towards industries

where it is more productive.

2. A 15 percent credit was often mentioned and is modelled here. A
further possibility discussed was that differential credits might
be given depending on the industry in which a company operates; this
is not modelled.

3. Future extensions of this approach could disaggregate labor into
skill types since these might have different rates of substitution

for capital. Similarly, capital could eventually be broken down
into land, equipment and structures, or some other useful definitions.

4. Earler data sets of this type for the U.K. have been used by Whalley
(1975) and Piggott and Whalley (1977).

model a 30% savings subsidy within the income tax framework. This
proportion reflects data from Flow of Funds accounts. Another 20%
of savings through owner occupied housing is also taxed on an
expenditure tax basis, indicating that the U.S. is approcLniately

half—way

between income and expenditure taxation. Housing tax

preferences are also captired by the model as discussed below.

7. Operation of the equal yield calculation is discussed in Shoveri and
Whalley (1977).

8. Because of the general equilibrium nature of these calculations,
both sources and uses effects are included in the Table 4

distributional results. The rental price of capital rises in the
simulated equilibrium. Low—income consumers tend to purchase outputs

of lightly—taxed, capital—intensive industries like housing, agriculture,
and petroleum. Thus the uses side of income has some regressive

effects. On the sources side, note that the capital/labor ratio of
income from our data is bowl—shaped over income groups. This is

largely due to their age structure. Since our model calculates a
long—run equilibrium, where homogeneous capital is reallocated
among industries, the new higher return to capital is earned by all
capital owners regardless

of their original portfolio. The higher

of capital causes bowl—shaped gains on the sources side of

income.

Although the simulated equilibrium is a Pareto improvement over the
benchmark 1973 equilibrium, we have said nothing about the possible

paths between the two. Short—run losses and transition costs should

10. This additional information is available from the authors on request.
11. The U—shaped gains of the additive replacement can be explained by

the higher return to capital in the simulated equilibrium. The
capital/labor

ratio of ino is greatest for the low—income (retired)

and again for high—inco individuals.
12. Here, again, the spread between the dynamic welfare gains is less

than that of full integration because this plan involves smaller
revenue

loss than full integration. Multiplicative scaling makes

most revenue from high—income, high—saving consumers, and it

thus reduces future capital stocks and incomes. The dynamic lump—
sum and additive cases show that the dividend gross—up does

substantially

less to improve interindustry resource allocation

than other plans.
