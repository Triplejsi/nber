Coherency Conditions in Simultaneous Linear Equation Models
with Endogenous Switching Regimes
SUNMARY
S

In

modelling disequilibrium macroeconomic systems which one would

want to subject to econometric estimation one typically faces the problem

of whether the structural model can determine a unique equilibrium. The
problem inherits a special form because the regimes in which the equilibria

can lie are each linear. By placing restrictions on the parameters that
insure the uniqueness of such a solution for each value of the exogenous
and random variables, we can improve the estimation procedure.

This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness

——or "coherency." These conditions are applied to a variety of models that
have been prominent in the literature on econometrics with 'switching regimes'

such as those of self—selectivity (Maddala), simultaneous equation tobit and
probit (Amemiya, Schmidt) and multi—market macroeconomic disequilibrium
(Gourieroux, Laffont and Nonfort).

Let us consider a general econometric model defined as
follows

g

where

'

x u
,

,

0) =

0

is a vector of eadogenous variables,

of exogenous variables,

x is a vector

u is a vector of perturbations, 0 is a

vector of unknown parameters and g is a known vector function.

If this model is to be used for econometric purposes, it
must associate a unique value of

x ,

u

and 0

;

y with any admissible value of

in other words, the model must have a well—defined

reduced form

= h
(x ,

u

'

0)

In the sequel we shall call "coherency conditions" the condi-

tions on the parameters 0 that insure this property.

This coherency problem must be distinguished from the identifiability problem which can be meaningfully stated only for a model
satisfying the coherency property. Indeed the identifiability of a
model, which is the uniqueness of the parameters of the model given the
distribution of the observable variables, presupposes the existence
of a well—defined distribution for the endogenous variables. For
instance, in the general linear model

Byt+Cxu
the coherency condition reduces to the invertibility of B (i.e.

det B 0 ) whereas the first—order identifiability amounts to the
uniqueness of B and C given B' C

—2

In

non linear models the issue of coherency is usually

incompletely dealt with by assuming the differentiability of g and
requiring a non vanishing Jacobian

a

g

The latter condition

a

insures

only locally the obtainability of a reduced form. Moreover,

the constraints implied on the parameters are never spelled out.

In this paper we provide an explicit solution of the coherency problem for a particular class of non linear models, namely the
class of simultaneous linear equation models with endogenously swit-

ching regimes. In this case g is piecewise linear in y and the
coherency property is the invertibility of this piecewise linear
mapping.

Recently the literature has offered a large variety of
such models, in particular the self—selectivity models (e.g. MADDALA
9]), the simultaneous equation Probit and Tobit models (e.g.

AMENIYA

[1], SC1IDT

[13])

or

the simultaneous equation disequilibrium

models (e.g. GOURIEROUX,LAFFONT and MONFORT [3]).

In the next four sections we provide necessary and sufficient
conditions of coherency for the general piecewise linear model under
four different sets of assumptions. Each case is illustrated by various
examples

borrowed from the literature.

that case, the relevant partition of P' in cones may, have less than
elements.

We will see in the examples below that the possibility of
having a well—defined reduced form in a model where the structural
form is piecewise linear depends on the invertibility of a mapping

suchas f
In this section we assume, as it is often the case in appli-

cations, that the matrices A1 are constrained in such a way that the
function f is continuous. We can then state our first invertibility
theorem1'.

is easy to verify that the mappings (A.) coincide on

the common boundaries of the cones (C.) on which they are relevant.

It is worth pointing out the difference which exists between
the coherency conditions and the stability conditions of the "natural"

The linearization of this system around the equilibrium (Q

yields

—F' y2F'

—G'

Therefore,

—Q

the adjustment process is locally stable if and

only if the real parts of the characteristic values of the matrix

—F'

y2F']
are negative. The sum

of

the characteristic values

y4G'
is negative, since the trace —

(F'

+

G')

is negative. The product of

the characteristic values equal to the determinant F' G' (1 —

2

must therefore be positive in order that the real parts of the characteristic values be negative (actually the characteristic values are

real in this particular case ). The local stability of the quantity
adjustment processes in every regime is therefore equivalent to the
coherency conditions.

The generalization of this approach to the n —market case
is straightforcard. The model can be written as3):

The coincidence on the coon boundaries of these cones is
easily checked. The coherency condition requires therefore that the
determinants of all these matrices be of the same sign. This is a
quite messy condition. However it is much weaker than a condition of

stability of each of these matrices (A1)

Beyond the n = 2

case, stability implies coherency but not

the converse. Indeed stability requires that the real parts of the
characteristic values be negative. Since complex characteristic values
always appear in pairs of conjugate values, the determinant which equals
the product of characteristic values is, under the stability conditions,

Example 2.2.

We know from economic theory that there exists a correspondence of possible effective demands and any selection in this correspondence is a potential candidate. In GOURIEROUX and alii [31 we used

the Clower effective demand ; QUANDT [11] and ITO [6] use a different
notion which is Continuous on the boundaries of the regimes, and
PORTES [10] has compared these two notions with a third one inspired
from BENASSY [2].

We show below that the different notions of effective demands
are related by piecewise linear mappings.

Consider two sets of linear demand and supply functions

PIECECUISE AFFIWE MAPPINGS

CONES VEFINEV BY ENVOGENOUS VARIABLES.

A natural generalization of the problem considered in section

2 is the case in which the endogenous variables are transformed by
affine mappings. Using the same notations as before, each affine map-

ping is defined on C1 by

B1 (x) = A1 (x) + b1

x E

where A1 is an invertible linear mapping from iR into

and b1E
This kind of model appears when there are, at the same time,
truncated variables (tobit or disequilibrium models) and dunmiy varia-

bles (probit models).

SCHMIDT [13 ]

studied

the "pure" simultaneous probit model,

i.e. the case in which the endogenous variables are either untruncated

or binary ; mathematically this means that all the A1 matrices are
identical. The necessary and sufficient condition for coherency found
by Schmidt is essentially the recursivity •of the model solved in terms

of the untruncated variables.

In the following theorem we propose a sufficient condition
for the general case.

Theorem 3

Under the same assumptions as in theorem 2, if

CO1'JCLLIVING REMARKS

The approach of non linear modelling by piecewise linear
models with endogenously switching regimes, which seems to be powerful
and flexible, probably deserves specific developments.

In this paper we solved the first problem raised by this
approach, namely the coherency problem. The next problem which requires
a systematic study is the identifiability question. The maximum likelihood techniques of estimation and testing are then readily implementable,
however the non differentiability of these models necessitates a
careful study of their asymptotic properties.

To complete the proof we have only to note that the ci1's have
the same sign if and only if the determinants of the A.'s have the same

sign, since det A. =
