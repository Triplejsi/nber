May 1979

The Rate of Obsolescence of Knowledge, Research Gestation Lags
and the Private Rate of Return to Research Resources

SUNMARY

This paper points out the conceptual distinction between the rates
of decay in the physical productivity of traditional capital goods and
that of the appropriate revenues accruing to knowledge—producing activities,
and notes that it is the latter parameter which is required in any study

which constructs a stock of privately marketable knowledge. The rate of
obsolescence of knowledge is estimated from a simple patent renewal and
the estimates are found to be comparable to evidence provided by firms

on the lifespan of the output of their R&D activities. These estimates,
together with mean R&D gestation lags, are then used to correct previous
estimates of the private excess rate of return to investment in research.
We find that after the correction, the private excess rate of return to
investment in research, at least in the early 1960's, was close to zero,
which may explain why firms reduced the fraction of their resources
allocated to research over the subsequent decade.

THE RATE OF OBSOLESCENCE OF KNOWLEDGE, RESEARCH GESTATION LAGS, AND THE
PRIVATE RATE OF RETURN TO RESEARCH RESOURCES

The recent interest of economists in knowledge-producing activities
has had two main strands. The first is an attempt to explain the growth in
the

measured productivity of traditional factors of production by incor-

porating research resources in production function and social accounting
frameworks; (for a review see Griliches, 1973, and idem,

forthcoming)

The second derives from two fundamental characteristics of knowledge as
an

economic commodity, its low or zero cost of reproduction and the diffi-

culty of excluding others from its use. These features give knowledge the
character of a public good and suggest that the structure of market incentives may not elicit the socially desirable level (or pattern) of research

and development expenditures. In particular, it has been argued that market incentives may create an underinvestment in knowledge—producing activities (see Arrow, 1962, for a discussion) .

In

order to investigate this

possibility, economists have applied the techniques of productivity analysis
and estimated the private (and social) rate of return to research from production functions incorporating research resources as a factor of production.
The estimates of the private return for the late 1950's and early 1960's

fall in the range of 30—45 percent.1 Despite these high estimated private
rates of return, the share of industrial resources allocated to research

expenditures declined steadily over the succeeding decade.2 This suggests
1For example, see Griliches (forthcoming) and Mansfield (1965). Note that
both these studies are based on firm or micro data. More aggregative data
bases are not directly relevant to estimates of the private rate of return
to research.

The share of net sales of manufacturing firms devoted to R&D has declined
from 0.046 in 1963 to 0.029 in 1974, or by about 40 percent. See NSF

a paradox: why has research effort been receiving less attention from
industrial firms if the private rate of return to research is so attractive?

o important parameters in these calculations of the

private

return

to research are the rate of decay of the private revenues accruing to industrially-produced knowledge and the mean lag between the deployment of

research resources and the beginning of that stream of revenues. These
parameters, of course, are necessary ingredients in any study which involves

a measurement of the stock of privately marketable knowledge. The rate of
decay in the returns from research has not previously been estimated. In
this paper we present a method of explicitly estimating that parameter.
We also use information provided by others to calculate the approximate
mean R & D gestation lags. Since previous research has not included the
latter and seems to have seriously understated the rate of decay of appro—
priable revenues in calculations of the private rate of return to research
expenditures, we then use our estimates to improve on previous results on
this rate of return.

Of course, all previous work in this area has been forced to make some
assumption, either implicit or explicit, about the value of the decay rate.
The problem arises because it has been assumed to be similar to the rate of

decay in the physical productivity of traditional capital goods. The fact
that the rate of deterioration of traditional capital and the rate of decay
in appropriable revenues from knowledge arise from two different sets of
circumstances seems to have been ignored..3

The employment of research resources by a private firm produces new

knowledge, with some gestation lag. The new knowledge or innovation may be
31t is common to find an assumed rate of decay of the knowledge produced by
firms of between 0.04 and 0.07 (Mansfield, 1965). Griliches (forthcoming
1978) noting some of the conceptual distinctions between the rates of decay
in traditional capital and in research, assumes an upper bound of 0.10 for
the latter.

a cost—reducing process, a product, or some combination of the two. The
knowledge—producing firm earns a return either through net revenues from
the sale of its own output embodying the new knowledge, or by license and
non—monetary returns collected from other firms which lease the innovation.
Since the private rate of return to research depends on the present value
of the revenues which accrue to the sale of the knowledge produced, the
conceptually appropriate rate of depreciation is the rate at which the

appropriable revenues decline for the innovating firm. However, as Boulding
(1966) noted, knowledge, unlike traditional capital, does not obey the laws

of (physical) conservation. The rate of decay in the revenues accruing to
the producer of the innovation derives not from any decay in the productivity of knowledge but rather from two related points regarding its market
valuation, namely, that it is difficult to maintain the ability to appropriate the benefits from knowledge and that new innovations are developed

which partly or entirely displace the original innovation. Indeed, the
very use of the new knowledge in any productive way will tend to spread and
reveal it to other economic agents, as will the mobility of scientific

personnel. One might expect then that the rate of decay of appropriable
revenues would be quite high, and certainly considerably greater than the
rate of deterioration in the physical productivity of traditional capital.3a
In Section I we examine two independent pieces of evidence bearing on

the rate of decay of appropriable revenues. Next, the information from various sources on the mean lag between R&D expenditures and the beginning of the

should be noted that the models used in this paper do not assume that
the rate of decay in appropriable revenues is exogenous to the firm's
decision—making process. In a dynamic context, a firm possessing an inno-

3aIt

vation has to choose between increasing present revenues and inducing
entry, and charging smaller royalties in order to forestall entry. This
choice is the basis of Gaskin's (1971) dynamic limit pricing analysis of

rough idea of how seriously the existing estimates of the private rate of
return to research overstate the true private rate of return. Brief concluding
remarks follow.

3.1. The Rate of Decay of Appropriable Revenues
The first piece of evidence on the rate of decay in appropriable revenues
(

hereafter,

the rate of decay) is based on data presented in Federico (1958).

Federico provides observations on the percentage of patents of various ages
which were renewed by payment of mandatory annual renewal fees during the period
1930-39 in the United Kingdom, Germany,

France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

A theoretical model of patent renewal will lead directly to a procedure for
estimating the rate of decay from these data.

Consider a patented innovation whose annual renewal requires payment of a

stipulated fee. Letting r(t) and c(t) denote the appropriahie revenues and the
renewal fee in year t, the discounted value of net revenues accruing to the
innovation over its lifespan, V(T),

Alternatively, Scherer (1965) cites evidence presented in Sanders and others
(1958) which indicates that the value of patents tends to distribute Pareto-Levy.

If f(r) is strictly declining (e.g. Pareto-Levy), P(t) will be a stricfly

decreasing, convex function of patent age, as shown by curve 2. Figure lb
presents the actual time paths of P(t) from Federico (1958). Four of the five
curves tend to support Sander's data and are consistent with an underlying

Pareto-Levy distribution of patent values. The time path for Germany, however,
indicates that the underlying distribution for that country has at least one

mode. Since it is futile to estimate both the parameters of the underlying
lognornial (for example) and the decay rate in appropriable revenues from only 18

observations available on Germany, we shall disregard the German data in the
remainder of the empirical work.

We now use this simplified model to obtain rough estimates of the decay

rate of appropriable revenues .

the relative density function of initial revenue is taken to be of the ParetoLevy type:

a/ The data on patent renewal are taken from Federico (1958). These data cover
the percentage of patents of different ages in force during 1930-39 which were

renewed by payment of a mandatory annual renewal fee. For example, if a patent
was granted in 1925, it would appear in the data as 5 years old in 1930, 6 years
old in 1931, and so on. Therefore, the percentage of patents renewed after5 years

Table 1 summarizes the empirical results. The observed value of the
test statistic is 5.4, while the five percent critical value is 5.99. Though
a little high, the test statistic does indicate acceptance of the hypothesis

the patent, but since cost data were not available we were forced to use
net-value data. A cumulative Pareto—Levy distribution was fitted to the
five positive net—value observations on expired patents which therefore
have observable net values. The R2 from this regression was 0.97. Note
that Pareto-Levy distributions with 8 < 1 do not have either a finite mean
or variance and hence do not behave according to the law of large numbers.
Therefore, if the distribution of patent values approximates the distribution of project values, diversification into many independent projects will
not reduce risk. This point was originally made by Nordhaus (1969). Of
course, if the returns to different projects are negatively correlated,
diversification may still reduce risk.

since the estimate of &' is obtained as the ratio of two coefficients, its confidence interval (obtained by using Fieller bounds) is not
symmetric around its point estimate. Three remarks on the robusthess of
these results are also in order. First, the assumption that the revenue

0.25, though consistent with theoretical arguments concerning the

unique characteristics of knowledge as an economic commodity, implies that

earlier researchers have assumed values of 6* which are far too small. In
particular, the lower bound of the 95 percent confidence interval for 6* is
nearly twice the maximum value of the rate of decay of private returns used
in previous research.

There is, of course, the possibility of sample selection bias in our
estimate of 5*.

The rate of decay of patented innovations may differ from

that of all innovations. The direction of the bias is indeterminate since
it depends on the correlation between the patent selection process and the

rates of obsolescence in the universe of all innovations. However, there
are two reasons to believe that the estimates of 6* may be biased downwards.
First, the fact that patents create property rights in the embodied knowledge may result in a lower rate of obsolescence for those innovations which

can be patented. Second, given an innovation which can be patented, it is
easy to show that the innovator will actually take out a patent only if

patenting thwers the rate of decay. As we show presently, however, evidence

revenue. We also experimented with a second-order approximation, namely,
r(t) = r(O)eAt+Bt . The estimates of B and its standard error were both
zero to two places of decimals, and the rest of the results were almost
identical to those reported here. Apparently, market—induced obsolescence
is well approximated by an exponential pattern. Griliches (1963) reaches
the same conclusion with respect to the obsolescence component of the
deterioration in the value of traditional capital goods. Second, the results
from the unweighted regressions were similar to the ones reported above.
The unweighted version of (12) yielded a point estimate of 6*
0.22, with
Fieller bounds of 0.16 to 0.33, and an estimate of = 0.62.
Finally, we can use the unconstrained version of the estimating equation to provide six different estimates of the combination W,6*). The
constrained version, in effect weights the various estimates in an optimal
manner. Five of these unconstrained estimates were (0.63, 0.22), (0.49,
0.32), (0.55, 0.26), (0.65, 0.21), and (0.47, 0.34). The sixth is obtained

of a completely different nature tends to show that whatever bias exists
is negligible.

The second source of evidence on the magnitude of the decay rate of
appropriable revenues is derived from data presented in Wagner (1968) on the
lifespan of applied research and development expenditures.

Survey data on

applied research arid development were collected from about 35 firms with long

R

D experience in 33 product fields, using the product field description

employed by the NSF in its annual industry reports. Included in the survey
was a question on the lifespan of R
the product of the R

D, defined as the period after which

D was "virtually obsolete."

This definition does not correspond directly to the decline in the

appropriable revenues accruing to research and development. However, a rough

correspondence can be established by assing that R

D is virtually obsolete

when the appropriable revenues reach some small fraction of the initial value, anu
then experiment with different fractions to examine the sensitivity of the

are aware is reported in a footnote in Griliches (forthcoming). A regression
of productivity growth against R & D flow and stock intensity variables in
his micro data set yielded an estimated 6' of 0.31. Griliches points out
the discrepancy between this result and the rest of his analysis but offers
no reconciliation.

technical advances. Second, we have not taken into account the time

both an application lag and a mean

Rapoport's data, take into account expenditures on both technically successful

The gestation

deriyed from Rapoport but the application lags are considerably longer,11

causing some discrepancy between the two sets of results. Mansfield (1968),

of these factors would tend to cause upward biases in our estimates of 0.
On the other hand, the R & D costs of technically unsuccessful projects

Since Wagner does not precisely define the "end of AR&D" or the "application

innovations," some caution should be exercised in interpreting the application lags. Wagner does indicate that the longer application interval in
durables reflects in large part the defense—space—atomic-energy oriented

Substitution of this number for Wagner's would bring the two sets of results
closer together and put the total lag at about 1,75 years. For present
purposes, however, a range of values somewhere between 1.2 and 2.5 years is
good enough.12

It is interesting to note that the maximum of this
range is considerably
shorter than the midpoint of the interval between project
inception and
marketing, reflecting the fact that the distribution of research

expenditures on projects is

considerably skewed to the left.

Two points should be noted here. First, since research expenditures
are already included in the measures of traditional capital and labor

expenditures in the production functions used to estimate R' the calculated
private rate of return to research represents an excess return above and
beyond the normal remuneration to traditional factors (see Griliches, 1973).
That is, r may be interpreted as the risk premium attached to research

activity. Second, the estimates of

obtained by other researchers are

calculated by multiplying the estimated sales (value-added) elasticity of
the stock of knowledge tines the ratio of sales to the stock of knowledge.
The stock of knowledge is taken as the undepreciated s.un of research

expenditures over the period of observation; For the calculations in (14)
to be consistent, however, the stock of knowledge must be calculated

according to declining-balance depreciation. We therefore calculate the
depreciated sum of research expenditures with a decay rate of

and then

use this stock of knowledge to convert the estimated sales elasticity into

This has been done for the three values of , corresponding

to the point estimate and FieJier bounds obtained earlier (0.18, 0.25, and

0.36), and for three different values '

Q (0.25,

0.30, and 0.35). The

results are presented in Table 4 for values of 8 equal to 1.75 and 2.0.

13 We thank Zvi Griliches for pointing out this problem and suggesting a
solution. The data for the calculations are taken from NSF (1976,

Table B-i). Three additional points should be noted. First, Griliches'
aggregate gross excess rate of return estimate was about 0.30, while
his estimates for research intensive and non-research intensive industries
were 0.40 and 0.20 respectively. Mansfield's estimates (averaged over
the ten firms he used) range from about 0.20 to 0.30 depending on the

specific assumptions made. Since Griliches' data are far more
comprehensive, we based the calculation of the conversion factor

on them. Second, if private returns to knowledge do in fact decay,
there is an error in the measured stock of knowledge used as an
independent variable in Griliches' regression. However, it can be
shown that the ratio of the variance in measurement error to the
variance in the true stock is less than 0.0026, which can safely be

ignored. That is, the sales elasticity of the stock of knowledge can
be taken directly from Griliches' regression. Finally, the private
rates of return are much less sensitive to changes in 8 than to different

values of *.

Turning to the results, it is apparent that the measured private (net.
excess) rates of return to investment in research are greatly reduced by our
adjustments.

For example, Griliches (forthcoming) reports a gross excess

return of 0.30 which, after correction for an assumed decay rate of 0.10,

translates into a net excess rate of return of 0.20. By contrast, Table 4
indicates that the rate of return associated with

our point estimate of ,

is

=

0.30, evaluated at

between 0.033 and 0.047. In

view

of the

abnormal riskiness associated with research expenditures, these risk premia
would appear to be modest.
in short, Table 4 suggests that the private rates of return to investment

in research and traditional capital are roughly equated at the margin. Another
way of checking this possibility is to ask: what is the decay rate of
appropriable revenues implied by the assumption that firms equate, at the margin,

the private rates of return to investment in research and traditional capital?

With a mean R F4 D lag of 6, the return to a dollar of research is (r1*+l)(l÷r)0,
while for traditional capital, with depreciation rate

3.4. Concluding Remarks

In

this paper we stress the conceptual distinction between the rates

of decay in the physical productivity of traditional capital goods and that
of the appropriable revenues which accrue to knowledge-producing activities.
An estimate of the private rate of obsolescence of knowledge is necessary

—23—

in

any study which requires constructing a stock of privately marketable

knowledge. We estimate this parameter from a simple patent renewal model

and

find the estimate comparable to evidence provided by firms on the

lifespan of the output of their R &

activities. The empirical results
indicate that the rate of obsolescence is considerably greater than the
D

rates typically assumed in the literature. The estimated decay rates,
together with mean R &

gestation lags, are used to calculate the private
excess rate of return to investment in research. Our results suggest that
the private rate of return to research expenditures, at least in the
early 1960's, was
however,

not

D

unreasonably high. It is important to emphasize,

that in order to

come to conclusions regarding the divergence

between the private and social rates of return to knowledge—producing

activities, information on the social rate of return must be added to the

information contained in this paper." Nonetheless, if our calculations of
the

return are even approximately correct, they do
suggest a partial resolution to the paradox presented in the introduction
private excess rate of

to this chapter: why did private firms steadily reduce the share of
their resources devoted to R & D if their previous research effort was so
highly

profitable? Part of the answer may

be that research was not as pri-

vately profitable as has been thought.
1k

In this connection, it

should be noted that the social rate of decay

well be smaller than the rate of decay of appropriable revenues.

effects in the production of knowledge.
