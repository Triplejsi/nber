Technical Systems and Innovations in Public Libraries

SUMMARY

The extent of use of twenty innovations in the operation of public
libraries is examined in 31 large public library systems across the

country. The innovations include the use of computers in ordering,
cataloging, and circulating materials. The pattern of diffusion of the
innovations across the systems is explored using contingency tables and

discriminant analysis. All the large library systems seem to participate
in early adoption of some innovations; none seem to be pace—setters for

all innovations. The extent of diffusion of some innovations may be
reduced by the development of successive innovations that replace them.
Only some of the innovations seem to be climax technologies that are
likely to persist for longer periods of time.

TECHNICAL SYSTEMS D INNOVATIONS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES

Most

libraries divide. their operations into two parts: public services

technical services. Public services deal directly with. users in
operating facilities and giving advice. Technical services deal with
and

maintaining materials for use. While the specific functions

he divided in exactly the same manner

in every library, technical

services generally involve the selecting, ordering, cataloging, and
processing of materials for use in the. library system. On average, the large
public library systems assign 12.8 percent of their staffs to technical

services. This

essay will

be concerned with technical systems

in

public

libraries including selection,cataloging and airculation control.
Technical

services are concerned with the flow' of

newly acquired

into the library. The main difference between a warehouse stacked

with books and a library- is the character of technical services applied.
Technical services give order to the materials so that they can be matched

to users as directly as possible. The selection of materials puts emphasis
on getting materials that will be used. The cataloging enterprise gives a
shelf number to each item so that the materials will be shelved near related

material. The catalog itself gives reference to the shelf number in a
variety of ways so that a user can find materials based on. titles, authors,
or subjects. Technical services may put labels, covers,. bin4ings, or anti—
theft devices on materials before placing them on shelves. Older materials

may also get preservative treatment, but that is a secondary function of
most technical service operations.

Several other activities will be discussed here even though they

are not normally performed by technical service divisions of the libraries.

The quality of technical services is an important consideration in
evaluating alternative techniques. Some ideas about judging quality are

presented here as the different technical activities are described.

with. brief descriptions, and other book review media. Single copies of

new

titles may be

received by libraries on approval from publishers under

an arrangement called the Graenaway Plan. tinder this regime, the. books

themselves 'may be

before acquisition decisions are made by the

individual library units. Eight—one percent of 31 large public library
system surveyed currently use the Greenaway Plan as indicated in Table 1.

The quality of book selection may reflect errors in acquisition, the

of acquisition, and the costo selectIon. Two kinds of errors can occur

5

in

book selection. The library can fall to buy material that would have

been used—a type L error. Alternatively, the library can buy materials

that are little or never used—a type II error. A most successful book
selection system would buy only materials that are most used and avoid

buying books that are. little. used. One. might want to assign different

advertising campaigns keyed to their publication date. Others have ties

to movies or television. Interest in such materials falls rapidly after

an initial boom. Demand for books

at the library may fall when a

paperback edition beèomes available. The value of materials falls with age,
especially after th.e publication date. Therefore, a library that succeeds
in making materials available to users quickly will be more valuable than a
library that takes six months from publication date to select, order,
catalog, and process new materials.

Of 26 large public libraries willing to estimate the length of time
from publication date until a book is available on the shelf in the library
on average, the mean lag was ii. weeks. Thirteet central city libraries

suburban systems averaged eight weeks. The estimates

weeks in Birmingham to zero in Brooklyn. There are important

differences in the acquisition lag across public libraries, and differences
in selection techniques may play a role.

The public libraries may have automated ordering systems that perform
th.e accounting functions of keeping track of orders and payment. Such systems
may lower costS and increase th.e accuracy of order record keeping. Thirty—
nIne

percent

of the 31 libraries surveyed had automated ordering systems in

1978, as reported in Table 1.

Cataloging

and Processing

Once materials enter the door of the. library, they must be made

accessible to users. The first step is assigning each item a place on
a shelf and the second step is creating references to the item

by

title,

author, and subject so that users can easiiy find materials they are

interested in. The

first step

is accomplished by assigning each item a

unique catalog number that indicates where

th.e item

will

be located on

the shelf. The second step is accomplished by inserting suitable
reference to title,. author,. and subject for the new material in a master

list of materials called a catalog. The physical catalog may be a printed
book (dictionary catalog), a card file, or microfilm. The new book or other
material will be processed by the labelling of the spine, the insertion of
a mark of ownership, and perhaps a pocket and card for circulation control
purposes.

Dewey system.

In the Dewey decimal system, each digit is an appropriate aggregation
of each. subsequent digit: a one digit code given a gross indication of

subject matter; a two digit code is somewhat more specific; and so on up
to a full six digit number. For a relatively small, general collection of
materials, the Dewey shelf order will put like materials together very

successfully.

For a large research collection of materials, the Library of Congress
method may be preferred. When a new topic develops, the Library of Congress
may introduce

a new label not in sequence with previous labels, thus certain

8

new books may not be placed near other related materials. Users of

libraries

will welcome the narrower definitions of subjects and

have less concern for proximity of materials not very closely related in

subject. That is, the helrarchical nature of the Dewey system may be less
important while the better definition of individual subjects may be more
important in a large research library. Tile LC system fractures a small
or moderate size general collection because it is not especially heirarchical.

Thus, the Dewey system is used in all but the Boston Public Library among

the 31 large public library systems surveyed. The Dewey arrangement serves
public libraries well.

The maintenance of a physical catalog once required that each book

be einfned by a skilled cataloger for the purpose of identifying subject.
Investigations may have been required to identify the author in more detail
than given by the title page so that authors with similar names were not

confused. In the first decade of this century the Library of Congress
began selling copies of its catalog cards.3 A library ordered the cards of

The use of the computer as an aid in cataloging has been many

years in coming. In the early 1950's, computer cards were used to sort
cataloging information. Computer cards are limited to 80 characters of
information,, not enough to hold even the full catalog number, author's
name

and

title. Thus, such systems were of limited usefulness because

full catalog information files were not maintained. The Milwaukee Public
Library pioneered in the use of such a card based file, but has not moved
to

more complete use of the computer for cataloging.
In the mid—1960s more sophisticated systems developed, capable of

handling more complete cataloging information files. One such system,
the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC), began batch processing Library

of Congress cataloging data files in 1968. Currently, OCLC makes cataloging

information available via computer terminals and telephone lines. Library

participants can

search

OCLC files for cataloging information, and purchase

catalog cards published on demand. Participating libraries can enter
original cataloging information for materials not located in the OCLC files.
In this way, original cataloging from a variety of sources can be shared.
Sixteen of the 31 libraries use

such

networks as sources of cataloging

information as indicated in Table 2.

Individual libraries developed improved systems internally. More
complete cataloging information is maintained in

files,

such

computer managed data

that a variety of formats of catalogs can be ptoduced. Some

such systems have limited usefulness. The Dallas Public Library, for
example, maintains a Master Bibliographic Data Base. The Base is in a

format that does not allow sorting by subject, however, so the Data Base

can not produce a public use catalog. The card catalog must continue to

12

be maintained.5 The Data Base is used to produce spine labels and book
pockets.

More recently the Prince George's County Public Library in Maryland

developed an internal computer produced cataloging capability. The local
catalog data base, however, is not compatible with Library of Congress
MARC formats so that the catalog information must be manually entered

into the Prince George's system rather than simply being copied from
LC—MARC tapes. The Prince George's system is remarkable because it was
developed in 1972 after the availability of the MARC system tapes.

Montgomery County has a similar system but developed it in 1963 before
MARC was promulgated.
In 1969 the New York Public Library froze their card catalog and

began producing dictionary catalogs of new acquisitions using locally

developed computer software. The format of the computer based catalog
information files, however, is compatible with the Library of Congress'

MARC tapes. Thus the New York Public System can locate Library of
Congress cataloging information by searching computer tapes, and copy
the information for locally acquired material into computer files repre-

senting the local collection. The computer file of catalog information
of locally owned materials is flexible enough to allow production of a
•

full catalog description of each item complete with author, title and

subject references. The computer programs developed at the New York
Public Library were transported to Hennepin County in Minnesota and are

used there. The Bibliotheque Nationale, housed in the Pompidou Center
in Paris, is also making use of the New York Public's computer programs.
The nature of the costs of operating a computer generated cata—
loging capability, however, militate against a library developing and

13

implementing in—house systems. The costs of maintaining the capability
of searching LC—MARC tapes for cataloging information and generating a
computer file of catalog information of locally held materials is sub-

stantial. The marginal cost of processing an additional hundred titles,
given that several hundred are already being processed is quite small.

many libraries by private contractors producing the catalogs for

many libraries.

The catalog contractor receives a list of titles ordered or
received

by its client library. The library may search LC—MARC micro-

fiche and locate an LC—]fARC number for each new book. If the microfiche
do not contain the material, the cataloging information may be produced

locally. The catalog.jobber then searches the LC—MARC tapes and copies
the full LC cataloging information for each item the library has acquired.

Local cataloging may be introduced. Dewey numbers prepared by LC may be
used and fiction,biography, and local materials may be handled in a

variety of ways according to local specification. The jobber then produces a computer output microform

catalog reflecting the holdings of the

local library. Perhaps ten firms

of their services is available.6

Twelve of 31 large public library systems surveyed currently have
computer generated catalogs with cataloging information copied directly

from LC—MRC tapes and three more were seeking contractors in 1978 as
indicated in Table 2. Except for the New York Public Library and

14

Hennepin County, catalog jobbers are used by all of these. Computer
produced catalogs are also generated in Prince George and Montgomery
'Counties

Maryland, but catalog information is manually introduced

systems rather than being copied from LC—MARC. Partial

bibliographic data files are manipulated on computers in Dallas,

Milwaukee, and elsewhere, but these files are insufficient to produce a
computer based catalog.

The computer generated catalog using LC—MARC tapes as the basic
source of information appears to be the climax technology. That is,
other cataloging techniques are likely to be replaced by the catalog

jobbers using LC—MARC tapes as sources. While more sophisticated use
of computers integrating circulation control with the catalog function
are conceivable, they are likely to be built on the LC—MARC produced

local catalog rather than replacing it. In particular, the use of
catalog cards for new materials is declining and cataloging services
that are linked to cards seem likely to be replaced. The OCLC is
basically a card—oriented service and its value may decline.

The online network systems are primarily designed to
support the production of current cataloging materials,
not the conversion to machine readable form of catalo—
ging already in existence. The charges and system
features of these systems are oriented toward the production of catalog cards and other printed products.7
The conversion of existing manual catalogs to machine based catalogs is costly, and may never take place in the largest libraries.

Manual catalogs can simply be frozen, and the machine based catalog begun

with materials acquired after a particular date. The cost of converting
a manual catalog to a machine catalog may run between $1.06 and $3.28

15

(in

1978 prices) per title depending on the number of characters of in-

formation

included in the machine based catalog.8

The success of the LC—MARC based jobber produced catalog depends

in

part on the breadth of coverage of Library of Congress cataloging and

the speed with which LC cataloging information becomes available. For
most standard materials acquired by public libraries Library of Congress

cataloging is available in a timely manner. Prepublication cataloging
is often published in books under the Library of Congress' Cataloging

in Publication program. The Cataloging in Publication information may
change

somewhat after the book is actually published—titles, author's

names, and even subjects may have been misspecified, Therefore, most
libraries insist on ultimate LC—MARC cataloging for their catalogs.

The success of the catalog might be measured by considering the
length of time users take to locate materials, and by considering their
success rate in finding materials, given that the materials are in fact

referenced in the catalog.11 The quality of the catalog is apparently
substantially influenced by the consistency of treatment of materials as

their references are entered into the catalog. While skill on the part
of cataloging librarians in applying standard rules may be important in

maintaining consistency, another procedure may also be important. Cataloging systems may maintain authority files. Authority files are irtde—

pendent lists of names of people and subjects, for use in cataloging.
Considerable effort may be put into maintaining the veracity of the

authority file. New materials to be cataloged may, then, be checked
against the authority files to assure consistency in names and subjects.
In this way, materials on South America can be kept together and referenced together whether called Latin America, South America or something

else. Materials by or aboutMuhammad Ali can be referenced together

creation of local computer based catalogs from LC—MARC tapes

may be enhanced if authority files for the local catalogs are maintained.
The software developed by the New York Public Library included

automated

authority file checks from the late 1960's. In the late 1970's the
Library of Congress is automating its authority files. An important
difference among catalog jobbers may be the extent of local authority

file checks included in the service. Among the jobbers, Autographics

17

and Library Interface Systems include both subject and name authority

file maintenance. Brodart and Blackwell include only subject authority
file checks. A major complaint with the service of OCLC and a similar
catalog information service based at Stanford called BALLOTS is the
lack of any authority files.'2
The quality of the cataloging operation may also be indicated by

the length of time required to catalog an item. The length of time from
when an item is delivered to the library until it is ready for use was

estimated by 27 libraries. On average 52 days elapsed from delivery
to shelving as indicated in Table 1. The suburban libraries, however,
average just 19 days compared with the 78 days required on average in

city libraries. The substantial variance in the cataloging lag in each

group, however, means that the differences in means is not
statistically significant across the geographic types.
The cataloging lag may be shorter for libraries using catalog jobbers
because the request for cataloging can be made when the book is ordered,

a possibility that is examined below. Thus, the cataloging may be
available at the time the book is delivered. The cataloging lag will
then be just the time required to process the book, entering labels and
the like.

A central difficulty with the use of a catalog jobber is the

problem of hiring, monitoring, and replacing the contractor. Many public
library systems are required to accept the lowest bid for a contract and

to rebid contracts every three years. It is difficult to include all
the

dimensions of service quality in the contract. The library will be

concerned with the speed of receipt of the catalog, with the error rate

18

in cataloging materials, and with the skill of authority file maintenance

and checking. Because contract termination for cause will invite heavy
legal expenses and possible chaos if catalog materials cannot be re-

trieved in usable form from the jobber, libraries will be understandably

reluctant to terminate contracts before they expire. Therefore, it may
be appropriate for the contracts to include penalties for slow delivery,
for high error rates, and for inadequate authority file maintenance.

When the contract is rebid a different jobber may win the contract. The
transition from one jobber to another may be difficult and expensive.

One jobber's computer files may not be compatible with another's. The
library may want to specify formats for the catalog and authority files

so that they can be easily transported to other jobbers. Perhaps a
transition period of a few months should be included in the contracts

so that the old and new jobbers can be brought together. When contracts
are rebid, a locality may want to allow the library board to choose among
the three lowest bidders both so that the contractor need not be changed

unless the gains are significant, and so that a contractor can be dis—

missed for poor performance even if it is the lowest bidder. Sophisticated
management is required of the library if contracting services are to yield
high quality services over a long period of time.

Serials

Technical

service operations will also handle serials. Serials

include periodicals

(annual or more frequent regular appearance) as well

as other serials (items published in sequence, not necessarily with

regular periodicity). Libraries typically maintain subscriptions to

serial publications. The library

payments,

must keep track of subscriptions,

receipt of materials, alerting publishers when materials

are

not received, and the cancellation of subscriptions no longer wanted.
Many libraries use computer based systems for keeping track of serials.
This study has not examined the use of computer serials control systems
in public libraries.

Alternative Materials
The public library can avoid cataloging and processing costs by

buying paperback books and by renting books. For popular titles in
substantial demand, all of the 31 large public library systems surveyed
except the Boston Public Library buy substantial numbers of paperback

books. About 28 percent of the books purchased by the Branch Libraries
of the New York Public Library are paperbacks. The library systems
averaged 40,000 paperback volumes as indicated in Table 3.

firms

so on. In the later case, the rental firm will track the best seller
lists and monitor new titles and ship rental volumes according to the
profile of the branch. The .rental volumes will be shipped directly to

the branch already jacketed, processed, labelled and ready for use. The
branch library returns rental books it no longer wants, even those in the

current shipment if they are not suitable. The cost for a 480 volume
rental collection with 120 new volumes replaced each month is about $200

per month (in l978)) Lower cost plans including used books are
available. A certain fraction of the used books may be retained by the
library, and others may be purchased at low cost. The books returned
to the rental company may be rented to Other libraries as used books or
may be sold in second hand book markets.

The Fairfax County Public Library uses a book buyback service of
the Ingram Book Company in Nashville. Ingram agrees to buyback books
within a specified period of time. The main
rental and buyback services seems

to

difference

between the

be that lost books are absorbed by

the rental firms while their cost is born by the library with the buyback
service.

The rental—buyback services allow a library to acquire multiple
copies of popular books while incurring relatively low processing—cata-.

loging costs and with a regular procedure for weeding out unneeded books.
In this way the handling of books acquired for popular use can be kept

separate from more permanent acquisitions. The expense of processing
and cataloging materials with short usefulness are reduced by using the
preprocessed books of the rental firm.

22

Libraries

can also make

microform materials available

to users.

hi1e microform materials are more difficult to use because they require
a device to project the film,

the

cost per page of materials is much

lower than with print. Therefore, the same funds devoted to microform
will buy more pages than if devoted to books. Microforms also require
less storage space.

The use of microform materials in public libraries

is limited, however, to large facilities. All the systems have micro-

form readers in the system. Among 30 public systems reporting this
information, however, only Houston has microfilm readers in all its
branches, and only Fairfax, Montgomery, and. Prince George Counties have

microform readers in over half of their branches. Microforms must be
used in the library, are inconvenient, are more difficult to read than
print and so their use seems to be limited to materials that are not
widely used. Thus, it is not surprising that microforins are in use in
less than a third of the branches of public libraries.

Many

public

libraries offer photoduplication services to patrons.

Seven of 30 systems reporting this information have photoduplication

available in every branch, as indicated in Table 3. All but three have
photoduplication in over half of the branches. The New York Public
Library does not have the service in a few older branches that have
direct

current wiring (duplication machines require alternating current).

While changes in the copyright law may discourage the use of photodupli—

cation to some extent,
in

such services seem t,o have found wide acceptance

the public libraries. Because the use of the machines

patrons——coin operated machines

are

is

paid for by

common——the equipment may generate

some revenue for the library. Photoduplication may reduce the theft and
vandalism

of materials.

23

Circulation Control
Libraries try to keep track of their books instead of simply

giving them away. Circulation control systems note materials that are
charged out of the library, check those that return, and send notices to

borrowers with materials overdue. Some circulation control systems may
be able to inform a patron when an item is already borrowed, and establish

a queue of future borrowers for material currently on loan. The system
may also identify inaerials that are lost. Some circulatton control
systems generate summary

information

on the circulation of materials:

for example, the number of materials circulated by type of material.
The conventional circulation control system was a manual system.
The borrower fills out a card, the card is filed and recalled when the

material is returned. Three of the 31 library systems surveyed continue
to use the manual system of circulation control. The specific systems are
indicated in Table 2. Summaries by geographic type are given in Table 3.
Beginning sometime in the early 1950'ssome libraries began substituting

microfilm records for the manual card system. A picture is taken of the
borrower's card and a book card together with a unique transaction number.
Photography is faster than writing, and the microfilm systems apparently
speeds up check out and possibly reduces the clerical staff needed for

circulation control. When the book is returned, the card with the trans—
action number at charge—out is matched to the charge—out transaction

numbers. Cardsorters or computers may be used for this matching. Those
books for which no charge—in number is matched to the charge—out are

overdue. The microfilm record is searched for the overdue transaction
numbers. Overdue notices are produced manually from the information
available on the microfilm. Nineteen of the 31 library systems report

24

using the

microfilm circulation control system.

Nine of the 31 systems use more

intensive circulation

control systems. At charge out a computer readable book card and
borrower card are read by machine, creating a computer manipulable record

of the charge out. At charge in, the book information is again entered
in

computer readable form. The computer can match charge ins with charge

outs,

identify overdues, and print overdue notices using information in

a computer file on borrowers. In this respect the computer based circulation control can duplicate the microfilm systems output with substantially less labor effort.

The capability of the computer based systems exceeds that of the

manul and microfilm systems, however. First, the computer can check the
borrower's card against a list of borrowers with overdue materials. Such
a credit check can be used to deny library privileges to persons who

seldom return materials. Second, the computer can check the book against
a list of requests. A renewal, for example, can be made with the assurance
that no one else is waiting for the item. Requests anywhere in the system
can be honored by materials available anywhere else in the system. The

sophisticated handling of requests is given as an important advantage of

computer based circulation control. Third, a computer may be the base
for a self—charge system with consequent reduction in clerical staff.

Computer based circulation control can produce very sophisticated

information about circulation as a by—product. The books can be
characterized in substantial detail by subject, level, language, and

age, for example. The monitoring of requests might also be detailed by
subject, level, and language. Such information might be used to evaluate
acquisitions policies, for example, the acquisition of multiple copies,

the use of rental materials, the length of the loan period, the type I

25

and type II errors in book selection. While

I

doubt that any library

currently uses its circulation control system in this way, it may be
that as such systems develop their value as management tools will increase.

The quality of the circulation control systems might be evaluated

by considering the shrinkage rate for library materials. Shrinkage can
occur

through the non—return of charged out materials and through the

theft of materials without being charged out. Twenty library systems
were willing to speculate about the proportion of charged

out materials

were not returned. The non—return rate varied from less than a

that

tenth of one

percent

to eight percent, with a mean of 2.4 percent. The

theft of materials without charge out can be detected by inventorying
the

stock. Inventories are expensive, however, and thus are rarely

undertaken. Of 15 libraries that had undertaken an inventory, the mean
latest year of an inventory was 1968, ten years before the interview.
While full inventories are undertaken too infrequently to give a consistent guide to theft, sample inventories might

be

undertaken more

often in order to evaluate the circulation control and anti—theft systems.

Anti—theft Systems
An effective circulation control system can discourage the charging

out of materials by patrons who do not intend to return them. Such
patrons may be led to steal the materials they want unless measures are

taken to discourage theft. The conventional method of theft control is
guards checking

parcels at the exits of the

libraries. Seventeen

of the

31 large library systems reported guards checking parcels somewhere in

their systems. Most have such checks only in a few locations. The use
of guards and parcel checks is concentrated among central city and

26

metropolitan systems and

is

not found in any

of

the suburban systems

surveyed.

In the last few years electronic systems have become available to

discourage the theft of materials. A magnetic

strip

is placed in each

book or other material. If the material is taken through. the exit check,

a tattle—tale sounds off. Some systems are designed to have the material
passed around the check at exit. Others are demagnetized at check—out
and remagnetized on return. The electronic theft systems are relatively
inexpensive. The tattle—tale leases for less than a thousand dollars
a year. The magnetic strips can be inserted in the books f or 25 to 30

cents by book jobbers; in—house processing costs may be less. The strips
cost less than 10 cents per item. The theft detection strips need not
be put in the full collection. Insertion in new materials will capture
the most valuable materials. Reference and especially valuable materials
might

be

retrofitted. Electronic security devices are in use in 17 of the

31 library systems, including 10 that have guards and parcel checks

somewhere in the system. Seven use the electronic system but do not use
the guards. Seven have guards but no electronic system, and seven have
no anti—theft system. The low cost of the electronic systems should
make

an

anti—theft system appropriate for libraries that previously had

no anti—theft system. And the electronic systems should replace the
guards and parcel checks in most situations, except where guards are
required for personal security reasons whether they search parcels or not.

The effectiveness of anti—theft efforts might be judged by taking sample

inventories to measure the shrinkage rate. One librarian commented that
employee theft may be significant. Neither the guard nor electronic
systems seem likely to affect employee theft.

27

Reference Activities
While

division of

reference services are the purview of the public service
most libraries, several technical arrangements are available

to support reference activities. A variety of large bibliographic
reference files have been entered into computer storage. The computer
can be used to search for key words to select items for a bibliography.

Chemical Abstracts, for example, can be searched in this way. A variety
of vendors provide this service via telephone lines and computer termi-

nals including

Lockheed, Bibliographic Retrieval Services, and Systems

Dynamics Corporation.

The user need pay only for the connect time (a

monthly

required), say

minimum may be

$25 per hour, and two to five cents

per citation printed out. The service is most useful to research
scholars in science and medicine. Ten of the 31 library systems offer
access to such computer bibliographic search services. (See Table 4.)
Most of the participating public libraries are central city systems.
Some public libraries have developed their own computer based
information

retrieval systems. The New York

Public Library has an index

of community service information, a file of agencies indexed by the

and persons they are prepared to help. The Public Library of
Nashville indexes the local newspapers because a high proportion of
problems

their

reference inquiries concern the local newspapers. Six of the 31

library

systems maintain some form of local index on a

Reference

computer. (See Table 4.)

services may require information not available in the

local library. Twenty—six of the 31 systems have teletypes for use in
requesting materials via interlibrary loan. Eleven have wide area
telephone service for use in inter—library loan. Only four libraries,

Denver,

Cleveland, Indianapolis, and Atlanta, indicate having neither

teletype nor wide area telephone service for use in seeking materials
or information via interlibrary loan.

Electronic Accounting FunctiOns
Data processing is used in the pUblic libraries for routine

accounting functions. Payrolls may be prepared, personnell records may
be maintained, and budget records may be processed by computers. These
activities may be moved to computers on a city—wide basis. That is, the
city or county government may introduce computer based payrolls for all

employees, including those in the library. Thus the decision to adopt
computer based accounting systems may be made outside the library. The
use of these activities is considered here so that the possible interaction between library specific data processing activities and city—wide

data processing activities can be considered. Autonomous library
systems, however, may act alone in adopting electronic accounting
functions.

The payrolls of all the public library systems surveyed

are prepared electronically, as indicated in Table 4. Personnell and
budget records are handled electronically in over 60 percent of the
library systems.

Rates of Diffusion of Innovations
The above descriptions of technical services indicates that sub—
stantial

technological change

is occurring in the public libraries.

Innovations have appeared in a wide variety of areas of library activities;
some

be

are related to the use of computers while others are not. It may

appropriate to examine the pace of technological change. How rapidly

do innovations spread from the time a first library begins a new practice

30

until

all

similar libraries are using the practice? Are

there

easily

rècOgnizablè characteristics of early adopters that might indicate the

motivation for technological change? Answers to these questions may
suggest policies that might promote useful technological change.

DiffusiOti Paths

When a library evaluates a new practice, it must decide on the
basis of limited evidence whether the benefits of the new practice will

justify the costs. Until the library has experience with the practice
itself, it will not know for certain its benefits and costs. A library
that picks up every possible new practice will incur substantial costs
in discovering practices that are worthwhile because many practices will

fail. A library that always delays the adoption of innovations will
incur the costs of maintaining expensive antiquated systems when cost

saving, output enhancing new practices are available. The optimal innovation strategy involves some balance between picking up untried

practices quickly when they work, and avoiding costly failures. Because
the adoption decision must

not

be easily struck.

be

made on limited evidence, this balance may
-

From an Industry point of view, some libraries must be willing to
experiment with new practices. Once a few libraries have found success
with a new practice, other libraries can act more confidently in mimicking

the new practice. The pattern of the diffusion of innovations from early
to later adopters generally traces a sigmoidal curve.14 That is, cumulative percentage of libraries that have adopted will grow slowly at

31

first during a trial period. If the innovation is successful, the pace
of diffusion will accelerate. Once most have adopted the pace will
decelerate again.

The patterns of diffusion of twenty innovations across the 31

large public library systems surveyed are described in Table 5. The
year of first use indicated by any of the surveyed systems is reported

in the first column. The proportion of systems currently using the
practice is reported in the second column. Only three of the 20 Innovations began before 1950, thus only recent innovations are being con-

sidered. Only three of the innovations are currently used in all the
surveyed library systems, suggesting that on average over thirty years
are required from first use by a system until a practice becomes universal.
This conclusion may be unwarranted, however, for several reasons.
The diffusion rates are explored further by noting the year when
half of the systems were using the technique, reported in the third

column of Table 5).5 The number of years from first use to 50 percent
use is reported in Column 4 of Table 5, with linear extrapolations in

parentheses for practices that have not yet reached 50 percent use. (The
linear extrapolations will overstate the time to 50 percent adoption if

the diffusion path is sigmoidal.) Of the twenty innovations, nine took
more than 15 years to reach 50 percent adoption. But of these nine, four

have been abandoned by some library systems. Thus it seems the average
time to full diffusion f or innovations that will be universally adopted

is somewhat less than thirty years (assuming symmetry between the first

50 percent and the second 50 percent of adoption). Overall the pace of
diffusion of innovations in libraries is faster than in urban fire departments and

compares favorably with the pace elsewhere in the economy.16

The process of the diffusion of innovations may
complex

interaction

be

slowed by the

among innovations. In particular, we observe new

innovations becoming available to replace older innovations before the
older innovations are fully diffused. Thus, a late corner may leapfrog
certain technologies and move directly to the most recent technology.
For example, a library currently using a manual cataloging system could

now move directly to using a catalog contractor to prepare computer

based

catalogs. Such a library may never make use of intermediate com-

puter based bibliographic files such as those in Milwaukee and Dallas.
Moreover,

such a library might never make use of the cataloging networks,

such as OCLC. For another example, a library using a manual circulation
control system might move directly to a computer based circulation control

system without ever using the microfilm systems. Security is a third area
where the electronic systems are being adopted by libraries that never
used guards and parcel checks.

Technologies

may have finite lives defined by

the introduction of subsequent techniques. Innovations might therefore be
classified by the likelihood of their obsolescence. An Innovation that
seems likely to become obsolescent might be termed an intermediate

technology. An innovation that seems likely to persist for a long period

34

of time might

be

called a climax technology. The extent of diffusion

of a particular innovation is likely to be influenced by the likelihood

that the technology will become obsolete. A climax technology is likely
to be diffused more widely than an intermediate technology. The fact
that only three of the twenty innovations studiedhave reached universal
application among surveyed libraries reflects the fact that many of the

innovations studied are intermediate technologies. Newer technologies
dominate the intermediate technologies for many libraries.
The pattern of diffusion will also be influenced by the extent of
local development required to make a technique useful in an individual

library system. Modular innovations that can be introduced immediately
into a library with little modification of existing programs and procedures will be expected to be adopted more quickly than innovations that

require the development of new procedures, and substantial adaptation to

local circumstances. A coin—operated photoduplication service can be
plugged in (where alternating current is available) and the service provided with very little local development expense and little impact on

other library operations. The use of a cataloging network like OCLC can
be introduced with little modification in cataloging practices. The
local card catalog remains intact, and control of the cataloging function

is retained in house. In contrast, the use of an approval plan relocates
the responsibility for selection and may change the activities of most

of the professional library staff. Use of a catalog jobber to produce a
computer output microfiche catalog replaces the card catalog, potentially
a significant part of the cataloging staff (at least compared to manual

cataloging). Much of the control of the catalog passes to the jobber.
This may explain why the use of the catalog network has diffused much

35

more rapidly than the use of the LC—MARC computer generated catalog even
though the LC—MARC catalog may be a climax technology.
The pace of diffusiOn may also reflect differences in the services

public libraries seek to provide. A system with no central library,
concentrating its resources on the current demands of readers may be more
interested in approval plans to get books quickly, paperback books to
make more current materials available, and jobber cataloging to reduce

catalog lags. Such a library may never adopt computer based information
retrieval. A system with more commitment to research support services

with

a large central library may adopt microform readers, and a WATS

line more quickly. They may be more reluctant to give up the decentralized management of

selection, cataloging, and circulation control that

computer based systems threaten.

Early Adoption
The process of innovation may be explored by looking for patterns
among

early

libraries

adopters of innovations. One issue is whether the same

tend to be early adopters of a variety of innovations, or

whether most libraries participate in early adoption of some innovations.

early adopters of
particular innovations are different in obvious ways from later adopters.
A second issue is whether libraries that are among

36

These issues are explored by classifying each library as either

an early or late adopter. For innovations that have not reached 50 percent diffusion, all current users are treated as early adopters. For
innovations that have exceeded 50 perèent diffusion, all systems who
adopted through the year when 50 percent diffusion was reached are

treated as early adopters. The number of libraries treated as early
adopters is indicated in the first column of Table 6. In some cases a
substantial number

of

libraries adopted the innovation in the year the

50 percentile of diffusion is reached, thus

the

number of early adopters

exceeds 50 percent in several cases.

The interdependence of early adoption is examined

whether

to

determine

adoption of one innovation is related to early adoption of

others. Contingency tables are constructed for each pair of innovations.

An

individual

library can be classified in four ways: adopted both

innovations early; adopted neither innovation early; adopted innovation A
early and B late; adopted B early and A late. The contingency' tables
for each pair if innovations are summarized in Table ô.The first number
is the number adopting both innovations early; the second is the number

of libraries adopting either or both innovations early. Random distribution of the 31 libraries over the four cells of the contingency table
should put about 8 libraries in each cell when 15 or 16 are treated as

early adopters. In this case the first number in Table 6 should be near
8 and the second number should be near 24. If the adoption of one innovation is a necessary first step to adoption of another, or if circumstances that lead to the adoption of one also lead to the adoption of
another, then early adopters of one innovation should be early adopters

of the' other. The first number indicated in Table 6 should be large and

the second number should be relatively small. Very few such circumstances

are found

in Table 6. Another possibility is that adoption of one inno-

vation precludes the adoption of another. In this case, the first
number should be small and the second large. This case is not found in
the Table either. Therefore, the adoption of each innovation studied
seems relatively independent of the adoption of the other innovations.
A formal statistical test of this independence is performed by calculating

a chi—square statistic for each contingency table. While the chi—square
statistics are not reported, those cells of Table 6 with statistically

significant chi—square statistics are indicated by asterisks. Of 190
contingency tables calculated, only seven have chi—square statistics

suggesting interdependence at the 10 percent level. Of these only the
interaction of automated budgeting and personnel records seems consistent

with some strong technical link. It does not seem to be the case that
libraries that have adopted some computer based innovations have tended

to be early to adopt others. Nor have early adoption of computer based
accounting systems——payroll and personnell——been associated with early
adoption of library specific computer systems.
No small group of library systems seem likely to stand out as
especiaily innovative, rather most libraries seem to participate in the

early use of some innovations. This pattern may be desirable. The
early use of innovations may involve investment in development that can
be avoided by latecotners. Early users may also incur more risk of
failure than latecoiners. Therefore, it may be appropriate that most

library systems participate in testing innovations. The innovations are

The specificcharacteristics of library systems who are early
adopters is explored for each innovation by means of discritninant ana—

lysis. The explanatory variables are the same as those used in an
analysis of library inputs and fall into three groups.17 First, the
cost of labor to the library, indicated by the compensation of a recruit

librarian, may influence the decision to innovate. If some innovations
are viewed as labor saving, libraries with higher labor costs would be
expected to adopt them before libraries with lower labor costs.

Second, the fiscal circumstances of local government may influence

the innovation decision. This effect may work in two directions, however. On the one hand, the development of an innovation may require
slack resources. Some of the innovations require large setup costs in
order to lower continuing costs. Library systems in local areas with
hither expenditures per capita and larger levels of intergovernmental
revenues per capita would be expected to adopt such innovations first.

On the other hand, high levels of local government expenditures may
reflect high competing demands from other agencies and so may indicate

less available to finance change in the library. Therefore, the
direction of association between local governments' own expenditures

per capita and intergovernmental revenues per capita and the early

adoption of innovations is ambiguous. A more detailed characterization
of the local fiscal scene is very difficult. The flexibility of
operations may differ for libraries that operate somewhat autonomously

from local governments than for those that are departments. A department
may have less flexibility to incur the fixed costs of computer systems
in order to save operating costs, for example.

Third, the demographic characteristics of the areaserved may

- 41

influence the decision to innovate. Large systems may be better able to
incur the costs of developing new practices. Some new techniques may
involve economies of scale so that only larger systems can use them.
On the other hand, very large systems may be more bureaucratic, and

managers may find innovation more difficult. The population of the area
measures the size of the system.
Areas with more educated adults use the public library more intensively and so certain innovations may be more useful in such libraries.

Adults in central cities tend to have lower education levels than those
in the suburbs, yet the central city systems tend to have larger central

libraries and more specialized library services than the suburbs. Innovations such as microfilm readers that meet specialized needs would seem

more likely tobe adopted in central city systems before being adopted
by suburbs.

Finally, the recent growth in population in the area serviced may

influence the innovation decision. Rapid growth may pressure a library
system such that new techniques are sought. A library system in a
growing area may be less tied to traditional practices. Innovation may
be easier with growth.
Standardized discriminant coefficients for each of twenty discritni—

ant analyses are reported in Table 7. Each is reported such that a positive sign on the coefficient indicates that that variable is associated

with

a higher probability of being an early adopter. The rank order of

the coefficients in each analysis indicates the relative importance of
each variable in discriminating early from late adopters. The chi—square

statistic for each analysis allows a probability statement about the

ability to discriminate.

Overall, the discriminant exercise is not very successful as re-

presented in Table 7. Only four of the twenty discriminant functions
are statistically significant at the 5 percent level with the chi—square

test: Network Cataloging, Guards, Rental Books, and Automated Budgeting.
That is, given the values of the seven variables used in the exercise, one
can make a statistically meaningful estimate of which libraries would

adopt a particular innovation early for only four innovations. A second

thod for observing the ability to discriminate early from late adopters
on the basis of library characteristics is to calculate what proportion
of the libraries are correctly classified as early or late by the dis—
criininant function. The value of each variable is multiplied by the dis—
criminant coefficient and the products are summed for each library,

establishing a discriminant score. If the score is greater than some
critical value, the library is predicted to be an early adopter. The proportion correctly classified is reported at the bottom of each column in
Table 7.

Sirrce the classification is based on the same libraries from

which the discriminant functions were estimated, the classification exercise is not statistically meaningful, yet the values make clear the nature

of the discriminant functions. Coin flipping would tend to classify 50
percent of the libraries correctly, so a powerful discrixninant function

should correctly classify a much higher proportion of the libraries.
Over eighty percent of the libraries are correctly classified for only

five innovations: the same four indicated by the chi—square statistic
and automated personnel records.

The role of individual variables in discriminating early from late

adopters——other things equal——is summarized in Table 8. The variables
in the first and second largest coefficients when ranked in absolute value

are reported for each innovation. No single observed factor is pushing
early adoption of innovations. Each variable is positively and negatively
associated with early adoption of different innovations. High labor
costs seems associated with early use of the automation of several
accounting

and record keeping functions, but has played no strong role with

automation

of cataloging or circulation innovations. Fiscal stringency,

representedby lower per capita expenditures from own sources and from
intergovernmental sources on local government functions other than libra-

ries, is associated with early adoption of some innovations, including

network cataloging and computer based circulation. Yet the fiscal
variables appear important for only a few of the innovations.

Libraries that are departments of city governments seem somewhat
less likely to adopt approval plans and computer based circulation
control systems early, suggesting that the flexibility of more autonomous
library organization may be important for early adoption of these inno-

vations. Yet this association is found to be important for only a few
innovations.

The characteristics of the area served by the library also seem
important for early adoption of some innovations. Larger libary systems
seem more likely to have adopted LC—MARC computer generated catalogs

and automated payrolls early. Yet smaller library systems seem to have
been more likely to adopt automated ordering, personnel records, and

budgets early. Areas with more adults who are high school graduates
seem less likely to have adopted network cataloging and more likely to
have adopted LC—MARC computer based cataloging and approval plans. Areas
that grew more rapidly in the 1960's seem more likely to have adopted
microfilm circulation control systems early, but less likely to have been

47

early users of rental books, microfilm readers, photoduplication, and

guards. In part these differences may reflect differences among city,
metropolitan and suburban systems.
Overall, it is difficult to generalize about the features of

library systems that are early adopters of innovations. Each innovation
has its ovm characteristics and consequently different factors seem

important for the early adoption of different innovations. The hypothesis
about the role of high labor costs, fiscal stringency, and the size and
growth of the area served each find modest confirmation in the evidence

but none are important for more than a few innovations. The process of
early adoption of innovations is complex.

Interaction Between Inputs and Innovations
The effort to explain early use of innovations relative to the external characteristics of library systems subsumes the fact that other
input choices the library makes may be important in the decision to adopt

an innovation. For example, a library acquiring more materials and more
titles may have greater need for new cataloging aids. Therefore, it is
appropriate to compare the inputs of libraries that have adopted an inno-

vation with those that have not. The difficulty with such a comparison

is that the choice of inputs and innovations may be simultaneous. n
innovation may allow a library to acquire more titles than it previously
did, just as the acquisition of a large number of titles may influence

the decision to innovate, say, in cataloging. A high cost library may
innovate and the innovations may lower costs. Both effects will shape a
comparison or costs between innovators and noninnovators. Thus the comparison of input levels between library systems using an innovation and

48

those not using an innovation is for descriptive purposes rather than
an exercise to explore causes of innovation.

The mean value of the input is reported separately for the library

systems that have innovated and for those that have not. An F—statistic
indicates whether the difference between the two means is statistically

significant. One input variable is binary, indicating whether the chief
librarian had been promoted from within the library. A chi—square test
indicates whether there is a statistically significant association between

adoption and promotion from within. The statistics are reported in Table
9. Five innovations that might be expected to have important associations
with other library inputs are examined.

Do the major technical service innovations lower library expendi-

tures? Library expenditures per capita are higher in libraries that have
LC—MARC cataloging than in those that do not; similarly for those with

computer based circulation control. The higher expenditure levels, how—
ever, may indicate that the innovating library systems offer higher levels

of service or face higher labor costs. Perhaps the higher costs have led
to innovations as cost saving measures. One cannot infer that the innovations have raised costs.

In a very few instances there are associations between the main

library activities and the innovations. Libraries with computer based
ordering systems have fewer locations per square mile and have more

volumes in stock per capita than those that have not adopted that inno-

vation. Libraries with computer based circulation control buy more
titles. There is no difference in branch hours per week or in public
service staff per capita among libraries with these innovations than

those without. Libraries using cataloging networks have a larger propor—
tion of their public service staffs in the main library. Perhaps the

networks are more valuable for main library sources.

One

might expect

that the electronic innovations examined here,

especially approval plans, ordering systems, the LC—MARC cataloging and
the computer based circulation control would enable a library system to

be more centrally managed. Thus technical librarianship skills might be
applied in central decisions, while individual library units could be

operated successfully with less professional skill. One might also ex-

pect smaller and less professional technical service staffs. Pew
such effects are apparent from comparing input levels between innovators

non—innovators.

and

Those libraries with LC—MARC computer generated

catalogs have a smaller fraction of public service workers professionally

trained. One would expect, however, that the strongest effect on the
public service division would be for ordering, selection, and circulation
control rather that in the catalog preparation, a function mainly of

technical services. Therefore, there is little evidence here that
libraries that have adopted the innovations use less labor than other

libraries. It is quite possible that the libraries that have innovated
have been the largest, most labor intensive libraries and have reduced
labor inputs in technical services from former

levels

or from levels

that would otherwise be necessary to provide similar levels of service.
A much more detailed study of specific library operations would be
necessary to estimate what labor requirements might be in the absence

52

that makes separating the subfunctions difficult; therefore, the total

technical service labor force and labor costs are compared. Libraries
using the cataloging networks and

computer

based circulation systems

are found to have larger technical service labor forces. One

might

expect that some of the innovations would lead to less professional

staff in technical services. In particular the use of LC—MARC computer
generated cataloging might allow a library to substitute less skilled

labor for more skilled labor. The technical service staffs of the LC—

MARC computer using libraries average 19 percent professional while the
technical service staffs of the other libraries average 26 percent pro—

fessional. This difference is only very slightly statistically signifi—
cant (at the 15% level) ,not a strong effect.

The labor cost of technical services can be estimated by multiplying the number of professional workers by the salary of professional
workers with five years experience (a benchmark value) and adding in

fringe benefits. A similar calculation is made for clerical workers
and

a sum taken.

While there are apparently large differences in the

labor costs of technical services, only those for the cataloging networks
and for computer based circulation are statistically significant, with

the innovators having larger expenditures. This evidence is consistent

with certain innovationa being adopted by high cost libraries. A
technical service labor cost per title is derived by dividing the total

labor cost estimate by the number of titles cataloged. The labor cost
per title is significantly higher among libraries with ordering systems.
Again,, the evidence suggests that high cost libraries have innovated, but

the evidence is not so strong that this association holds for all innovations.

53

These cost and staffing comparisons would be more meaningful if
information about staffing for particular functions were available from

a larger group of libraries. The use of an approval plan and an automated
ordering system may have larger impacts on selecting and ordering staffs

and no impact on cataloging and processing operations. The use of computer assisted cataloging may influence cataloging and processing operations

but not ordering and selection. The use of computer based circulation
may influence public service operations, but not cataloging, processing

or ordering. The processing of overdue notices may be performed in
different divisions in different libraries; the costs of this function
might be compared for the computer based circulation control innovators

and non—innovators. Moreover, one would like to know expenditure on data
processing and contractual services in order to compare total costs.
These more detailed cost comparisons are beyond the scope of the present
study.

One might

expect

that the approval plan, ordering systems, and

cataloging systems would reduce both acquisiton lags and cataloging lags.
The comparison of mean acquisiton and cataloging lags of innovators with

non—innovators shows no significant differences. Again, however, the
libraries with the longest lags may have innovated to reduce the lags;
the present evidence does not reveal the changes in lags, if any,
following innovation.

There may be an association between the characteristics of the
chief

executive

of the library system and the adoption of innovations.

A new chief executive, for example, may have more authority to adopt

innovations. Such seems to be the case for ordering systems, but not
for the other innovations. A chief promoted from within the library

54

system may feel acclimated to traditional practices in the system, while

an outsider may be more interested in bringing in new techniques. Chief
executives of public libraries are sometimes recruited from academic or

special libraries. A national search may yield persons of varied experiences in libraries. No significant difference between inside and outside
chiefs is found. Note however that most appointments of chief executives
follow a search both within and without the system, thus promotion from
within need not imply a ratification of the status quo in library

operation. Moreover, librarians sometimes move among systems as assistant
chief executives so that promotion from within need not imply that the
new chief executive has no mangerial experience in other library systems.

Sunnary On Innovations in Public Libraries

A wide array of innovations are sweeping the public library

industry. Most parts of the operation of a public library system may be
changed by innovation, including material selection, ordering, cataloging,

and circulation control. These innovations seem to be diffused rapidly
across the large public library systems surveyed. While the study has
not attempted to document the cost saving potential of these innovations,
substantial benefits are presumed to exist.

The pattern of diffusion is influenced by the fact that many inno-

vations may become obsolete before they are completely diffused. Only
a few innovations may be climax technologies that will be completely
diffused, before becoming obsolete. Computer based circulation control,
LC—MARC based computer generated catalogs, and electronic anti—theft'
devices may be such technologies.

No single group of libraries (among the large systems surveyed)

stands out as pace setters. Each system has been among relatively early

'C

55

adopters of some innovations and no system has been among early
adopters of all innovations. Moreover, no particular characteristics of
libraries seem especially significant in the decision to adopt innovations.
Labor costs, fiscal circumstances, and system characteristics may

each

play some role, but the relative importance of each will change from
innovation to innovation.
Two

factors

deserve mention as sources of technological change in

public libraries. First, the development of the Machine Readable Cataloging by the Library of Congress has allowed private firms

to

distribute

LC cataloging information at very low cost in microform. Other firms are
able to use the LC—MARC tapes to prepare local catalogs. The cataloging
information has public goods qualities: the cost of making the information
available to additional users is very low relative to the cost of

generating the information in the first place. Thus, the advance of
cataloging services at the Library of Congress (with Ford Foundation
support) has been of substantial benefit to public libraries.
Second, the chief executives of public libraries are professionals.
They typically attend professional meetings annually or more frequently.
They contribute to and read many

periodicals

on library methods. They

participate in national markets and usually land their positions after

national

searches

by library boards. The professional characteristics

of library managers probably enhances the pace and
innovation among

libraries.

theoretical underpinnings of the shape of the adoption path.

Each library system was asked when it began using a particular
technique. In this way, the year when any particular fraction had
adopted could be identified. Unfortunately, not all

libraries

that had

a practice in use could indicate when the practice had begun. The number
of library systems using a technique but not reporting a year of adoption

is reported in the last column of Table 5. In determining the year when
50 percent adoption is reached, these libraries are assumed to be among

the first half adopters. Given the gaps in information, it is not
possible to report a specific sigmoidal curve of the diffusion paths.
