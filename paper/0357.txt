Labor Mobility and Wages
SUMMARY

In this essay we explore the implications of human capital and search
behavior for both the interpersonal and life—cycle structure of inter—firm

labor mobility. The economic hypothesis which motivates the analysis is that
individual differences in firm—specific complementarities and related skill
acquisitions produce differences in mobility behavior and in the relation
between job tenure, wages and mobility. Both "job duration dependencet' and'

heterogeneity bias" are implied by this theory. Exploration of longitudinal
data sets (NLS and MID) which contain mobility, job and wage histories of men
in the 1966—76 decade yield the following findings, among others:

1. The initially steep and later decelerating declines of labor mobility
with working age are in large part due to the similar but more steeply declining relation between mobility and length of job tenure.

2. Given tenure levels, the probability of moving is predicted positively

by the frequency of prio moves and negatively by education. The inclusion of
prior moves in the regression reduces the estimated tenure slope because it
helps to remove the "heterogeneity bias" in that slope.

3. The popular "mover—stayer model" is rejected by the existence of
tenure effects on mobility.

4. Differences in mobility during the first decade of working life do not

predict long—run differences in earnings. However, persistent movers at later
stages of working life have lower wage levels and flatter life—cycle wage growth.

5. The analysis calls for a reformulation of earnings (wage) functions.
Inclusion of tenure terms in the function permits separate estimates of returns
to general and specific human capital after correction for heterogeneity bias.
A rough estimate is that 50 percent of life—time wage growth is due to general
(transferable) experience and 25 percent each to firm—specific experience and
inter—firm mobility.

Labor Mobility and Wage!t

1. Introduction: Renewed Interest in Labor Mobility
Labor mobility is one of the central topics of labor economics and

a long—standing subject of empirical research. Earlier studies reflected
primarily a concern with the allocative efficiency of the labor market.

They analyzed attitudes, job—change decisions and the direction of observed labor mobility in attempts to ascertain whether information,

motivation and behavior of workers were consistent with the postulates
of economic theory.
ifl a comprehensive survey of this literature (Parnes, 1970) the

author concluded that the evidence on the operation of market forces

was mixed, both among different studies and even within them. Although
research in the 1960's was more sophisticated and utilized larger data
sets than prior work it did not provide any change in perspective.
Reviewing the more recent literature Parsons (1976) finds promise
in the emergence of human capital and of search theories as tools for
the analysis of labor mobility, labor turnover, and unemployment.
However, applied work in search theory

has,

thus far, only partially

touched on problems of labor mobility and of unemp1oyinent Its emphasis
has been largely on conditions terminating job search, rather than on
circumstances which generate it.

The reformulation of labor mobility as a human capital investment
decision has been fruitfully applied to migration (Sjastaad, 1962, and

other work reviewed by Greenwood, 1976). The connection between investments

specific to the firm. (and

to larger units) and the incidence of

of Becker (1962) ,

Oi

(1961) ,

and Parsons (1972)

The novel approaches suggested by human capital and by search
theories are producing a renewed interest in the formerly stagnant field

of labor mobility. A further source of interest has come from stochastic
models of labor mobility. These made their initial appearance as the
"mover-stayer" model two decades ago (Blumen, Kagan, McCarthy, 1955) and

have recently reappeared in more sophisticated form.1
The purpose of this essay2 is to explore the implications of human
capital and search behavior for both the interpersonal and life cycle

structure of inter-firm labor mobility. The apparent ambiguity in the
relation between labor mobility and wages which characterizes much of
the literature surveyed by Parnes is implicit and reconcilable in human

capital analysis: As a response to perceived gains in wages mobility
promotes individual wage growth, but to the extent that on-the-job investments contain elements of specificity, mobility is a deterrent to wage

growth. The study of differences in mobility behavior requires information over time: Of special importance, in our approach, is information
on time spent in the firm (tenure) and on the life—cycle changes in job
attachments. The availability of longitudinal inicrodata (especially

NLS and MID panels) enables us to study these phenomena.
The economic hypothesis which motivates the analysis is that individual differences in firm—specific human capital behavior lead, via wage
effects, to heterogeneity in mobility behavior, and to "tenure effects"

on attachment to the firm. Implications for life—cycle mobility are
then derived in the absence or presence of "aging" (changes in mobility

with age, at given tenure levels). Both "tenure dependence" and "hetero—

—3—

geneity

bias" are implied by the theory. We explore data sets which

contain mobility histories to ascertain the existence of these phenomena

and to correct for the predictable biases. Next we investigate corresponding features of the wage structure. Labor mobility and tenure effects
are introduced and tested in a reformulated earnings function in which
specific

and general human capital accumulation can be distinguished.

Part II presents a rigorous formulation of the structure of mobility
viewed

as a stochastic process.

2. Tenure, Working Age, and Mobility: Some Definitions and Facts
We define labor mobility as change of employer, whether or not

unemployment intervenes. We exclude exits from and entries into the labor
force. This exclusion is a minor one for the male labor force which we
study.3

Consequently,

job separation is synonymous with job change in

our data. Except for one illustration of observed differences (in Table
2), we do not distinguish here between separations initiated by (or

reported as) quit or layoff. Geographic, industrial, and occupational
mobility are components of job mobility which are included in our concept
but not singled out for separate treatnient.4

Two probabilistic relations, or time—profiles, are basic in our
discussion and measurement of labor mobility.

(1) The "tenure turnover

profile" S(T) is the relation between the probability of separating
from a job in period t and the time spent in that job prior to t (current

tenure T). In the language of renewal theory, S(T) is the "hazard
function". At the individual level this is a profile of "propensities

to move" conditional on tenure. Such a profile is not observable. In
large homogeneous groups, that is consisting of individuals with the

same propensities

S(T), we can observe estimates of

the

probabilities in

period in the form of relative frequencies or separation rates

conditional on tenure. (2) The relation between an individualts
propensity to move and working age, regardless of his current tenure,

is his "experience turnover profile" S(X).
as

a relation between experience and separation rates.

that it declines with age. It declines much more sharply
tenure. The declines in both S(X) and S(T) are strongest

with length
initially

decelerate subsequently. Several tenure and age profiles of separ-

ation rates are shown in Tables 1—3.

Table 1 shows the decline with age in the proportion of job changers

(number of job changers divided by number employed) in 1961. The decline
is similar when measured in terms of number of job changes rather than
job changers, since a similar fraction (35—40 percent) of job movers ih
each age group changed jobs more than once during the year.5
Table 2 shows cross—classifications of separations, quits and layoffs by experience and tenure in the period 1971-73 in the two NLS
samples of men (young men, ages 19—29 and older men ages 50—64 in 1971).

The tenure profiles within working age (experience) classes are steeply

declining and decelerating (convex). Mobility does not decline with age
at given tenure levels within each of the cohort age ranges. The
decline between the young and old cohort is pronounced but it shows
mainly in quits.

The separation equations in Table 3 summarize the nc1usion that
within the two age panels declines of mobility with age (experience),

shown by S(X) in Tables 1 and 2, are due to the effect of tenure which is

revealed in the regression S(X,T): For young men, experience effects
(coefficients of X, X2) vanish when tenure (T, T2) is included. No
experience effects are observed for older men with or without the tenure

variables.6 However, estimates of S(X) and S(X,T) in Michigan Income
Dynamics data which cover the complete age spectrum (Table 5, Panel C,

lines 1 and 2) show that net aging effects remain even after the inclusion

of tenure, although they are reduced in size and significance. In all
data sets the explanatory power resides mainly in the tenure variables;
mobility is convex both in tenure and in experience; and the tenure
profile is much steeper than the experience profile.

3. Wage and Mobility Structures: Some Theory
We now turn to broad theoretical considerations with which we

may analyze the facts of labor mobility. Some aspects of skill acquired in a particular firm are not transferable to other firms.

The

acquisition of such "specific" components of human capital by workers
and the consequent wage pattern suffice to produce the tenure effects

in the attachment to the firm which we observed in Tables 2 and 3. At
the same time individual differences in amounts of specific capital
investment imply a heterogeneity in mobility, or in attachment to the
firm (length of tenure) as well as in the strength of tenure effects

that is in slopes of the tenure-separation probability relation.
The effects of acquiring job specific capital on mobility may be

described as follows: Successful job matches eventually result in
wage levels W which exceed expected alternative wages Wg. The higher
the wage W the less incentive to quit, given the usual fluctuations in

demand. Separations are high during the initial "probation" period and

drop to low levels. It is reasonable to assume that a successful match is
only a starting point for a continuing employment relation which often
involves investments of workers and firms in worker skills, and these

are partially nontransferable.7 Employer investments involve hiring,
screening, and training costs which are recouped by wage policy Wg < W

< VMP, where VMP is the workerts value of marginal product in the firm,

so

that both quits and layoffs are deterred.
Define W =

Wg

+

W51

where Wg is the worker return on his general

(transferable) human capital and W is the difference between the
(higher) wage received in the firm and the opportunity wage elsewhere

(Wg)• Similarly, We is the employer's return on the costs of investing
in workers, the difference between the worker's productivity (VMP) and

the wage paid to him (W). Workers are deterred from quitting and
employers from dismissing workers, because of these returns. Total
separations are affected by

= (VMP -

Wg)

=

W5

+ We that is by both

components of returns to specific capital. In this paper we do not
focus on the distinction between quit and layoff and do not consider
the question whether employers and workers engage in joint or in separate

optimizing behavior.8 Plausibly, W and We are expected to be positively
related: a good match and opportunity for joint investments are recognized by both employee and employer.

The distribution of returns to specific capital ()

creates

indiv-

idual (and group) differences in tenure—turnover profiles. Tenure pro-

files are horizontal only when = 0, in which case tenure has no effect
on mobility or on wages. With > 0, tenure profiles of specific capital
does not emerge instantaneously as the worker joins the firm. It is
accumulated over time, given a successful match, and the returns grow over

time. Both the rate of growth of these returns and their ultimate level
affect mobility:

the "tenure effect" is steeper the bigger both. The convexity of the
tenure—mobility profiles, and concavity of the tenure-wage profiles are
due to the eventual completion of specific capital accumulation in the
9

firm.

Thus the economics of specific human capital formation predicts the
coexistence of heterogeneity and of "tenure dependence" in mobility.

The two aspects of behavior are related and re not to be viewed as
mutually exclusive hypotheses: Persons who favor large volumes of
specific capital investment exhibit relatively little mobilityl0 (except

f an initial period of repeated search and occasional later moves) and
strong tenure effects. Low levels of specific investment behavior, whether
intentional or due to inefficiency in job matching, imply high (persistent)
mobility levels independent of tenure (zero or small tenure effects).
If rates of decline of experience profiles of mobility reflect primarily
the slopes of tenure profiles, as appears to be the case, the flat and
high profiles of "movers" and the downward sloping profiles of "stayers"
imply a progressive divergence over the life-cycle in observed mobility
behavior of a heterogeneous population.

The growing divergence of mobility rates over the working age parallels
the repeatedly observed divergence of individual life—cycle wage profiles.11

The human capital model can interpret both as lifetime outcomes of un-

changing individual differences in abilities and opportunities. This
view cautions against literal impressions that older cohorts are more

heterogeneous than younger ones, or against the notion that the experience
of longer tenure creates a "reinforcement effect" that is a desire to invest

in specific capital. This is not to say, however, that such views are not

valid. Habit formation and unexpected contingencies do modify lifetime
histories, but they need not be invoked in an initial analysis.
The major implication of specific capital .heterogeneity for the

structure of mobility is the existence of differential tenure effects.
Levels of S(T) are higher and slopes flatter for individuals and groups

who acquire little specificity in their human capital, while steeper
slopes and eventually lower -levels characterize tenure functions of

large specific capital investors. Empirical observations should reveal
downward slopes in tenure—turnover profiles exaggerated by "heterogeneity bias", as well as "true" negative slopes after correction for bias.

A related set of predictions applies to the wage structure: A
major one jS the existence of tenure effects on wages which are additional

to the effects of general human capital accumulation. This suggests a
reformulation of the earnings function to include a tenure term. The
experience and tenure coefficients should provide a decomposition of worker

returns to general (transferable) and specific (nontransferable) human

capital. As in the case of mobility it is also necessary to attempt
correction for potential upward biases in tenure effects which are posed
by the existence of heterogeneity.
Other implications of the theory relate to age (experience) changes

in mobility and wages S(X) and W(X). An interesting conclusion is that

mobility declines and wages grow -

with

age even if there are no

"aging" effects, that is even if mobility depended only on levels of

tenure and not directly on age (given tenure). Similarly, wages would
grow (on average) over the life-cycle even if no general (experience)

capital were accumulated. Also W(X) would be concave if W(T) is concave,
and S(X) is convex because S(T) is. Indeed, without specific capital

phenomena the convex shape of the age patterns of mobility S(X) would be
difficult to understand.

4. Tenure Effects on Mobility in Homogeneous
and in Heterogeneous Groups
A simple heuristic model makes the notions intuitively clear:12

The propensity to move at the individual level, or the separation rate
in a homogeneous group is a function:

s =

f(T,X)

(1)

where s is the probability of separation in period t, T is length of
current employment in the firm up to time t, and X is total work exper-

ience (working age). The slope of the age (experience) profile is:

< 1. Tenure would grow by the same amount of time as age only

in the case of perfect immobility: It increases initially with age since
it is necessarily short at early stages of experience. At later stages
approaches zero as T approaches the fixed value (. — 1) in the ease
of no-tenure depeidence, that is when

at later ages as well.'3 A regression of T on X, not shown here, reveals
specificity or tenure dependence, i.e., when .!< 0

a positive slope and slight concavity.

Decomposition (2) yields the following conclusions about the
observed decline of mobility with age:

1. Even if there were no "age effects" (-

= 0),

decline with age, because of job specificities, that
declines with tenure

mobility would

is

because mobility

< 0. No decline would be observed if mobility

were independent of tenure.

2. Again abstracting from age effects, since d.!< 1, the slope of
dx
the experience profile is less than that of the tenure profile.

3. Convexity in the tenure profile would be reinforced or simply
reflected in the age profile if

decreases over time, or is constant.

Moreover, this could happen even if there is an age effect and even if
the latter were concave.

4. Decline of mobility with age is faster the stronger the decline
of mobility with tenure, apart from the pure age effect.

Up to this point the analysis applies to a homogeneous group,
defined by the identical S(X,T) function for each of its members.

Components of life-cycle mobility can be observed directly in such

groups by estimation of equation (1). Generally, it is not possible
to define homogeneous groups empirically, so that estimation of (1)

cannot be carried out directly. If in fact individual propensities to
move are not reduced by tenure yet they differ among workers, the observed group tenure profile S(T) will have a downward slope and is

likely to be convex as well. In this case persons with high propensities to move separate at early levels of tenure while those with

low propensities stay on a long time. The decline in the tenure profile consequently reflects the degree of heterogeneity when measured

by the variance in propensities to move, while convexity would reflect
a decline in that variance, as only stayers remain in the long tenure
classes

15

—

Let us now define a heterogeneous population in consonance with
specific capital heterogeneity as a collection of. homogeneous subgroups

among which mobility rates differ at given levels of tenure, while

tenure curves S(T) decline in some or most of the subgroups. By the
preceding argument, any degree of heterogeneity will lend a downward
bias (steeper than average slope) to the observed group tenure curve.
We should note that heterogeneity biases can exist without any true

tenure effects, for reasons not involving specificity. But, if the

tenure effect ()

is

zero in each subgroup i, the observed population

experience profile S(X) will be horizontal, since its slope is an aver-

<

age of slopes in the subgroups. Conversely, if

0 in each or some

subgroups the observed experience profile must slope down. Thus, in the
absence of age effects, the age profile of mobility S(X) provides a clear
test of the presence or absence of tenure effects in the group, regardless of its degree of heterogeneity.
As an example, the popular "mover-stayer"

16

model which assumes

heterogeneity and neglects tenure effects must be rejected by the decline
in the age—mobility profile, insofar as the latter is not exclusively

due to pure age effects (i.< 0 in (1)).
Although the decline in life—cycle mobility reflects the existence
and strength of tenure effects, it yields no information on the extent of

heterogeneity in the population. Assessment of heterogeneity is important,
however, both in its own right, as well as a basis for recognition and
correction of bias in the estimated tenure effects.

5. Empirical Mobility Functions
An open-ended empirical procedure for estimating tenure effects in
the presence of heterogeneity is to enter a number of variables which
are likely to capture heterogeneous behavior in a regression of tenure

on mobility. The tenure slope estimate in the multiple regression is
reduced compared to its value when it is the only right-hand variable.
The reduction measures the extent of heterogeneity bias due to these

variables. This procedure was applied to the NLS data and the results
are shown in Table 4, including the list of heterogeneity factors. The
reduction in slope was about 20-30 percent for the young men, and larger
(relative to the flatter slope) for the older men.

The heterogeneity factors in the regressions were, aside from

experience which was also included: education, health, hours of work,
family status variables, industry, and union membership. In terms of
contribution to

the last two factors were the most pronounced.

This procedure is clearly incomplete for our purposes here, although
of interest in the substantive studies of particular facthrs.
A scheme that is more genera], in the sense that it does not require

an enumeration of heterogeneity factors derives from the definition: At
a given level of tenure members of a homogeneous group have equal probabilities of moving during the next period regardless of their past
mobility, while in a heterogeneous group probabilities differ even at

fixed current tenure. Since frequency of past mobility is an indicator
of personal probability ("propensity to move") in the heterogeneous case,
its (partial) correlation with mobility in the next period, given tenure,

reveals the existence and estimates the degree of heterogeneity. And to

Information

on prior mobility was available in the NLS data for young

men as the number of interfirm moves (NM) between 1966 and 1971. For t1
older men in NLS such information was not available, but we constructed
a variable (PM) on the number of (survey to survey) periods between 1965

and 1973 during which at least one move took place.1
Table 5 presentsi in successive steps, regressions for young men

(Panel A) in which separations (job changes) in the period 1971-73 are
predicted by: years of work experience (X, X2) up to 1971, tenure (T, T2)

in 1971, and mobility prior to the current job (NM). The prior mobility
variable was also interacted with experience (XNN). The same regressions
(except that PM replaces NM) predict job changerates of NLS older men
in 1973—75 (Panel B), and of all MID men in 1975—76 (Panel C).

Briefly, the findings are: Inclusion of tenure (line 2) shows it
to be the variable which is responsible for the gross age decline in

separations among young NLS men (line 1, Panel A). Looking at lines
1 and 2 of panel B, we find that the older NLS men show neither gross

nor net age (experience) effects. While net age effects are absent
withir the limited age ranges in the NLS data (young

29, old

50)

they are reduced (going from line 1 to 2 in panel C) but remain signif-

icant in the MID regressions which cover the whole age spectrum. The
absence of gross age effects (line 1, panel B) in the older cohort

reflects very small tenure effects (slopes) at this stage. This is
consistent with a strong convexity of tenure (and age) profiles over

the long run. The comparable tenure slopes are much steeper for the
young because they are dominated in regressions by early tenure levels.

Indeed, in a subsample of older men whose tenure does not exceed 8 years
(not shown here), the tenure slopes are quite as steep as those of young

men. Thus, the differences between the young and the old need not be
interpreted as a change in the mobility structure.
The inclusion of prior mobility variables shows the existence of

heterogeneity in mobility behavior: The variable is a strong predictor
of mobility in the next period given experience and tenure at the

beginning of the period. Persons who moved more frequently prior to
the current job are more likely to leave the job earlier than others.

Prior mobility appears to be a stronger predictor at older than at

younger ages. This can be seen in the effect on R2 (i.e. in the partial
correlation), and in the regression slope. When converted into an
elasticity it is several times larger in the older group. Evidently,
repeated mobility at an advanced age represents persistent mobility
suggesting little stake in job tenure or lack of opportunity, while
repeated mobility at young ages does not have the same connotation.

We tried to test the proposition that prior mobility at older ages is

a better index of heterogeneity within each of the panels: The experience—
prior mobility interaction variable, shown in line 4 of each panel, was

positive and significant. Incidentally, the existence of this
interaction implies that age (experience) profiles of mobility are not
only higher but also flatter for movers (PM large) than for stayers
(PM small), as we theorized in section 3 (p.11).

The introduction of the prior mobility variable was designed to

separate "movers" from "stayers". If effective, such "standardization"
should reduce the tenure slope in the regression. Tenure slopes are

indeed reduced in all three data panels in lines 3 and below.

The

reduction is small among the young and large among the old, as would be
expected since PM is a stronger indicator of persistent mobility at

older ages. The average reduction in the linear tenure term at midexperience levels (MID) is about one—third. That is, heterogeneity
biases the steepness of tenure-turnover profile upward by about 50 percent,

on average. As predicted,'inclusion of prior mobility which is an
attempt to, standardize for heterogeneity, reduces the tenure slope by

about a third (in the linear term) among the young and by close to two-

thirds among the old. Incidentally, the education variable shown in

the last rows of Table 5 appears to predict some reductions in mobility
at given levels of initial mobility, but has no additional predictive
power among the old.

6. Net Age Effects in Mobily
Although they do not appear in the NLS

regression

of Table 5, age

effects (coefficients of experience) on mobility are present in the
MID regressions in panel C and were seen in the decline of mobility rates
at fixed levels of tenure when the older cohort was compared to the younger
(Table 2). The economics of this downward shift in tenure curves may be

found in the more traditional aspects of labor mobility: Job change is
a response to higher wage levels beckoning elsewhere as well as a search
for specific investment opportunities.

For a given wage gain, the supply response would diminish with working

age (at given levels of tenure) since the payoff period declines. Such
effects, however, would not become pronounced until late in the working
life, especially in view of positive and not negligible discounting.

Emphasis on finite life (working age) cannot produce a convex experience—
turnover profile, nor can it rationalize the fact that the observed net

age declines (!) occur relatively early in the working life. However,
the gain from mobility may decline over the life cycle not because of

the declining payoff period but because of rising costs: Costs of
geographic mobility are sizable and rise with family size and the presence
of school—age children.

-

Age effects are, indeed, more important in migration than in local
job mobility. The decline in migration with age s(x) is steeper than
the decline in local job mobility: One-third of young compared to less
than

10 percent of older

job changers migrate. But the greater costs in

migration include also costs due to locational specificities which exist
in addition to job specificity, so stronger "pure aging" is not the only
reason for a sharper age decline in migration than in local job mobility:
Tenure effects which reflect both job and location specificities are
indeed, sharper for migrants.

Another set of age factors, unrelated to location, may operate in

the early years of work experience: The range of quality of jobs and of
the job match cannot be ascertained by mere search, and some knowledge

must be acquired by actual experimentation. Also, job training and opportunities for investment in general human capital may present themselves

sequentially in different firms. Beyond the first decade of working life,
we may expect that human capital investors who eventually find a reasonably
compatible work place

develop a strong attachment to the job.

and Mobility Effects in the Wage Function

Specific

capital investments imply tenure effects on wages which

cause the tenure effects in mobility. Wage heterogeneity due to differ-

— 26

ential

—

specificities similarly produce some of the heterogeneity in

mobility. Consequently, we should observe tenure effects in addition
to general work experience effects in wage functions. Moreover, these
effects may be exaggerated in empirical estimates in view of interpersonal
diversity in specific investhient behavior.

Information on job mobility can and should be built into the standard

earnings function. The inclusion of the tenure variable should capture
returns to specific (non-transferable) capital accumulation permitting
the

experience term to measure returns to general (transferable) capital

accumulation.

Information on prior mobility should also be useful in

correcting for heterogeneity bias. The explanatory power of the enriched
wage function ought to be enhanced.

The coefficients of experience (X) in the standard wage function,
which includes only education in addition to the experience terms, reflect

a gross effect

which is a mixture of returns to general and specific

capital:

The standard wage function has an upward sloping and concave experience profile (the concavity is more pronounced when w =

in cross sections and in longitudinal data)8 Its slope has been derived
in human capital theory and in econometric studies. In view of (2a) it is

It is interesting to note according to (2a), that even if no genera]. capital were accumulated in the work career, wages would still rise
over the life—cycle and, as a group average, the wage profile would

tend to be concave so long as the tenure wage profile is concave.. and

does not increase over the life cycle.
Wage functions with tenure variables w (XT) can be estimated in

hgeneous groups without bias (honegeneity defined as the same tenure

wage profile) ,but no such groups can be defined a priori: In the

presence of heterogeneity the tenure coefficient is likely to be exaggerated, as in the case of mobility, and corrections need to be de—

To the extent that general returns to capital (Wa) are not fully

measured (standardized)

by regression variables, the bias will arise.

Of course, positive tenure coefficients need not reflect wage growth

in the firm. Higher wage levels (not growing with tenure) for the same
labor in some firms create incentives to stay there longer. Although
transitional, this relation is likely to be widespread in a dynamic

economy as an equilbrating phenomenon. Such supply adjustments to
shifting demands are most likely to involve younger people whose mobility is less costly especially in terms of specific capital losses.

Note, that in this case prior mobility is not a good index of wage

heterogeneity. Similar and more long—lasting effects can be created
by above equilibrium union wages and nepotism.
Can information on prior mobility be used in the wage function as
an index of relevant heterogeneity, that is of individual differences in

W and consequently in the wage-tenure coefficient? The answer is less
clear in the wage equation than in the mobility equation. Positive
serial correlation in mobility makes the link between length of tenure

and mobility almost definitional whatever the urce of heterogeneity
in mobility. The problem for the wage equation is that bias in the tenure
coefficient is only in part due to heterogeneity in specific capital and
the latter is responsible for only a part of the heterogeneity in mob-

ility. Thus prior mobility may be a weak instrument for elimination
of heterogeneity bias. Its role in wage formation is nevertheless of
interest to our study.

— 29 —

and

Table 6 presents wage functions of the younger ,' older NLS men, and

of

all men inMID. The independent variables are the same as in the mobility
functions in Table 5. The dependent variable is the logarithmic wage°
and row (1) is the "standard" wage function where the independent var-

iables are education and experience. In the next row the tenure terms
are added. In the third row we add the prior mobility variable and in
the last row we observe its interaction with experience.

In the young men's panel the introduction of tenure reduces the

experience coefficient: At this stage (on average five years of experience), wages grow 6.6 percent per year of experience (1st row of Table
6); wages grow 4.3 percent as returns to general post-school human
capital accumulation (2nd row of Table 6) and 2.3 percent due to specific

capital accumulation. The tenure coefficients are large and significant.
Prior mobility is not related to current wages and does not affect the

tenure coefficits.

The coefficient of the interaction variable is

surprisingly positive but quite small, and its intr3duction raises the

tenure coefficient slightly. Apparently differences in early mobility
of young men are not indicative of future differences in specific capital
investments nor do they capture differences in wage levels which are
positively related to the length of current tenure.
In the wage function for NLS

older

men the experience profile is a

plateau, but tenure slopes are positive (and concave) though much flatter

than for young men.21 Still, the observed tenure effect is biased upward. Introduction of prior mobility cuts the linear term in half and
reduces its significance. We may conclude that repeated mobility at an
advanced stage of the life—cycle is an indicator of persistent turnover,,

denoting little investment in specific capital. The mobility variable

Taken together the findings in both NLS panels

on wages are significant,

show that tenure effects

reflecting the firm—specific component of wage

progress on the job. This component accounts for about, one third of

wage growth per year in the early part of working life. At young ages,
past mobility does not clearly distinguish tendencies toward firm specific

human capital behavior. It does so, however, at older ages. At that
stage lesser specific investments also result in lower wages, apparently
as a result of slower growth over the past decades.22
The wage function in the MID panel, which covers all working ages,
indicates that on average (and in mid—career) the firm specific component
accounts for 20-25 percent of wage growth per year (difference between the

X—coefficjents in lines 1 and 2, panel c). Prior mobility is negatively
related to wages. The interaction term is also negative suggesting that
men who continue to be frequent movers in the third decade of their
working lives have both lower wages and flatter experience profiles of

wages. The inclusion of prior mobility variables reduces the tenure
slope by close to 20 percent. Thus, heterogeneity biases the tenure—
wage slope coefficient upward by about 25 percent, half as much as it biased
the tenure-mobility slope (panel C of Table 5).

— 33—

7. Tenure, Exuerience and Mobility: Additional Remarks

We used. the generalized term "specific hian capital behavior" to
cover both the informational theory of job matching and the theory of

specific han capital invesent. The former is a necessary
condition for the latter, and both are required for cpleteness.
There is another and popular view that the reality of tenure ef-

fects on mobility and on wages is largely institutional. The effects
we n1yzed are seen as "seniority rights" which include job security,
pension rights, vacations, and seniority based pay and prortion advan-

tages. But the distinction is superficial. The "rights" themselves
may well derive from htan capital specificities in the presence or
absence of formal, especially union, regulations. Indeed, recent research shows that tenure turnover profiles decline and tenure wage
profiles grow as much and more U) in the non—union as in the union

sector.23

-

In the past, experience coefficients

were often crudely inter-

preted as on-the-job general investments. In the wage function which
includes tenure the experience coefficients

effectively segregate

returns to general hiznan capital investments, but they contain both
returns to on-the—job general investment and across jobs wage gains due

to mobility (but not to tenure). These across—jobs wage changes are

positive in purposive quits especially in migration, but are often
negative when job change results fr layoff, "exogenous" quit, and job
dissatisfaction •24

34 -

Over the life—cycle the effects of mobility on wages become increasingly less favorable at least as measured by money wages. Quits, migration,
and occupational upgrading predominate in mobility of the young, but they

become relatively unimportant at older ages. Since the frequency of job
change declines over the life cycle for reasons already spe'led out, the
mobility component of wage growth

declines over the life cycle both

as a result of declines in the size and in the frequency of wage gains

across firms. This is another aspect of the well-known concavity of the
experience profile of wages.

Some models elevate the across—firm wage change to a single explan—

ation of the typical concave life—cycle wage profile: The worker is
envisaged as moving up a fixed wage offer distribution over his lifetime.

Successful on-the-job search results in off—the-job wage growth. With
a fixed wage offer distribution turnover declines with labor market

experience. Thus older workers have a higher wage and a smaller probability of future separation.25
Although they produce concavity in the wage profiles, such models
are quite inadequate as major explanations of magnitudes of wage growth

over the life cycle ():

71n his work, Jobanovic (1978) has shown that job matching processes produce downward sloping tenure separation functions and up-

ward sloping tenure-wage functions. Investments of employers and
workers in their mutual association are a corollary. We use the language
of specific capital to cover the combined phenomena.

8For a theoretical treatment of this distinction see Mortensen (1978)

9We may note that even if returns to specific capital accumulation,

and in particular W did not decelerate with tenure, but grew in a linear
fashion, the resulting growth of acceptance wages would nevertheless
lead to decelerating declines in the probability of quit, given a
declining upper tail of the wage äffer distribution.
10
We must be careful, however, not to assert the converse: by
itself, inertia does not bring about specific investments.

11For evidence and references see 3. Mincer (1974).

12The deterministic

treatment is for expository convenience only.

See Part II for a more formal and more specialized analysis of the
stochastic process.
13Perhaps

a simple way of illustrating the conclusion

that

dx

is larger with than without tenure dependence, is to consider a case

in which we go from none to some tenure dependence. Let the mean tenure
in the group be T and the overall turnover rate s. Then after a passage
of a year the (l—s) stayers have increased tenure by one year, while
the s movers, without tenure dependence, lost, on average T years of

tenure. The net change

dx

is therefore (1-s) - sT, which approaches

- 38

zero since T approaches (!

- 1).

—

Now, let s remain the same, but the

process become taure—dependent. In this case, the average thnure lost
< T since proportionately more of them are drawn from

by movers is

low tenure classes. Consequently the net gain in tenure

sT > (1 — s)

= (1 -

14Theorexn 2, Part II.

15Cf. Theorem 3 in Part II. Such a decline in the variance need not
be inconsistent with a widening of differences in mobility rates.

16The best known work is that of Blumen, Kogan, and Mccarthy (1955).

For a recent exposition and critique see Singer and Spilerman (1976).

For those men whose current tenure started before the initial
year of reported prior mobility (1965 for the old NLS, 1966 for the young

NLS, and 1968 for MID), no information on PM is available (12% of young
NLS, 62% of the old NLS, and about 50% in MID). As a check on the results
in Table 5 which implicitly assigns values PM = 0 to those whose tenure
is too long, we used dummy variables on the complete samples, and we also
replicated the regressions of Table 5 on the subsamples which contained

information on prior mobility. The results were quite similar to those in
Table S with one interesting feature that was already mentioned: The
tenure coefficients for the old men in NLS (with short tenure in the sub-

sample) were as steep as for the young and the inclusion of PM reduc
the slope by a relatively small amount as it did for the young.

18The longitudinal evidence is less familiar. See Borjas and
Mincer (1978) reporting Coletnan—Rossi data, and Anderson, Balcer, and

Diamond (1976) on the Continuous Work History Sample.

discussion in Part II, following Theorem 3.

20Dollar wage equations, not shown here, show similar patterns, but
weaker predictive power.

21This is true also in the sample with T < 8, in contrast to the
short-tenure mobility equation (see note 17).

22Supporting evidence is shown in ti Bartel and Borjas paper in
this volume, as well as in previous research by Borjas.

Borjas (1975)

classified the older NLS men into movers and stayers. The latter were

defined by the fact that their current job was the longest ever. Education and experience were only slightly different in the two groups.
The movers had lower wages (about 25 percent) and flatter experience
profiles.

23Freeman (1978), Borjas (1978), and others. The flatter union

tenure slopes have been analyzed as effects of union policy. We
suggest that theyniay also reflect lesser heterogeneity in the union

compared to the non—union sector.

24See Bartel and Borjas, this volume.

25Burdett (1973), Sorensen (1974). Jovanovic (1978a) is an adapt-

ation

of Burdett, which allows for on-the—job human capital

accumulation.

It is doubtful, however, that the assumption of a fixed wage offer
distribution can be maintained for workers whose skills are growing and
changing over the life-cycle.

PART II
labor Mobility as a Stochastic Process

In this part we treat labor mobility and wage growth

over the life cycle as related stochastic processes.We first

focus on th evolution of these processes for a given worker,
and we interpret our formulation within the context of exis-

ting theories of turnover and of wage growth and list some of
the implications of these theories. Next we take up the

question of unmeasured heterogeneity in the population,and the

problem of sample selection over time,known as the 'mover -

stayer"

problem. A remarkably simple result is proved in

Theorem 3

which relates the behavior of a heterogeneous

to the behavior of the individual members of that
group.In interpreting the result,we pay particular attention
to the on-the-job training hypothesis.Lastly,we describe an
group

method which may be applied to estime..te various
parametrizations of the separations and wage equations.

e purpose of this section is to draw some parallels betieen

wage rates

and tenure t will receive. It may be noted that both w and s are mathe-

matical expectations conditional upon t, x, and z.
Hereafter it is assumed that when a particular job episode

terminates, it is iediately followed by a new job episode. That is,
there are assumed to be no unemployment spells or spells of market non-

participation. Given this assumption, consider now the special case in

which /x

—

3F/x0

— 0.

Then each job episode is identically dis-

tributed. If, in addition, the job episodes are also assume to be
independently as well as identically distributed, then turnover becnes
a pure renewal process (see Feller (1966) Cli. II]. In what follows, we
study processes that are re general than the renewal process, and ucre
general than semi—Markov processes.

Let a(x, z). be. the probability density that worker z will experience a job—separation at the point in time at which his market experi-

ence is equal to x. (For the special case where turnover is a renewal
process, a(x,z) is known as the renewal density.) A.lso let h(t)x, z)
be the probability density that a worker with market experience x will

have current job tenure equal to t. Note that for this statent to be

There are several reasons for choosing this approach. First, the
deteninistic earnings—function approach (see, for exanple, Mincer

(1974)] is a special case of the above formulation. In the earnings function approach turnover is not considered explicitly so that job—tenure is

not included in the regressions. Such regression equations are here
interpreted as expectations conditional on x and on the measured compo-

nent of z, and the expression that characterize such conditional expec-

tations are provided in equations (8) and (U). A set of sufficient
conditions under which the conditional expectation of the wage is a
monotonicaUy increasing function of experience is provided below.
Second, thà job—matching theory of turnover as developed in
Jovanovic (1978 )

is fully consistent

the latter is restricted to s 'C—

w

'C

with the above

formulation when

0 for aU (x, t, z) so that the

turnover process is predicted by the theory to be one of pure renewal.

The key assumotions in generating such a result are a constant rate of
discount, and infinite horizon, and an assumption about the job—search

—6—

process that makes the latter "pure exterience search" in the terminology
of Nelson (1970). The model also implies w > 0 for all t, and

< 0

for large enough t and perhaps for all t.
Two other search models that explicitly look at the implications

for life cycle mobility are those of Burdett (1973) and of Jovanovic
(l97$a). Both models involve the worker ving up a fixed wage—offer

distribution over their lifetime, with search of the "pure search" kind
(Nelson's terminology again). Both models imply that in the absence of
on-the—job training, s < 0 and w > 0 while s w — 0 for given x.
When firm—specific h"" capital investment is introduced (Jovanovic
(1978a) 3, the latter prediction changes to s < 0 and w > 0 for all
workers except the very old for whom s > 0 and w <

0

as they allow

their human capital to depreciate toward the end of their lifetime.
General on—the—job training raises wages, implying w >

0

given

a monotonic increase in general training over time. Since general

training raises the worker1 a productivity in many firms, it is not expected to affect turnover, and therefore s - 0 is consistent with
and with the presence of general training. A somewhat different
argument asserts that the presence of general training is the cause of
> 0

turnover at younger ages, because it may be optimal for the training

to be acquired in several different firms and such turno'er is planned

in advance. To the extent that such turnover is significant, (and

little evidence is available to support its significance), it may produce non—monotonic effects on s(t, x, z) for young workers as t and x

increase.

Intuitively, one expects that Theorem 2 should extend to the case
where s < 0 and s < 0, that is, to the case where the separation pro—
pens ity declines with both tenure and market experience, and that the

in the separation propensity considered as a function of market

decline

experience alone (a (x, z)], should, if anything, be reinforced. While

this conjecture may be tzie, an attet at proving it along the lines
of the proof of Theorem 2 fails, because

can not be signed.
Theorem 2 asserts that the renewal density declines notcnically

if the inter—event waiting-time distribution possesses a znotonica.lly

decreasing hazard rate. Note that a parallel result for monotonically
increasing haza.rd rate distribution does not hold. That is,

an extension of an earlier result

due to Barlow, Marshall and Proschan

(1963).

Their result states that

mixtures of decreasing hazard—rate distributions

also

possess decreasing

hazard rates.
Suppose that there are no true age or tenure effects on

separations so that t(tIx0,z) = 0
everywhere. Then,

— 17 —

A

st(t,x0)

=

— -(sIx0,t)

•

-

so that the group separation rate declines

although the individual separation rates are constant.Further-

more, (t,x0) would in this special case be convex in t (which
would be consistent with the evidence presented in Table 2) if

O(x0,t) declines monotonically with t. For a wide class of distributions p(zx0) one would expect such a monotonic decline because the selection out of the sample as t increases is such that
"movers" are (on avrrage) selected out leaving behind only the
"stayers" so that the sample of those left behind becomes increasingly more homogeneous.But

need not decline monotonically

as is demonstrated by the following example0Assume that at any x0,

p(zx0) is such that z takes on only two values, say I and 0,
and that the z = 1 workers have .a higher separation propensity
than do the z = 0 workers.Assuine that the initial ( t = 0 ) sample
is such that nine-tenths of the workers are z = 1 types and that
the remaining one-tenth are z = 0 types.Then the initial variance

of z is (1 —

.9).9

=

.09.

As tenure increases, the population pro-

portions shift towards the stayers, and the variance of z increases

steadily up to .25, at which point the population proportions are
equal.Thereafter, the variance declines monotonically to zero.Of
course,a monotonic decline would occur even in this example if
the initial proportions happened to be equal,or were weighted in
favor of stayers.

Acoording to the first part of equation (18), the change in
the group separation rate is always an overstatement (in the negative direction) of the average of the individual chariges.However,

the same is not true of the group wage-change because the covariance

term in the second part of equation (18) may be either positive

— 18 —

or negative. The relevant question is whether a "mover"
(for whom (t,x) -

(tx0,z)

is negative) would expect to

receive higher or lower wages than a "stayer" at a certain te-

nure- level given that it was optimal for both to remain in the
firm up to that time. A theory which predicts that a worker
will separate from a job on which wages paid to him were low
relative to his prior expectations implies nothing about this
question.

The implications of human capital theory for the sign

and magnitude of Cov(,Jx0,t) are ambiguous.In part I we emphasized the role of firm-specific human capital in generating a

wedge between the worker's productivity in his current firm
and his productivity elsewhere.Consider the polar case in which
the ratio of general to firm-specific training is fixed and

constant across workers,but that workers differ in the total
amount of training that they undertake.Suppose that z is an
index inversely related to the worker's propensity to invest in
on-the-job training.Under these assumptions, a higher propensity to invest also implies a higher investment in specific

training, s,o that (tx0,z) > 0. Assume that z is not corelated with unmeasured ability components.Then, since investment in training involves foregone earnings early on in return

for higher earnings later,this implies that w(tIx,z) > 0 for
young workers (for whom x0 and t are small), and w(tlx0,z) < 0

for older workers0Therefore Cov(,x,t) is positive for
the young and negative for the old workers.

Suppose instead, however, that the total amount of training
across individuals (with given x0 and t and other observable cha-

— 19 —

racteristics)

is cènstant while only the ratio of general to

specific training varies positively with z.Now, high-z workers
have higher separation propensities because their training is
general in nature rather than firm-specific.In view of the
well-known argument (see Becker (1975)) that general training is
financed by the workers, such workers earn lower wages initially,
and higher wages later on, than do "stayers" whose training is
more firm-specific in nature.(Again,this conclusion depends
on the assumption that the preference for the type of training
is not related to unmeasured ability differences).The implication

now is that Cov(,x0,t) is negative for the young, and
positive for the old workers.
Neither polar case is expected to obtain in practice.Bo-th

the total amount and the composition of the training may be expected to vary systematically with z.But which doninates ? The

wage-function estimates reported in Table 6 strongly suggest

the dominant variation is in the total amount of training.
In both parts of this table,this inference in made by comparing
the second line with the forth line in part A of Table 6,and the se-

that

cond line with the third in part B. The variables PM and NIM are indexe:

of past mobility and are corelated with (ttx,z).By definition,
z is the unmeasured component of heterogeneity,and the inclusion
of PM and NIM therefore has the effect of reducing the absolute

value of Cov(,sIx0,t).In both parts of Table 6 there appears
to be an effect of this reduction.The wage growth, measured as the
sum of the coefficients on X and T, increases for the young men
when NIM is included, and decreases for the older men when PM is
included in the regression, and these changes are consistent with
the first polar case,but not the second,as is clear from equation
(18).

An Estimation Procedure2

The following estimation procedure exploits the property of

p(zx) (defined in (15)) of having two different functional forms,
implying, in turn, two

different

functional forms for '(t,x0) in

(17).We demonstrate below how identification of the parameters may
be secured by subdividing the sample of all workers into two subsamples:
one for which x0 = 0 (workers on their first job ever) ,and the other

for which x0>0. In fact,in the following illustration for an additive
fixed-effect parametrization àf s(t,x,z),the parameters are overidentified,which suggests that identification may be secured for more
complex functional forms which we hope to consider in future work.

The following additive fixed-effect formulation is perhaps inadequate in captring the individual differences,but it is adequate as
an illustration of the estimation method.Let

(22)

s(t, x, z) —

z +

S(t,

where, without loss of generality S(o, o)

0. One

possible

way to pro-

ceed is to take first differences in equation (22) and eliminate z,

thereby also eliminating the selection bias. There are two proble
with this approach. First, using differences in separation probabilities as the dependent variable leads to coefficients that are not

— 22

—

significant. Secondly, there is then no possibility of estimating

the variance of z • We have therefore chosen a different procedure,
which is based on deriving two separate relationships associatd with

equation (22).
Let z Ct, x)

be

conditional expectation of z and s Ct, x)

the cor4—

expectation of the separation rate given t and x. Then,

taking conditional expectations in equation (22),

s(t, x) — z(t,

The regressions for the separation equations are reported

in the first two columns of Table II —

1.(Separate

regressions were

also run for quits and for layoffs and they are reported in the table,
although they do not have an interpretation within the mathematical
structure presented above).The three linear coefficients and the
two constant terms provide five restrictions on the four parameters
so that the parameters
nitude

of

are overidentified.However,

the relative mag-

the two constant terms is reverse from that implied by the

— 2-7 — -

theory,

leading to an estimate of

which is negative, which may

mean that the additive fixed-effect formulation is inadequate.In future
work, we intend to experiment with different functional forms for the
separations and wage equations, focusing on the question concerning
the best way to model the individual differences, and to organize the
data so that the time interval, Lxx, is shortened to one year rather
than two.
