The models presented in this paper were developed by the
authors under the direction of William Branson while at
OECD Project Interfutures and were extended during the
NBER Summer Institute for International Economics. The
results of the simulations are somewhat different from
those contained in the final report of Project
Interfutures and do not reflect the official views of
Project Interfutures. The research reported here is part
of the NBER's research program in International Studies.

trade flows and trade prices for 26 regions and three commodities. A
simple exchange rate model used developments in current accounts to

model changes in nominal exchange rates. The regions coiered are the
twenty—three1 OECD countries and three non—OECD region: LDCs, OPEC, and
the centrally planned economies (CPEs).

Introduction
This paper contains a detailed description of a model of trade and

exchange rates. A verbal summary of the model may be found in NBER Working
Paper li

The model contains equations for import demands, bilateral trade flows

and trade prices for 26 regions and three commodities. A simple exchange rate
model used developments in current accounts to model changes in nominal exchange

rates. The regions covered are the twenty—three1 OECD countries and three
non—OECD regions: LDCs, OPEC, and the centrally planned economies (CPEs).
Sector A contains an algebraic description of the model and a glossary of

variables and parameters. Section B is a detailed discussion of the equations
and the sources of the parameter values.

1Belgium and Luxembourg are combined and Yugoslavia is included in the
CPE region.

The short—run income elasticity in import equation for goods and

services is (a) and the price elasticity is (B). In the long—run,
when (Y) equals full—employment output (Y*) income elasticity is
one and the long—term import/output ratio is (P) when relative

prices remain stable.

3. Export Price Equation

Cae alternative to obtain estimates for the coefficients in the export
price equation would be to use substitution elasticities from our import
share equation and price elasticities from our import equations (calculate a compound price elasticity for each exporting country from substi-

tution elasticities (A) and price elasticities (8) ) in the import function and obtain
information
relevant

supply elasticities from other sources. As econometric

about

trade supply elasticities is very scarce (the only

empirical estimates for our purposes that

are rtus and Rhomberg (1973), Samuelson

Krugman (1977). The elasticities of export prices with respect to competitors' price and some measure of the cost variable from the above
sources are shown

in

Table 5. The coefficients for these variables

do not necessarily sum

to

unity; we therefore calculated the "first

state estimates" as arithmetic means, using the estimates in columns
1, 2 and 3 for the coefficient of competitors' prices and

estimates

in

columns 5, 6 and 7 for the coefficient of domestic prices. Then these
coefficients were scaled to add up to one. These are our final estimates for (c) for OECD countries and

they

in

Table 6.

and Papaefstratiou (1978) calculated proxies for market power
for a sample of 41 countries consisting of both developed and developing
countries. They assumed that market power in any commodity is an in-

Branson

creasing function of the country's share in world trade.
A comparison of the market power index for 15 developed countries using
our estimates (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Noray, Spain, Sweden, The United
Kingdom and The United States) shows that these are closely related.
This dependence allowed us to derive a value for (1—u) for the export
price equation of non—oil LDCa in our model which is .70. This same
elasticity

was also applied to the export price equations for goods and

services of Centrally Planned Economies and OPEC.

4. Other Parts of the Current Account
The "world interest rate" in the net inve8tment income equation was set
to .03. jtjal (1975) value for "other terms" in the current account
is kept constant during the projection period.

5. Domestic Price Equation
The coefficients for the effects of imported raw materials (*) and

petroleum

are

price increases (it)

formulas from the 1975 data and

calculated according to the following

are shown in Table 7.

Branson—Ralttunen—Masson (1978) and in Branson—

Haittunen (1979) to the trade block. These sources give the exchange
rate equations for Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, Prance, and Italy.

(dollar/local currency) exchange rates were used for the first two
countries and for Canada' and the (Deutsche Mark/local currency) rates
for the three remaining countries which were converted also to determine
(dollar/local currency) exchange rates. The money stock variables in

the exchange rate equations were neglected2i due to the fact that our
growth projections do not give any indiciation of the future monetary
growth of these countries and only the effects coming through changes
in net private foreign asset stocks were taken into account.
Exchange rate equations were estimated in log—form and that is why the

obtained parameters are elasticities. For our purpose these equations
were translated into a linear form using the following procedure. The
exchange rate equations can be written in elasticity form as:
(1)

1975 values for E and F were used. Equation (ii) is the equation for exchange rates for Canada, France,

Germany, Italy,

United

Kingdom used in the model.

implicitly we assume that the effects coming through changes in both
countries' money stocks cancel each other out. The work is in progress

to allow exchange rates to respond to different growth rates of money stocks.
