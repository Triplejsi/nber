Adjusting Depreciation in an Inflationary Economy:
Indexing Versus Acceleration

ABS TRACT

With the existing "historic cost" method of depreciation, higher
inflation rates reduce the real value of future depreciationdeductions
and therefore raise the real net cost of investment. The calculations in
this paper show that this rise in the net cost can be quite substantial
at recent inflation rates; e.g., the real net cost of an equipment investment with a 13 year tax life is raised 21 percent by an 8 percent expected
inflation rate if the firm uses a 4 percent real discount rate.
The effects of inflation on the net cost of investment can be completely eliminated by indexing depreciation. A more accelerated depreciation schedule can also lower the net cost of investment and make that net
cost less sensitive to the rate of inflation. The current paper examines
a particular acceleration proposal and finds that, for moderate rates of
inflation and real discount rates, the acceleration proposal and full
indexation are quite similar. For low rates of inflation, high discount
rates, or very long—lived investments, the acceleration proposal causes
greater reductions in net cost than would result from complete indexing.
Conversely, for high rates of inflation, low discount rates, or very short—
lived investments, the acceleration method fails to offset the adverse
effects of inflation.
Since the acceleration and indexation methods have quite similar
effects under existing economic conditions, the choice between them
requires balancing the administrative simplicity and other possible advantages of acceleration against the automatic protection that indexation
offers against the risk of significant changes from the recent inflation
rates and discount rates.

Adjusting Depreciation in an Inflationary Economy:
Indexing Versus Acceleration
Martin Feldstein*
Under existing law, the depreciation of plant and equipment that firms may
claim in calculating taxable income is limited to the original or "historic"
cost of' the investment. The annual depreciation allowances are not adjusted
when there are increases in the general price level or in the cost of replacing

the particular asset. A higher rate of inflation therefore lowers the real
value of' the depreciation allowances on any investment.1 Since depreciation
allowances reduce a firm's net cost of making an investment, a higher rate of

inflation raises the net cost of investing.2 The combination of inflation and
existing tax laws thus discourages investment in depreciable plant and equipment
and, by making investment less profitable, may reduce the economy's rate of'

saving. Moreover, since the reduction in the value of' the depreciation that is
caused by inflation depends on the life of the asset, inflation also distorts
the choice between short—lived and long—lived equipment and thereby reduces the
productivity of the capital stock.

*presjdent, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Professor of Economics,

research and to the NBER and National Science Foundation for financial support
of this work. This research is part of the NBER Research Program in Taxation
and the NBER Study of Capital Formation. The views expressed here are my own
and should not be attributed to any organization.
1-According to estimates by the Department of Commerce, the depreciation
allowances of nonfinancial corporations in 1978 would have been 140 percent greater
than the $1114 billion actually allowed if depreciation were based on the replacement cost of the assets instead of their historic cost. Feldstein and Summers
(1979) discuss the comparable figures for earlier years.

2This is equivalent to an increase in the effective tax rate on capital income.
Feldstein and Summers (1979) show that in 1977 the use of' historic cost depreciation raised the total effective tax rate on nonfinancial corporations and
their owners by nearly 114 percentage points.

Several economists have pointed out that these adverse effects of inflation
on the value of depreciation allowances could be eliminated completely by
changing from historic cost depreciation to a method of indexed depreciation)The simplest such scheme would adjust the value of allowable depreciation each
year for the rise in the consumer price index since the previous year.2
Although depreciation allowances have been indexed in this way in a few
countries with very high inflation rates3, it has been common in most other
countries to deal with inflation by reducing the number of years over which an

asset can be depreciated.
In the United States, some tax experts have advocated shorter depreciation lives
instead of indexed depreciation on the ground that acceleration is much simpler
than indexation for taxpayers to use and that such administrative simplicity

saves real resources. This is particularly true of proposals to "expense"
investment (immediate write—off) or to depreciate all kinds of equipment over

the same number of years. It is further argued that indexing depreciation might

'e, for example, Feldstein, Green and Sheskinski (1978), Feliner (1975),
Galper and Mendenhall (1976), International Monetary Fund (1975), Shoven and
Bulow (1975), and the papers in Aaron (1976) and Tax Foundation (1975.)
2An alternative method of indexing depreciation would adjust each type of asset
by a different price index in an attempt to reflect differences in the rates of
change of replacement cost. Since adjusting for changes in the relative prices
of different assets and in the relative prices of consumption and investment
goods is really a separate issue from overall inflation adjustment, I will limit
my discussion to adjustments based on the consumer price index.

3These include Argentina, Brazil and Israel. See the descriptions of the Brazil
and Israel methods in Nadiri and Pastore (1977.)

For

example, for a broad range of equipment investments, Canada allows a
two—year write—off while the United Kingdom allows immediate expensing.

lead to other kinds of indexing that reduce the overall stability of the

economy.1 Yet another argument in favor of acceleration is that it can be used
to provide an incentive for investment spending above and beyond merely of f—

setting the adverse effects of inflation.
Proponents of indexing have countered that a shortening of depreciation

periods is inferior to indexing in three important ways. First, any specific shortening of depreciation lives may be either inadequate or too

generous at existing inflation rates. Second, since the proposed shorter
depreciation lives do not depend explicitly on the rate of inflation, the
benefit of shorter lives would more than offset the effect of inflation when
the future inflation rate is low but would fail to offset it when the infla-

tion rate is high. Third, for any rate of inflation, using an arbitrary
short depreciation life benefits long—lived investments more than short—lived
investments and thereby distorts choices among assets of different durabi-

lity. The correct choice between the administratively simpler acceleration
approach and the more precisely appropriate indexing depends on hoc well acceleration approximates indexing over the relevant range of asset lives, interest
rates and inflation rates.2'3
The primary purpose of the present paper is to provide just such a
1See Fischer (1917) and Gray (1976) for analyses of the conditions under which
general indexing may be destabilizing.
2My colleague, Dale Jorgensen, points out that all of the benefits of
indexing could be achieved by allowing an immediate deduction of the entire
present value of the future real depreciation whenever an investment is made.
In practice, this would be equivalent to expensing a fraction of the initial
cost that varies inversely with the life of the asset. Selecting the fraction requires choosing (actually or implicitly) a real discount rate for
calculating the present value.
3More rapid depreciation may also bias patterns of ownership and leasing because
of the differences in marginal tax rates.

comparison of the relative effects of acceleration and indexing on the

firm's net cost of investment. The effects of both methods are calculated
for a wide range of asset lives, interest rates and inflation rates.

With

these calculations, it is possible to analyze how the relative impact of the
two methods differs according to the inflation rate for a given asset as
well as how it varies among assets of different lives for a given inflation

rate. The paper also provides evidence on the extent to which inflation and
the existing historic cost depreciation method now raise the net cost of
investment and distort the mix of long—lived and short—lived investments.
There are, of course, many different ways in which shorter lives, more
rapid acceleration schedules and increased investment tax credits can be

combined to reduce the net cost of investment. Although the calculations
described below were initially made for several different such acceleration
combinations, I decided to focus the presentation of results on a particular
acceleration proposition that has been receiving substantial attention in

tax policy circles. Two key members of the House Ways and Means Committee,
James Jones and Barber Conable, recently introduced a bill that would permit
structures to be depreciated in 10 years, equipment (except automobiles and
light trucks) to be depreciated in five years, and autos and light trucks to be

depreciated in three years.1 The annual depreciation amounts2 for the shorter
lives are calculated on an accelerated schedule which is essentially the sam—of—

2he proposed legislation is HR}46146 of the 96th Congress, known as the Capital
Cost Recovery Act of 1979. Jones is an Oklahoma Democrat and Conable is a New
York Republican. The Senate sponsors of the bill are Lloyd Bentsen (D, Texas),
Bob Packwood (B, Ore.) and Gaylord Nelson (D, Wisconsin.)

2The bill refers to the annual depreciation amounts as "capital cost recovery allowances" to emphasize that these are not intended as measures of
actual economic depreciation.

—5—

the—years'—digits method.1 The proposal also calls for extending the full 10
percent investment tax credit (ITC) to all equipment (other than autos and light
trucks) and providing a six percent ITC for autos and light trucks.
The first section of the paper describes the measure of the net cost of
investment that will be used to assess the impact of inflation and the effects

of the indexing and the acceleration methods. Section two then shows how, with
the existing method of historic cost depreciation, inflation raises the net

cost of investment. The third section presents the key comparisons of the net
costs of investment under the indexing and acceleration methods for different
inflation rates and asset lives.

In the end, each reader must decide for himself whether the acceleration
method approximates the indexing method closely enough to justify the selec—
tion of the simpler but less accurate method of adjusting depreciation to
avoid the adverse effects of inflation.

1. The Net Cost of Investment
The net cost to a firm of acquiring any piece of plant or equipment is
the difference between the market price of the asset and the present value of
the reductions in tax liabilities due to the investment tax credit and future

depreciation allowances. Consider, for example, a machine with a market price
of $100 and an allowable life of 13 years. The 10 percent investment tax credit (ITc) causes an immediate tax saving of $10. With historic cost depre—

TFor equipment, the percentages of the initial costs to be allowed in the
first five years are 20%, 32%, 21%, 16% and 8%; the low percentage in the
first year reflects the "half—year" convention of allowing one—half of a full
year's depreciation during the first year. For buildings, the depreciation is
10 percent in the first year, 18 percent in the second year, and then declines
at 2 percent a year. For vehicles, the depreciation is 33 percent, )45 percent
and 22 percent, which are the percentages obtained by using the double declining
balance method.

—6—

elation, the $100 original cost of the machine causes a $100 reduction in
taxable income over the life of the machine. With a 146 percent marginal rate
of corporate income tax, the $100 reduction in taxable income lowers taxes by
$146. The present value of this tax saving depends on the method of depre-

ciation and the firm's rate of discount. This present value is greatest if
the firm uses

the

sum—of—the—years'—digits method. With this method of depre-

ciation, a 13 year tax life, and a discount rate of 10 percent, the $146

of tax savings through depreciation has a present value of $29.814. The net
cost of

the investment is thus the $100 purchase price minus the $10 ITC

the present value of

future

and

tax savings of $29.814, i.e. a net cost of $60.16.1

Table 1 shows the present—value net cost of acquiring a $100 piece of
equipment under the existing tax law but in the absence of inflation.2
The calculations assume that the investor is subject to a 146 percent

tax

corporate

rate and chooses the depreciation method that achieves the lowest

net cost. The figures in Table 1 show how a higher discount rate, by reducing
the present value of future depreciation deductions, raises the net cost

of investment. Comparing the net costs for equipment with a three year tax
life and an 8

year

tax life shows that the eligibility of the 8

year equipment

for the full investment tax credit outweighs the slower rate of depreciation.
Further increases in the tax life of an asset raise the net cost of investment
wthenever there is a positive discount rate. Analogous calculations for
structures, presented in the lower half of the table, show the effect of

nearly 140 percent reduction in the net cost of the investment can he
regarded as a partial offset to the 146 percent rate of tax levied on future
earnings. Samuelson (19614) has shown that a tax on profits will not
distort investment decisions only if complete economic depreciation is

1The

allowed.

2The calculations assume that the investment is not eligible for the 20 percent

additional first year depreciation.

limiting

the investment tax credit and the sum—of—the—years'—digits method to

equipment. The net cost of a given structures investment is higher than an
equal investment in equipment and the difference grows with the allowable depreciation life of the asset for any positive discount rate.
The net cost of acquiring $100 of investment goods is a useful measure of
how inflation and different depreciation methods affect the incentive to invest

and the choice among assets of different durability. An increased rate of
inflation raises the net cost under existing tax rules while a shorter depre-

ciation life lowers the net cost. To interpret changes in the net cost, it is
useful to bear in mind that a rise in the net cost of investment has essentially the same effect on the internal rate of return as an equiproportionate
fail in the annual operating profits (i.e., sales revenue minus operating

costs, or quasirents.) Equivalently, the internal rate of return on an investment can be maintained when the net cost rises if the annual operating profits
rise by the same percentage.1

The internal rate of return is of course an alternative measure of the

effect of changes in tax rules or the inflation rate. However, comparing
internal rates of return requires specifying the pretax income of the invest-

ment and the true pattern of economic depreciation.2 The relation between the
This homogeneity property holds precisely when the discount rate used to
calculate the net cost is the internal rate of return on the profit. This is
shown formally in Appendix A.
2There are other related ways of assessing the impact of inflation and the
depreciation method. Auerbach (1979) suggests the relative change in the gross
rate of return that must be earned on an investment to produce a previously
fixed real net—of—tax yield to investors; see also King (1977). Feldsteiri and
Summers (1978) suggest the maximum potential net rate of return that can be
paid to investors on the basis of a given pretax real return. Both of these
approaches are useful in other contexts but require specifying the economic
life of the asset, the time profile of output, the method of financing the
investment, and the pretax or post—tax rate of return.

—9—
change in the net cost of investment and the change in the internal rate of
return depends in particular on the economic life of the investment and the

allowable speed of depreciation. For an investment that lasts forever and produces a constant perpetual yield, a rise in the net costs induces an equal per-

centage fall in the rate of return. As the economic life gets shorter, the proportionate change in the rate of return for any given change in the net cost

increases. For very short—lived investments, a relatively small change in net
cost can imply a quite large change in the rate of return if there is no change

in operating profits.1 With typical economic lives and pretax rates of return,
the relative changes in the internal rates of return are similar to the change
in net costs.2

In practice, a change in the initial net cost of investments will cause
changes in both the internal rate of return and the annual operating profits.
The relative importance of these two changes will depend essentially on the
supply elasticity (with respect to the rate of return) of funds for business
investment and on the demand elasticity for the products of such investments

with respect to their relative price.3 If the supply of funds is perfectly
1To take an extreme example, consider an investment with a one year life, a net
cost of $100 and a rate of return of 10 percent. A 5 percent increase in the
net cost cuts the return in half while a 10 percent increase in net cost eliminates the entire return.
2Consider, for example, an equipment investment with an 11 percent pretax
return, a 13 year allowable tax depreciation, and exponential decay of gross
operating profits at 7.7 percent a year until the equipment is scrapped at the
end of 13 years. As the inflation rate rises from 1 percent to 8 percent, the
net cost under the acceleration proposal rises by 5 percent while the internal
rate of return falls by 7.6 percent (from 10.5 percent to 9.7 percent.) A
further increase in inflation from 8 percent to 12 percent raises the net cost
under accelerated depreciation by an additional 5 percent while the internal
rate of return falls by an additional 7.2 percent. Other examples are presented
in Appendix B of this paper.
3This statement oversimplifies because the operating profits depend on the product price relative to wages and other input prices and because the relative
price of the investment goods themselves may change in response to their demand.

—10—

elastic,1 a change in the net cost must leave the rate of return unchanged
and therefore must raise the annual operating profits by the same percentage as

the rise in net cost. Appendix A to this paper presents a simple general
equilibrium model and analyzes the implications of differences in the relative
supply and demand elasticities.

To appreciate the magnitude of any given change in net cost, it may also
be useful to compare it with the equivalent change in the investment tax cre-

dit. For example, a $100 investment with a 13 year life has a net cost of
$51.90 when evaluated at a real discount rate of I percent in the absence of
inflation. A 10 percent rise in this net cost is therefore equivalent •to
reducing the investment tax credit by $5.19, i.e., by 5.19 percentage points
from 10 percent to 1.8 percent.

The remainder of this section specifies the formulae for calculating
the net cost of investment under the three depreciation methods that will be
(1) historic cost depreciation with

compared empirically in sections 2 and 3:

existing lives, (2) indexed depreciation with existing lives, and (3) the specific method of acceleration described above.

Historic Cost Depreciation

Consider an asset that can be depreciated over T years. The economic life of
the asset, i.e., the number of years until it is scrapped, may also be T years
but it need not be; the economic life of the asset is irrelevant in calculating
-1-The elasticity of the supply of funds for business investment depends not only
on the responsiveness of saving but also on the competing demands for funds
(for housing and government spending) and on the international mobility of
capital. A common assumption in studies of investment behavior has been that
the supply of funds is perfectly elastic; see e.g., Hall and Jorgenson (1967) and
Eisner (1978). Feldstein and Summers (1978) found that the supply of funds
for business investment appears to be very elastic, i.e., that changes in the
potential internal rate of return caused by changes in tax rules cause only
very small changes in market rates.

and comparing the net costs of the investment.

The fraction of the initial cost of the asset that can be deducted as a
depreciation expense in year t of the asset's life under the existing historic

cost method of depreciation will be denoted DHt. If T is the corporate tax
rate, the reduction in other tax liabilities in year t is TDHt. With the
straight—line method of depreciation, DHt =

l/T

in each year. As noted above,

the optimal policy is to use the sum—of—the—years'—digits method which makes

DHt = 2(T—t+1)/T(T+1).-'2
Let r denote the real discount rate that firms use to calculate the present value of the future tax savings that result from allowable depreciation3.

Indexed Depreciation
The basic idea in indexed depreciation is to adjust each year's allowable
depreciation for the increase in the price level since the asset was

purchased. This has the effect of making the real value of depreciation in
each year of the asset's life independent of the rate of inflation. If

p denotes the price level at the time the investment is made and t denotes
the price level t years later, the allowable depreciation with the indexing
method is DIt =

(l+i)t

and DIt =

DHt. If the inflation rate is constant at j, 't'0 =

DHt.

The increase in the nominal amount of allowable

depreciation exactly offsets the fall in the real value of the dollar and

Aiaive and essentially equivalent approach is to discount the nominal
depreciation amounts by a nominal discount rate equal to the sum of the inflation rate and the original real discount rate. The resulting expression for
CH differs from that in equation 1.2 only by a second—order term that disappears
if discounting is continuous.

Comparing C1 n equation 1.14 and CA in equation 1.5 shows that
the relative net costs under these two ways of changing the current depreciation method will depend on the rate of interest, the rate of inflation, the
depreciation life of the asset, and the proposed method of accelerating depreciation.

2. Inflation and the Cost of Investment with Existing Tax Rules
Before comparing the effects of indexing and acceleration, it is

_14
useful to examine the way in which inflation raises the net cost of investment

with existing tax rules. Table 2 presents the ratio of the net cost of
equipment investment with the specified rate of inflation divided by the net

cost when there is no inflation. These relative net cost ratios are presented
for different combinations of the real discount rate and the allowable tax life.
The corresponding ratios for investments in structures are presented in
Table 3.

Consider, for example, the effect of an 8 percent sustained rate

of inflation on the relative net cost of an investment in equipment. With a
real discount rate of 14 percent (i.e., a nominal discount rate of approximately

12 percent), the net cost of investment for a 13 year piece of equipment is 21

percent higher than it would be if there were no inflation. In comparison to
the net cost of $51.90 in the absence of inflation that was shown in Table 1,

the 8 percent inflation raises the net cost to $62.56.1 With a lower rate of
discount the increase in the net cost is greater; e.g., lowering the nominal
discount rate from about 12 percent to 8 percent (i.e., a real discount rate of

zero) raises the cost increase from 21 percent to 31 percent. Raising the nominal discount rate to about 15 percent reduces the cost increase from 21 percent

to 16 percent. Thus for any plausible discount rate, the 8 percent inflation
rate causes a substantial rise in the net cost of investment.
An increase in the allowable tax life of the asset generally increases
the sensitivity of its net cost to inflation.2 With a real discount rate of 14

Thnce abolishing the entire investment tax credit would raise the net cost of
investment from $51.90 to $61.90, the 8 percent inflation has a greater effect
than eliminating the entire ITC.
2Only with high discount rates and very long lives is this reversed. Auerbach
(1979) shows that, with his alternative measure of the distorting effect of
investment, the extra cost decreases monotonically with the durability of the
investment if there is exponential depreciation and a fixed real net rate of
return.

percent or more, there is little extra rise in the relative net cost for

increases in the asset life beyond 13 years. But inflation clearly raises the
net cost of short—lived investments by relatively less than the increase in

the net cost of long—lived assets and therefore biases the pattern of investment in favor of short—lived assets.
The relative increases in the net cost of investments in structures that
are shown in Table 3 are very similar to the corresponding figures for equipment in Table 2.

This

represents two offsetting factors. Because structures

are not eligible for the investment tax credit or the suni_of_theyears'—digitS
method of depreciation, the net cost of an investment in structures is higher

in the absence of inflation; this was shown in Table 1. The lower rate of

depreciation

the

also means that inflation causes a greater absolute increase in

net cost of investment. Since the two increases are of approximately

equal proportions, the increase in the relative net cost is about the same.
For example, in the absence of inflation, a structure with an 18 year life

have a net cost of $66.62 per $100 of investment at a 14 percent discount
rate. This is 23 percent higher than the net cost of $514.08 per $100 of equipment investment with the same depreciation life and discount rate. An 8 percent
would

inflation

would raise the net cost of the investment in structures to $79.98, an

increase of $13.36 or 20 percent. Similarly, an 8 percent inflation would raise
the net cost of equipment investment by $12.11 or 22 percent. The cost of
investment in structures is thus 21 percent higher than the cost of a comparable
investment

in equipment. As a result, the relative net cost ratios in Tables

and

3 are very similar: 1.22 for equipment and 1.20 for structures.

historic cost depreciation rule, the 8 percent inflation rate raised the net
cost

of

investment by 21 percent. Table 14 shows that the acceleration propo-

sal would eliminate almost all of the increased cost under these circumstan-

ces. In particular, the real net cost is only three percent higher with the
shortened depreciation life than it would be with complete iridexation.
Table 14 also shows that acceleration favors longer lived investmentsJ
With a 14 percent real discount rate and an 8 percent rate of' inflation, the net

cost per dollar of investment is 9 percent higher for an investment with an 8
year life than for an investment with an 18 year life. With a real discount
rate

of' 7 percent,

the extra cost is 12 percent higher. This bias toward longer

lived investments is slightly stronger than the bias toward shorter lived
investments that prevails under existing tax rules.
The relative net cost of acceleration and indexing remains between 0.9 and
1.1 for almost al]. combinations of real discount rates between 14 and 7 per-

cent, inflation rates between 14 and 12 percent, and lives between 3 years and

is not able to eliminate the effects of' inflation.

The results are quite similar for investments in. structures. Table 5 shows

b.

Conclusion
A firm's real net cost of investing in plant and equipment depends on the

investment

tax credit and the present value of the future real depreciation

deductions. With the existing historic cost method of depreciation, a higher
rate of' inflation reduces the real value of future depreciation deductions and

therefore

raises the real net cost of investment.

The calculations presented in the paper show that the rise in the net

cost per dollar of investment can be quite substantial. The real net cost of
an equipment investment with a 13 year tax life is raised 21 percent by an 8
percent expected inflation rate if the firm uses a real discount rate of 4

percent (i.e., a nominal discount rate of 12 percent). For any real discount
rat.e, inflation raises the net cost relatively more for long—lived assets than

for assets with shorter tax lives, thereby distorting the pattern of investment in favor of short—lived investments.
The effects of inflation on the net cost of investment can be completely
eliminated by an indexing rule that adjusts the cost base for the rise in the

general price level. A more accelerated depreciation schedule can also lower
the net cost of investment and make that net cost less sensitive to the rate

—23—

of

inflation. The current paper examines a particular acceleration proposal

(that essentially provides a 5 year life for all equipment and a 10 year life
for all structures) and finds that, for moderate rate of inflation and real
discount rates, the acceleration proposal and full indexation are quite simi-

lar. For low rates of inflation, high discount rates, or very long—lived
investments, the acceleration proposal causes greater reductions in net cost
than would

result

from complete indexing. Conversely, for high rates of

inflation, low discount rates, or very short—lived investments, the acceleration method fails to balance the adverse effects of inflation on the net cost
of investment.

Advocates of the acceleration method argue that it can achieve the same
desirable offset to the adverse effect that inflation has on the cost of
investment as indexing can, but without the administrative complexities of
indexing or the risk of an economically destabilizing extension of the

indexing principle to other aspects of the economy. The analysis in the present
paper of a particular acceleration proposal indicates that this claim is essentially
true if the inflation rate is in the range of 14 percent to 12 percent and the

investor's real discount rate is between 14 percent and 7 percent. With higher
or lower inflation rates or real discount rates, the acceleration method can

he substantially different from indexation. The accelerated depreciation
schedule could of
change

course

be altered in the future if

economic conditions

significantly, but the possibility of such ad hoc adjustments is

inherently destabilizing and the lack of retroactive adjustment introduces
unnecessary risks into current investment decisions.

Since the acceleration and indexation methods have quite similar efrects
under existing economic conditions, the choice between them requires balancing

the administr@ive simplicity and other possible advantages of acceleration against
the automatic protection that indexation offers against the risk of significant
changes from the recent inflation rates and discount rates.

Appendix A
Total and Partial Responses of the Internal
Rate of Return to Changes in Net Cost
This appendix shows how a rise in the net cost of investment affects the

rate of return on

investment in a general equilibrium context in

price of the product can vary. The analysis here thus elaborates the

the text about the importance of

remark on page 9 of

the elasticities of the

supply of funds and the demand for the product. For simplicity, the appendix
takes the wage rate as numeraire and assumes that there is only a single cton—

sumer good in the economy.1
Consider a "standard machine" to be one that uses one unit of labor per

period, has a durability of T years, and produces output y(t) for O<t<T. Let
the gross price of the machine be g, the price per unit of output be constant at
p and the wage rate be unity. The net operating profit (quasirent) in year t of'
the machine's life is thus q(t) =

p.y(t)—l.

Let the tax rate be T, the annual

depreciation deductions be d(t) and the investment tax credit be ITC. The internal rate of return on the investment (x) is then defined implicitly by:

1This ignores changes in the relative prices of the final goods produced with
capital, the capital goods themselves and other goods like housing. The gross
price of the investment good is treated as exogenous on the implicit assumption
that the investment goods are made by labor alone. The analysis also assumes
only a simple technology of production.

A-2
Thus an increase in c and an equiproportionate increase in the q(t)'s keeps the
internal rate of return unchanged.
We now extend this analysis from a single standard machine to the entire

capital stock. For any equilibrium age structure of the capital stock, the
distribution of machine outputs (y(t)'s) remains constant and therefore the mean

output remains constant at .

The mean quasirent is therefore also a constant,

qp37—l. On the basis of equation A—2 we can write the function relating the
internal rate of return to the net cost and the average quasirent as
x =

with the understanding that this function is homogeneous of degree zero in q and
C.

Appendix B
After—Tax Internal Rates of Return

With Indexing and Acceleration
This appendix presents the real after—tax internal rates of return for
investments under the indexing and acceleration methods of depreciation.
Results are presented for assets of different life and for different inflation

rates. Separate figures are given for equipment and for structures.
The gross operating profits of each investment are assumed to decline

geometrically over the life of the investment. The rate of decline is the
inverse of the life of the investment. The initial level of gross operating

profit is selected to make the pretax internal rate of return 11 percent. The
allowable tax depreciation life is assumed equal to the economic life.
The calculated internal rates of return are presented in Table B—i.
