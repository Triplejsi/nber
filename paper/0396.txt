Family

Effects in Youth Enp1oyrrent
ABSTRACT

The authors beam with the hypothesis that parental contacts

play a major role in finding jobs for youth. This hypothesis is
tested with a iixlel of youth tploynent that includes characteristics
of other family manbers in addition to a large set of control

variables. Particular attention is paid to parental characteristics
that right indicate a parent's ability to assist the youth in
finding a job, including occupation, industry and education. The
effects of such variables are aenerally not siqnificant and do not
support the

initial hyoothesis. Hcver, the

'p1oynnt probability

of a youth is significantly affected by the presence of rp1oyed

siblings, indicating the presence of sate intrafarnily effects.

FAMILY EFFECTS IN YOUTH EMPLOYMENT

I. Introduction
Youth unemployment can be decomposed into two principal compo-

nents. One of these arises from the high turnover of young people.
As Baily and Tobin have written: "Much teenage unemployment, it is
often observed, comes from dissatisfaction with the available job
options, a gap between expectations or aspirations and the realities
of low wages and poor working conditions. One consequence is high

turnover. Even when jobs are available, therefore, unemployment is
high.

,l

The second component arises from the shortage of jobs. As Clark
and Summers point out, "The substantial cyclic response to changes
in aggregate demand suggests that a shortage of job opportunities
characterizes the youth labor market."2 This second component is,

of course, larger during recessions. The data used in this study,
described in the next section, refer to 1975 and the early part of

1976, when unemployment was still quite high. The unemployment rate
for the whole civilian labor force was above 7 percent throughout this

period and rates for young workers (16 to 19 years old) were above
18 percent. The component representing demand deficiency at current

wage rates, rather than turnover, must therefore have been substantial.

The existence of demand deficiency unemployment of youth has

an implication that we seek to test: If there is a shortage of jobs
for young workers at prevailing wages, then there must be one or
more nonprice rationing mechanisms that determine which young people

get the available jobs. Our special hypothesis is that the family
of the young person furnishes such a mechanism; those young people
get jobs whose parents or siblings have jobs, particularly jobs in
which they can influence hiring decisions. Some support for this
view can be found in earlier studies of the labor—force participation
of young people. Bowen and Finegan, who found that after controlling
for other forces the labor—force participation of married women falls

with husband's income, were surprised to find that the adjusted
labor—force participation rate of males 14 to 17 in school in urban
areas in 1960 rose through the range of other family income between

$4,000 and $11,000. In seeking to explain this, they wrote "We suspect
that art of the explanation turns on the comparative advantage that
youngsters in these families have in finding part—time jobs. For one
thing, their parents are more frequently able to help, mainly as a

result of their business and social contacts."3 Robert Lerman found
significant effects of parent's occupation on the employment of youth,

using dummy variables for broad occupational categories. In particular,
he found that having a parent who is a white collar worker, either
salaried or self—employed, or a farm manager significzlAtly increases

the probability of employment relative to having one who is a low—level
'blue collar worker.4

It should be noted that giving assistance in finding work is
clearly not the only way in which family members can influence the

employment prospects of young people. Much education takes place in
the home so that youths who have well—educated parents and who have
been exposed to books and to serious discussion while growing up may
have advantages in finding and holding jobs over other youths with

the same axunt of formal schooling. Moreover, fanilles have expectations about how their members should behave. Young people whose
families expect them to go to work for whatever reason (cultural,
religious, or economic) are more likely to be employed than young

people whose families do not have this expectation. We shall refer
to such expectations as a work ethic.

It follows that a variety of variables measuring different aspects

of the family and its members might have some discernable effect
on estimates of employment probabilities. In addition to family income,
these could include education, occupation, and location.

(The work

ethic might be stronger in some regions or areas than in others).
We set out to test the hypothesis that parental contacts assist

youth In finding jobs. Our results show no significant effects of
parental characteristics on youth employment. We do, however, find
significant effects of the employment status of siblings, which Indicates
the presence of some sort of intrafamily interactions.

II. The Data Set

The results presented in this paper are from the cross—sectional
data set called the "Survey of Income and Education", collected in

the spring of 1976 (April through July). The full sample is a national
stratified probability sample of households in which 151,000 house-

holds were interviewed. This makes the sample roughly three times
the size of the Current Population Survey. The interview includes
most of the information available from CPS interviews, plus a good
deal of additional detail on sources of 1975 income and on education.

We have analyzed data for men and women aged 17 to 20 living in
nonf arm households where they are the children of the head. This ex-

cludes those young people who have moved out of their parents' household to live by themselves or establish their own families. The group
that was 17 to 20 in 1976 was 16 to 19 in 1975, and one of our depen-

dent variables measures work experience in 1975. Using the ages 17
to 20 in 1976 rather than 16 to 19 also gives us a less unequal division
of the sample between those in school and those not in school.
'The distinction made here between those in school and those not

in school is based on whether or not the person had attended school

since February, 1976. The alternative of using major activity in the
survey reference week Is only viable for those observations collected
in April and May, since many June and July observations were collected
during school vacations.

The regressions presented in the next section are based on a data
file we have created that merges observations on the young person with
observations on household Income and individual data on other members

of the household 16 years of age and older. This individual data includes
sex, age ,scholing status, employment status and relationship to the

—5

young person. Additional data is used on the head of household
(one of the youth's parents), including industry, occupation and

years of education. These, it was felt, could help to measure the
likelihood of the parent having contacts that would help the youth
get a job.

III. Regression Results
We have been persuaded by the work of Clark and Summers, among
others, that for young people the distinction between being unemployed
and being out of the labor force is not always meaningful, since the

boundary between these states is so blurred. Accordingly, we use
several measures of employment as our dependent variables. The two
measures shown here are:

(a) estimated total hours worked last year

(the product of weeks worked and usual hours per week) and (b) a

dichotomous variable taking the value of one if the teenager was

employed in the survey reference week. We also used weeks worked last
year and a dichotomous variable indicating unemployment in the survey
reference week as dependent variables, but the results are not presented

here. The regressions using weeks worked give similar results to
those using total hours worked but the fits are not quite as good.

The regressions using unemployment fit very poorly for in school youth.
For out of school youth all significant coefficients in the employment
regression have the opposite sign in the unemployment regression,
though the fit is again poor.

Each model was estimated separately for males and females in and

out of school. We chose to treat the decision to attend school as
given, rather than as jointly endogenous with the decision to work, in

order to simplify estimation. The means for many variables differ
substantially across the subsets, especially for the dependent variables.

—6

The differences are most striking between in and out of school youth,

with out of school youth showing stronger ties to the labor force:
over one—third more employment and unemployment and twice as many hours

worked last year as in school youth. The coefficnts obtained in the
separate estimations are also quite different for in and out of school
youth, ruling out any attempt to capture the effects of school attendance

with a dummy variable. The split between male and female shows less
conclusive differences, although the effects of some of the control
variables (notably marriage ) do vary substantially between groups.

Table 1 gives the means and standard deviations of all variables

for each of the four subsets used. Table 2 shows our estimates of the
determinants of estimated hours worked last year. We used a tobit

technique to allow for the presence of people did not work in 1975
and hence have zero hours observed. Table 3 shows the corresponding
estimates of the determinants of employment in the reference week,
using a probit technique to allow for the dichotomous nature of the

dependent variable. Tables 2A and 3A simply involve rescaling the tobit
and probit coefficients to correspond to ordinary least squares coefficients for easier interpretation.

In general, we get significant effects (at the 5 percent level)
for variables measuring schooling, race, being in a female—headed

household, and being in a poverty area. We also estimate significant
effects for the employment status of siblings, but generally not for
the employment status of the head.
Schooling

Since we are dealing with people whose schooling has often not

been completed, we measure years of school completed relative to the
mean for all people of the same

age

in the main SIE sample. The variable

—7

"Education gap 1" measures the number of years above the overall

mean for those who are above. "Education gap 2" measures the
number of years below the overall mean for those below. Having less
education than the average of one's age group lowers employment significantly In all eight regressions.

The three negative signs on "Education gap 1" in Table 2 seem
to be an anomaly arising because those people with more education than
their age group had a greater than average probability of being in

school last year. In Table 3, where the schooling status and dependent
variables both refer to the same year, the signs on "Education gap 1"
are all positive.
Income

A second set of variables explored measures family Income. The
one used here, other family income, is the income of the household in
1975 minus the earnings of the young person whose behavior is being

measured. This has no significant effect on employment in the reference
week. For those in school its effect on total hours worked last year
is mixed, while it is significnatly positive for those who are not in

school.In earlier work we used a number of additional variables
indicating whether the household received income in 1975 from various

kinds of transfer payments. At some stages of our work, a few of these
variables showed significant negative effects on some measures of youth

employment. However, they did not remain significant in the presence
of the other variables included in the final model.
Geographical variables
A third set of variables deals with various geographic aspects of

the labor market. The data set places observations in one of nine
regions of the country. We have included a set of eight regional dummy
variables in all regressions as control variables, and there are always

—8

some significnat differences in youth employment by region. Variables
indicating whether or not the household lived in an SMSA or in the

central city of an SMSA were not significant. The final model includes
a dummy variable taking the value of one if the household lives in an

area designated by the Census Bureau as a poverty area. In our sample
12 to 13 percent of youth in school and 17 to 18 percent of youth not

in school lived in such areas. This variable has an effect that is
consistently negative and usually clearly significant. For youths in
school of both sexes, living in a poverty area reduces the probability

of employment by 10 percent, other things equal. Since other family
income and race appear in the regressions, this should probably be
interpreted as measuring the availability of job opportunities in the
locality.5

We also tried using a variable measuring the total unemployment
rate in the SMSA for SMSA's that could be identified in the data set.

The unemployment rate was taken from a published external source
(Department of Labor estimates for May,l976) and merged into the data

set. Only about one—third of our observations were in areas for which
we could use this information. The variable did not have a significant
effect even in regressions confined to observations for which the

variable could be used. We might have gotten better results by generating
unemployment rates by area for spring 1976 from our own data set.
However, this would have required processing data on all households;
we have used only households including youth.
Race

We have used two variables to identify youth by race, dummy

variables identifying blacks and Hispanics. Both are consistently

5An alternative explanation for this result lies in environmental
characteristics common to poverty areas other than lack of jobs,
such as low quality education and limited motivation.

—9

negative and usually significant with the effect of being black
being generally substantially larger than that of being Hispanic.
For regressions whose dependent variable is "employed last week",

being black lowers the probability of employment by 17 to 25 percent
even after controlling for schooling, other family income, and

location in a poverty area. For youth not in school, in Table 2,
negative coefficients on the variable identifying blacks are about
one—half the size of the mean of the dependent variable. With other
measured variables equal, we estimate that black youth not in school
worked half as many hours in 1975 as white youth. We also duplicated
our analysis with regressions run using only observations on blacks.
The results (not reported here) tend to be similar, with less consistency of coefficients between subsamples and lower significance
levels, probably due to the large reduction in sample size.

We have tried using a variable measuring whether or not the
principal language spoken in the household is English; this is less
successful than the variable identifying Hispanics.
Family influences

When we started our research, we expected to find powerful

influences of the position of t1head of the household on the employ-

ment status of youth living at home. The effects we find are much
weaker than we expected. Living in a household with a female head
has a negative effect in seven of eight regressions, and a significant

one in four. Living in a household with a self—employed male head
generally has a positive effect, but this is significant only once
at the 5 percent level and twice at the 10 percent level for employment

and hours worked last year. The effect on unemployment is consistently
negative and generally significant.

—10

Sets of dummy variables identifying male heads who were not
employed and the major industry or occupation of the employed male

heads performed very poorly. So did an index of three—digit occupations scaled by median income in the occupation in 1969. Education
of the male head was tried and entered with a negative sign ——

that

is, it acted like an index of permanent income rather than a measure
of access to jobs.

Our second set of variables measuring family effects identifies
the employment status of siblings between the ages of 16 and 24 who

are in the household, using a set of eight dummy variables. Within
this large set, there are four subsets, for older brother, older
sister, younger brother, and younger sister.6 In each of these subsets,
there are two dummy variables, e.g. "older brother not employed" and
"older brother employed;" the base or omitted variable of the subset

is "no older brother living at home." If the person to whom the independent variable refers has more than one sibling between the ages
of 16 and 24 living at home, there may be entries of 1 rather than 0

in more than one of these dummy categories. For a person with two
older brothers, for example, one employed and one not employed, both
dummies in the older brother subset take the value 1.

Employment decisions within the household are presumably made
simultaneously, and our single equation model does not permit us to

analyze the simultaneity. If we have an observation on a youth named
John who is employed and he has an older brother named Fred who is also
employed, we detect the associations, but we cannot tell whether John

found Fred a job, Fred found John a job, or both were subject to
some common parental or environmental influence that increased the
scheme of classifying siblings by sex and birth—order was suggested
by the work of Claudia Goldin on the employment of youth in Philadelphia
in 1880.

—11

probability of their being employed. It should also be noted that if
both of them are between 17 and 20, observations for both will appear
somewhere In our regressions with many (though not all) of the independent

variables being identical. However, the scheme should permit us to
separate the effects of job contacts 'and the family's work ethic from

Income effects by examining the signs of the coefficients.

The income

effect of Fred's working on the probability that John will work is
presumably negative.

As
ment

shown in Tables 2 ar 3, the positive association of

auploy-

status anong siblings is very strong. For males in school, having

an atploy&1 sibling significantly increases the dependent variable
in seven of eight cases in the two tab1es.tavin a siblin8 not employed

significantly decreases the dependent variable in all eight cases.
For fen1es and males not in school the effects are not always signi-

ficant, though the signs are alirost always the same. Sane of the
effects for females are also quite large. For

example, other measured

variables held constant, having a younger brother employed increases
the chances of a female in school being employed by 15 percent, or
increases her estimated hours worked last year by '87 relative to a
mean of 400.

The differences in coefficients for siblings of different sexes
may support the interpretation that the sibling variables reflect
information networks in the labor market, rather than local job

availability or parental influenoe. Because many occupations or
industries still employ workers predominantly of one sex, a youth may
be better able to help a sibling of the same sex find work. The differences in coefficients may also arise from stronger derronstration
effects or closer personal relationships between siblings of the same
sex.

but the effect of a younger brother employed is only 21. For a
male, having a younger brother employed increases estimated hours
last year by 178, but the effect of a younger sister employed is

only 80. In both cases the larger figure is clearly significant
at the 5 percent level and the smaller is not.

One further refinement of the sibling dummies was used, splitting
each dummy into two dummies for the sibling being in and out of school.
Besides giving an unwieldy number of coefficients to interpret,
the expanded set of dummies showed few differences in coefficients

based on school status. Thus we chose to use only those sibling
dummies presented here in the final model.
As rcientjoned above, these results can only be viewed as suggestive

because the family's work ethic is not distinguishable from its job

contacts. One possible area for future research would involve comparing
the detailed occupation and industry of each youth with those of his

parents or siblings. A high correlation could indicate the presence of
helpful contacts made by relatives on the job. Another approach could
be to examine some other data sets to check for consistency of the basic
results and to add further explanatory variables, such as the presence
of reading materials during childhood, that could capture more of the

unobserved part of family background. In this regard one could consult
data sets that ask how the respondent found his job (or why he in
particular was hired after applying).
One final alternate approach requires a different estimation technique,
presented by Gray Chamberlain.7 This would use analysis of covariance,

with each set of siblings representing a different group for comparing
the within—group to the between—group variation. Some complications
result from the different numbers of observations across groups and the

need to use non—linear estimation, but it would allow one to control for

Any of these approaches would shed more light on what role, if
any, a family plays in the employment of its youth.
