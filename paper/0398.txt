Adolescent Health, Family Background,
and Preventive Medical Care

ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the health of white adolescents,
focusing particularly on the roles of family background and nreventive

medical care. This emphasis is motivated in part by our desire to
study adolescent health in the context of the nature—nurture contro-

versy. The findings indicate first, that family characteristics
(especially mother's schooling) do have a significant impact on
adolescent health and second, that preventive care is an imnortant
vehicle for this impact in the case of dental health hut not in the
ease of nhysicai. health measures. Similarly, the greater availability

of dentists hs a positive impact on dental health, but greater
availability of pediatricians does not alter the physical health

measures. On the basis of these results we predict that Qoverment
efforts to improve the dental health of adolescents with policies to
lower the cost of dental care or increase the availability of dentists
are much more likely to be successful than similar policies directec!

at improving their physical health.

ADOLESCENT HEALTH, FAMILY BACXGROUND,
AND PREVENTIVE MEDICAL CARE

Linda N. Edwards and Michael Grossman*

This paper investigates the health of white adolescents, focusing

particularly on

the roles

of family background and preventive medical

care. This emphasis ii motivated in part by our desire to study adolescent health in the context of the nature—nurture controversy. Despite
the

existence

of a massive literature on the relative importance of hered-

ity (nature) and the home and school environment (nurture) in the determination of cognitive development,1 the corresponding issue has not been

directly addressed by researchers in child and adolescent health. This is
partly because

much of the health research is limited either to poverty or

to minority populations (Hu 1973; Kessner
Dutton

and

Silber 1979),

and

1974; Inman 1976;

partly because researchers who

Dutton

1978;

use represen-

tative samples do not adopt the multivariate context necessary for distinguishing between genetic and environmental influences (Douglas 1951;
Douglas and Bloomfield 1958; Keilmer—Pringle, Butler, and Davie
Haggerty,

variate

Roghntann, and Pleas 1975; Zimmer 1978). Our

1966;

research uses multi—

statistical techniques to provide some evidence of the degree to

which nurture——that is, the family and local environment——acts in deter-

mining the health levels of a representative sample of white adolescents.
One aspect of the adolescent's environment, medical care, has been
recognized

as the

logical vehicle for public policy

aimed at

improving

adolescent health. For example, Newberger, Newberger, and Ricbeond

Keniston

and

the

(1976),

Carngeie Council on Children (1977), and Marmor (1977) all

have proposed that national

health insurance

should provide coverage of

—2—

prenatal care,

pediatric

care, and

dental

care.

Bills

with this aim

bean introduced in Congress by Senator Jacob K. Javits and

have

Congressman

James H. Scheuer, both of New York. To cite another illustration, recently—
enacted Federal legislation has attempted to increase the availability of
pediatricians and dentists in medically underserved areas to expand the

use of preventive care in such areas. The Emergency Health Personnel Act
of 1970 (PL 91—623) created the National Health Service Corps., whose mem-

bers are

assigned

to health manpower

shortage

areas. The Health Profes-

sions Assistance Act of 1976 (PL 94—484) encourages new graduates of medical and dental schools to locate in urban

ghettos

and rural regions by

forgiving their medical education loan obligations.

Further, the Health

Maintenance Organization Act of 1974 (PL 93—222) gives priority for de—
veloretental funding of lIMOs in medically deprived areas.

One objective

of our research is to provide estimates of the potential payoffs to
national health insurance and medical manpower policies directed at improving youths' health.

The specific health indicators we study are oral health, obesity,

anemia, and corrected distance vision. These four are chosen not only
because they represent health problems that create discomfort for the
teenager, but more importantly, because they may be good predictors of

subsequent adult health. Indeed, they all partly reflect poor health
habits

that

are likely to persist

into

adulthood. With the growing evi-

dence that adults' choice of life styles and health behaviors can have
important impacts on their health (Breslow and Klein 1971; Fuchs

1974a,

1974b; Grossman 1975; Manheim 1975), it is natural to look into adoles-

cence to understand the formation of these habits. A second motivation

—3-.

for choosing these indicators is that they represent health problems that

other

are capable of being affected by family decisions concerning diet and

of at-home health care, as well as by pediatric and dental care.
This is in contrast to many adolescent health problems that are either
forms

self—limiting, such as

morbidity from acute conditions,

or irreversible,

such as congenital abnormalities of the neurological system.
To analyze these health problems we use data from Cycle III of the
U.S. Health Examination Survey (HES),

an

exceptional source of jnformation

about a national sample of 6,768 noninstitutionaljzed youths aged 12 to

17 years in the 1966—70 period.2 The data comprise complete medical histories of each youth provided by the parent, information on family socio-

economic characteristics, and birth certificate information. Most important, there are
examinations

objective

measures of health from detailed physical

given to the youths by pediatricians and dentists employed

by the Public Health Service. These data are supplemented by two medical

resource inputs specific to the youth's county of residence (the number

of pediatricians per capita and the number of dentists per capita) and
information on the presence of controlled or natural fluorides in the
water

supply system that services the youth's community. The last piece

information enables us to evaluate the impact of a collective, as opposed to an individual, preventive dental practice.
of

These data are used to estimate two types of relations: a health production function and a derived demand function for preventive care. The

resulting estimates permit us to answer the following four questions.
What is the size of the home environmental effect on

physical

adolescent oral and

(obesity, anemia, corrected distance vision) health outcomes?

—4—
How important is the home environment as a determinant of the demand for

preventive dental and pediatric care? How large are the effects of dentists, preventive dental care, and fluoridation on oral health outcomes?
How large are the effects of pediatricians and preventive pediatric care

on physical health outcomes? In addressing the last two questions, we
recognize explicitly the common—sense proposition that an increase in a
community's physician or dental manpower will not increase health outcomes unless it encourages more utilization of medical care services.

Previous empirical work on the impact of physicians or dentists on
health has not taken account of this restriction (for example, Newhouse
and Friedlander 1977).

Our findings indicate first, that family characteristics do have a
significant impact on adolescent health and second, that preventive care
is an important vehicle for this impact in the case of dental health but

not in the case of the three physical health measures. Similarly, the
greater availability of dentists has a positive impact on dental health,

but greater availability of pediatricians does not alter the physical

health measures. On the basis of these results we predict that government efforts to improve the dental health of adolescents with policies
to lower the cost of dental care or increase the availability of dentists
are much more likely to be successful than similar policies directed at
improving their physical health.

I. Analytical Framework
In a previous paper (Edwards and Grossman 1980), we have argued that

characteristics of the child that generate utility for the parents: his
health, sex, wealth, social adjustment, intellectual develoinent, etc.
Therefore, when parents choose their optimal family composition, they
choose not only how many children they will have but also what portion

of the family's resources will be devoted to each child. This choice is
made in the usual way:

parents choose the number and

quality

of children,

as well as of other consumption goods, so as to maximize their utility

of medical care,

nutrition,

and any other purchased inputs used to

—6—

improve children's health. It also depends on the number of children in
the family because the more children there are in the family, the more
costly it is to raise

their

average health level. In addition, to the

extent that there are systematic differences in the ability of families

to produce children's health with given inputs, these differences in

efficiency are also relevant. For example, more educated parents are
more likely to be able to follow doctors' instructions, to have general
information about nutrition, and to be willing and able to acquire medi-

cal information from published materials. Consequently, one would expect
more educated parents to be more efficient in producing healthy children.
Given these considerations, the following factors are expected to
influence children's health levels: the child's exogenous (genetic)
health endowment, family wealth, parents' wage rates, family size, par-

ents' educational attainment and other measures of their efficiency in

.

household production, and the direct and indirect costs of medical care
and other market health

inputs (vitamins, sanitation, etc.)

(The in-

direct costs of medical care are generated by the time spent in traveling,

waiting, and obtaining information about this care.4) The relationship

between the child's ultimate health and this set of factors may be
termed a demand function for the output of health. In this demand func'
tion a positive association between children's health and family wealth

is predicted (assuming that child health is a normal good). Similarly, a
positive association is expected between both parents' education and children's endowed health status and children's ultimate health status.

empirical estimation of the resultant "demand for

function would not yield answers to the questions

posed in the introduction. Such estimates would only yield information

about the total impact of family characteristics or medical input prices
on children's health. To determine the effect of preventive care on
health we need estimates of the health production function. Similarly,
to determine whether families with specific characteristics are more

efficient at producing healthy children also requires estimates of this

production function. Alternatively, to assess the role of family characteristics in determining the amount of preventive care received by
adolescents, an estimate of a derived demand function for medical care

is needed. Finally, a computation of the impact of health manpower
availability on adolescent health requires not only the above functions
but also a set of market demand and supply for health manpower functions.

In the latter case, we employ a simplified approach which yields rough
estimates of these manpower availability effects on health.

A. The Health Production Function
A simple, linear health production function6 is represented by

(1)

H=80+1E+B2G+83M+4X+85R+u1

Here H is a health measure, E is a vector of family efficiency characteristics, G is a vector of the adolescent's endowed health characteristics,
M is a medical or dental care input, X is a vector of other family inputs
(nutrition, parents' time, etc.), R is a vector of relevant regional characteristics (city size, region of the country, and whether or not the

water supply is fluoridated), and u1 is a random error term with the
usual properties.

The health production function actually estimated in Section III
does not correspond exactly to equation (1) because of inadequate data.
First, data on the amount of "other" inputs (X) are not available.

Therefore, we include the following proxy measures for X: family income,
family size, and the mother's labor force status. Family income is positively related and family size is negatively related to nutrition and

other unmeasured market health inputs. Family size and mother's labor
force status are proxies for the amount of time the mother spends with

each of her offspring. Women who work full—time or part—time in the
labor market and women with many offspring have less time to spend with

each one. In addition, our data do not include good information about

curative care, Consequently, M represents only preventive care. This is
not a serious deficiency because we have chosen health measures for which
the impact of preventive care (with the associated remedial treatment) is

large. (By focusing on health problems for which the medical

input is primarily preventive, we also avoid the necessity of modeling
the simultaneous determination of health levels and

B. The Derived Demand for Preventive Care

The derived demand function for medical care depends on the same set

of variables as the demand function for health:

F represents family income, education, family size, and other family char-

acteristics affecting either the demand for health or the family's efficiency in producing healthy children G and R are the same as in equation

We

cannot estimate this derived demand curve exactly as stated be-

cause data on p are not available. Inclusion of variables representing

the mother's labor force status helps control for variations in the
mother's

wate rate. Other input prices are partially controlled for by

the region and

of the health manpower variables in the derived demand equations embody

both the relationship between health manpower availability and direct and

indirect medical care prices, and the relationship between medical care
prices and the demand for preventive care.

Implicit

in

in the above

discussion is the assumption that an increase

a community's health manpower will not improve the health of adoles-

cents unless it encourages a greater utilization of preventive care ser-

vices. This assumption is explicitly incorporated in equations (1) and

— 11 —

(3):

D is assumed to have no direct effect on health in equation (1) but

alters health only via its impact on M in equation (3). Substituting
equation (3) into equation (1) yields estimates of the total impact of
doctor or dentist availability on health:

83a2) c+ 83a3D

84X+ (85+ 83 a4) R+u1+ 83u3

The total impact of pediatrician or dentist availability on health is given

by 83 a3. Note that an estimate of the total impact computed from individual estimates of a3 and 83 differs from that obtained from direct estimation
of equation (4) because the latter does not incorporate the restriction
that D does not appear in equation (l).8

D.

The Role of Family Background Variables

To the extent that there are faini ].y background variables common to

both the set E and the set F (parents educational attainment is a good
example of one), the substitution in equation (4) provides an additional
insight. Parents' education is clearly seen to have two effects on adolescent

health: a direct or "efficiency" effect given by 8i and an in-

direct or "allocative" effect given by 83 U1.

The latter refers to the

ability of parents with greater schooling levels to select a better input

mix

in the production function.

A.

Measurement of Adolescent Health

In the introduction to this paper, we expressed an intention to
study physiological measures of adolescent health that (1) reflect det-

rimental health behaviors or life styles that may persist and create
more serious problems in adulthood and (2) relate to problems that can
be modified by endogenous inputs in the health production function such

as proper diet, parents' time, and especially preventive medical care.1°
Based on these criteria, we focus on two correlates of poor oral health:
the periodontal index and the number of decayed permanent teeth; and on

disease. When a portion of the free gingiva is inflamed,
a score of 1 is recorded. When completely circumscribed
by inflammation, teeth are scored 2. Teeth with frank
periodontal pockets are scored 6 when their masticatory
function is unimpaired and 8 when it is impaired. The
arithmetic average of all scores is the individual's

(no inflammation or periodontal pockets) to a high of
8.0 (all teeth with pockets and impaired function).

It is clear from this description that higher values of the periodontal
index correspond to poorer

dental health. Our measure, APERI, is scaled

somewhat differently from that described above in order to remove the
well-known age and sex trends in the periodontal index. APERI is com-

is used for our other measure of oral health, the number

of decayed permanent teeth (IDECAY). We employ two measures of dental
health because it is one of the few health problems for which welldefined continuous health measures have been developed.

Obesity is represented by a dichotomous variable that equals one

if the physician rates the youth as obese or very obese (OBESE). The
physician presumably takes account of the youth's height, age, and sex
in making his evaluation.

Anemia is represented
the

youth's

by

a dichotomous variable that equals one

if

heinatocrit level is "excessively" low (ANEMIA).12 The

hematocrit level of a female youth is considered to be excessively low

the

if it is more than two standard deviations below

mean for all females

12 to 17 years of age. The hematocrit level of a male youth

it is more than two standard deviations

below the mean for all males in his stage of sexual maturity. This procedure is based

on Daniel's (1973) findings that (1)

heznatocrit values

differ by sex; (2) these values depend on sexual maturity rather than
age for male adolescents; and (3) hematocrit levels are independent of

age and sexual maturity for female adolescents. 13
Abnormal corrected distance vision is denoted by a dichotomous vari-

able that equals one if a

youth wears

glasses and

his corrected binocular

distance vision is 20/40 or worse or if a youth does not wear glasses and

his uncorrected binocular distance vision is 20/40 or worse (PVIS). This
standard

of

distance vision is the one

used

by National Center

for Health Statistics (1972).

the future lifetime well—being of a significant percentage of adoles-

studied

because there is a lack of

consensus among pediatricians concerning the importance of this condi-

tion in adolescence and the appropriate treatment (National Heart, Lung,
and Blood

Institute's

Task Force 1977). Moreover, the measures of high

blood pressure in Cycle III are somewhat suspect (National Center for

Health Statistics 1977). Congenital abnormalities are a source of

current and future difficulties, but we do not study

them

because to a

large extent they are irreversible. Parental ratings of adolescent
health and other subjective indicators are avoided because of the possibility that responses depend on the parents' socioeconomic status.
Parents with low

satisfied with

levels

of income

and schooling

are likely to be dis-

many aspects of their life including the health of their

offspring. Finally, we do not include measures relating to the "new
morbidity" such as "learning difficulties and school problems, behavioral
disturbances, ... and the problems of adolescents in coping and adjusting ..."

(see Haggarty, Roqhinann and Pless (1975), p. 316). While such

measures may well reflect life styles that have serious health conse-

quences, they are unlikely to be revealed in a physical exam. Nor are
they likely to be easily altered by preventive medical care. Although
examination of these and other excluded health measures would be neces-

sary to

paint a complete picture of the health of this adolescent cohort,

it is not relevant to the objectives of this paper.

B.

Measurement of Preventive Dental and Medical Care
Preventive dental care is measured by a dichotomous variable that

equals one if the youth saw a dentist for a check—up within the past

year (DTPREV). Similarly, preventive pediatric care is measured by a
dichotomous variable that equals one if the youth saw a doctor for a

check—up within the past year (DRPREV). These variables distinguish
between two groups of adolescents:

(1) those who received preventive

care; and (2) those who received no care at all or only curative care.
These two measures of preventive care are preferred to alternatives like
the number of dental or physician visits or the receipt of curative care
alone because our measures are less likely to reflect reverse causality

from poor health to more medical care. Of course, our measures
reflect the possibility that adolescents received treatment as well, as

an examination, but the appropriate treatment of problems revealed by
an annual check—up is an integral component of preventive care.

Fluoridation is indicated by a dichotomous variable that is equal
to one if the community in which the youth resides uses naturally fluo-

ridated or controlled fluoridated water (FLUOR). Naturally fluroridated
communities are serviced by a water supply system that contains a natu-

ral fluoride content of 0.7 parts per million or higher. They are identified by the Division of Dental Health of the National Institutes of

Health (1969). Controlled fluoridated communities are those that have
adjusted the fluoride content of their water supply systems to the

optimum level. They are identified by the Division of Dental Health of
the National Institutes of Health (1970). For youths who reside in controlled

communities, the

fluoridation variable equals one only if the

— 22 —

date on which that youth was examined in the RES
succeeds the date on
which the community

adjusted

the fluoride content of its water supply

system. This insures that youths in controlled communities

actually

were exposed to fluoridated water.

Measurement of Other Explanatory Variables

Many of the remaining explanatory variables called for in Section ii

require no further elaboration. Parents' educational attainment and family

— 23 —

income, for example, are adequately described in Table 1. Some of the

variables listed in Table 1, however, do require additional ex-

other

planation.

Family size is represented by the number of people in the family who

are

under 20 years of age at the time of the Cycle III interview (LESS2O).

Consequently, it may overstate or understate actual completed family size.

Three measures

dren

of the family's efficiency in producing healthy chil-

are included in addition to the parents' educational attainment.

These are dichotomous variables that identify

youths whose mothers were

age 20 when the youths were born (LMAG),

youths from homes in which

foreign language is spoken (FLANG), and youths who live with their moth-

ers only (NOFATH). Young mothers are notoriously less efficient at contracepting and may be similarly less efficient in producing healthy

The youth's endowed health status is represented by four variables

relating to his early health. The first two (LIGHT1, LIGHT2) are dummy
variables identifying youths of low birth weight. Low birth weight is
a typical indicator of a less healthy birth outcome (for example, Birch

and Gussow 1970). Birth weight was obtained from the youth's birth

certificate.

Since birth certificates are missing for approximately 25

percent of the sample and

since

we do not focus on the effects of birth

weight, we do not delete these observations. Instead, we include a

— 24

—

dwmny variable that identifies youths with missing birth certificates

(BWUK) in the regression estimates. The third endowment measure is a
dummy variable identifying youths whose mothers were over 35 years old

at the youth's birth (HMAG). The rationale for including this variable
is that older mothers are more likely to have offspring with health
defects. The last of these measures is a dummy variable which identi-.
fies youths whose parents reported a medical difficulty with the youth

before the age of one year (FYPH). Although parents' reports of youths'
medical problems before the age of one year are subject to recall error,
the first year of a child's life is likely to stand out in his parents'

minds relative to other stages in his life cycle. Therefore, we believe that the measurement error in this variable is small.
Our current health indicator is used as a proxy for the child's

unmeasured genetic health endowment and his health history beyond age

one. This indicator is the presence of at least one significant abnormality as reported by the HES physician who examined the youth (ABN).
Abnormalities include heart disease, neurological, muscular, or joint

conditions; other major diseases; and otitis media. Except for the
last condition, which constitutes a relatively small percentage of all
reported

abnormalities,

congenital

these health problems are to a large extent

and irreversible.

We also

control

for several other characteristics of the youth which

are not necessarily health related but may cause him to receive better or
worse treatment within the family. They are his birth—order (FIRST) and

whether or not he is a twin (TWIN). First born youths

(or

non-twins)

will have greater access to individual parental attention because they

— 25

—

in the family first (or they arrived alone). In addition, the

youth's age (AGE) and

sex (MALE) are

included in regressions in which

the dependent variable is not adjusted for age and sex (i.e. when the
dependent variable is either obesity, abnormal corrected distance
vision, preventive dental care, or preventive pediatric care).
Finally, three region variables (NEAST, MWEST, SOUTH) and
sizes

four

of place of residence variables (URB1, URE2, URB3, NURB) are in-

cluded to control for regional differences that are not otherwise taken

into

account. We are agnostic about the nature of these differences,

but want to avoid the possibility that the

health manpower and fluo-

ridation effects are biased by an omission of unmeasured regional characteristics.

to remember that the five health

measures (APERI, IDECAY, OBESE, PVIS, ANEMIA) are negative correlates

of good health, so that negative effects of independent variables in the
production functions reflect factors associated with better health outcomes. The two preventive medical care measures (DTPREV, DRPREV), on

other hand, are positive correlates of care; thus positive effects
of independent variables in the demand functions reflect factors assothe

ciated with higher propensities to obtain preventive care.

of decayed permanent teeth (IDECAY) is the dependent variable, two

production functions are estimated. The first contains the same set of
independent

variables as the periodontal index (APERI) regression, while

the second includes APERI as an additional independent variable. It
has been

suggested

by Russell (1956) that variations in APERI result

largely from genetic factors. If these genetic factors are correlated
with the home environment and imperfectly measured by the health endowment variables, the second regression will give a more accurate estimate

of the effects of the home environment on IDECAY than the first. Of
course, APERI has an environmental component as well as a genetic compo-

The coefficient estimates imply that adolescents who did not have

a preventive check—up within the past year have periodontal indices and
decay scores that are each about .3 of a standard deviation worse than

adolescents who received a check—up. When APERI is included in the decay
equation, the decay differential between the two groups of adolescents

declines to .2 but remains statistically significant. To gauge the magnitudes of these effects, recall that APERI and IDECAY have means of
approximately

zero and

standard deviations of approximately one. There-

fore, the oral health differentials associated with absence of preventive
care are relatively large; they range

from 20

to 30 percent of the stand-

ard deviations in the scores. Moreover, the differentials apply to a

The results pertaining
care——water

a publicly provided form of preventive

fluoridation——are also strong. Youths exposed to

fluori-

dated water (FLUOR) have significantly better oral health than other
youths

21

at all conventional levels of confidence.

The fluoridation

differentials are smaller, however, than the corresponding preventive

dental care differentials in oral health. For example, the fluoridation coefficient in the periodontal index equation is one-third as
large

as the preventive dental care coefficient. In the decay equa-

tions, the ratio of the two coefficients ranges from three—fifths to
two—thirds.

Nevertheless, given that the per—child cost of fluorida-

the

tion is substantially below

cost of a preventive dental visit,

this remains a cost—effective method of improving dental health.22

Let us turn now to the role of the family in determining adolescent

dental health levels. The

four

characteristics of the family environ-

ment we focus on are parents education (MEDUCAT, FEDtICAT), family income

(FINC), family size (LESS2O), and mother's labor force status (MRKFr,
MWORKPT)

• An

reveals

that

overview of

the production function estimates in Table 2

all six variables have statistically significant effects in

the expected directions (with the exception of mother's labor force

status in the periodontal index equation). Children of more educated
parents have better oral health, as do children from families with
higher incomej while children whose mothers' are employed full—time or

who come from

larger

families have

poorer

health. The impacts

of

these

— 32 —

variables

on IDECAY are reduced in absolute value when APERI is held constant,

but the pattern of statistical significance is not dramatically altered (only

the coefficient of father's schooling becomes insignificant). It is clear, then,
that these family characteristics have an important impact on adolescent dental
health.

We interpret these findings as evidence that the home environment plays an

important role in determining children's health. It can be argued, however,

our results do not really constitute strong evidence in favor of "nurture"
because of the likelihood of positive correlations first between these family
that

characteristics

and the parents' health and second between the genetically deter-

mined components of parents' and childrens' health. Put differently, this argument states that family characteristics such as income or parental education

largely reflect genetic health factors. For exanmie, parents who are themselves
healthy are more likely to be in the labor force and will have higher earnings.
Or, parents who have had a healthy childhood and adolescence are more likely to

have attained a higher level
doubt

of education. Two

of our findings, however, cast

on the applicability of this argument in our case. First, when we include

APERI in the decay equation in an effort to more fully control for genetic factors,
we still find that these family environment variables have significant impacts on

IDECAY. This is noteworthy because the inclusion of APERI is likely to bias the

around the coefficients of the educa-

of the two parents. If the education effect is primarily

we would expect the coefficients of both mother's and father's education

to be equal because both parents make an equal genetic contribution to the child.

On the other hand, if the education

— 33 —

effect

is primarily environmental, we would expect the impact of the

mother's education to be larger because she is the family member most

concerned with the children's health care. In Table 2 we observe
that in every case the coefficient of mother's education exceeds that

of father's education. In addition, despite a high correlation be—
tween the two education variables Cr

.61), the difference in coeff i—

23

cients is always statistically significant at the 10 percent level.

Thus, our results clearly indicate that the family environment, and in
particular, the mother's education, plays an important role in producing healthy children.
Besides having an important impact on the production of health,
family characteristics work to improve adolescent health by increasing

the probability that an adolescent receives preventive care. In Table
3 we see that all six of the family variables have significant impacts

on the probability that an adolescent received preventive care. Children from families

with higher annual income,

more educated

parents,

and in which the mother works part-time, are more likely to receive
preventive care, while children from larger families or families where
the mother works full—time are less likely to receive preventive care.
As

an

example of the magnitude of these effects, the probability that a

child received preventive care in the previous year increases by about
two percentage points for each additional year of education received by
the mother and declines by about three percentage points for each addi-

tional child in the family. Once again we believe that these results

reflect environmental rather than genetic influences the mother's
education coefficient is more than twice as large as the father's

It should be noted that the positive impact of dentists on the pro-

we view the dental manpower variable as reflecting the

the parents' decision to obtain preventive dental care for their of f—

Most of the other results in Table 3 are consistent with our expectations and will not be discussed.28

We do wish to point out, how-

ever, that although fluoridation does have a significant impact on

dental health, it is not significantly related to the probability of
obtaining

preventive dental care. This is not surprising since from a

theoretical point of view either a positive or negative relationship

could be predicted. If fluoridation is regarded as an increase in the
child's health endowment, the quantity of care demanded should fall.

On

the other

hand, if

the

increased endowment also increases the

mar-

ginal product of preventive care, or if it lowers the psychic costs

— 37

—

of obtaining care by reducing the severity of the tooth decay uncovered

by a preventive check—up, a positive effect on the quantity of care demanded would be predicted.29 Both types of results have been reported

in other studies. Manning and

Phelps

(1978) report mixed effects of

duration of exposure to fluoridation on the propensity to obtain preventive dental check-ups for white children below the age of 15 in a
1970 health survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center.
Upton and Silverman (1972) use 1966 data for 15 midwestern towns, half
of which used fluoridated water, and report fewer restorations of children's permanent teeth in the fluoridated towns.
We conclude this subsection by using our results to estimate the

impacts of three government programs to improve the oral health of

youths. First, consider a $1,000 income transfer to low—income families.
As shown by the reduced—form coefficients of FINC in Table 4, the transfer would lower the periodontal index of youths from these families by

.01 points and would lower their decay index by .02 points. (Such a
program would naturally also have other beneficial effects on children

and their families.) Next consider a program to reduce or eliminate
regional differences in the number of dentists per thousand population.

were 1.1 dentists per thousand population in

San Francisco, California, while there were .2 dentists per thousand
population in San Benito, Texas. Suppose that this difference were eliminated by raising the number of dentists in San Benito by one per thousand

population. Then the periodontal index of youths in San Benito would fall
by .04 points, and their decay index would fall by .05 points.30 Finally,

consider

—

an 80 percent reduction in the price of a dental check-up as a re-

sult of the enactment of a national health insurance plan for dental care
with a 20 percent co—insurance rate. Based on research by Manning and

Phelps on the impact of price on the propensity to obtain preventive

dental care for children and youths, we estimate that such a policy
would raise the probability of obtaining care by 16 percentage points.
This would improve both the periodontal and the decay scores by .04

points.

B. Physical Health
Estimates of the physical health production functions and the pre-

ventive care

demand function appear in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

Looking first at the production function estimates, we are struck by the
fact that these physical health measures are

much

less amenable to sta-

tistical explanation than are the dental health measures. Of course,
lower

would be expected for the three physical health measures be-

cause they are dichotomous rather than continuous • But many fewer ex-

planatory variables are statistically significant in the physical health
case. Clearly unmeasured genetic or "luck" factors play a much larger

role in the case of these

health

measures.

In

contrast to the results for preventive dental care, there is

little evidence that preventive medical care is efficacious. Youths
who saw a doctor for a check-up within the past year (DRPREV) have onehalf percentage point smaller

probabilities

of being obese or of having

abnornal corrected distance vision than other youths, and a one-fifth
percentage point higher probability of having anemia.

None of these

three differentials is statistically significant. One possible ex-

for these findings is that there are fairly long lags between
the receipt of preventive care and an improvement in physical health.

Alternatively, one might argue that physicians play a minor role in the
outcomes

studied here relative to unmeasured endogenous inputs such

as

proper diet. The non—significant impact of preventive care also means
that family characteristics operate on health only through the produc-

tion function. There

are

no indirect effects of the various family

characteristics on physical health, only direct effects. Consequently,
we do not present a table of "total" effects (comparable to Table 4) in
the case of the physical health measures.
The relationship between family characteristics and health is

also much weaker in the case of physical health. Most of the six
family characteristics variables studied are not even statistically
significant in the production function; only the mother's education

and family size variables have significant impacts. Children of
more educated mothers are less likely to be obese or anemic, and they
are more likely to have poor vision (the latter relationship is not

significant). Children from larger families are more likely to have
poor corrected vision or be anemic, but they are less likely to be

as opposed to genetic, we again look at the difference

between the coefficients of the two parent's education variables. For
both OBESE and M4EMIA,

the mother's education coefficient is larger

than the corresponding father's education coefficient, but for PVIS
opposite is true. Only in the case of obesity is the difference

the

sig-

nificant at the 10 percent level. Thus, in this case the evidence re-

a nature versus nurture interpretation of the family effects

garding

is

not conclusive, but it does suggest that with respect to obesity at

least one component of the family environment-—mother's education——has
an important impact.

We

noted that the family size variable has a perverse sign in the

obesity equation: children from larger families are in better rather
than worse health in that they are less likely to be obese. The positive relationship between family size and

the incidence of the other

health problems is easy to rationalize (it may reflect a substitution
away from

higher "quality" children as the shadow price of quality

rises), 32 but a justification for the negative relation reported for
obesity is less obvious. One possible explanation for this negative
family size effect (as well as for the positive income effect) is the
existence of jàint production among various aspects of quality. For
example, families with fewer children or higher income may consume. more
rich and

caloric foods. This consumption raises some aspects of qual-

ity but at the same time makes obesity more likely.

The finding of non—significant effects of family income in physical health

outcomes has important implications. First, it suggests that

— 44

—

policies to improve the well—being of adolescents via income transfers

would have little impact on our physical health measures. Second, this
finding coupled with the significance of the mother's schooling variable
underscores the key role in health production of nonmarket productivity
as opposed to market goods and services as measured by family income and

preventive care. This result echoes our earlier findings for a group of
younger children (Edwards and Grossman 1980). In the case of obesity,
we believe that

are more likely to get preventive care for their children while larger

families are less likely to. In addition, father's education has a larger
impact than mother's education. It is not clear how to interpret these
results, however, since we have no evidence that preventive pediatric
care is efficacious.

The last result to be discussed concerns the role of pediatrician

important role in determining oral health but less so for the other

health problems studied; (2) preventive care

is efficacious in the

case of oral health but not for the other health problems studied;
and (3) the three physical health measures are largely unexplained by

the family and preventive care variables used here. Only mother's
education and family size have significant impacts.

With respect

schooling. Moreover, mother's schooling tends to dominate both

and father's schooling in the physical health equations, especially in the case of obesity. The finding that the impact of mother's
income

schooling almost always exceeds that of father's schooling is especially
important because equal effects would be expected if the schooling vanables were simply proxies for unmeasured genetic endowments.

Two additional pieces of evidence underline the robusthess of the

finding that nurture Nmatters.u First, the relative magnitude of the
effect of the various family background variables on the index of tooth

decay is not greatly altered when the periodontal index, a proxy for
genetic oral health endowment,

is held constant.

Second, the identif i—

cation of a plausible mechanism by which family characteristics influence
adolescent health——preventive care——increases our confidence that these

variables reflect a behavioral effect as opposed to a genetic effect or

a statistical artifact.
With regard to the role of preventive dental care, youths who received a preventive dental check—up within the past year and youths ex-

posed to fluoridated water have much better oral health than other youths.

Moreover, the probability of a preventive examination is positively re-

lated to the number of dentists per capita in a youth's county of residence. This implies that a program to increase the availability of
dentists in medically deprived areas would improve the oral health of

youths in these areas. Indeed, we estimate that the payoffs to increasing dental manpower by one per thousand population are about the

same as the payoffs to the coverage of preventive dental care under

national health insurance.

and the sites in the HES survey are not identical to the sites in the
BLS survey. On the

other

hand, the number of dentists and pediatri-

cians are based on complete enumerations in all counties by the
American Dental Association and the American Medical Association and

can be matched easily to the lIES sites •

Thus

the two manpower vari-

ables have little measurement error, while the price estimates from
the BLS would contain a great deal of measurement error.

8Thi8 is in contrast to the work of Newhouse and Priedlander (1977)

who fit an equation similar to our equation (4).
9The term "allocative effect" and the decomposition of the schooling parameter into direct and allocative components is due to Welch
(1970). He

uses this framework to study the impact of schooling on mar-

ket production. Technically,

schooling is a relevant determinant of the

demand for medical care even if it has no allocative efficiency effect.
In simple models of schooling as an efficiency variable in household
production (Grossman 1972, Michael 1972), schooling raises the amount of

health output obtained from a given vector of inputs. In such models
schooling can lower the quantity of medical care demanded at the same

time as it raises the quantity of health demanded. In particular,
medical care would rise only if the income and price

elasticities of de-

for offspring's health exceeded unity. We stress a model that incorporates an allocative efficiency effect because schooling should in-

mand

crease the parents' knowledge about what constitutes an appropriate

diet, when to take their children to the doctor or the dentist for a
preventive check—up, how to follow the doctor's advice, and how to

demand larger quantities of preventive care even if the

income and price elasticities of health are less than one.

101n adopting these two criteria for the selection of health measures, we are guided in part by Kessner's (1974) tracer methodology
for studying the health of children and adolescents.

1If the actual periodontal index of each age—sex group is normally
distributed, APERI

could

be translated directly into the youth's peri-

index percentile. Wa have experimented with the actual value

of the periodontal index as the dependent variable in a multiple regression that includes age, the square of age, and a dummy variable for
male adolescents in addition to the remaining independent variables.

The results obtained (not shown) are similar to those reported in
Section III.

Dutton (1978) advocates the use of

a continuous,

rather than a

discrete, measure of anemia. She conducts a multiple regression analy-

sis

of

actual hematocrit levels of black children between the ages of

6 months and 4 years. The only statistically significant variables in
this regression (at the 5 percent level) are age and sex. Therefore,
it is not at all clear what we would gain by adopting

her measure.

F— 5

13Similar patterns are present in the Cycle III data. Tanner (1962)

stresses the importance of sexual maturity in the determination of the
health and cognitive development of adolescents. Preliminary analysis

revealed, however, that sexual maturity does not have an effect on our

health measures except in the case of hematocrit levels of females.
14Clinical evidence suggests that exposure to fluoridated water is

particularly important if it occurs during the ages at which the permanent teeth are being formed (McClure 1962). These teeth do not appear
until a child is approximately 6 years-old but start to be formed a few

months after birth. Therefore, it is useful to identify youths who had
been exposed to fluoridated water before they reached the age of 6 years.

Unfortunately, we cannot do this because the youths current residence

alone is reported in the lIES.

We

did create a fluoridation variable

that identifies youths exposed before age 6 under the assution of no
migration, but it had no effect on oral health in regressions that included the fluoridation variable described in the text.
measure of the number of dentists excludes those in the

Federal dental service. The number of pediatricians pertains to
those in private practice.
16Since pediatricians treat only children and youths, the number
of pediatricians per person under a certain age (say age 18) might
appear to be a more relevant measure than the number of pediatricians

First, the appropriate age cutoff is not obvious. Second, even if
pediatricians do not treat youths beyond the age of 17, s inc. mothers

for taking youths to the physician, the mdi-

and most important, there is little variation in persons under

age 18 as a percentage of the population or in women with children
under age 18 as

17The educational attainment of absent fathers is not known. For
children with

father's

absent fathers, we code FEDUCAT at the mean

level of

education in the subsample of youths who live with both parents.

This coding scheme is consistent with the assumption that father's education has the same relationship with adolescent health whether or not

the father is actually present. An alternative assumption is that

ther's

this assumption, the education of absent fathers would be coded

at zero. Use of the alternative coding scheme would alter the regression

coefficient of NOFATH but would not alter the coefficient of FEDUCAT

or the coefficients of other independent variables in the regression.

Note

that APERI is negatively correlated with the composite

disturbance term (u2 — b1 a1' u1) in equation (3). Therefore, if the

equation is estimated by ordinary least squares, the regression coeff icient of APERI is biased toward zero and that of B away from zero provided B and APBRI are negatively related. In the text we make the

plausible assumption that this upward bias in the absolute value of the

regression coefficient of B is offset by the fundentai difference between the structural parameters of B in equations (2) and (3). That is

The

estimated effects of fluoridation on oral health are

not

to the omission of the three region and four size of place

of residence variables from the regressions. This indicates that the
fluoridation variable is not simply a proxy for location.
22

Consumer Reports

(1978)

cites a report in the New England

Journal of Medicine which estimates the per

capita cost of fluorida-

tion to be about 10 to 40 cents per year (p. 393).

23The relevant "t" statistics for the three equations in Table 2

are 1.41, 1.79, and 1.48. Note that probable biases in the estimates
of the two parents' education coefficients are likely to work towards

a finding of no significant difference. The estimate of the direct
efficiency effect of father's schooling may be biased away from zero;
and the estimate of the direct efficiency effect of mother's schooling

may be biased toward

The former bias is introduced if father's

ment error in current family income). The latter bias is introduced if

more educated wthers allocate less time to the production

timated father's

education effect may be biased upward in the demand

curve for preventive care. The mother's education effect is biased
downward if oral health is "time—intensive"

and

if substitution in

consuntion outweighs substitution in production.
24These could be thought of as solved "reduced form" coefficients

of

the exogenous variables.

25 is expected on the basis of the education coefficients in
Tables 2 and 3, the difference in "total" effects is larger than the

difference in direct effects. The test of the significance of the
difference
"total"

between the "total"

effect of mother's schooling and

the

effect of father's schooling is based on the estimated reduced

form——the ordinary least squares regression APERI or IDECAY on all the
exogenous variables • This procedure is employed because standard er-

rors of solved reduced-form coefficients and standard errors of difference between such coefficients are very difficult to compute. In every
case, the estimated reduced—form difference between the schooling co-

efficient is exactly the same as the solved reduced—form difference.

Therefore, the bias introduced by our test is minimal. The test statistics are 1.81, 2.23, and 2.82 for APERI, IDECAY, and IDECAY with

APERI, respectively.

26Manning and Phelps estimate a discriminant function of the prob-

ability of obtaining a check-up. They point out that the coefficients
in this equation approximate logit coefficients •

Since

they do not

their discriminant estimate of the decision for white children
and youths to receive a dental exam, Manning and Phelps specify a price

effect that varies with family income. Our extrapolation of their ra—
suits assume (1) that family income equals $10,000 (the mean value in

the RES), (2) that the uninsured price of check—up is $15, and (3) that
the uninsured probability of a check—up is .7 (the mean in the HES).

The reduction in the decay score is obtained from the decay function that
excludes APERI.

32Alternatively, these effects may be attributed to a reduction in
per capita income as family size rises with family income held constant.

Indeed, the sign of the family size effect is opposite that of the family
income effect in all three regressions. Yet something more than a mechanical relationship between family size and per capita income is required

to account fully for the contribution of family size to health outcomes.
For example, unlike the family size coefficients, the family income co-

efficients are not always statistically significant. In addition, canputations reveal that the impact on physical health of a 1 percent

F — 12

increase in family size is larger in absolute value than that of a 1 percent increase in family income.
33Some readers may object to the constraint in our recursive model

that the direct effect of health manpower on health is zero. For the
benefit of these readers, the estimated reduced—form coefficients of
the number of pediatricians on obesity, abnormal visiofl, and anemia are

These coefficients give a very different and, in our view,

inappropriate picture of the payoff of a program to expand pediatric manpower compared to a program to expand dental manpower.
