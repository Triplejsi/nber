Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts

ABSTRACT
It is sometimes suggested that compensation varies across individuals
much more dramatically than would be expected by looking at variations in
their marginal products. This paper argues that a compensation scheme
based on an individual's relative position within the firm rather than his
absolute level of output will, under certain circumstances, be the preferred
and natural outcome of a competitive economy. Differences in the level of
output between individuals may be quite small, yet optimal "prizes" are
selected in a way that induces workers to allocate their effort and investment activities efficiently.
In particular, by compensating workers on the basis of their relative
position in the firm, one can produce the same incentive structure for riskneutral workers that the optimal and efficient pie~e rate produces. It might
be less costly however, to observe relative position than to measure the
level of each worker's output directly. This results in the payment of
prizes, wages which for some workers greatly exceeds their presumed marginal
products. When risk aversion is introduced, the prize salary structure no
longer duplicates the allocation of resources induced by the optimal piece
rate. For activities which have a high degree of inherent riskiness, payment based on relative position will dominate.
Finally, when workers are allowed to be heterogeneous, an important
result is obtained. Competitive contests which pay workers on the basis of
their relative position will not, in general, sort workers in a way which
yields an efficient allocation of resources. In particular, low quality
workers will attempt to contaminate a firm comprised of high quality workers,
even in the absence of production complimentarities. This suggests that
high quality firms will use non-price techniques to allocate jobs to applicants.

INTRODUCTION

It is a familiar proposition in labor economics that under competitive
conditions workers are paid the value of their marginal products.

In order

for this statement to be meaningful, it is apparent (see Alchian and
Demsetz, 1972) that some mechanism exist for ascertaining and monitoring
productivity.

If inexpensive reliable monitors are available, the optimal

compensation method is a periodic wage that pays on the basis of observed
input.

However, when the firm cannot monitor input as closely as the worker

can, compensation based on input that the firm actually observes invites
shirking by workers and may be inefficient.

In these cases, the situation

can be improved if rewards are based on output, so long as that is more
easily observed by both parties.

It is true that compensation geared to

, input is generally superior to that based on output when monitoring costs
are negligible, because workers must bear more risk in an incentive contract
than in a wage contract, creating gains from trade if the firm is less riskaverse than are its employees.

Nevertheless, when monitoring is not free,

the gain in efficiency from output or incentive payments may outweigh the
loss of utility due to additional risk-bearing of workers.
A wide variety of incentive payment schemes are used in practice and
one of them, simple piece rates, has been extensively analyzed (e.g., see
Cheung (1969), Stiglitz (1975), Mirrlees (1976)).

In this paper we consider

another type of incentive payment, namely contest and prizes, that has not
been analyzed very much, yet which seem to be prevalent, either implicitly
or explicitly, in many labor contracts.

The main difference between

prizes and other types of incentive compensation is that in a

2

contest earnings depend on rank order among a group of workers, whereas
piece rates typically are paid on the basis of individual performance.

1

The prototype contest is the tennis match, where winning and losing prizes
are fixed in advance, independently of each player's performance in that
particular contest.
The analysis of alternative compensation schemes is related to the
problem of moral hazard and providing appropriate incentives for eliciting
effort and investment when information is costly and monitoring costs are
asymmetric.

Each type of compensation method is characterized by certain

parameters, such as the piece rate, the prize structure and so forth.

For

each scheme we seek the values of the parameters that maximize utility of
workers, subject to a zero profit constraint for competitive firms.

For

familiar reasons, the scheme that actually emerges in competitive markets
achieves the unconditional maximum utility of workers among the set of
conditional maximums.

Two dimensions of incentives need to be distinguished:

one is investment or skill acquisition prior to the time a work activity is
entered and the other is the effort expended, after skills have been
acquired, in a given work situation or play of the game.

In this work we

The emphasis on prior

investment lends itself most readily to an interpretation of earnings
prospects over the whole life cycle, or lifetime rather than annual earnings.
Section II demonstrates that two-player tournaments achieve the same
allocation of resources as piece rates when workers are risk-neutral.

assessing rank rather than individual performance.
important for the structure of executive pay.

These issues are

Section III extends these

3

results to N-player tournaments; sequential tournaments with eliminations,
which give rise to skewed realized reward structures; and to problems where
rank rather than total output is valued by consumers.

Section IV shows the

very surprising result that tournaments can be the social optimum contract
when workers are risk-averse.

This is applied to a problem originally

formulated by Friedman (1951) on the relation between skewness in the
overall earnings distribution and workers' preferences for lotteries.
Section V discusses problems of adverse selection in tournaments in the
presence of population heterogeneity and asymmetric information, and the
economic structure of handicapping systems when these differences are known
to everyone.

depends upon the spread

As the spread increases, the incentive to

devote additional resources to improving one's probability of winning
increases.

The firm would like to increase the spread and thereby induce

higher productivity "play" (which increases the firm's revenue).

However,

as the spread increases contestants invest more, but their costs are
increased as well.

The latter is what limits the spread.

too large a spread induces excessive investment.

A competing firm can

attract all the workers by·decreasing the spread, because it lowers workers'
costs by more than it lowers expected earnings and therefore raises expected
utility.

If the marginal cost of skill acquisition is increasing, there is

a unique equilibrium spread between the prizes that maximizes expected
utility.
Some further manipulation of the equilibrium conditions yields an
interesting interpretation in terms of the theory of agency (see Ross (1972),

That is, the players receive

their marginal product combined with a fair winner-take-all gamble over the
total entrance fees or bonds.

The appropriate social investment incentives

are given by each contestant's attempt to win the gamble.

This contrasts

with the main agency result, where the bond is returned to each worker
after a satisfactory performance has been observed.

There the incentive

mechanism works through the employee's attempts to work hard enough to
recoup his own bond.

Here it works through the attempts to win the contest.

Let us conclude this part of the discussion with some comparative
statics, all of.which follow from the marginal conditions (10) and the
worker's investment decision (7).

These two imply also that

The reason is

10

that a given incremental investment buys each player a smaller incremental
probability when luck is more important.

The stakes must therefore increase

to give contestants the proper marginal incentives to invest.

This implies

that among risk-neutral workers the optimal prizes are closer together in

If rank is

more easily observed than each individual's level of output, tournaments
dominate piece rates.

On

the other hand, occupations in which an

individual's output level is easily observed would have no particular
preference for a prize scheme.

For example, salesmen whose output is

easily observed are paid by piece rates, whereas many business executives,
whose output is much more difficult to observe, engage in contests.
Consider the salary structure for executives.

It appears as though

the salary of, say, the vice-president of a particular corporation is
substantially below that of the president of that same corporation.
presidents are often chosen from the ranks of vice-presidents.

Yet

On the day

that a given individual is promoted from vice-president to president, his
salary may triple.

It is difficult to argue that his skills have tripled

in that one-day period, presenting difficulties for standard theory, where
supply factors should keep wages in those two occupations approximately
equal.

It is not a puzzle, however, when interpreted in the context of a

prize.

If the president of a corporation is viewed as the winner of a

match and as such receives the higher prize,

then that wage payment

is settled upon not only because it reflects his current productivity as

13

president, but rather because it induces that individual and all other
individuals to perform appropriately when they are in more junior positions.
This interpretation suggests that presidents of large corporations do not
necessarily earn high wages because they are more productive as presidents,
but because this particular type of payment 'structure makes them more
productive over their entire working life.

There is a curious feature of the N-player case that only first and

is sufficiently nonobvious that it is worth discussing, but requires a few
details and is therefore relegated to appendix 2.

This indeterminacy is a

feature of the risk neutral case and vanishes when risk aversion is introduced.

B.

Sequential Contests
This section considers a few aspects of sequential games.

Before

doing so, it is necessary to clarify a possible point of confusion between
what might be labeled repetitive and sequential contests.

Clearly, there is only a single period or one-

time tournament in a whole lifetime, though the "period" is a long one to
be sure.
In repetitive play one might think of a series of, say, annual contests.
This stands in the same relation to a single lifetime contest as a compound

In this case also, however, annual risk

is diversifiable by each worker over his lifetime, e.g., by using a saving
account, since a good outcome in a given year is likely to be offset by an
equally poor outcome in some other year.

The point is that with sufficient

repetition and independent error all risk would be diversified away,
for basically the same reasons that the sample standard deviation of the mean
of a distribution shrinks to zero as the sample size increases.

Incottle could

be made constant over the lifetime and the tournament structure would unravel.
Consequently, in order for a tournament to make sense there must be
some risk that is nondiversifiable by the worker and that is revealed only
relatively slowly. 9

As an historical note, one of the few papers we have been able to find
on the prize structure in tournaments is by Sir Francis Galton (1902).15
Galton considered a race with n-contestants where a fixed sum was to be
divided among the first two places.

This

criterion is roughly related to expected relative outcomes or productivity.
Galton's work is an important paper in statistics but is less interesting
to economists because it does not take account of a contestant's incentive to
run fast.

His contest is a random draw of a sample of size

This result would perhaps be less

surprising today, given what is known about the characteristic skew of
extreme value distributions, yet it does roughly concur with the prize
structures commonly observed in sports activities such as tennis and horse
racing.

Skew is not necessarily an implication of a single n-player contest

in our model, though it is not inconsistent with it.

We believe, however,

that skewed prizes in each play of a repetitive game structure may be a
strong implication of the incentive to elicit effort in each round and that
dimension has been ignored here.

IV.

OPTIMAL PRIZE STRUCTURE WITH RISK-AVERSION

In the previous section, we obtained the surprising result that
contests and piece-rate compensation schemes yield identical and efficient
allocations of resources.

In this section, we allow for risk-aversion of

contestants and show that the choice of compensation scheme is no longer
indeterminate.

Even when costs of ascertaining output are zero, the

piece-rate scheme tends to dominate for distributions of

€

with low

variance, while prizes tend to dominate for high variance distributions.
The reason is roughly as follows:

In a piece-rate scheme, players are

paid a fixed sum (to be determined optimally) plus some proportion of their
output.

The higher is the variance in chance,

€j'

the higher will tend

to be the variance in income (although this can be offset by reducing the
variable and increasing the fixed part of the payment).

A prize structure

truncates the extremes of the distribution by converting it to a binomial.
However, the necessity of a positive spread in the prize structure implies
that there must be some variance in income.

For small

2
a ,
€

it appears as

though the variance introduced by the requisite spread exceeds that which
results from paying by the piece.

But as

a

2
€

gets large, higher expected

utility is produced by fixing maximum gain and loss in advance with prizes
than by taking one's chance and allowing

€j

to affect wages strongly.

The fixed component would have to be so high relative to the variable
piece component in the piece rate that investment incentives are too small
and prizes dominate.

goes above some level a prize yields the largest

With risk-neutrality we showed that there is always a unique prize
structure that duplicates the resource allocation of the optimal piecerate wage structure:

There, each compensation scheme yields the same

expected utility, and choice between them is on the basis of different
monitoring and observation costs.

In this section, risk-aversion supplies

28

another criterion for choice.

Because the prize structure that duplicates

the investment of a piece rate structure has a different variance (and distribution in general), workers generally prefer one to the other:

The ex-

pected utility of the optimal prize scheme does not, in general, equal the
expected utility of the optimal piece rate structure.

In the examples in

Tables 1 and 2, piece rates dominate when luck is relatively unimportant

(o~ small) and prizes dominate when luck is more important

(cr~ ,large).

This suggests perhaps, that high level executives, whose decisions may have
a large effect on output will have salaries which more closely parallel prizes.

This result is reminiscent of a paper by Friedman (1951) on social
arrangements producing income distributions that satisfy workers' risk
preferences.

It demonstrated how a Friedman-Savage utility function leads

to a two-class income distribution:

Those people who are risk-averse are

assigned to relatively safe occupations, where income follows productivity;
whereas those with preferences for gambles buy lottery tickets in very risky
occupations where a small number win very large prizes.

The overall

distribution is the sum of the two and exhibits skewness in the right tail.
While Friedman's work is a remarkable precursor to more recent treatments,
it is flawed by inadequate attention to the problem of moral hazard or
incentive.

When the role of incentives is modeled more completely we

31
obtain a similar result with only risk-aversion, since the optimum contract
is a tournament if the underlying distribution of outcomes has a large
variance.

HETEROGENEOUS CONTESTANTS

Workers are not sprinkled randomly across firms, but rather seem to be
sorted by ability levels.

One explanation for this has to do with comple-

mentarities in production.

But even in the absence of such complementarities,

sorting may be an integral part of optimal labor contract arrangements.

Furthermore, there is no price rationing mechanism that induces Pareto
optimal self-selection, and mixed play is inefficient because it cannot

sustain the efficient investment strategies.

Therefore tournament

structures naturally require credentials and other nonprice signals to
differentiate people and assign them to the appropriate contest.

This example

bears a family resemblance to the work of Rothchild and Stiglitz (1977),
Wilson (1978), and Riley (1975) on adverse selection in inSurance markets.

We

.know from that work (and it is obvious from construction of Figure 4) that a
separating equilibrium need not exist; but difficulties remain even when it does:
(1)

The equilibrium in Figure 4 may be less efficient than a

nonseparating equilibrium with mixed play.
(2)

This type of separation may not be sustainable against a broader

set of strategies.

To elaborate (this point also applies to the insurance

39

problem), suppose the leagues and prizes are set up as in Figure 4 with
players "signing" into a league prior to committing investment.

The mere

act of signing into league 1 or 2 therefore reveals their type.

But once

types are revealed all those labeled as

and ultimately entitles participation in what appears to be a

dominant game, as in Figure 3.

This behavior, akin to a time inconsistency,

unravels the two-league structure and separation is not achieved.
The practical resolution of these difficulties, which has its obvious
counterpart in the structure of real-life tournaments, is the use of
nonprice rationing and certification to sort people into the appropriate
games, based on past performances.

Similarly, firms use nonprice factors

in allocating jobs among applicants.

Presumably the market solves a

complicated experimental design problem, perhaps with a hierarchical
structure, that elicits this information in an efficient manner.

The

issues are similar to those sketched in Section III.B.
Upon reflection, it is not terribly paradoxical that price information
alone does not allocate resources efficiently in these circumstances and
that nonprice rationing can be more effective.

After all, only a fool or

a person with tastes for random dissipation of his wealth would examine
only the price of a transaction when there is a nontrivial probability of
misrepresentation of the other terms.

That nonprice factors are

ubiquitous in labor markets is recognized in the theory of equalizing
differences.

For practical examples of nonprice rationing one need go no

40

further than the problem of allocating academic economists to departments.
Yet there appears to be a special problem with tournament structures that
should be pointed out.

Strictly speaking, in the formal model above there

is no social value of sorting inherent in the technology, since total
output is the sum of independent outputs of all the workers.

The tournament

introduces a socially contrived dependence through strategic factors
involved with attempting to improve one's chance of winning, for which
relative output is crucial.

The independence of production implies that

sorting is no problem in the piece rate solution when workers are riskneutral:

It makes no difference who works with whom because rewards are

based on independent individual performance?5

Of course, there would be

productive value of sorting if the objective function were not summable,
e.g.,

V(qj,qk)

of V· (qj + qk).

or the order statistic example in Section III.C instead
Nevertheless, the above differences may suggest that

stratification and sorting present greater difficulties for tournaments
than for individual performance-geared incentive schemes.

Still,

tournaments may be the socially efficient arrangement if rank is easier
to observe than is individual performance.

B.Handicap Systems
This section moves to the opposite extreme of the previous discussion
and assumes that the identities of each type of player are known to everyone.
Gambles involving

N players of known talent are said to be fair if each

player has win probability of

liN.

When the quality of play is drawn out

of fixed distributions that differ among players, fairness is achieved by
handicaps that equalize the upper

liN

quantiles of the various

41

distributions; e.g., with
equalize the medians.

N

= 2 the weaker player is given "points" to

It is surprising that this criterion of fairness

fails to hold true in competitive markets where prizes affect probability
distributions and the gambles are productive:

The market clearing handicap

implies less than full equalization so that the better player always has a
competitive edge.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper proposes an alternative to compensation in proportion to
marginal product.

Under certain conditions, the new scheme yields

~~

allo-

cation of resources identical to that generated by the efficient piece rate.
By compensating workers on the basis of their relative position in the firm,
one can produce the same incentive structure for risk neutral workers that
the optimal piece rate produces.

It might be less costly, however, to

observe relative position than to measure the level of each worker's output
directly.

This would result in paying salaries which resemble "prizes";

wages which for some workers greatly exceed their presumed marginal products.

This complication adds

Competitive contests will not, in general, sort workers

in a way which yields an efficient allocation of resources.

In particular,

low quality workers will attempt to contaminate the firm comprised of high
quality workers, even if there are no complementarities in production.

This

contamination results in a general breakdown of the efficient solution if
low quality workers are not prevented from entering.

This is, therefore, one

rationalization for the use by high quality firms of initial credentials when
allocating jobs to applicants.

For example, annual bonuses may

depend on group measures such as total profits of the firm, but not on
rank order of workers within each labor category.

It is clear that a

one-parameter linear piece rate is the competitive solution in this
case, since nonlinearities or two-part tariffs can only transfer
inframarginal rents to employers, thus violating the zero profit
condition.

A one-parameter piece rate is definitely nonoptimal in

the presence of risk aversion.

Of course, in a full analysis any change in costs of all participants
would change industry supply and therefore alter

V, but those

qualifications are straightforward.

8.

Lazear (1979, 1979a) uses this notion in a deterministic but dYnamic
setting.

By paying an individual more than his marginal product later

in life, and less than marginal product earlier in life, one induces
optimal effort and investment behavior throughout the worker's lifetime.
9.

Of course, the risk is diversifiable across workers and therefore by
firms.

One might also think that risks could therefore be pooled

among groups of workers through, say, sharing agreements, but that
is false because of moral hazard.

A worker would never agree to share

prizes since doing so (completely) results in

~

=0

so that

E(qj + qk)

As the result, firms offering tournaments' or piece-rates in the pure sense
yield higher expected utility than the sharing arrangement.
10.

There is some discussion of contests in the statistics literature for
the method of paired comparisons.

Samples from different populations

are compared pairwise and the object is to choose the one with the
largest mean.

If all pairs are compared, the experimental design is

similar to a round-robin tournament.

An alternative design is a

= O.

47

knockout tournament with single or double elimination, which does not
generate as much information as the round-robin but which requires
fewer samples and is cheaper.

These problems are discussed by David (1963)

and Gibbons, Olkin and Sobel (1977), but are not helpful here because
they assume fixed populations, whereas the essence of our problem is
to choose an experimental design and payoff mechanism that induces
players to choose the correct distributions to draw from.

A complete

treatment would add the additional complexity of allowing investment
strategies to change as new information becomes available.
11.

With the current technology and risk neutral workers, there is no
advantage to being able to distinguish the best from second-best,
etc.

The motivation for this analysis comes from considering other

payoff structures where level is important in nonadditive ways.
multiplicative technology, where revenue equals
implies that sorting of workers is important.

for example,

Similarly, a payoff

which depends on the level of the highest output individual may also
require sorting.
12.

This latter case is discussed below in another context.

Strictly speaking, the production variables in the two-period problem
should be rescaled to make the outcomes identical with Section II, but
that is a detail.

See Lazear (1979) for additional details.
