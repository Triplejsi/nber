Taxation and the Stock 1arket Valuation of Capital Gains
and Dividends: Theory and Empirical Results

1BSTRACT

Dividends seem to be more heavily taxed than capital gains. Why
then do corporations pay dividends rather than repurchasing shares or re-

taining earnings? Either corporations are not acting in the interests of
shareholders, or else shareholders desire dividends sufficiently for nontax
reasons to offset the tax effect.

In this paper, we measure the relative valuation of dividends and
capital gains in the stock market, using a variant of the capital asset

pricing model. We find that dividends are not valued differently systematically from capital gains. This finding is consistent with share price
maximization

heavier tax on dividends.

We also show that the relative value of dividends provides an

indirect measure of a marginal Tobin's q. The measured value of dividends
relative to capital gains tends to be higher during prosperous periods, as

is consistent with this interpretation. We hope that this time series on a
marginal Tobin's q will prove to be useful in forecasting the rate of investment.

finding otherwise should cause us to reassess the tax consequences at the

shareholder level and to look for other reasons for valuing dividends.
On the supply side of the market for corporate shares, the theory

of the firm implies that in equilibrium the two forms of returns to shareholders should be equally valued, that is,

of shareholders for which dividends are less heavily taxed than capital gains.

The next section, Section I, presents certain institutional and
theoretical background relevant to the interpretation of the empirical

analysis. Section II describes the model of equilibrium share valuation, the
estimation of which is the subject of Section III. Section IV contai.ns the
results of estimation and the paper concludes w.th a brief summing up and
commentary in Section V.

I.

Institutional and Theoretical Background
In this section we first

briefly review

the concepts of dividends and

capital gains, and the tax treatment thereof, as these bear on the evaluation

by

demanders of common stock.1 We then summarize the implications

and

Their Tax Consequences

The term "capital gain" as used in TJ.S.

is related to a

of sale or exc.hangeof a "capital asset," as defined in the law.

We use the term to refer simply to the increa.se in market value of an asset
over

a specified

ti period. It is thus unrelated

to transactions. The

equivalence between capital gains and dividends (which are cash distributions

from a corporation to its shareholders)2 is, however, dependent on transactions.
The crucial point is that, in the absence of taxes and

is

possible to produce precisely the same consequences by dividends and by

share repurchase by the corporation. Both operations can be used to transfer
funds out of the corporation. By entering the market to sell, shareholders
can obtain the same cash flow in the repurchase case as would be provided
by dividends.

By entering the market to buy, recipients of dividends who

prefer an increased ownership interest can reproduce the effect of declining

to sell shares to the corporation in a disbursement of corporate funds by
share

repurchase. The ownership claim remaining in the shareholder after either

transaction is the same. It is important to understand the equivalence of

the two, since it explains the econost's conviction that the value of the
corporation should be the same after disbursement of a given amount of funds

by either form)
Because there are transactions costs and because

the tax

potential shareholders between capital gains and dividends are not as
unambiguously in favor of capital gains as is commonly believed. It appears

possible that investors favoring dividends could be sufficiently influential
to induce a temporary equilibrium value of a in excess of one.8
Implications of the Theory of the Firm for Dividend Policy

We turn next to the question of how the decisions of an individual

firm will be related toits perception of the value of a implicit in the
stock market. Specifically we consider three margins of choice: (1) that
between retentions and

We have concluded so far that when the dividend payout rate is optimal

a equals the value of a dollar of retentions, which also normally equals
the value of a dollar of real investment. However the firm cannot be in
long term equilibrium if a is different from one. A value of a greater

II. Taxes, portfolio choice, and the relative valuation of dividends and
capital gains.

suggested in the

IV. Coefficient estimates

The first step in the estimation process was to construct a forecasted
value for dividends. As described before, the overall sample was divided
into four subzanxples, based on the number of dividend payments during the

previous year. The resulting estimates for the four subsa.mples are reported
in Table 1. The coefficients are all reasonably plausible.
These equations were then used to create forecasts for the dividend

yield. As a result, the first year of data was dropped from later samples,
as it was needed to construct fitted dividends. After dropping in
addition observations with .ssing data and firms with too few observations
to allow estimation of sit' 6JJi,15O observations were left. Initial
estimation was done on this sample.

The first specification estimated corresponds to equation (17) with

a

t=a

and

rft .

This

specification is similar to that estimated

in L—R, though they assuid b = a and performed only one iteration, as

described above. We estimate a to be .82, which is statistically significantly

less than one, and corresponds to the estimate in L-R of .76 . However,
b is estimated to be less than zero and substantially 1es than a . This
puts into question the use of rf as an approd.mation to the risk-free rate.
The problem, however, could well be the importance of firm specific

Conclusions

In this paper we have presented estimates of the relative value in
the U.S. stock market of dividends and capital gains. We have concluded
that over the sample period (1926 to 1978) the capital gain regarded by
the

market as

Thflowed

equivalent to a dollar of dividends, denoted by a

,

has

a cyclical path around one. The pattern of movement has roughly

paralleled that of the business cycle.
The estimates are based on a modification of the capital asset pricing
model. Successive estimates are presented, relaxing a priori restrictions.
We

are able to incorporate stochastic dividends and inflation and to allow
for deviation between the returns on the stock market and that on the

portfolio of all assets. In each case the empirical results are consistent
with expectations. In particular, the most refined version has not only by
far the highest value of the likelihood function, but also the most plausible
path of a
We interpret the tendency of a to one as consistent with a view
of the firm as mad.zing share value in making decisions about dividend
policy, real investment and financial structure. An implication of this

view is that a is an estimate of the value in the market of incremental
real investment. The empirical results on the time pattern of a are
consistent with this implication.

While the estimated value of a is consistent with maximizing behavior
by the firm, it is less clearly consistent with mad.mizing behavior by

investors. The market value of a is shon by the theory to be a weighted
average of stockholder a's. The tax treatment of the two forms of returns

Second, the theory developed here implies a response of the dividend

speaking, high values of a should cail forth a shift from debt to equity

effect.
To deal properly with this relationship wili require a careful treatment of
the underlying reason for a change in a (e.g., change in tax rules vs.

FOOTNOTES

'The tax rules described below are those currently in effect. They

are representative in a qualitative sense of the rules that were in effect
over the recent decades of the sample period of the empirical work, although
there have been important changes in the treatment of capital gains in the

individual income tax. The important fact about the early decades of the
sample is that the income tax affected very few people.
2For simplicity we neglect here distributions of property other than
cash. Stock dividends are treated as a simple redefinition of the units of
