A Multicountry Econometric Model

ABSTRACT

A multicountry econometric model is presented in this paper. The
theoretical basis of the model is discussed in Fair (l979a), and the
present paper is an empirical extension of this work. The model is
quarterly and contains estimated equations for 44 countries. Most of
the equations have been estimated by two stage least squares. The basic
estimation period is 19581—19801 (89 observations). For equations that
are relevant only when exchange rates are flexible, the basic estimation
period is 197211—19801 (32 observations). The trade matrix contains
data for 64 countries. The U.S. part of the model is the model described
in Fair (1976, 1980b).
The model differs from previous models in a number of ways.
(1) Linkages among countries with respect to exchange rates, interest
rates, and prices appear to be more important in the model than they are
in previous models. (2) There is no natural distinction in the model
between stock—market and flow—market determination of the exchange rate.

(3) The number of countries is larger than usual, and the data are all
quarterly. (4) I alone have estimated small models for each country and
then

linked them together, rather than, as Project LINK has done, take
models developed by others and link them together. The advantage of this
approach is that the person constructing the individual models knows from
the beginning that they are to be linked together, and this may lead to
better specification of the linkages.
The paper contains (1) a review of the theoretical basis of the
model, (2) a description of the econometric model, including presentation
and discussion of all the estimated equations, (3) a comparison of the
predictive accuracy of the model to that of a fourth order autoregressive
model, and (4) a brief discussion of the properties of the model. A much
more detailed examination of the properties of the model is presented in
Fair (1981).

A MIJLTICOUNTRY ECONOMETRIC MODEL*

by
Ray C. Fair

I. Introduction
A multicountry econometric model is presented in this paper. The
theoretical basis of the model is discussed in Fair (l979a), and the

present paper is an empirical extension of this work. Quarterly data
have been collected or constructed for 64 countries, and the model con-

tains estimated equations for 44 countries. The basic estimation period

is 19581—19801 (89 observations). For equations that are relevant only
when exchange rates are flexible, the basic estimation period is 197211-

19801 (32 observations). Most of the equations have been estimated by
two stage least squares. The U.S. part of the model is the model described
in Fair (1976, 1980b).

The model differs from previous models in a number of ways. First,
linkages among countries with respect to exchange rates, interest rates,
and prices appear to be more important in the present model than they

are in previous models. Previous models have been primarily trade linkage models. The LINK model (Ball 1973), for example, is of this kind,
although some recent work has been done on making capital movements

endogenous in the model)
*The research described in this paper was financed by grant S0C77—03274
from the National Science Foundation.

2

Second, the theory upon which the model is based differs somewhat

from previous theories. The theoretical model in Fair (1979a) is one
in which stock and flow effects are completely integrated. There is no
natural distinction in this model between stock—market and flow—market
determination of the exchange rate, a distinction that is important in
recent discussions of the monetary approach to the balance of payments.2
The theoretical model also allows for the possibility of price linkages
among countries, something which has generally been missing from previous
theoretical work.

Third, the number of countries in the model is larger than usual,

and the data are all quarterly. Considerable work has gone into the
construction of quarterly data bases for all the countries. Some of the
quarterly data had to be interpolated from annual data, and a few data

points had to be guessed. The collection and construction of the data
bases are discussed in the Appendix.

Finally, there is an important difference between the approach taken
in this study and an approach like that of Project LINK.

I alone have

estimated small models for each country and then linked them together,
rather than, as Project LINK has done, take models developed by others

and link them together. The advantage of the LINK approach is that larger
models for each country can be used. It is clearly not feasible for one
person to construct medium— or large—scale models for each country. The

1See Hickman (1974, p. 203) for a discussion of this. See also Berner
et al. (1976) for discussion of a five—country econometric model in which
capital flows are endogenous.

2See, for example, Frenkel and Johnson (1976), Dornbusch (1976), Frenkel
and Rodriguez (1975), and Kouri (1976),

3

advantage of the present approach, on the other hand, is that the person
constructing the individual models knows from the beginning that they
are to be linked together, and this may lead to better specification of

the linkages. It is unlikely, for example, that the specification of the
exchange rate and interest rate linkages in the present model would develop

from the LINK approach. Whether this possible gain in the linkage specification outweighs the loss of having to deal with small models of each
country is, of course, an open question.

The theoretical basis of the model is reviewed in Section II. Because of data limitations, not all versions of the theoretical model in
Fair (l979a) can be estimated, and the primary purpose of Section II is
to present the version of the theoretical model that the econometric model

most closely approximates. The econometric model is presented and discussed in Section III. The predictive accuracy of the model is then
examined in Section IV, and the properties of the model are discussed in

Section V. Section VI contains a brief conclusion.

II. The Theoretical Basis of the Model
Data limitations usually make the transition from a theoretical model

to an empirical model less than straightforward. This is certainly true
In the present case, where much of the International data that one would

like to have are of poor quality or do not exist. The transition from
the theoretical models in Fair (1974, 1979a) to the present econometric

model Is discussed in this section. The theoretical models will first
be reviewed, and then the modifications needed for the empirical work will
be discussed.

The basic theoretical model that has guided my empirical work is

4

presented in Fair (1974). Individual agents in this model derive their
decisions from the solutions of multiperiod maximization problems: households maximize utility and firms maximize profits. The variables that
explain the decision variables are the ones that affect these solutions.
These problems require that agents form expectations of the future values

of a number of variables. Even though the model is

deterministic, agents

make expectation errors. They do not know the complete structure of the
model and must form their expectations are the basis of a limited set of
information (usually only the past history of a few variables). These expectation errors lead at times to hldisequilibriumt! in the labor,

goods,

and financial markets, and much of the modeling is concerned with the

effects of disequilibrium. Another important feature of the modeling
is making sure that all flows of funds among the agents are accounted for.
The idea for the two—country model in Fair (l979a) came from considering how one would link the above theoretical model, which is a single—

country model, to a model just like it. One way in which the two—country
model is distinguished from previous models is in the determination of

the exchange rate. The distinction between the stock—market and f low—
market determination of the exchange rate, which has played an important
role in the literature on the monetary approach to the balance of payments,

is not relevant in the model. The exchange rate, like the price level,
the wage rate, and the interest rate, is merely one endogenous variable
out of many, and in no rigorous sense can it be said to be "the" variable

that clears a particular market. Because of the accounting for all flows
of funds, the model is one in which stock and flow effects are completely
integrated.

There are a number of versions of the two—country model, depending

5

(1) on whether there are fixed or flexible exchange rates, (2) on whether
the bonds of the two countries are perfect substitutes, (3) on the level
of aggregation of the sectors in the countries, (4) on whether reaction
functions of the monetary authorities with respect to interest rates and
the exchange rate are postulated, and (5) on the treatment of the forward

rate. Before considering the transition to the empirical model, it will
be necessary to outline some of these versions.
Consider first the case in which there are two sectors per country:

private (p) and government (g) .

In

what follows capital letters de-

note variables for country 1; lower case letters denote variables for
country 2; and an asterisk (*) on a variable denotes the other

country's holdings of the variable. Each country has its own money

The bonds are one—period securities.

(M,m) and its own bond (B,b) .

Negative values of B and b denote liabilities. The interest rate on

B is R and on b is r •

e

is the price of country 27s currency

in terms of country l's currency, and F is the (one—period) forward
price of country Vs currency. Each country holds a positive amount of
the international reserve (Q,q)

,

which is denominated in the currency

of country 1.

It is unnecessary for present purposes to consider explicitly the

labor and goods markets. Instead, the savings of each sector can be
represented by writing one equation per sector:

(1)

S =

(2)

Sg =

(3)

s =

(4)

=
Sg

f1(R,

r, e, •.. )

f2(R,

r, e,

f3(R,

r, e, •..

f4(R,

r, e,

)

6

S and s denote savings, the difference between a sector's revenue and
its expenditures. In the complete model the savings variables are determined by definitions, where many of the right hand side variables in these

definitions are determined in the labor and goods markets. Almost every
variable in the model has at least an indirect effect on savings, and

so the argument list in the above functions is long. The two interest
rates and the exchange rate have been listed explicitly in the functions
only for emphasis.

Each sector faces a budget constraint:

For simplicity it is assumed that the countries do not hold each other's
money and that the governments do not hold foreign bonds.
Coming out of the solutions of the maximization problems of the pri-

vate sector are demands for domestic and foreign bonds and domestic money,
which can be represented as:

B =

There is finally an equation stating that there is no change in total

One

of

equations (1), (5), and (9)—(ll) is redundant, and one of

equations (3), (7), and (12)—(l4) is redundant. It will be useful to
drop equations (10) and (13). Also, the savings variables satisfy the

+

property that

and so one of equations (1)—

(8), (15)—(l8), and (19) is redundant. It will be useful to drop equa-

tion (19). This leaves 16 independent equations. There are 19 variables

that one of these two variables is taken to be exogenous, the model can

It

should be clear from this representation that e ,

is

not determined solely in stock markets or in flow markets. It

like

R and

is simultaneously determined along with the other endogenous variables.

When R ,

r

,

and

e are determined in the above version of the model,

they will be said to be "implicitly" determined. An alternative to this
version is one in which reaction functions of the monetary authorities

are postulated. Reaction functions for R and r can be written:

(20)

R =

f20(

...

)

(21)

r =

f21(

...

)

where the arguments in the functions are variables that affect the mone-

tary authorities' decisions regarding short term interest rates. In this
case monetary policy is explained by equations (20) and (21) and so is

endogenous in the model. Adding these equations means that Bg and bg
must he taken to be endogenous. It is also possible to postulate an
exchange rate reaction function for one of the monetary authorities, where
e is on the left hand side and variables that. affect the decision of the

4Note that the monetary policy vriahles are Bg and bg in this model.

The monetary authorities affect the economy by exchanging bonds for money
or reserves, subject to the government budget constraints (6) and (8).
This in turn affect interest rates and other endogenous variables. There
is no banking sector in the version of the model presented here. If a
banking sector were added, then two other monetary policy variables would
be introduced for each country: the discount rate and the reserve requirement rate. See Fair (1979a) for a discussion of this.

monetary authority regarding e are on the right hand side:
e =

In this case, as in the fixed exchange rate case, Q is endogenous.
The next issue to consider is the case in which the bonds of the

two countries are perfect substitutes. The covered interest rate from
country l's perspective on the bond of country 2, say r'

,

F is the forward rate. If for R =

r'

people

are indifferent as to which bond they hold, then the bonds will be defined

to be perfect substitutes. If this is the case, then the above model is
modified as follows. First, equations (9) and (12) drop out, since the
private sector is now indifferent between the two bonds. Second, arbi-

trage will insure that R =

R =

(23)

(e/F)(l-i-r)

and so a new equation is added:

— 1

Third, the model is underidentified with respect to B

and b* ,

,

B*

,

b

and so one of these variables must be taken to be exogenous.5

A key question to consider in the perfect substitution case is how

the forward rate, F

,

is

determined. If F is equal to the expected

future spot rate, then one could try to estimate an equation explaining
F ,

where the explanatory variables would be variables that one believes

affect expectations. An alternative to this would be to assume that expectations are rational and estimate the model under this constraint.

If F is determined in either of these two ways, it will be said to play
5This indeterminacy is analogous to the indeterminacy that arises in,
say, a two—consumer, two—firm model in which the two consumers are indifferent between the goods produced by the two firms. It is not possible
in this model to determine the allocation of the two goods between the
two consumers.

10

an "active" role inthemodel. If F is active, then it is obviously
not possible to have all three variables—— R

r

,

and

,

e ——implicitly

determined or determined by reaction functions. Given equation (23) and
the equation (implicit if rational expectations, explicit otherwise) for
F ,

only

two of the three variables can be implicitly determined or

determined by reaction functions. Also, if exchange rates are fixed,

then it is not possible to have both R and r implicitly determined
or determined by reaction functions if F is active. An alternative

case to F being active is the case in which R

r

,

,

and

e are im-

plicitly determined or determined by reaction functions and F is deter-

mined by equation (23). In this case F will be said to play a "passive"

role in the model. Given R

,

r

,

and

e ,

F

merely adjusts to insure

that the arbitrage condition holds.

The version of the model that was used as a basis for the empirical

work is the one in which the bonds are perfect substitutes, F is passive,

and R ,

r

,

and

e are determined by reaction functions. Whether this

choice, which was partly dictated by data availability, provides an adequate basis for constructing an empirical model is an open question.

No direct tests of the assumptions behind this choice are attempted in

this paper. The choice is indirectly tested by examining how well the

model explains the historical data. The results of this test are presented
and discussed in Section IV.

The assumption that is most questionable in this choice is probably

the assumption that e is determined by a reaction function. The alternative assumption is that e is implicitly determined, with reserves,
Q ,

exogenous.

In practice there is obviously some intervention of the

monetary authorities in the exchange markets, and so this alternative

11

assumption is also questionable. The assumption that

e is determined

by a reaction function means that intervention is complete: the monetary

authority has a target e each period and achieves this
priate changes in Q .

This

target by appro-

assumption may not be, however, as restrictive

as it first sounds. The monetary authority is likely to be aware of the
market forces that are operating on

e in the absence of intervention

(i.e., the forces behind the determination of

e when e is implicitly

determined), and it may take these into account in setting its target

each period. If some of the explanatory variables in the reaction function
are in part measures of these forces, then the estimated reaction function

may provide a better explanation of e than one would otherwise have
thought. Similar arguments apply to the assumption that R and r are
determined by reaction functions.

The assumption that F is passive means that the forward market
imposes no "discipline" on the monetary authority's choice of the exchange

rate. Again, if the monetary authority takes into account market forces

operating on e in the absence of intervention, including market forces
in the forward market, and if the explanatory variables in the reaction

function for e are in part measures of these forces, then the estimated
reaction function for e may not be too bad an approximation. Given
this assumption and given that F does not appear as an explanatory vari-

able in any of the equations, F plays no role in the empirical model.
For each country it is determined by an estimated version of the arbitrage
condition, equation (23), but the predictions from these equations have
no effect on the predictions of any of the other variables in the model.

The assumption that F is passive is not sensible in the case of
fixed exchange rates: for most observations

F is equal to or very close

12

to e when e is fixed. A different choice was thus made for the fixed
rate case. This choice was designed to try to account for the possibility
that the bonds of the different countries are not perfect substitutes as

well as for the fact that F is not passive. The procedure that was
followed in the fixed rate case is as follows. The U.S. was assumed to
be the "leading" country with respect to the determination of interest

rates. Assume in the above model that the U.S. is country 1. Consider

the determination of r

,

country

2's interest rate. If exchange rates

are fixed, bonds are perfect substitutes, and F is equal to e ,
r is determined by equation (23) and is equal to R

.

In

then

other words,

country Vs interest rate is merely country l's interest rate: country
1 sets the one world interest rate and country 2's monetary authority has

no control over country 2's rate. If the bonds are not perfect substitutes, then equation (23) does not hold and country 2's monetary authority
can affect its rate.

If, however, the bonds are close to being perfect

substitutes, then very large changes in

bg will be needed to change

r very much. In the empirical work interest rate reaction functions
were estimated for each country, but with the U.S. interest rate added

as an explanatory variable to each equation. If the bonds are close to
being perfect substitutes, then the U.S. rate should be the only significant
variable in these equations and have a coefficient estimate close to 1.0.
If the bonds are not at all close substitutes, then the coefficient estimate should be close to zero and the other variables should be significant.
The in—between case should correspond to both the U.S. rate and the other
variables being significant.
The above discussion about the U.S. rate in the interest rate reaction functions does not pertain to the flexible exchange rate case. One

13

would thus not expect the interest rate reaction functions to be the same
in the fixed and flexible rate cases, and so in the empirical work separate
interest rate reaction functions were estimated for each country for the

fixed and flexible rate periods. Note that the U.S. rate may still be
an explanatory variable in the reaction functions for the flexible rate

period. This would be, however, because the U.S. rate is one of the variables that affects the monetary authority's interest rate decision, not
because the U.S. rate is being used to try to capture the degree of sub-

stitutability of the bonds. It should finally be noted in this regard
that the interest rate reaction function for the U.S. was estimated over

the entire sample period. This procedure is consistent with the above
assumption that the U.S. is the interest rate leader in the fixed rate

period. If it is the leader, then it is not constrained as the other
countries are, and so there is no reason on this account to expect the
function to be different in the fixed and flexible rate periods.

The next issue to consider in the transition to the empirical model

is the level of aggregation of the sectors. In the empirical model the
private and government sectors are aggregated together, and so there is

only one sector per country. In this case the budget constraint for country
1 is the sum of equations (5) and (6):

(24)

S

0=

S —

— eLb* —

is equal to Sp + S g

script

,

tB

is equal to LB + B
p

g

,

and the p sub-

has been dropped from b* since it is now unnecessary. The budget

constraint for country 2 is similarly the sum of equations (7) and (8):

(25)

0s—b—4B*_Aq.

14

Note that because of the assumption that a country holds no foreign money,

the money supply variables drop out of the sums. Equations (15) and (17)
are now written as:

(26)

0=B+B*

(27)

0=b+b*
Consider now a further type of aggregation. Let AA

and a =

b

(28)

0=S—AA

AB + eAb* + LQ

this notation equations (24) and (25) are:

If one adds the first difference of (26), the first difference of (27)

and (19), the result is:

multiplied by e ,

(30)

0 =

LA+

eAa

Equation (30) is redundant, given (28) and (29), because S and s satisfy
the property that S + es = 0

.

This aggregation is very convenient be-

cause it allows data on A and a to be constructed by summing past

values of S and s from some given base period values. Data on S
(the balance of payments on current account) are available for most countries,

whereas data on B ,

B*

,

b

,

and

b* (i.e., bilateral financial data)

are generally not available. There is, of course, a cost to this type
of aggregation, which is that capital gains and losses on bonds from ex-

change rate changes are not accounted for. Given the current data, there
is little that can be done about this. Note that this aggregation is made
possible in the model by the assumption that the bonds are perfect sub—

15

stitutes. If the bonds are not perfect substitutes, then equations (9)
and (12) do not drop out, and bilateral financial data would be needed to
estimate them.

It will be convenient to rewrite the above model in the form that
was used as a basis for the empirical work:

It should finally be noted that although nothing has been said about

the determination of S and s in this section, this determination is
an important part of the empirical model. It will be discussed in the
next section. The purpose of this section was to try to make clear the
assumptions behind the use of the reaction functions and the aggregation.

III. The Econometric Model
The econometric model for all countries except the U.S. is presented
in Tables 1 through 4.

The variables for a particular country i are

presented in alphabetic order in Table 1; the equations for country i
are listed in Table 2; the trade and price linkages among the countries
are presented in Table 3; and the coefficient estimates for all the coun-

tries are presented in Table 4. The purpose of this section is to explain
these tables. To conserve space, it is assumed in the following discussion that the tables have been read carefully. Parts of the tables that
are self explanatory are not discussed, and the discussion is not self
contained without the tables.

The econometric model for the U.S. is the one discussed in Fair (1976,

1980b). It is much larger than the model for an individual country in
Table 2, and it captures many more features of the economy. The two key
exogenous foreign sector variables in this model are the import price
deflator and the real value of exports, and when the U.S. model is embedded
in the overall model, these two variables become endogenous. Since the
U.S. model is described in detail elsewhere, it will not be discussed

in this section. All references to the econometric work in this section
pertain only to the non U.S. part of the model.

The Data
The raw data were taken from two of the four tapes that are constructed

every month by the International Monetary Fund: the International Financial Statistics (IFS) tape and the Direction of Trade (DOT) tape. The
way in which each variable was constructed is explained in brackets in

Table 1. Some variables were taken directly from the tapes, and some were
constructed from other variables. When "IFS" precedes a number in the

table, this refers to the variable on the IFS tape with the particular

number. Some adjustments were made to the raw data, and these are explained in the Appendix. The main adjustment that was made was the construction of quarterly National Income Accounts (NIA) data from annual

data when the quarterly data were not available. Another important adjustment concerned the linking of the Balance of Payments data to the

other export and import data. The two key variables involved in this

process are BOP* and TT* ,

and, as noted in Table 1, the construction

of these variables is explained in Table A—3 in the Appendix.6

Most of

the data are not seasonally adjusted.

Note that two interest rates are listed in Table 1, the short term

rate (r.) and the long term rate (R)

.

The notation for these two

rates should not be confused with the notation in Section II, where both

r and R denoted short term rates. For many countries only discount
rate data are available for

r. ,

and this is an important limitation

of the data base. The availability of interest rate data by country is
discussed in Table A—i in the Appendix.

in Table 1 was constructed by summing past values of

BOP

from a base period value of zero. The summation began in the first quarter

for which data on BOP
it existed. This means that the A series is
it

off by a constant amount each period (the difference between the true

value of At in the base period and zero). In the estimation work the
functional forms were chosen so that this error was always absorbed in

the estimate of the constant term. It is important to note that

6The balance of payments variable is denoted BOP* rather than S . S
is used to denote final sales. This should not be confused with the no-

tation in Section II, where S denotes the balance of payments.

measures only the net asset position of the country vis—a—vis the rest

of the world. Domestic wealth, such as the domestically owned housing
stock and plant and equipment stock, is not included.
An Outline of the Model
Table 2 contains a complete description of the equations for country

i except for the functional forms and coefficient estimates of the stochastic equations. There are up to 11 estimated equations per country,
and these are listed first in Table 2.

Equations 12 through 20 are

definitions.
Equation 1 determines 'the demand for merchandise

imports, and equa-

tion 14 provides the link from merchandise imports to total NIA imports.
Equations 2 and 3 determine the demands for consumption and investment,

respectively. Equation 16 is the definition for final sales.

The level

of final sales is equal to consumption plus investment plus government
spending plus exports minus imports plus a discrepancy term. Government

spending is exogenous. Exports are determined when the countries are
linked together. The key export variable is
links this variable to NIA exports.

X75$. ,

and equation 15

Equation 4 determines production, and

equation 12 determines inventory investment, which is the difference be-

tween production and sales. Equation 13 defines the stock of inventories.
Equation 5 is the key price equation in the model.

It determines

the GNP deflator. The existence of a price equation in the model means
that equilibrium is not necessarily assumed to exist in the product market.
Any difference between demand and supply in a period is reflected in a

change in inventories. The other price equation in the model is equation
11, which determines the export price index as a function of the GNP deflator and other variables.

35

Equation 17 defines the balance of payments on current account,

B0Pt .

Equation 17 and the equations involved in determining its right

hand side variables are represented by equation (i) (or (ii)) in Section

the asset variable At is determined by equation

II. Given B0Pt ,

18. This equation is analogous to equation (iii) (or (iv)) in Section

II. The demand for money is determined by equation 6. Although the money
supply drops out of the budget constraint when the private and government
sectors are aggregated, it is an explanatory variable in the interest rate

reaction functions in the model and so needs to be explained. Equation
6 is analogous to equation (11) (or (14)) in Section II.

Equations 7a and 7b are the interest rate reaction functions. They
are analogous to equation Cv) (or (vi)) in Section II. The "a" denotes
that the equation is estimated over the fixed exchange rate period, and
the "b" denotes that it is estimated over the flexible rate period. Equation 8 introduces a variable that was not considered in Section II, the

long term interest rate. This equation is a standard term structure
equation.

Equation 9b is the exchange rate reaction function. It is analogous
to equation (vii) in Section II and is estimated only over the flexible

exchange rate period. e± in equation 9b is the average exchange rate
for the period, whereas

ee. in equation 20 is the end—of—period rate.

Equation 20 links eit to ee. ,

Section II, F.t plays no role in the model, and so neither does

The trade and price linkages are presented in Table 3.

Table 3 takes

as input from each country the total value of merchandise imports in

75$ (N75$A.) ,
(e.) .

the export price index (Px.) ,

and the exchange rate

It returns for each country the total value of merchandise ex-

ports in 75$ (X75$.) and the import price index

(PM.t) .

These latter

two variables are used as inputs by each country. The model is solved
for each quarter by iterating between the equations for each country in
Table 2 and the equations in Table 3.
Note from Table 1 that the data taken from the DOT tape are merchan-

dise exports from i to j in $ (XX$..)

.

These data were converted

to 75$ by multiplying XX$.. by e./(ej75PX.) (see 75ijt in
Table 1). This could only be done, however, if data

on e. and PX

existed. Type A countries are countries for which these data exist, and
Type B countries are the remaining countries. The share variable
that is used in Table 3 is defined in Table 1.

Table 3 deals only with Type A countries. Total merchandise imports of

and 8 were estimated by two stage least squares, and the remaining equations were estimated by ordinary least squares. Lagged dependent variables
were used extensively in the estimation work to try to account for

37

expectational and lagged adjustment effects. This procedure is consistent
with the treatment of expectations in the theoretical model discussed
in Section II, where expectations are assumed to be formed on the basis

of a limited set of information. Explanatory variables were dropped from
the equations if they had coefficient estimates of the wrong expected sign.
A number of the equations were estimated under the assumption of first order
serial correlation of the error term.

in Table 4 denotes the estimate

of the serial correlation coefficient. In many cases variables were left
in the equations if their coefficient estimates were of the expected sign
even if the estimates were not significant by conventional standards.7
Both current and one—quarter lagged values were generally tried for
the explanatory price and interest rate variables, and the values that

gave the best results were used. Similarly, both the short term and long
term interest rate variables were tried, and the variable that gave the

best results was used. All the equations except lOb and 11 were estimated
with a constant and three seasonal dummy variables. To conserve space,
the coefficient estimates of these four variables are not reported in
Table 4. In most cases the functional form chosen for the equations was
the log form. Data limitations prevented all the equations from being
estimated for all countries and also required that shorter sample periods

from the basic period be used for many countries. The main part of the
model, excluding the U.S., consists of countries Canada through the U.K.

7There is considerable collinearity among many of the explanatory variables, especially the price variables, and the number of observations
is fairly small for equations estimated only over the flexible exchange
rate period. Many of the coefficients are thus not likely to be estimated very precisely, and this is the reason for retaining variables even
if their coefficient estimates had fairly large estimated standard errors.

The specification of the following equations is generally consistent

with the theory outlined in Section II. When it is not, such as the use
of income as an explanatory variable in the consumption function, this

will be noted. No attempt is made in the following discussion to provide
a detailed explanation of the transition from the theory to the econometric

specifications. Some of this was provided in Section II, particularly
with respect to the use of the interest rate and exchange rate reaction

functions. Detailed explanation of a number of the other equations is
presented in Fair (1976), where the transition from the single—country
theoretical model in Fair (1974) to the econometric model of the U.S. is

discussed. As with most macroeconometrjc work, these transitions are
not as tight as one would like, but there may be little that can be done
about this given the nature of the data.
The asset variable,

,

is

an important explanatory variable in

a number of the equations. One should, however, be aware of the limita-

tions of this variable. As noted earlier, this variable measures only
the net asset position of the country vis—a—vis the rest of the world.

It does not include the domestic wealth of the country. Also, the value
of the asset variable for each country is off by a constant amount, and
this required a choice for the functional form of the variable in the
equations that one might not have chosen otherwise.

Equation 1: The demand for imports
Equation 1 explains the real per capita merchandise imports of country
I .

The explanatory variables include the price of domestic goods, the

price of imports, the interest rates, per capita Income, and the lagged

39

value of real per capita assets. For the main countries these variables
were generally found to be significant. The two price variables are expected to have coefficients of opposite signs and of roughly the same
size in absolute value, and this was generally found to be the case.

uation 2: Consumption
Equation 2 explains real per capita consumption. The explanatory
variables include the interest rates, real per capita income, and the

lagged value of real per capita assets. These variables were generally
found to be significant. The use of income in this equation is inconsistent with the treatment of a household's decision problem in the theoretical
model outlined in Section II.

If a household is choosing consumption and

labor supply to maximize utility, then income is not the appropriate variable to put on the right hand side of the consumption equation. This
procedure can be justified if households are always constrained in their
labor supply decision, and this is what must be assumed here. This issue
is treated consistently in the U.S. model, where income is not used as an
expianatoryvariabie in the consumption equations. (See Chapter 4 in Fair (1976).)

The interest rate variables in the import and consumption equations

are nominal rates. I added various proxies of expected future rates of
inflation to the equations (in addition to th.e nominal interest rate) to see if

their coefficient estimates had the expected positive sign. The proxies
consisted of various weighted averages of current and past inflation rates.
I also tried subtracting each proxy from the nominal rate and then

adding this "real" rate to the equation. The results were not very good,
which may be due to the difficulty of measuring expected future inflation

rates. In future work more attempts of this kind should be made, but
for the present purposes the nominal rates have been used.

and past changes in output, lagged gross investment, a

One would expect the output coefficients to be positive, the
coefficient
for lagged gross investment to be negative, and the coefficient for
time

to be positive. This is generally the case in Table 4. In
many cases
not all of the output coefficient
estimates are significant, which is
not surprising given the likely

collinearity among the output variables.

41

The investment equation estimated here is similar to the investment
equation estimated in the U.S. model, with two important exceptions.
For the U.S. model a capital stock series and an "excess" capital series

were constructed. Desired net investment was assumed to be a function of
the amount of excess capital on hand as well as of the output changes.
Also, depreciation was assumed to be proportional to the capital stock.
This introduces two new explanatory variables into the estimated equation
——the amount of excess capital on hand and the measure of depreciation

——and subtracts one variable——time. (See Chapter 5 in Fair (1976) for
further discussion.)

Equation 4: Production
Equation 4 explains the level of production. It is based on the
following three equations:

Equation (35) states that the desired level of inventories is proportional

to current sales. Equation (36) states that the desired level of production is equal to sales plus some fraction of the difference between the
desired level of inventories and the level on hand at the end of the previous

period. Equation (37) states that actual production partially adjusts

42

to desired production each period. The implied values of A

,

,

and

are presented in Table 4 along with the actual coefficient estimates.

The values of A are less than one, and it is generally the case that

A is greater than a for a given country. In a few cases the original
estimates implied a negative value of a

,

and in these cases

was dropped as an explanatory variable. First order serial correlation
of the error term is quite pronounced in most of the equations.

Equation 5: The GNP deflator
Equation 5 explains the GNP deflator. It is the key price equation
in the model for each country. The explanatory variables include the
price of imports, interest rates, and a demand pressure variable,
It is clear from the results that import prices have an im-

portant effect on domestic prices for most countries. The estimated
coefficient of the demand pressure variable is also significant for a
number of countries, and at least some slight effect of interest rates
on prices has been estimated for some countries.
The demand pressure variable was constructed as follows.

Log(Y./POP.) was first regressed on a constant, time, and three seasonal
dummy variables, and the estimated standard error, SE

values, log('/pop) ,

43

it

The demand pressure variable in equation (40) is equal to zero when the

actual value of log(Y./PoP.) is 4 standard errors greater than the
value predicted by the above mentioned regression and is less than zero

otherwise.8 Given that the log of the demand pressure variable is used
in the price equation, and assuming that this variable has the expected
positive coefficient estimate, this treatment means that as the actual
value of real per capita output approaches

Y/P0P. ,

the

predicted

price level approaches plus infinity. Given the other equations in the
model, this would never be a solution of the overall model, and so this

treatment bounds the output of the country from above. This is a way
with limited data of putting supply constraints into the model.
There are a number of theoretical arguments that can be made for
the inclusion of import prices in the domestic price equation, and given

the seeming empirical significance ofimport prices on domestic prices,
some of these should perhaps be mentioned here. In this discussion of
the U.S. model in Fair (1976), it is argued that import prices may affect
a firm's expectations of other firms' pricing behavior, which may in turn

affect its own price decision. This "expectational" justification is
consistent with the profit maximizing model of firm behavior in Fair (1974).
On a more practical level, if some wages and prices in a country are indexed and if the index in part includes import prices, them import prices

8Thjs is assuming that the actual value of log(Y./POP.) is never more

than 4 standard errors greater than the value predicted by the regression.
For no country was the actual value greater than 4 standard errors from
the predicted value in any quarter.

44

may directly or indirectly (through a wage effect on prices) affect domestic prices.

Another implication of the profit maximizing model in Fair (1974)
is that interest rates should have a positive effect on prices. This, as

noted above, was found to be true for some countries. This was also found

to be true for the U.S.

qation 6: The demand for money
Equation 6 explains the per capita demand for money. Both the interest rate and the incomevariables are

generally significant in this

equation. For all countries except Austria and the Philippines the estimated coefficient of the interest rate was of the expected negative sign.

Equations 7a and 7b: The interest rate reaction functions
The candidates for inclusion as explanatory variables in the interest
rate reaction functions are variables that one believes may affect the
monetary authority's decision regarding short term interest rates. In
addition, the U.S. interest rate may be an important explanatory variable
in the equations estimated over the fixed exchange rate period if bonds

are close substitutes. The variables that were tried include the lagged
rate of inflation, the lagged rate of growth of the money supply, the
demand pressure variable, the change in assets, the lagged rate of change
of import prices, the exchange rate (equation 7b only), and the German

interest rate. The form of the asset variable that was tried is

At/(PYjPOPj) .

Except for division by

1'°"1 , the

change in

this variable is the balance of payments on current account. For some
countries, depending on the Initial results, the current and one period

lagged values were entered separately. It may be that the monetary

45

authorities respond in part to the level of assets and in part to the
change, and entering the current and lagged values separately will pick
this up.

Although equations 7a and 7b are estimated over fairly small numbers
of observations because of the breaking up of the sample periods, a num-

ber of significant coefficient estimates were obtained. The estimates
vary considerably across countries, but in general it does seem that

monetary authorities in other countries "lean against the wind." This
conclusion is consistent with the results for the U.S., where the Fed

is also estimated to lean against the wind. (See Fair (1978).) The U.S.
rate, as expected, is a more important explanatory variable in the fixed
exchange rate period than it is in the flexible rate period.

qation 8:

The long term interest rate

Equation 8 is a standard term structure equation. The current and
lagged short term interest rates and the rate of inflation term are meant

to be proxies for expected future short term interest rates. Many of
the current and lagged short term rates are significant. The rate of
inflation term is in general not very important.

Equation 9b: The exchange rate reaction function
Equation 9b explains the spot exchange rate. Candidates for inclusion as explanatory variables in this equation are variables that one
believes affect the monetary authority's decision regarding the exchange

rate. If, as mentioned in Section II, a monetary authority takes into
account market forces in choosing its exchange rate target, then variables

measuring these forces should be included in this equation. The variables

that were tried include the price level of country i relative to the

46

U.S. price level, the short term interest rate of country i relative
to the U.S. rate, the demand pressure variable of country I relative

to the demand pressure variable In the U.S. model (ZJ)

,

the one—

quarter lagged value of the change in real per capita net foreign assets

of country I relative to the change in the same variable for the U.S.,
and the German exchange rate.

As was the case for the interest rate reaction functions, the results
vary considerably across countries, but in general significant effects

of these variables appear to be found. (Remember that these estimates,
like the estimates for the interest rate reaction functions, are based

on a relative small number of observations.) The German exchange rate
has an important positive effect on the exchange rates of the other

European countries. The signs of the effects of the other variables,
when they are operating, are (all changes are relative to the U.S.):
an increase in a country's price level or demand pressure variable has
a positive effect on its exchange rate (a depreciation), and an increase
in a country's short term interest rate or change in assets has a negative

effect (an appreciation). The change in asset variable,

Al/(PY.1Pop11)) , is

the per capita balance of payments of the

country in 1975 local currency. When subtracting from this variable the
similar variable for the U.S., the U.S. variable must be multiplied by
the 1975 exchange rate

(e.75) to make the units comparable.

Equation lOb: The forward rate
Equation lOb is the estimated arbitrage condition. Although this
equation plays no role In the model, it is of Interest to see how close

the quarterly data match the arbitrage condition. If the condition were

47

met exactly, the coefficient estimates of log

(l+r.t/100)

ee. and -lo(11/100)

would be 1.0 and the fit would be perfect. As can be seen, the results
do indicate that the data are consistent with the arbitrage condition,
especially considering the poor quality of some of the interest rate data.

Equation 11: The export price index
Equation 11 provides a link from the GNP deflator to the export price

index. Export prices are needed when the countries are linked together
(see Table 3).

If a country produced only one good, then the export price

would be the domestic price and only one price equation would be needed.
In practice, of course, a country produces many goods, only some of which

are exported. If a country is a price taker with respect to its exports,
then its export prices would just be the world prices of the export goods.
To try to capture the in between case where a country has some affect on
its export prices, but not complete control over every price, the export
price index was regressed on the GNP deflator and a world price index.

The world price index (PW$.) is defined in Table 1. It is a
weighted average of the export prices (in dollars) of the individual coun-

tries. Type B countries and oil exporting countries (countries 26 through
35) are excluded from the calculations. The weight for each country is
the ratio of its total exports to the total exports of all the countries.

The world price index differs for different countries because the individual
country is excluded from the calculations for itself.
Since the world price index is in dollars, it needs to be multiplied

by the exchange rate to convert it into local currency before being used
as an explanatory variable in the export price equation for a given country.
(The export price index explained by equation 11 is in local currency.)

48

For some countries, depending on the initial results, this was done, but
for others the world price index in dollars and the exchange rate were

entered separately. The results in Table 4 show, as expected, that export prices are in part linked to domestic prices and in part to world
prices.

It should be stressed that equation 11 is meant only as a rough

approximation. If more disaggregated data were available, one would want
to estimate separate price equations for each good, where some goods'
prices would be strongly influenced by world prices and some would not.
This type of disaggregation is beyond the scope of this study.
As noted above, equation 11 is used to link the export price index

to the GNP deflator. The world price index is added to the equation to
try to lessen the bias of the coefficient estimate of the GNP deflator.

The world price index is not meant to be an endogenous variable. Although
it is measured as a weighted average of the export price indices of the
individual countries, which are endogenous, its use in equation 11 is

merely as a control variable. The export price index of one country is
indirectly affected by the export prices of other countries through the
effect of import prices on the GNP deflator in equation 5 and the effect
of the GNP deflator on the export price index in equation 11.

It would

be (in a loose sense) double counting to have the export price index of
a country also be affected by the export prices of other countries through

their effect on the world price index. Again, this treatment, which at
best provides only a rough approximation to the truth, is dictated by
the use of the aggregated data.

49

Summary

This completes the discussion of the estimated equations. Given the
poor quality of much of the data, especially for the non industrial coun-

tries, the results do not seem too bad. The least precise estimates in
terms of t—statistics are those for the interest rate and exchange rate

reaction functions, which are based on relatively few observations. Even
for these equations, however, the results do not seem unreasonable. In
particular, it is encouraging that a number of explanatory variables were
found to be significant (by conventional standards) in the exchange rate
equations aside from the lagged dependent variable and the German exchange
rate.

IV. The Predictive Accuracy of the Model
The evaluation of macroeconometric models is a difficult problem.
Any model is likely to be only an approximation to the true structure
of the economy, and one would like to choose that model that provides

the best approximation. The problem is deciding what one means by best
approximation. It is difficult to compare the fit of one model to the
fit of another because models differ in the number and types of variables

that are taken to be exogenous. Also, there is a serious danger of data
mining with macro time series data, and it is not easy to control for
this. A model may be poorly specified (i.e., a bad approximation to the
true structure) but fit the data well because of data mining.
I have recently proposed a method (Fair (l980a)) that I think can

be used in the long run to compare alternative models. The method provides estimates of forecast error variances that take into account the

four main sources of uncertainty: uncertainty due to the error terms,

50

the coefficient estimates, the exogenous—variable forecasts, and the pos-

sible misspecificatlon of the model. It puts each model on an equal
footing and so allows comparisons to be made across models. The method
is unfortunately expensive to use, since it is based on successive re—
estimation and stochastic simulation of the model, and it is beyond the
computer budget for this project to apply it to the model.
Because this method has not been used, this paper provides no rigorous

comparison of the present model to other models. What was done instead
is the following. Three eight—quarter prediction periods were chosen:
a fixed exchange rate period, 19701—l9711v, and two flexible rate periods,

19741—19751v and 19761—l977IV. For each of these periods both static
and dynamic predictions were generated using the actual values of the

exogenous variables.9 Root mean squared errors (RNSEs) were computed
for each endogenous variable for each run. The same procedure was followed
for what will be called the "autoregressive" model. For the autoregressive model each of the variables on the left hand side of a stochastic
equation in the regular model is regressed on a constant, time, three
seasonal dummy variables, and the first four lagged values of the left

hand side variable. The autoregressive model consists of a set of completely unrelated equations. The predictions and errors in one equation
have no effect on any of the other equations. The same estimation periods
were used for this model as were used for the regular model. The variables

9The model was solved using the Fair—Parke (1981) program, which uses
the Gauss—Seidel technique. Iteration occurs for a given quarter both
within the countries (the Table 2 part of the model) and among countries
(the Table 3 calculations). Convergence was generally quite rapid, requiring between about 3 and 7 Table 3 calculations per quarter. The
approximate time on the IBM 370—158 at Yale for one eight—quarter simulation of the complete model (including the U.S. model) was 3.5 minutes.

51

explained by definitions in the regular model are not part of the autoregressive model.

The results are presented in Tables 5, 6, and 7.

For the results

in Table 5 a weighted average of the RNSEs across all countries except
the U.S. was taken for each variable. The RI1SEs were weighted by the

ratio of the country's real GNP (in 75$ )

in

the last (i.e., eighth)

quarter of the prediction period to the total real GNP of all the coun-

tries. This provides a summary measure of the overall fit of the model
with respect to each variable. The RNSEs of the individual countries
are presented in Table 6 for one run, the dynamic simulation for the

period l9741—l975IV. This is the period of the large increase in the
price of oil by OPEC and is not a particularly easy period to explain.
The RMSEs for the U.S. are presented in Table 7.
Each number in parentheses in Tables 5 and 6 is the ratio of the ENSE

to the corresponding RMSE for the autoregressive model. Two of the variables

in the tables, PM and X75$ ,

are

explained by definitions in the regular

model, and so no RMSEs from the autoregressive model are available for these.
Each number in parentheses in Table 7 is the ratio of the RNSE to the corresponding EMSE when the rest of the world is taken to be exogenous from the
point of view of the U.S.

The following general conclusions can be drawn from Table 5.

(1) The

model is the same as or less accurate than the autoregressive model for

GNP and its two major components, consumption and investment. It is the
same as or more accurate than the autoregressive model for the GNP deflator, the two interest rates, the exchange rate, imports, and the price

of exports. The two models are about the same for the money supply.

the autoregressive model is l9741—19751V.

(3) In going from a static

simulation to a dynamic simulation, the accuracy of the model improves
relative to that for the autoregressive model for the 19741—l9751V period.

The relative accuracy worsens for the 19701—l97lIV period. It is about
the same for the 19761—19771v period.
The RI4SEs in Table 6 give a general idea of how well the model ex—

plains the individual countries. The RNSEs are generally larger for the
smaller countries, which is as expected given, among other things, the
poor quality of much of the data for the smaller countries.
The main conclusion to be drawn from the results for the U.S. in
Table 7 is that the fit of the U.S. model is not very sensitive to whether
or not the U.S. model is included in the overall model, i.e., to whether
or not the rest of the world is taken to be exogenous in the U.S. model.
Note also that the U.S. RNSEs for a given variable are generally much

smaller than the corresponding RNSEs for the other countries in Table 5.
Although the results in this section give one a general idea of the
accuracy of the model, they do not, as mentioned above, provide a test

of the model. It is unclear how the model would compare to the autore—
gressive model if the method in Fair (1980a) were used.
This method takes into account exogenous variable uncertainty, whereas
the procedure followed in this section does not, which biases the current

results against the autoregressive model. The autoregressive model has
no non trivial exogenous variables. The important exogenous variables in
the regular model are the government spending variable

(G.e) and the

price of exports of the oil exporting countries. On the other hand, the

10The U.S. model is compared to an autoregressive model in Fair (1980a),
and so no comparisons of this kind are presented here.

56

autoregressive model may be more misspecified than the regular model,
which would bias the current results, which are all within sample,

against the regular model. The method has been used to compare the
U.S. model and an autoregressive model (Fair (l9SOa)), and the results
in general indicate that the autoregressive model is more misspecified.
In future work it will be of interest to use the method to compare
the present model not only to the autoregressive model but also to
other structural models.

V.

The Properties of the Model
A useful way of examining the properties of the model is to consider

the effects of changing government policy variables. The results of one
experiment are reported In this section: an increase in the purchase of
U.S. goods by the U.S. government. This experiment was performed in both
a fixed exchange rate period (l9701—197l1v) and a flexible rate period

(l9761—19771v). The results of other experiments are reported in a
sequel to this paper, Fair (1981). This paper provides much mote discussion of the properties of the model than space limitations allow in
this section.

Before discussing the results of the experiment, it will be useful

to explain some of the ceteris aribus effects in the model. In what
follows a variable is said to have a "direct" effect on another variable
if it appears on the right hand side of the equation (either a stochastic

equation or a definition) explaining the other variable. Most endogenous
variables have at least an Indirect effect on the other endogenous
variables——either contemporaneously or with a lag of one quarter. Because
of this, it is difficult to explain the properties of the model in a

57

systematic way. The following discussion is designed to try to give a
general idea of the properties of the model without going into every

possible indirect effect. The experiment, of course, takes all effects
into account, and so the experimental results provide a check on the less
rigorous discussion of the properties.
It should also be kept in mind in the following discussion that not

all of the effects operate for all countries. To conserve space, no distinction is made across countries. Each effect is discussed as if it
applied to all countries. All interest rates referred to in the discussion are short term interest rates unless otherwise noted.

Trade Effects Among Countries

There is a standard trade multiplier effect in the model. An auto-

nomous increase in GNP in country I increases its demand for imports,
which increases the exports of other countries and thus their GNP and
demand for imports, which then increases the exports of country i and

thus its GNP. In short, exports affect imports and vice versa.

Price Effects Among Countries

There is also a price multiplier effect in the model. An autonomous

increase in country i's domestic price level increases its export prices,
which increases the import prices of other countries, which increases
their domestic prices, including their export prices, which then increases

country i's import prices and thus its domestic and export prices. In
short, export prices affect import prices and vice versa.

58

Direct Interest Rate Effects Among Countries
The U.S. short term interest rate appears as an explanatory variable
in the interest rate reaction functions of a number of countries. The
U.S. rate is more important in the fixed exchange rate period than it
Is in the flexible rate period, but even in the flexible rate period It

has an effect on some countries. This means that an increase in the U.S.
interest rate directly increases other countries' rates. The German interest rate appears as an explanatory variable In the interest rate reaction
functions of a few other European countries, and so an Increase In the
German interest rate also directly increases other countries' rates.
Direct Exchange Rate Effects Among Countries
The German exchange rate appears as an explanatory variable in the

exchange rate equations of the other European countries. The German
exchange rate thus directly affects other exchange rates. All exchange
rates are relative to the U.S. dollar, and so each explanatory variable
in the exchange rate equations (other than the lagged dependent variable
and the German exchange rate) is the particular variable of the country

relative to the same variable for the U.S. This means that the following
U.S. variables appear as explanatory variables in the exchange rate equa-

tions: the GNP deflator, the short term interest rate, the demand pressure
variable, and the change In net foreign assets.

Direct Effects Within a Country
The short term interest rate directly affects the long term rate

(equation 8). The short term rate or the long term rate has a direct
negative effect on imports and consumption (equations 1 and 2) and a
direct positive effect on the GNP deflator (equation 5). The short term

59

rate has a direct negative effect on the demand for money and the exchange

rate (equations 6 and 9b). (Remember that an increase in the exchange
rate is a depreciation of the country's currency.)
The asset variable, which is a measure of the net asset position
of the country vis—a—vjs the rest of the world, has a direct positive
effect on imports and consumption (equations 1 and 2) and a direct negative effect on the short term interest rate and the exchange rate (equations 7a, 7b, and 9b).

The exchange rate has a direct positive effect on the price of imports and the price of exports, both of which are in units of the local

currency (equations V and 11). It also has a direct negative effect on
the price of exports in dollars (because the coefficient estimate of the

log of the exchange rate in equation 11 is less than 1). It has a direct
positive effect on the short term interest rate for three countries (equation 7b).

The price of imports has a direct negative effect on imports (equation 1), a direct positive effect on the GNP deflator (equation 5), a
direct negative effect on the asset variable (equations 17 and 18), and
a direct positive effect on the short term interest rate for four coun-

tries (equation 7b). The price of exports has a direct positive effect
on the asset variable (equations 17 and 18). The GNP deflator has direct
positive effects on imports, the demand for money, the short term and
long term interest rates, the exchange rate, and the price of exports
(equations 1, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and 11).

The level of imports has a direct negative effect on final sales
and the asset variable, and the level of exports has a direct positive

effect on these two variables (equations 16, 17, and 18). The level of

60

final sales has a direct positive effect on GNP (equation 4).

Any devi-

ation of GNP from final sales in a period is absorbed by a change in in-

ventories (equation 12). The stock of inventories has a direct negative
effect on production (equation 4).

GNP or the demand pressure variable (which is a nonlinear function
of GNP) has a direct positive effect on imports, consumption, investment,

the GNP deflator, the demand for money, the short term interest rate,
and the exchange rate.

Some Indirect Effects Within a Country
It should be clear that there are very few unambiguous indirect ef-

fects in the model with respect to sign. The signs depend on the relative
sizes of the coefficient estimates. It will nevertheless be useful to
consider the likely signs of some indirect effects, even though these signs
are not necessarily logical consequences of the model.
Consider first the Indirect effect of the exchange rate on GNP.
The main direct effect of the exchange rate is on the price of imports,

at least in the short run. The price of imports has a direct negative
effect on imports, and the level of imports has a direct positive effect

on GNP. In other words, an increase in the price of imports causes substitution from imports to domestically produced goods, which raises GNP.
The exchange rate thus has an indirect positive effect on GNP through
this channel (i.e., depreciation increases GNP).
Depreciation also lowers the dollar price of exports, which lowers the
import price indices of countries that import from the given country,
which in turn increases the demand for the given country's exports. Therefore, depreciation also increases GNP through this channel.

61

Depreciation is likely to have a negative indirect effect on GNP

through a third channel. The likely initial effect of a depreciation
on the balance of payments is negative. Depreciation raises the local
currency price of imports more than it does the local currency price of
exports, which, other things being equal, has a negative effect on the

balance of payments. Depreciation also lowers imports and raises exports,
which has a positive effect on the balance of payments. This latter effect
is, however, likely to be smaller initially than the price effect, and
so the initial net effect is likely to be negative. (This is, of course,
the "

J curve" effect.) A decrease in the balance of payments decreases

net foreign assets, which directly decreases imports and consumption and

directly increases the short term interest rate. Although the decrease
in imports raises GNP, the decrease in consumption and the increase in
the interest rate lower GNP, and the net effect is likely to be negative.
Depreciation is thus likely to have an initial indirect negative effect
on GNP through this "assett' effect channel.

Depreciation has two main indirect effects on the GNP deflator, one

positive and one ambiguous. The positive effect is through the price
of imports, which has a direct positive effect on the GNP deflator. The
second effect is through GNP. If the net effect of depreciation on GNP
is positive, this will have a positive effect on the GNP deflator through
the direct positive effect of the demand pressure variable on the GNP

deflator. If the net effect of depreciation on GNP is negative, the indirect effect on the GNP deflator is negative.

There are three main effects of the short term interest rate on GNP,

one negative, one ambiguous, and one positive. The negative effect is
through consumption. An increase in the short term rate increases the

62

long term rate. An increase in the short term rate or the long term rate

decreases consumption, which lowers GNP. The ambiguous effect Is through
the exchange rate. An increase in the short term rate has a negative
effect on the exchange rate (an appreciation), which has an ambiguous

effect on GNP. The positive effect is through imports. An increase in
the short term or long term rate lowers imports, which, other things being

equal, raises GNP. The consumption effect is likely to be the dominant
one, and so the net effect of the short term rate on GNP Is likely to
be negative.

An increase in interest rates has three main effects on the GNP de-

flator, one positive and two negative. The positive effect is a direct
one: interest rates appear as explanatory variables in the price equation (equation 5). The first negative effect is the negative Indirect
effect of interest rates on GNP and thus on the demand pressure variable.

The other negative effect is the effect on the exchange rate: the exchange
rate appreciates, which lowers the price of imports, which lowers the
GNP deflator.

The Results of the Experiment
The effects of increasing U.S. government expenditures on some of
the key variables in the model are presented in Tables 8 and 9 for the

main countries. Each number in the tables is the percentage difference
between the two— or six—quarter—ahead predicted value of the variable
before and after the change divided by the percentage change in autonomous

income. For these results the estimated residuals were added to the
stochastic equations and treated as exogenous. This means that when the

model is simulated us1g the actual values of the exogenous variables,
a perfect tracking solution is obtained. The base path before the change

63

is thus the perfect tracking solution, and so the predicted values after
the change are merely compared to the actual values.11
Consider first the results in Table 8, which are for the fixed exchange

rate period. The increase in U.S. government spending increased U.S. income, which in turn increased U.S. imports. This increased other countries'
exports, which in turn increased their income and imports. This is the
trade multiplier effect. The increase in U.S. income also led to an increase in the U.S. price level, which increased other countries' import

prices. This led to an increase in other countries' export prices, which
resulted in further increases in other countries' import prices. This
is the price multiplier effect.

The other important effect in this case is the interest rate effect.
The increase in U.S. income and prices led to an increase in the U.S.

interest rate through the reaction function of the Federal Reserve. This
offset some of the increase in U.S. income that would otherwise have occurred

and also led to an increase in other countries' interest rates. The interest
rates for all countries except Japan were higher after two quarters. This
worldwide increase in interest rates offset some of the increase in world

income that would otherwise have occurred. In the case of the Netherlands
this effect was large enough to lead to a net negative effect on GNP in
the second quarter.12

'2Some multiplier results for other multicountry econometric models are
presented in Tables 1 and 2 in Fair (1979b), and these provide a rough
basis of comparison for the results from the present experiment (U.S.
increase in a fixed exchange rate period). In general, the present income multipliers are smaller and the price multipliers are larger than
those of the other models. This is, of course, as expected, since the
other models are primarily trade multiplier models and so have weak or
non—existent price multiplier and interest rate effects.

The U.S. increase had a negative effect on the U.S. balance of payments and a positive effect on the other countries' balance of payments.
This has, other things being equal, a negative effect on other countries'

interest rates. For some of the countries the net effect on the interest
rate after six quarters was negative. This reverses at least part of
the initial negative effect of the world wide increase in Interest rates
on world income.

Although GNP Increased for all countries except the Netherlands,

imports declined for some countries. This is due in part to the effects
of higher Initial interest rates and in part to the fact that import

prices increased more initially than domestic prices. An increase in
import prices relative to domestic prices leads to a substitution away
from imported goods.

Note finally with respect to Table 8 that the money supply decreased

for many countries. Although income was higher, interest rates were also
higher, and In many cases the negative Interest rate effect dominated.
The results in Table 9 are for the flexible exchange rate period.
One key difference between the fixed and flexible rate periods is that
the U.S. interest rate has smaller direct effects on other countries'

interest rates. The changes in the other countries' interest rates after
two quarters are smaller in Table 9 than in Table 8. This means that
there is less initial offset to the trade multiplier effect from higher
interest rates in the flexible rate period.

There are four main effects of the U.S. spending increase on exchange

rates, three negative and one positive. The spending increase raised
U.S. output and prices relative to those of the other countries, both
of which have a negative effect on other countries' exchange rates (an

67

appreciation). The U.S. balance of payments fell relative to those of
the other countries (the balance of payments of other countries generally
rose), and this also has a negative effect
tive effect is the interest rate effect.

on exchange rates. The posi-

The U.S. short term interest

rate rose relative to other countries' rates, and this has a positive
effect on exchange rates (a depreciation).

As can be seen in Table 9,

the net effect can go either way. For some countries, such as Germany,
there is a depreciation after two quarters (the interest rate effect

dominating) and an appreciation after six quarters.
The changes in the price of imports are much higher in the flexible

rate period. This is, of course, due to the fact that exchange rate
changes are no longer zero. The changes in the price of exports are
also higher for the same reason. The

changes in import prices are nega--

tive for countries whose exchange rate appreciates. For most of these
countries the fall in import prices led to a fall in the GNP deflator.
In other words, the U.S. expansion generally led to a fall in inflation
rates in those countries whose exchange

rates appreciated. This is con-

trary to the case in Table 8, where the U.S. expansion led to an increase

in almost all countries' inflation rates.
The balance of payments fell for some countries in Table 9, contrary
to the case in Table 8.

If a country's exchange rate depreciates in

response to the U.S. expansion (the interest rate effect

dominating),

then, as noted above, the initial effect on the balance of payments is

likely to be negative (the J curve effect).
The rest of the results in Table 9 should be

self explanatory given

the above discussion. As a final comment, it would be possible, as some
people have suggested to me to compare the properties of the present model

68

to the properties of Model A in Fair (1979a). Model A is a "quasi—
empiricalt' two—country model obtained by linking the U.S. model to a

model exactly like it. Model A has the advantage of allowing more versions of the theoretical model to be analyzed. This may be of interest
in future work, but In general I look on Model A as merely an intermediate step between the theoretical model and the present econometric
model.

VI. Conclusion
The econometric model presented in this paper provides quantitative
estimates of the trade, price, and interest rate linkages among countries.
Some information on these linkages is presented in Section V.

Much more

information is presented in a sequel to this paper, Fair (1981).
It is clear from the results in Tables 8 and 9 that there are important
quantitative differences between the fixed and flexible rate periods,
which shows the importance of trying to model exchange rates accurately.
The models of the individual countries can be easily replaced by alternative models within the context of the overall model, and it is hoped

that this study will induce work of this kind)3 It will be interesting
to see how sensitive the properties of the overall model are to the re-

placement of individual models. As more observations become available
under flexible exchange rates, it should be possible to get more precise
estimates of the interest rate and exchange rate reaction functions, and
it will also be interesting to see how sensitive the properties of the

model are to the new estimates. Another important area for future work

131t is quite easy in the Fair—Parke program, which estimates and solves
the model, to replace one individual country model with another.

69

is estimating the responsiveness of the trade shares (the

jit

to

changes in relative prices.

In the more distant future the overall model will need to be tested

using a method like the one in Fair (l980a). A method like this should
help decide which version of the model is the best and how this version

compares to alternative models. In the meantime, the results from the
model must be interpreted with considerable caution.

DATA APPENDIX

The collection of the data for the U.S. model is described in Fair
(1976, l980b), and this discussion will not be repeated here. The data
for all the other countries were obtained from the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) tape (October 1980) and the Direction of Trade (DOT)

tape (October 1980). The following steps were involved in the construction of the data base:

1. A program was written to read the IFS tape and create for each
country all the variables in Table 1 except the variables for

which DOT data are needed: M75$A.

XX$ XX75$

.

and

M75$B.

,

PM

Most of the work in

constructing the data base was writing this program. No two
countries were exactly alike with respect to the availability
of the data, and so separate subroutines were written for each

country.1 The individual treatment of the countries is discussed
below. The output from this program was stored by country on a
tape called IFS1.

2. A program was written to read the DOT

tape

and

create the XX$..

data (the bilateral trade data). The output from this program
was stored by country on a tape called DOT1.
3.

The IFS1 and DOT1 tapes were sorted to store the data by quarter.

the IFS data in a convenient format. The information needed to write
the individual subroutines was taken from this printout. I am indebted
to William Parke for help in writing the initial program that read the
tape.

71

The sorted tapes were then used together to create the variables

mentioned in step 1. This completed the construction of the
data base.

The individual treatment of the data for each country is outlined

in Table A—i. The comments in the table

discuss any special treatment

of the country. If no comments appear for a particular country, then
all the data were available and

nothing special needed to be done. Two

standard procedures were followed for all the countries, and it is necessary to discuss these before considering the comments in Table A—i.
First, if no quarterly National Income Accounts (NIA) data were available,
then quarterly data were interpolated from annual data using quarterly
data on the industrial production index

(IP). If quarterly data on IP

were not available, then the procedure in Table A—2 was used to create

the quarterly data. One can thus tell from Table A—i how the quarterly
NIA data were constructed (if they

were constructed) by noting whether

or not IP data were available.

The second standard procedure concerns the construction of the Balance
of Payments (BOP) data, and this procedure is presented in Table A—i.
The key variable that is created in this process is BOP ,

the balance

of payments on current account. It is used in the construction of the

asset variable, At

,

for

each country. Quarterly BOP data do not gen-

erally begin as early as the other data, and the procedure in Table A—3

allows data on BOP to be constructed as far back as the beginning
of the data for merchandise imports and
When all data are available, the

exports (

M$.

and

procedure is a way of linking the BOP

and non—BOP data.

Most of the comments in Table A—i are self explanatory. Data for

Note: The annual population data that were collected for the model are
mid—year estimates. In order to apply the above procedure to these
data, the assumption was first made that each mid—year value is
the same as the average value for the year.

(See note 1 to Table 1.) For these

75

a variable were "made up" if there were a relatively small gap in an

otherwise good series. In these cases the data were usually made up by
linearly interpolating between the closest two available observations.
In a few cases quarterly data on the consumer price index (CPI) were used
for quarterly interpolations of annual data, and for France and Switzer-

land quarterly data on employment (ENPL) rather than on industrial pro-

duction were used for the quarterly interpolation of the NIA data. For
many countries only discount rate data were available for the short term

interest rate (r)

,

and these cases are mentioned in the table. For

a few countries the NIA year began other than January 1, and this had

to be taken into account in the quarterly interpolations. These cases
are also mentioned in the table. For a few countries data on real GNP
(Y) were not available, but data on the nominal NIA variables were.
In these cases, as indicated in the table, CPI data were used for the

GNP deflator. Real GNP was then taken to be nominal GNP divided by the
GNP deflator.

Quarterly population data were not available for any country, and
the procedure in Table A—2 was used to construct quarterly from annual

data. See in particular the note at the bottom of the table.
Quarterly DOT data began only in 19701, and no attempt was made to

construct DOT data before this quarter. Instead, the variables in the
model were constructed In such a way (with one exception noted below)

that no DOT data were needed in the estimation of the model. In other
words, no DOT data were used for the estimates in Table 4.

This allowed

the estimation periods for most countries to be much longer than would

otherwise be the case. The DOT data are needed, of course, for the solution of the model, and so the earliest quarter for which the model can

76

be solved in 19701. In a few cases annual but not quarterly DOT data
were available, and in these cases the procedure in Table A—2 was used

to construct the quarterly data. In a few cases no DOT data existed,
and in these cases the observations were assumed to be zero.
For a few countries no data on import prices were available, and
for these countries the data were constructed as indicated in note 1 to

Table 1 in the text. This construction required the existence of DOT
data, and this is the exception mentioned above where DOT data were needed

for the estimation work. For countries for which DOT data were used in
the construction of the import price index, the estimation period had to
begin no earlier than 19701 for the equations that relied on these data.
The links to and from the U.S. model are listed in Table A—4. The
two key exogenous foreign sector variables in the U.S. model are the real

value of exports (EX") and the import price deflator (PIN") .

When

the U.S. model is embedded in the overall model, these two variables be-

come endogenous. The endogenous variables In the U.S. model that affect
the rest of the model are the real value of imports (IM") ,

(GNPD")

,

the bill rate (RBILLU)

GNP (GNPRu) ,

and a demand pressure variable (ZJu)

The data base for the U.S. model is different from the data base for the
U.S. on the IFS tape (among other things, the real variables in the U.S.
model are in 72$, whereas the real variables for the U.S. on the IFS tape
are in 75$), and the

variables in Table A—4 are used to link the

two data sets.

The sample periods that were used for the estimation work are listed

in Table 4 in the text. The beginning of the sample period was usually
taken to be four quarters after the

beginning of the data, and the end
