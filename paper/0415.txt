November, 1979
The Impact of the Market and the Family
on Youth Enrollment and Labor Supply

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the school enrollment and labor
supply

decisions of teenagers and young adults as jointly deter-

mined outcomes. The empirical results are based on an application
of discrete multivariate analysis to a sample taken from the

Survey of Income and Education. Higher relative wage offers
are found to reduce the probability of a youth enrolling in school

and to increase labor supply. However, the estimated impacts are
very sensitive to adjustments made for the possibility that wage
rate offers by

are higher for full-time than for part-time

work. Job availability, as measured by the local youth unemployment rate, has its strongest effect on the probability of enrollment and full—time labor force participation for nonwhite males,
accounting, in the extreme, for a difference in this probability

of almost 50 percent. Since a wage measure is included as an
independent variable, we can be sure that the job availability
measure is not acting as a surrogate for an absent wage variable,

but instead has an impact of its own. Specific findings on the
influence of various family and market characteristics are compared
to those from earlier studies.

This paper analyzes the separate influences of the labor market and the
family on the school enrollment and labor supply decisions of teenagers and

young adults. For a sample drawn from the 1976 Survey of Income and Education,
the analysis considers explicitly two market signals pertaining to the rela-

tive reward for participation by the youth in the labor market. These are:
(i) the wage, and (ii) the youth unemployment rate in the relevant local labor

market, which is used as a measure of job availability. Data reflecting each
family's socio—economic circumstances are also used in the analysis. As a result1 it is possible to examine directly the impact of the family on the

youth's decisions and to separate this from the impact of the labor market

characteristics. This permits us to discern, among other things the added
worker and discouraged worker effects.
Decisions as to whether to participate in school and/or the labor force

are qualitative in nature and are jointly determined. The empirical portion
of the study uses discrete multivariate analysis, a relatively new statistical
technique suitable for analyzing jointly—determined qualitative decisions, to

estimate youth enrollment and labor supply functions. In a separate paper
(Steinmeier, 1979), it is demonstrated formally that multinoimial logit analy-

sis applied to analyze an identically specified model would generate identical

results. However, in the context of our problem, multinomial logit analysis
would be more expensive to use and more difficult to apply than discrete multi—
variate analysis.

While other studies have been concerned with various aspects of the
school enrollment—labor supply decision, there is no single set of estimates

which: (a) incorporates information on the youth, the youth's family, and the
market; (b) considers the roles of both job availability and the wage; and

—2—

Cc) uses econometric tools that would be viewed today as being appropriate for

analyzing these enrollment and labor supply decisions. As a result, the findings of these past studies—-many of which were conducted before appropriate
analytical tools were developed—-are likely to be biased, either because they
used inappropriate techniques (e.g., OLS to analyze qualitative outcomes) or
because the enrollment or labor supply relations were not fully specified, sub-

jecting parameter estimates to specification bias.1 To provide an indication
of how serious these biases may be, our findings are compared in detail with
those from the most complete and important of the earlier studies, Bowen and
Finegan's pathbreaking work (1969) and the aithitious effort by Cohen, Rea, and
Lerman (1970) .

Comparisons with results from other studies are also presented.

factors, all of which lead us to ex-

pect some differences in results, a major purpose of this study is to highlight
those areas where quantitative estimates differ very significantly from those

reported elsewhere. Equally important, it is of interest to discover which
findings from earlier studies persist.

For

those who work, we also attempt to discover how family background

and market conditions influence the propensity for part-time vs. full—time

To the extent that downwardly rigid wages prevent the youth labor marclearing, one would expect both wages and job availability to influence labor supply. If one of these measures is not included in explaining
labor supply, the coefficient estimated for the other measure may, for well
known reasons, be biased. In addition, in the alternative circumstance in
the wage is not included as an inwhich the youth labor market does clear,

dependent variable and standardized for statistically, one might find that a
measure of job availability-—such as the proportion of industries in a community that

normally employ teenagers—-is significantly related to the quantity of labor supplied. Unless the wage is held constant, findings with respect to demand related factors which normally influence the quantity of labor
supplied by operating through the wage rate may erroneously suggest that job
availability plays an independent role in influencing labor supply.

participation, and how this is related to the enrollment decision. Consider,
for example, the potentially conflicting effects of job availability on school

enrollment and the interrelation with part—time employment. On the one hand,
if jobs are readily available to young people, youth from poor families may be

able to enroll in school, supporting themselves through part—time work. With
no jobs available, some may be unable to afford school expenditures and may

drop out (Bowen and Finegan, 1969, p. 404). On the other hand, readilyavaila—
ble employment opportunities for youth may simply raise the probability of

dropping out of school and working full—time. Our findings will help to determine how young people react to this influence and to other influences of the
market.

Much of the public concern about the operation of the youth labor market
has focused on the very high unemployment rates for nonwhites and the impact

of these high rates on minority youth. In view of this concern, and also in
view of the likelihood that the labor supply and enrollment functions may be
different for young men from those for young women, we fit
for

functions

groups. While much work remains to be done, it is our hope that this paper

rollment and

fects of

a step closer to having the kind of estimates of en-

youth labor supply functions that can be used to isolate the ef-

the market and the family on the youth's enrollment and labor supply

decisions. such estimates are required if policy—makers are to distinguish
the impacts of current youth-oriented labor market programs from those of mar-

ket forces, and if they are to be able to predict the impact of proposed policies.

We begin by sketching a theoretical framework which builds on the time

in the household approach. A second section discusses the empirical specifi—

—4—

cation and the estimation techniques used. The empirical results in Section
III analyze the influence of the market and the family on the enrollment and
labor supply of the over 18,000 young people in the sample and compare the results to those from other major studies of youth enrollment and labor supply.
A concluding section discusses the relation of these results to current policy.

1. Theoretical Framework
The analytical framework builds directly on Gronaus (1977) recent model
of the allocation of time. The youth is assumed to be the decision-maker, but
the family influences the youth's decisions through a number of channels.
Utility is determined according to the following function:

V v(Z[(X +

XP[HH])1HL]IZFIEOJHJIE[EZHJ,Fam)

(1)

To preserve space, a number of structural relations discussed in more detail
in Gustman and Steinmeier (.1979) have been collapsed into V. The function Z
represents

produced

is

current commodities produced by purchased goods (X) , by goods (xv)

from time spent in the household (H). and by leisure time (FIL)

.

a function representing the current value of commodities to be produced in

future periods. It is assumed that commodities will be produced in future periods so as to generate optimal investment, production in the household, and

consumption patterns in all periods after the one under observation. The
amount of future goods available is a function of total education accumulated
up to the beginning of the period of observation (E0) and time devoted in this
period to educational activities (HE) which together determine the amount of

human capital inputs to the earnings function in futur periodsJ Education

1

Educational inputs purchased might also be included in H. But to do
so requires us to consider the price of educational goods. There is no convenient measure of the price of educational goods available for use in the empirical analysis.

—5—

(E) is also assumed to influence independently the level of utility. Finally,

Pam represents the influence of family characteristics. Family characteristics influence each of the commodity production functions listed, the youth's

preferences and knowledge of the available choice set. They may also play a
role because the youth cares about the family and may alter behavior in accor-

dance with the family's circumstances.' For convenience of presentation, Pam
has been included only once in Equation (1)

Equation (2) represents the time constraint facing the youth. It is assumed that T, total discretionary time availabler is constant.

T=HN+HH+HE+HL.

(2)

The other budget constraint pertains to goods:

P'X =

•

W•F(HNfU)

+ I.

(3)

P is the price of all goods (X) purchased in the market; W is the wage rate;2
is the hours in the labor force; U is the unemployment rate; and I is other

1

One possibility suggested by Ehrenberg and Marcus (1979) is that there
is a minimun contribution to the family required of young people from poor
households. Such a requirement may modify either the utility function, the
budget constraint, or both. If this effect is important, they note that,
where jobs are scarce, a young person who might otherwise work part—time and
attend school might be forced to drop out and look for work full-time. Goldfarb and yeazer's analysis, which utilizes a Stone-Geary specification for the
utility function, is consistent with this view. Our empirical analysis includes a test for the presence of the interaction effects between family income and the local area unemployment rate which are implied by two hypotheses,
but the interaction is fcund not to be significant.
2

Rosen (1976) has shown how to incorporate into the analysis a wage
that varies with hours supplied. He includes a measure of the total earnings
associated with different amounts of time spent at work rather than just using
the wage rate to explain time supplied to market work. Such an adjustment
would complicate but not change the thrust of the theoretical model. Accordingly, at this point we assume the wage is invariant with hours. To examine
the importance of this assumption, the empirical analysis utilizes as an alternative to the observed wage an adjusted wage which is calculated at a particular amount of hours worked.

—6—

income. For a young person, much of I is expected to take the form of transfer income from and to ether members of the family.1
Time that is actually spent in market work, generating income at the
wage rate of w is measured by F(ENIU) ,

which is less than

The difference

between time supplied to the labor market and time spent at work is accounted

for by time spent unemployed, either in job search or idle time. Since some
labor force time is spent in activities that do not generate income, the likelihood of spending some fraction of labor force time in unemployment reduces

the expected returns from labor force time.2 Accordingly, when optimal decisions
are calculated, the attractiveness of labor force participation may be èx-

pected to vary

inversely

with the unemployment rate. While many approaches

may be taken to modeling the role of unemployment as it affects job choice,
the simple specification in Equations (1), (2), and

(3) captures the spirit of

the discouraged worker effect as visualized in the labor force participation
literature.3 However, in view of the siinplifications involved, no assumption
1

A more elaborate analysis would allow transfers to vary with educational choice. This would reflect both a family's willingness to finance educational but not other types of expenditures, and the availability of governmental and other loans only to those who are enrolled in school. Another
extension would incorporate the linkage between future earnings and desired
current period consumption (see Gustman [19731 and Custman and Stafford [1972]).
2

The probability of a new entrant obtaining a job will depend on the
unemployment rate and on turnover of those who are already employed. If, for
any given unemployment rate, turnover is high enough so that unemployment is
shared by all those who are in the market, the unemployment rate may provide a
direct indication of the fraction of labor force time that a typical individual
will spend unemployed (Grainlich [1976]). For an analysis which considers the
interrelations between the minimum wage, job turnover, unemployment, and the
likelihood of securing a job, see Mincer (1976)
The model could be further modified to consider own unemployment as a

state

that involves (dis)utility that is differcnL from abc disutility of work-

ing. The differential productivity of search from unemployment rather than

search

from employment might also be considered.

—7—

is made about the specific functional form of F and therefore about how unem-

ployment time varies with total time committed to the labor force.1

Maximization of (1) with respect to the uses of time (HN UHr 'E' and
HL)f the quantity of goods purchased (X) , and Langrangian multipliers repre-

senting the marginal utility of time and money, subject to Equations (2) and
(3), yields a system of reduced form equations for each of the various uses of

tine and goods purchased.2 The equations we focus on are those for time spent
on educational activities (HE). and time supplied to the market (HN)

These

are:

UN = HN(Famfw;PfUfI;EO)

(4)

HE = HE(FamW,PfUtI$EO)

(5)

Consider now the role of stochastic elements in the model. Clearly,
utility functions are not the same, even for youths with the same set of ob-

servable characteristics. Differences in tastes for work and education arise
from factors we cannot measure, and the sane is true for the kind and amount

of parental advice. These factors serve to introduce stochastic elements into

In an analysis of the effect of unemployment on labor supply, Rea
(1974) assumes that unemployment time is not a function of time spent in the
labor force.

This procedure assumes rational decision—making on the part of the
youth. A number of objections may be raised to this assumption. One is that,
despite the intuitively appealing nature of the marginal conditions for maximization, the calculations required are too difficult for it to be assumed
that the "as if" hypothesis can legitimately be adopted. Another objection is
that in some cases the youth's activities may conflict so obviously with his
or her own self-interest that defending the rationality assumption involves
the tautological argument that if the youth acted in a particular way, there
is some goal that he or she had in mind which was being maximized. On the
other hand, it is our judgment that by using the analytical framework suggested by the theory in combination with the (relatively flexible) statistical
technique we employ, which does not require narrow assumptions as to functional form, there is a smaller probability that the results will be contaminated by serious specification error than if any available alternative approach is taken.

—8—

any parameterization of the utility function. Furthermore, there may be some
unmeasured constraints that vary from family to family, such as difference in
the conditions upon which income is transferred from the parents to the youth.
As a result of these unseen random factors, HN and HE are not completely
determined by the observed explanatory variables in Equations (4) and (5) (although they may be completely determined by some larger set of observed and

unobserved explanatory variables). Rather, HN and HE have a probability distribution for any particular set of values of the observed explanatory varia-

bles. The relation that we estimate is

Prob(HNJHE) = F(Fam,W,P,tJ),

(6)

where the dependent variable is the joint probability that a youth works HN

hours and goes to school HE hours. The estimation procedure (to be discussed
below) does not require us to specify the functional form of F in Equation
(6). For consistent parameter estimates, however, the usual assumption that
the stochastic errors are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables is neces—
5 ary.

In addition to the introduction of stochastic elements, the transition

from Equations (4) and (5) to Equation (6) involves two other changes. First
since there is no information on the nature of intrafamily transfers which

make up the bulk of the youth's income (I), it is assumed that I is a function

of family income and background. Therefore, the variable I does not appear
directly in Equation (6). The second difference is that E0 does not appear in
Equation (6)'. It is assumed that past family and market circumstances persist
sufficiently over time so that it is possible to substitute iteratively for

enrollment in each of the past years. The role of past enrollment outcomes is
then approximated by writing them as functions of current measured family and

—9—

local market characteristics. The reason we adopt this procedure is that at
least some youths may make a single lifetime educational decision. If this is
so, E and the dependent enrollment variable will be simultaneously determined.
Substituting iteratively for F0 permits us to avoid the problems that arise if
F0 is endogenous to the decision—making process.1

II. Empirical Specification and the Estimation Procedure
The Survey of Income and Education (Sn) is a large cross—section survey
built around questions from the Current Population Survey. The sample was

from April through July of 1976. We work with

observations for over

young people who live in one of the 98 largest SMSA's and who do not

SMSA, which allows us to calculate relevant labor market measures and to incorporate them into the analysis, and hence to estimate the separate influences
of the market and the family.

Activities of young people that are of interest to us can, for conveni-

ence, be divided into six mutually exclusive categories. The first major division indicates whether or not the youth was enrolled in school after February 1,

1976. Those enrolled in school fall into one of three categories; those who
were not in the labor force in 1975, those

weeks or
who

who were in the labor force for 20

less (many summer—only workers will fall in this category) , and those

were in the labor force for more than 20 weeks. For those not enrolled in

school after February 1, 1976, the three categories are: in the labor force

Evidence that the distribution of unemployment rates among areas persists over time so that current area unemployment rates provide an indication
of relative unemployment in a market in past periods is presented by Bowen and

hours,

in the labor force last year for 100

1200 hours, and in the labor force last year for more than 1200 hours.

The independent variables are categorical. Limits for each category
are chosen to correspond to conunorily used classification terms (e.g., less

than high school education, high school graduate, etc.) and/or to generate a

relatively even number of observations in each category. Independent variables pertaining to the family are as follows:

Note that since the sample was taken in the months from April through
July, including time when students may be looking for or engaged in summer
work, current status during the month of the survey may be a particularly misleading indicator of the activities pursued by the youth over the course of
the year. Therefore, we have focused on time spent in the labor force last

week question for students who work, both during the summer and part—time
while in school.

The enrollment question does not refer to exactly the same time period
as the time in the labor force question. Since there is no information on enrollment status during the past year, some people may be classified as having
part—time labor force commitment when in fact their commitment was full—time.
For example, those who went to work on a full—time basis after leaving school
in June 1975, but who did not work while in school, will not have worked more
than 26 weeks last year and most likely will not be enrolled after February 1,
1976. Therefore, they are likely to fall into the not in school, 100 to 1200
hours in the labor force category.

The numerator of the youth wage variable is calculated as the ratio of the
youth's earnings to the product of the usual hours worked per week and the
number of weeks worked in 1975. These calculated wage rates for youth are
then divided by a fixed weight measure of the average adult wage rate in the
city

where the young person lives.2
Youth unemployment in the

is measured by a fixed weight index using

national weights calculated according to age, race, and sex, and is estimated
as the ratio of time spent undmployed to time spent in the labor force in

Those who were 16 at the time of the survey are excluded because they
were 15 during some part of 1975. Legal limitations on the kind of jobs they
can hold and school attendance requirements restrict the freedom of fifteen—
year—olds to choose between work and schooling options.

The deflated wage variable measures the relative reward to working
while still a youth. The adult wage rate reflects, at least in part, interarea differences in the cost of living. Accordingly, we do not, as called for
by Equation (6), also deflate by an index of cost of living (F)

Econometric estimates used in this study are based on the discrete multivariate algorithm developed by Goodman (1968, 1971) and others for dealing
with a model consisting of categorical dependent and independent variables.

Bishop, Feinberg, and Holland (1975) discussed the approach in detail. Using
this technigue we are able to estimate the effects of variation in the independent variables specified above on the probability that a youth falls in a

given school enrollment—labor supply category. It may be shown that the discrete multivariate algorithm maximizes exactly the same likelihood function as
does the standard multinomial logit algorithm, and hence the two sets of esti-

mates must be equivalent.2 We chose to use discrete multivariate analysis because it is flexible-—i.e., it requires no rigid assumption about functional
form—-and is a relatively inexpensive technique to use for analyzing very large

data sets in a situation where there are only a few explanatory variables)
1

Similar results are obtained when an alternative measure of area unemployment——one based on the rate of unemployment at the time of the SIB survey——
is used.
2

The equivalence requires that the full set of interactions among the
explanatory variables (but not involving the dependent variable) be included in
the discrete multivariate model; see Steinmeier (1979) . The algorithm actually
used in the study assumes that family characteristics are only weakly correlated with area labor market characteristics so that some third—order and
higher interactions between these two groups of independent variables are ignored. All second—order interactions are considered, however.
In a report upon which this paper is based (Gustean and Steinmeier,
1979), for purposes of example, we solved the model specified in Equations (1)
through (3) , assuming simple Cobb—Douglas-type production and utility functions.
It

is clear

from this exercise that the underlying relations are nonlinear. An

technique which uses categorical explanatory variables, as discrete
multivariate analysis does, facilitates an analysis of nonlinear relations.

In discrete multivariate analysis, the central statistic is U2, which is
—2 times the log-likelihood function:

=

•
i=l

where

is the probability predicted by the model for a combination of values

from the actual data, and i runs over all possible combinations of variables.
Estimating an additional effect (or interaction) will tend to reduce U2, and

the significance of the effect is inferred from the size of the reduction. Under the hypothesis of no true effect, an additional estimated effect will yield
a AG2 which has a

distribution with the degrees of freedom equal to the

number of additional independent parameters introduced by the effect- If the
AG2 is above the appropriate critical point on the

distribution, the effect

(or interaction) is deemed to have a significant impact on the dependent varia-

ble. Thus, the A@2

statistic

tests the joint significance of a group of dummy

variables defining the categories of an explanatory variable. A value of the
AG2 statistic pertaining to the relation between the indicated independent
variable and the set of enrollment-labor force outcomes is reported, where appropriate, in the last column of the tables in Section III.
There are two missing data problems which the econometric procedure must

the wage rate for those who did not work

For those youths, the distribution of potential wage rates is taken

from an earnings function based on age, sex, race, and labor market (i.e.,

SMSA), and

estimated from those who did work.

A major concern in following

this procedure is that those who did not work are different from those who did
in a

systematic fashion that will lead to the results being contaminated by se-

lectivity bias.

However, tests for selectivity bias indicate that it is not a

—14—

significant problem.'
The second data problem arises because if a young person has either discontinued schooling and left home or has married and left home, characteris-

tics pertaining to the youth's parents' household are not reported. This problem is not very serious for the younger members of the group we are concerned

with, especially because the SIE reports family characteristics for young peo-

ple who are not married but are in schools away from home. However, for the
older cohorts, a larger fraction of observations in the sample have no data re-

ported on parental family characteristics. Since a youth is unlikely to leave
home and school without a means of support, those with missing information are
more likely than average to be working, at least in the case of male youth.2
Given that information on fanily characteristics is missing, one of two

courses can be taken. The analysis can be limited to those for whom a full set
of data is available. The problem with following this course is that since the
young people who leave their parents' home are likely to be those able to sup-

port themselves, while some who remain home cannot, the effect of independent

variables on school—work choice is conditional on remaining at home. Hence,

the

findings would be difficult to interpret and not representative for a typi-

cal

youth in the population. Alternatively, it is possible to estimate the

distribution of family background variables for those for whom no data are re-

ported. Estimates can be obtained by assuming that parental family income,
education, and structure are the same for the younger cohorts, for whom family
data are available for almost everyone, as they are for the older cohorts, for

whom we have family data on only a sthsetj The distribution of family charac-

teristics for the subset of the older cohort with no data reported can then be
estimated as the difference between (a) the characteristics for the

entire

older cohort, as projected from the younger cohort, and (b) the family charac-

teristics for the subset of the older cohort for whom we do have data. In
practice, we use discrete multivariate analysis to estimate separate distributions

for the younger cohorts and for those in the older cohorts who remain

home.

After adjusting for size differences among the cohorts, the probability

distribution for those with missing data is calculated as the difference. This
method of projection, which is roughly analogous to using averages for missing
observations in OLS, is not without its problems,2 but projecting the missing
data and including all observations appears to be a better choice than simply
eliminating from the sample all those who left, home.

1

This assumption cannot, in practice, be fully justified. For example,
the number of families with two parents may be lower for 20—year—olds than for
17—year--olds because the parents of 20—year-olds are older and more of them
are likely to have died. Nevertheless, in our calculations we assume as an
approximation that the distribution of family characteristics is the same for
younger and older cohorts.
2

As a result of this procedure, the effects of family background characteristics may be biased downward, especially for older youth who have left home
in greater numbers. Experimentation indicates that the estimated effect of
market factors on labor supply and enrollment is not very sensitive to the assumptions made about the relation between family income, labor supply, and enrollment within the group that has left home.

III. Empirical Results
The empirical results are organized in the following way. First, Table
1 summarizes the effects of personal characteristics——age, race, and sex——on
the probability of falling into one of the schooling-labor force groups speci-

fied. The probabilities presented in Table 1 are calculated for what we will
call a reference youth-—that is, a youth from a family with chosen characteris-

tics facing reference level labor market conditions.1 Specifically, the reference youth is assumed to be from a family with an income that is in the second
category ($lO,000—$l7,500) ,

to

have a family head with an education level that

is in the second category (high school graduate) /

to

be from a two—parent f am—

ily, and to be from a family with a head who is employed. This reference youth
faces a wage offer that falls in the second category (30
average

to 44 percent

of the

adult wage) and lives in an SNSA with a youth unemployment rate that

falls in the middle category (l3.6l7.6 percent). It is important to remember
that these data are not simple cross-tabs, but compare probabilities for different age, race, and sex groups holding family background and labor market
characteristics constant,. Tables 2A through 2F, which are presented later in
this section, examine the effects of variation of each of the independent
variables

on the probability of a youth falling into one of the work—schooling

categories.
The first six columns of each table refer to the joint probabilities of
a youth falling into one of the six school enrollment—labor force categories
defined above. The remaining six columns of probabilities are derived from

the joint probabilities presented in the first six columns. Columns 7 and 8
refer to the marginal (i.e., unconditional) probabilities of school enrollment

and labor force participation, respectively. Columns 9 through 12 deal with
the conditional probabilities of being in the labor force or in school. Col—
umn

10, for example, considers the probability of labor force participation,

given that the individual is not enrolled in school.
The conditional probabilities are computed primarily for purposes of

comparison with earlier studies. Many who dealt with this issue previously
did

not have the techniques of multinoimial logit or discrete multivariate ana-

lysis available to them, and instead took the approach of analyzing conditional
distributions.

As the discussion of Bowen and Finegan indicates, however, the

parameters of conditional distributions are by themselves tricky to interpret.2

To illustrate, consider the effect of higher family income on labor force participation conditional on being in school. This effect is composed of two

1

Three recent papers apply the multinomial logit technique to data from
the National Longitudinal Survey. One analyzes the joint determination of
school

enrollment and labor force participation (Pates and Mellow, 1978); another, changes in enrollment and employment status (Stephenson, 1978) . Neither
study includes a direct measure of the wage in examining market impact. The
third study (Ehrenberg and Marcus, 1979) investigates the effect of minimum
wage laws on employment and enrollment status. Notice that employment status
is an outcome of supply and demand interactions. Our ooncern is with the supply side relationship where the quantity measure pertaining to the labor market
is time supplied to the market.
2

Bowen and Finegan essentially combine a labor supply function conditional on enrollment status with a marginal equation describing the determinants of enrollment to derive a joint probability of labor force participation
and enrollment status. Lerman (1972) takes an analogous approach to explaining enrollment behavior. However1 while he discusses the determinants of enrollment status for youth conditional on labor market status, he combines that
with an analysis of labor market status conditional on enrollment status.

enrolled group will affect the conditional probability under consideration.
These two effects, which Bowen and Finegan call a "pure" effect and a "shift"
effect, are muddled in a conditional distribution, with the result that the
parameters of an estimated conditional distribution cannot be interpreted as
the marginal effect of an explanatory variable on the probability of a typical
individual being in the labor force.'

A. The Probabilities for the Reference Youths
Consider now the basic probabilities for the reference youth in the dif-

ferent age, race, and sex categories as reported in Table 1. It can be seen
from the data in Column 7 that the probability of enrolling in school declides

with age. The probability of enrolling in school is roughly the same for nonwhite and white males, and, other things the same, it is lower for white fe—

males than for nonwhite females.2 With regard to labor force participation,

Among those who analyze a conditional distribution, it is not uncommon
to do so simply by including enrollment status as an independent variable.
This approach assumes that explanatory factors have the same impact on work activities by students and nonstudents. See, for example, Katz (1970).
2

We should note that the same market-wide measure of job availability—a weighted average unemployment rate for all age, race, and sex groups-—implies
different levels of job availability for each group, especially for whites and
nonwhites. The level of job availability for nonwhites associated with a given
category of the unemployment measure we use is much lower than it is for whites.
This can be seen in the following table.

the rates shown in Column 8 are always higher for whites than for nonwhites

and for males than females. Labor force participation increases with age except for a slight downturn for 21—22—year—old white females. From Columns 9

and 10 it can be seen that for males, labor force participation rates for
those

enrolled in school are always below participation rates for the not en-

rolled, while this is not always so for females.
One category of our dependent variable bears a special relation to a

masure stressed by 8owen and Finegan. They were interested in what they called
the activity rate-—the ratio of those either in school or in the labor force to

the total population. The activity rate is equal to one minus the probability
of being observed in the not enrolled-not in labor force category. We report
this latter probability in Column

4.

The probability of falling in the not enrolled, full—time in the labor
force category increases with age for the four sex-race groups (Column 6)
Nonwhite youth with reference level characteristics have a much lower proba-

bility of falling in the not enrolled, full-time in the labor force category
than

do comparable white youth. White males are, in comparison with all but

younger nonwhite females, less likely than those in the other groups to be not

enrolled, part—time in the labor force (Column 5). With the exception of older
white males, the probability of falling in this category increases with age for
all groups.

13. Effects of Variation in the Independent Variables

The following six tables report on the effects of variation in the basic
family and labor market characteristics on the probability that a youth will

fall within each of the work—schooling categories, Specifically, the numbers
reported in each column are the differences in the respective probabilities if

the

characteristic under consideration alternately takes on the highest arid

lowest possible values. All other relevant independent variables are held at
the level designated for the reference group. Note that the AG2 statistic reported in Column 13 refers to all main and higher order effects, and tests for
any relationship between the independent variable and the complete set of six
outcomes for the dependent variable.

(1) Family Income. The first thing to notice is the effect of family income on the joint probability of enrolling and participating in the labor force
(Columns 2 and 3) and of not enrolling but participating (Columns 5 and 6)

Those with highest family income have a much higher joint probability of enrollment arid participating and a much lower joint probability of being in the

labor force and not in school than do those with lowest family income. As a
result, it can be seen that, for all but younger white females, differences in
family income have a bigger impact on the (marginal) probability of enrolling
•

(Column 7) than on the (marginal) probability of participating in the labor

force (Column 8). Indeed, while for other groups the probability of participating in the labor force is positively related to family income, it has vir-

tually

no relation for white males. The effect of family income on the proba-

bility of participating is smaller than the effect on enrollment because students who work part—time are counted in the labor force with equal weight with

nonstudents who work full-time year—around. The strongest effect of family income is for youths who are 19 or older, whose schooling decisions pertain to
levels

of oclucation beyond tho cusbomary minimum expected of ll young people,

and thus whose choices are not as constrained by social pressures as are the
choices of 17— and l8—year—olds. Higher family income is also associated with

a lower probability of being both not enrolled and not in the labor force (Column 4).

A positive relation between family income and

time

spent in the labor

force might be the result of a number of factors——e.g., a relation between
family income and the work ethic, the youth's preferences, and/or between fam-

ily income and family connections, which make it easier to locate a jobJ
Note also the indication in Table 2A that the effect of family income on en-

rollment is much more pronounced for minority than for majority youth.2 What
happens to those young people who would be enrolled had they been from high
income families, but who are not enrolled because their family incomes are

low? An examination of Columns 4-6 indicates that for whites, these youths
tend to be mostly in the labor force full—time; very few seem to fall into the

part—time participation or nonparticipation categories. For nonwhites, however, the story is somewhat different. For them, almost equal numbers of
youths from low income families end up in the part-time participation category
as in the full—time participation category, and a substantial fraction go into
the nonparticipation category.

In comparing the results of Table 2A to those from other studies, it
should be remembered that the family income variable and the covered sample in

our study are different from those of earlier ones. Specifically, our family
income variable always refers to the income of the parents' family. Most earlier studies either used a combined measure of family income which referred to
the parents' family if the youth lived at home or to the youth's, and perhaps
the spouse's earnings if the youth lived away from home, or they confined the
sample so that only those still living with their parents were included (as in
1

flowen and Finegan, in examining the role played by family connections,
found that young people whose parents are employed in sales occupations are
more likely to be employed themselves. See, however, Bees and Gray (1979)
2

In contrast, Lerman's (1972, p. 376) results suggest that family income
had the same effect on enrollment for minority and for majority youth.

—24—

Bowen and Finogan's analysis of 14- to 17—year-old enrolled youth)
The conditional probabilities f rpm our study indicate, first, that con-

ditional on being enrolled in school, labor force participation is higher for
those from families with highest incomes, but is only barely so for white

males. Cohen, Rea, and Lerman applied ordinary least squares analysis to a
sample consisting of 16— to 2l—year-olds living in the 96 largest S1SPi'S.

Their results and ours agree (see their Table G-ll, which is most comparable)
Bowen and Finegan analyzed labor force participation for 18— to 24-year—

olds enrolled in school. But they were not satisfied with the income variable
and were suspicious of the results. For l4—17—year—olds enrolled, they find
nonmonotonic effects of income. Labor force participation over part of the
range increased with income. Eventually, however, participation for highest
income youth fell below that for those in the lowest income classes. While
our full results pertaining to the variation of participation with each of the
four income categories are not reported here, only for enrolled white males do
we find a nonmonotonic pattern similar to the one reported in Bowen and Fine—
gan.

Our calculations of labor force participation rates conditional on non-

enrollment status are presented in Column 10. Bowen and Finegan find no important impact of family income for this group (p. 4l5), which is the way we

would characterize the results for white males. However, Cohen, Rea, and Icr—
man find a negative impact on participation (Table G—ll)

Our findings in Columns 11 and 12 point to strong positive effects of
family income on school enrollment for those in the labor force and for those

out of it. Lerman finds similar strong positive effects. However, Lerman's
findings also indicate that differences in family income have a somewhat
larger impact on enrollment for those out of the labor force than for those in

—25--

it. If anything, our findings point slightly in the other directionS
(ii) Family Head's Education. Table 2B presents the estimates of the
effects of differences in the education of the family head on the various la-

bor force participation and enrollment categories. Increases in the family
head's education have a strong positive impact on the probability of enroll-

ment for all age, race, and sex groups. There is for 17—lB—year—olds a positive impact on labor force participation as well. But for the older groups
the effects of higher levels of parental education on participation is mixed.
For nonwhite females, Table 2B indicates that the probability of being not enrolled/part—time in the labor force and the probability of being enrolled and
in the labor force more than 20 weeks are particularly sensitive to variations
in the head's education.
For those in the labor force, enrollment probabilities increase with the

head's education. Given the mixed results for those not in the labor force,
our findings concur with Lerman's observation that the head's education is

more likely to be associated with school enrollment for those in the labor
force than for those outside it.
(iii)

Number of Parents Home. As can be seen from Table 2C, the varia—

ble measuring whether there are one or two parents home is significant at bet-

ter than the 95 percent level only for males. In general, the effects on the
probabilities of enrollment and of labor force participation vary in sign

among groups. The same is true of the measures referring to the probability
of different amounts of hours worked.

(iv) Head Employed. Family head's employment status is included to con-

trol for the added worker effect. It does not have a significant impact for
males. The impact for white females is significant at better than the 95 percent level, while for nonwhite females it is significant only at somewhat more

than the 90 percent level. Both groups of females are less likely to be enrolled if the family head is unemployed. And while the effect on overall labor force participation differs between the two groups, it can be seen from
Column 6 that the probability of not enrolling and participating full-time in•

the labor force is consistently higher for those young women whose family head

is unemployed. This is clearly what the added worker hypothesis would lead us
to expect, but again, it is not of importance for young men.'
Bowen and Finegan's (pp. 399-401), findings indicate some statistically

insignificant added worker effects for 14-17—year—old girls enrolled in school,
and for 18—24—year—old young men who are not enrolled but still live at home.
For 14-17—year—old boys still enrolled, if the father is unemployed, they find

a significant negative effect on labor force participation. Our results with
respect to this variable are weak, and age categories do not correspond fully

to theirs. Nothing in our findings strongly contradicts their results.
Mincer (1966, p. 95) argues that, given a lower relative asset position

of poorer families, he expects that added workers are more likely to come from

lower income families. There is no significant interaction between family income and head's unemployment to indicate that the impact of head's unemployment

varies with family income. It is important to note, however, that the inclusion of those who have left home in the sample may have weakened the effect of

the head of parents1 household employed measure. To be sure, those who have
left home may increase their work effort if the head of their parents' house-

hold is unemployed-—e.g., they may wish to help out even though they aren't
living at home, or they may be forced to support theire1ves if they had been

receiving transfers from their parents. But it seems reasonable to expect

A portion of the added worker effect may be captured by the family income variable, thus weakening the measured impact of parental unemployment.

that a youth living away from home is probably less likely to adjust his or

her own employment status in light of the parents' circumstances than isa
youth who still lives at home. Despite this expectation, we find the effect
of a difference in parental employment status is significant for young women,

who are more likely to have left home, while it is not for young men. This
may reflect a stronger family cotmuitment to the education of the young men.
(v)

Wages. Table 2E reports the effects on the probabilities of falling

in each of the school-work categories of a difference in the observed wage
from

less than 27 percent of the average adult wage to greater than 63 percent

of the adult wage. In other words, this table represents the response of the
youth to a more than doubling of his or her wage rate. This effect is statistically significant for all but nonwhite females.

The probability of enrollment is lower for those in the highest compared
to

the

lowest wage category. The negative impact is greater in absolute terms

for l9—22—year—olds than for those 17-18 and

The relatively weak effects on the overall participation rate are accompanied by major differences in the probability of putting longer time in the

pation

These do not result in large changes in the labor force partici-

rate because the higher probability of working longer hours if a high

wage is offered is accompanied by a lower probability of falling in the part—
time in the labor force categories.

Most impor-

a In calculating these differences in probabilities, the independent verieble takes on the lowest value if the youth'a wage is less than 27% of the
average adult wage and the highest value if the youth's wage is greater than 63% of the adult wage. All other variables except age are held at
the3r reference level.

time

workj While theoretically, the market relation between wage rates and

tine spent at work (which Rosen 11976] calls the wage-hours locus) may be
positively or negatively sloped, the available empirical literature suggests a
positive relationship (see Lazear, 1977; Owen, 1978; Parsons, 1974; and Rosen,
1976)

2

A number of approaches may be taken to correct far the potential bias

arising from the influence of the wage-hours locus. Essentially, we can try to
calculate the wage that would be offered to each individual at a constant
amount of work, thus eliminating the correlation between wages and hours that

would result from movement along the wage—hours locus. One approach is to substitute

for the actual wage for full—time workers the wage distribution for

part—time workers

of the same age and sex who work in the same city where the

full—time workers live and to estimate the results for the four race-sex groups
using the calculated part-time wage distribution for those with full—time earn-

ings. When such estimates are made, we find that the level of significance for
the wage variable falls to just below 95 percent for white males and just below

90 percent for nonwhite males. The wage variable becomes insignificant for
white females and had previously been found to be insignificant for nonwhite
1

We should take note of other potential sources of bias which may lead
to an underestimate of the effect of wages on hours supplied. First, earnings
may be measured with error. Second, the aricunt of time employed may be measured with error, causing the denominator of the wage variable to be related to
the value of the dependent variable. A standard approach for dealingwith errors in measurement is to use instrumental variables. However, many of the instruments normally used——age, race, sex, residence in a city-—already form the
basis for dividing our sample into subgroups. Those pertaining to education
are inappropriate because they may be endogenously related to the dependent
variable. Third, there is also evidence that part—time work may be easier to
do than full—time work (Lazear, 1977) , with the result that unmeasured nonpe—
cuniary benefits may be negatively related to the wage rate.
2

may be argued, however, that some of the evidence suggesting a positively sloped wage-hours relationship merely reflects the existence of a posi—
tively sloped labor supply curve.

the above table with the analogous figures in Table 28, we find that while the
impact of substantial wage differences on the

ticipation is

probability

of labor force par-

very small whichever procedure is used, the magnitude of the ef-

fect of wages on enrollment probability and on the probability of being not enrolled in the labor force more than 1200 hours are both reduced dramatically
when estimated part—time wages are used instead of actual full—time wages.
These findings are consistent with a view that the estimates reported in Table
28

may have been influenced, at least in part, by a positively sloping wage-

hours locus. On the other hand, based on these results alone, we cannot be

sure that the impact of wages on the allocation of time is as small as the results using the part-time wage instrument indicate. The available instrument
for this procedure was the identity of the SNSA in which the person worked, but
this instrument accounts for only 8 to 14 percent of the variance of the re—

corded part—time wages.

Therefore, to provide a further check on our findings, we modify the estimating procedure to take into account Rosen's findings as to the estimated

slope of the wage—hours locus for women. According to his findings, the wage
increases by 2 percent for each additional 100 hours supplied. We proceed by
recalculating wage rates for all observations assuming 1000 hours worked.
Thus, if an individual worked 2000 hours, we used a calculated wage that was

20 percent below the wage rate actually observed. A problem with this procedure is that we do not know what the wage—hour locus really looks like. It
may, for example,

be discontinuous with part—time work during the summer paid

at a different rate from part—time work during the yearJ Thus, estimates

only the calculated wage. Results for white males are reported in Columns

6(b), 7(b), and 8(b) of the preceding table. The wage variable is significant
at above the 99 percent level for white males, but is not significantly dif-

ferent from zero at any standard level for nonwhite males. The only wage effect that persists for estimates in Table 2E and those reported above is that

higher wages reduce the probability of enrollment.3 These results imply that

Over some range, it is conceivable that the wage rate varies inversely
with hours worked. E.g., the wage rate paid for summer work may exceed that
paid for an after—school job.
2

We should also note that Rosen's estimates themselves may be subject
to wide error, even when applied to women. One reason is the choice of which
instruments appear in the wage—hours locus and which appear in the labor supply curve are subject to question. E.g., education appears in the wage-hours
locus,

but not the labor supply curve.

Even this finding does not hold up if it is assumed that the

estimated wage elasticities of enrollment and of labor supply are very sensi-

tive to assumptions about the wage-hours locus. Since we do not have very
good information on what it looks like, extreme caution should be exercised before assuming coefficients estimated for the wage variable represent the true
parameter values of the labor supply curve.

(vi) Area Unemployment Rate for Youth. The area unemployment rate for
youth is included to test for the effects of interarea differences in job

availability on enrollment and labor supply. Since the wage is also included
as an independent variable, a finding that the relation between job availability and time supplied to various activities is significant will mean that

job availability has a truly independent impact. This was not clear from previous studies, which did not include the wage as an independent determinant of

the quantity of labor supplied. The reason is that in these earlier studies,
the measures of job availability, reflecting as they do the demand for labor,

may have acted as a surrogate for the wage. It can be seen from our findings
in Table ZF, however, that even when wages are included as a separate explanatory variable, youth unemployment has an impact that is significant at better

than the 95 percent level for three of the four groups consideredJ The exception is white females.
In areas with low youth unemployment rates vis—a—vis those with high
rates, the probability of enrolling in school is lower for white males, non-

white males, and white females. Bowen and Finegan (p. 45O) found, in general
agreement with our results, that higher area unemployment raises the proba-

bility of enrollment for males. With the exception of a slight negative ci-

1

The estimated impact of unemployment is changed only slightly when instruments for part-time wages, or calculated wages assuming a 2 percent increase for every 100 hours supplied, are substituted for full-time wages.

for

older white males, the probability of Labor force participation is

higher in areas where jobs are more readily available.
Rowen and Finegan have set forth an argument that jobs are likely to be
particularly important for minority youth so that they could help finance

their way through school. The response of nonwhite women to greater job
availability is consistent with this view. Enrollment and labor force participation rates are higher in areas with lower unemployment. Nonwhite men,
however, appear to take advantage of readily available jobs by leaving school

to begin working on a full—time basis. For these men, the increase in the not
enrolled/full—time participation is very substantial, amounting to 40 to 48
percent of the reference probabilities of falling in this category (see Table
1) -

Bowen and Finegan found, before correcting their results for the effects

of those who shift employment status, that labor force participation for those

not enrolled responded more to differences in job availability than did labor
force participation for those enrolled (p. 424) .

Similarly,

Cohen, flea, and

Lerman found lower unemployment associated with greater labor force participation for those not enrolled, with the same relationship holding weakly between

areas with the highest and lowest unemployment rates for those enrolled. With
regard to the probability of enrollment conditional on participation, Lerman
found for those in the labor force, higher unemployment is associated with
greater school participation, while for those not in the labor force, he found

no significant effect of unemployment on enrollment. In general, our results
for the various conditional probabilities, as presented in Columns 9 throu9h

12 of Table 2F, are mixed. They tend to support the findings of the other
studies cited for some sex—race categories, but not for others.

IV. Summary and Implications
This study has used a relatively new statistical technique, discrete

multivariate analysis, to estimate in a simultaneous framework the effects of
family background and labor market conditions on the enrollment choices by

youth and on the time they supply to the labor market. Where possible, findings have been compared to those from earlier studies, with similarities and
differences pointed out.
Parental income and the education of the head of the family have much
stronger effects than either the number of parents living at home or the head's

employment status. Added

worker

effects are found for young women but not for

young men.

No matter what wage measure is used, higher relative wage offers seem to
reduce the probability of the youth enrolling in school, but the size of the
estimated impact of wage on enrollment, and the impact on labor supply are very
sensitive to whether or not adjustments are made for the possibility that wage

rate offers by firms are higher for full-time than for part—tine work. If estimates of labor supply curves obtained by others, especially for secondary
workers, are as sensitive to the treatment of the wage variable as our results
indicate they are, great caution and a clear awareness of the potential variance in estimated results is called for before applying them to the design of
public policy programs.
Job availability, as measured by youth unemployment, does seem to influence youth labor supply, with the strongest effect on the labor supply for

nonwhite males. The results suggest that nonwhite males in low unemployment
areas will be in the labor force full-time 40 to almost 50 percent more often

than will similar males in high unemployment areas. Moreover, since a wage
measure is included as an independent variable, we can be sure that the job

—39—

availability measure is not acting as a surrogate for an absent wage

variable,

but instead has an impact of its own.
Youth-oriented labor market experiments have been proposed and conducted
in the past, and some are in progress (e.g., the Youth Entitlement Incentive
Pilot Project) .

Income and substitution effects of the changes brought about

by these programs may be calculated and used to make projections of program

impact. Our findings suggest that job availability may play a direct role in
influencing the budget constraint facing the youth. Accordingly, explicit consideration should be given to the role of job availability when calculating income and substitution effects, and in making national projections based on results pertaining to a particular site.
Further developments along the lines pursued here may make it easier to
estimate the impact of interarea or intertemporal differences in market condi—
-

tions

on school enrollment and youth labor supply. This may be especially

helpful in evaluating experiments which implement different school or job pro-

grams in different cities. Results such as those developed in this paper can
aid in separating out that part of the outcomes of these programs (e.g., drop-

out rates or school continuation rates) due to the impact of the program from
that part which arises merely because market conditions vary among the various

cities in which the experiment is being conducted. Moreover, in the case of
experiments like the Youth Entitlement Project, which saturate the labor mar-

ket with jobs for young people, there is a special need to estimate, based on
information from outside of the experiment, what enrollment and labor supply
would have been in the absence of the program.
The supply curve we have estimated constitutes one of the structural
equations in a model of the effects of the minimum wage on youth labor market

activities and enrollment behavior. 1

In concluding, it is appropriate to note

that while our findings are consistent with a View that minimum wages discourage labor market activity and increase school enrollment, they are not themselves sufficient to generate such a result.

The likely importance of job rationing in a model of the impact of
minimum wages has been recognized by Welch (1974)',. Mincer (1976), Gramlich
(1976), and others. Interactions between school and work and their implications for the measured impact of the minimum wage have been examined by
Ehrenberg and Marcus (1979), Leighton and Mincer (1979), and Mattila (1978).
