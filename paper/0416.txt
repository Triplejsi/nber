An Economic Analysis of the Diet, Growth, and
Health of Young Children in the United States

ABSTRACT
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to
which family income and education are obstacles to the provision
of adequate diets for young children in the United States. An
examination of the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reveals
the following:

1. Average nutrient intakes of young children are well above
recommended dietary standards, with the exception of iron.
2. Average nutrient intakes for children in households of
lower economic status are very similar to intakes of children in
households of higher economic status. Rates of children's growth
are also similar in these households.
3. Family income and education of the household head have
statistically significant but very small positive effects on the
nutrient intake levels of young children.
4. There are substantial effects of protein intakes on
children's height and head growth, even though protein is consumed
in excess of dietary standards. This finding and the apparent
correlation between children's growth and their intellectual development brings to question the adequacy of present protein standards.
Could American mothers, who provide very high protein diets for
their children in households at all levels of socioeconomic status
know more about what constitutes an adequate diet for their
children than the experts do?

living in homes in which incomes are insufficient to meet the
costs of procuring many of the essentials of life, particularly

I. Introduction
Interest in the nutritional status of young American children has

heightened considerably in the past decade. Nuch of the concern has resulted from research suggesting varying degrees of under—nutrition in low
income

American school1 and pre—school children and from evidence indicating

a positive association between children's growth and their intellectual development.2 In this paper we analyze the choice of diet for children.one to

the

extent to which family in-

may be obstacles to the provision of adequate diets for

American

families. The hypothesis that these obstacles are sub-

stantial underlies many government nutrition and income support programs and
has led to the Congressional mandate of two separate comprehensive national
nutrition surveys, The Ten State Nutrition Survey, 1968—1970, and the Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1971—1975.

In

a

previous paper we used the Ten State Nutrition Survey (TSNS) data to

examine the nutritional status of children up

was consumed in quan-

times recommended dietary standards and to an extent where

and mother's education were shown not to be significant (in the statistical

sense) barriers to the provision of adequate protein and calorie intakes for

children in poor American families. In the TSNS data average protein and
calorie

consumption was

stratified

in excess

of dietary standards whether the data was

by children's age, family income, or ethnic group. Protein intakes

in these cross—tabulations were consistently two to three hundred percent of

dietary standards.
In this paper we analyze the Health and
data

Nutrition

Examination Survey (HANES)

to provide further evidence on the choice of diet for young American children

and its effect on their growth and health. This paper is divided into five sections. In the following section we describe the conceptual framework and sneèifv

a general model of children's diet, health, and growth. This is followed by a

discussion of the data that includes important descriptive statistics. In
Section IV, we present the estimated econometric model. The

final

section

summarizes the research.
II. Conceptual Framework
As a point of departure we postulate that the utility of parents is a
positive function of their children's growth. That is, within the bounds of
perceived norms, parents desire heavier and taller children.3 For our analysis
it is not necessary that this desire be based on known correlations

current
health

between

period height and weight of children and their current and future period

status and intellectual development. Rather, we only argue that this

desire does exist and that parents make sacrifices or forego other pleasures
in- order to augment the growth of their

children.4

—3—
Although constrained by genetic and ohysiological factors, parents influence the growth of their children by their choice of diet for the children
and by their investment in their children's health (medical care, parental

care, sanitary conditions, etc.). The interdependencjeg among children's
growth, children's health and their diet are formalized in the following model.
We begin by relating the parent's choice of the initial diet, D0, for a
new born to birth weight, BW, which is a proxy for the infant's demand, for

food, and initial period socioeconomic influences, E, that impact on the
quantity and quality of diet.

D = f°(BW, E).

(1)

In each subsequent period the child's growth, G, is determined by genetic

and arental traits, Z, and by diet, Dci, and health status, Htl, in the
preceding period. Health status can be interpreted as an efficiency parameter
that affects the rate at which nutrients are converted into children's growth.
Formally,

(5)

In order to statistically identify certain key relationships and to make
the model consistent with available cross—section data, several assumptions

are necessary, some of which are explicit in equations 1—5. First, birth
weight is considered exogenous to our model of children's growth, diet and

health. A more sophisticated model could include birth weight as an endogenous
variable and relate it to parental characteristics, diet of the mother and socio-

economic variables. We also assume that some variables are serially correlated
(e.g., diet, household income) or constant (e.g., mother's education, parental

traits) over t and that the time increments are infinitesimal.
To isolate the role of diet as a bridge from socioeconomic status to
children's growth, we can, given the assumptions detailed above, derive the
following simultaneous equations from (2), (3), and

which specifies D, C, and H as endogenous variables. Equation (6) is basically
a technical relationship, describing how children's growth responds to diet and
health levels, given age, birth weight and

parental

and genetic characteristics.

Equations (7) and (8) are primarily behavioral relationships, explaining the
choice of diet in the household for the children, given socioeconomic constraints,
and

the

subsequent influence of diet and

growth on health levels.

The Data

HANES is anationa]. sample of the population of the United States, with

oversampling of low income families. The entire HANES sample, which was
collected between 1971 and 1975 by the National Center for Health Statistics,
contains approximately 28,000 individuals between the ages of 1 and 74.
Slightly less than 3,000 children aged 1 to 5 years were included in the sample.
Dietary intake data for the previous 24 hours were collected for children less

than five years of age by interview of the homemaker. A working sample of 2515
was created by deleting all observations (children) with missing data. The
roughly 450 children deleted from the samDle did not differ significantly from
the

working sample in

detail by the National Center

Descriptive statistics for variables collected in HANES relevant to our

analysis are presented in

Table

specifications are selected from the measures of children's diet, health,
and growth. Measures of children's growth are height, weight, and head cir—

indicative of the oversampling of low

protein intakes of 1516 and 56

dietary standards is not surprising given the similar results from the
TSNS, a sample characterized by significantly lower family incomes. Children's intakes of calcium, vitamin A and vitamin C average two to three
times recommended dietary standards in the MANES working sample. In the

case of iron, the average intake is two—thirds of dietary standards.

Further information on the nutritional status of young American children
can be obtained by examining the diets of children light for their age and
sex. In our HANES working sample the calorie and protein intakes of children

below the 10th percentile in weight for their age and sex are 1440 and 53 grams,
not significantly different from the working sample means and indicative of
more than adequate intakes of these nutrients according to dietary standards.
The mean family income for this group of light children is $8470. Unless
present and past nutrient intakes are not correlated, these numbers imi,ly that

influences other than diet may be responsible for producing

associated

the condition usually

with undernutrition. The consideration of the emprical results in the

next section will, enable us to come to firmer conclusions about the role of

socioeconomic variables in the choice of diet by arents for their children and
about the subsequent effect of nutrient intakes on children's growth.

IV. Empirical

Results

At the empirical level we have estimated several variations of our model
of children's diet, health, and growth. With the excei,tion of calories and
protein, the nutrient intake variables did not ai'proach statistical significance

on the growth equations, either because of their high correlations with rotein
and calorie intakes or because they have very small impacts on growth at the

margin. The health variables also oerformed poorly in the growth equations
in the statistical sense, apparently because these conditions have minor or
very short term growth effects that are rapidly overcome.
In the presentation of the empirical results, therefore, we etmhasize a

model with the following endogenous variables: height, weight, head circumference,

protein intake, and

calorie

and for vitamin C intake.

intake.

We also report results for the colds variable

These substantial elasticities of growth with respect to nutrients that
are consumed in excess of dietary standards is consistent with the findings of
the evaluation of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Inf ants and

Children (WIC). This analysis showed that although children in poor American

households generally consumed nutrients well in excess of dietary standards,

their growth could be accelerated by increasing nutrient intakes. In light of

Average nutrient intakes for children in households of lower eco-

very similar to intakes of children in households

households.

Family income and education of the household head have statistically

significant but very small positive effects on the nutrient intake levels of
young children in the model of children's diet, growth, and health estimated
in

this paper.

These findings are very consistent with those from a similar analysis

development, concludes that the "evidence, which still should be considered preliminary in nature, ... [indicates] that bigger is srtarter, at least

3More formally,

it could

be argued that rates of children's growth enter

the utility function in a non—linear fashion and that

(e.g.

excessive rates of growth

obesity) are negatively related to parent's utility.

4it is often pointed out that in

agricultural societies parents are very

concerned

about the size of their children because physical strength is an

important

correlate of individual output. Although a desire for larger children

in modern societies may not be based on a similar observation, there is evidence

that

the height or weight of children at younger ages correlate with their in-

tellectual develomnent and health in later years, and thus with

their

earnings.

Adjusted R2,s increased by less than .01 when the socioeconomic variables

were added to either height, weight, or head size regressions that already contained age, the square of age, sex, parent's height, birthweight and birthorder.

It should also be pointed out that the limited significance of the socioeconomic
variables does not appear to be due to colinearity with the genetic and parental

trait variables. The t—values of the socioeconomic variables do not increase
markedly even when the genetic and parental trait variables are excluded from
the children's growth equations.

8The results for the colds variable are also presented in Table 4 but are

not discussed in the text. Household income and education of the household
head are inversely related to the number of children's colds while protein and
vitamin C intakes do not have statistically significant impacts.
9Because the growth equations formed part of a simultaneous system traditional F tests could not be employed to test the individual and joint contribu-

tions of the protein and calorie variables. Results from OLS regressions indicate that protein makes a significant incremental contribution to explaining
the variance in height and head growth when added to regressions containing

the other independent variables, while calories does not. When both diet
variables are added jointly to height and head growth regressions the incre—

mental contribution is insignificant. For the weight equation, the incremental
contribution to explained variance is significant when the trotein and calorie

variables are entered individually or jointly to regressions contaning the
other independent variables.

as independent variables in the height and head circumference equations in

the final stage of a two—stage least squares process. No evidence of a non—
linear orotein effect was uncovered.
