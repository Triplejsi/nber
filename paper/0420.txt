Strict Liability Versus Negligence
in a Market Setting
ABSTRACT
Bo~h

strict liability and negJigence are efficient in the

short run when the number of firms causing harm is fixed.

Only

strict liability is efficient in the long run when the number of
firms is variable.

In general, the market price in the long run

under negligence is too low and too many firms enter the industry.
However, the optimal second-best negligence standard may result
in the same price and number of firms as under strict liability.

STRICT LIABILITY VERSUS NEGLIGENCE
IN A MARKET SETTING
A. Mitchell

pOlinsky~

There are two competing rules of liability for controlling
activities like speeding or polluting which cause harm to others.
The rule of strict liability shifts the victitn's harm to the injurer regardless of the injurer's behavior, while the rule of negligence shifts the burden to the injurer only if the injurer does
not take some specified amount of care.
Most formal analyses of strict liability and negligence.have
l
been in a non-market context like automobileacc'idents. /

These

studies conclude (or imply) that 'both rules are efficient when the
administering authority has sufficieritinformation to set the negligence standard'properly (in each 'case a defense of , contributory
negligence may' b,e required).

According to these analyses, strict

liability is efficierit because it fUlly internalizes the harm and
negligence is efficient because the injurer can be induced to take
exactly the specified amount of care and this amount can be set
efficiently~

For reasons which will become apparent, it is im-

portant to note that these models have assumed a fixed number of
injurers--for example, a predetermined number :of drivers.
Interestingly, most informal discussions of strict liability
and negligence have suggested that in a market setting negligence
may be inefficient even when the adminis,tering authority ,has perfect information.

The argument is stated clearly in a discussion

of environmental control by Richard Stewart and James Krier:
Reflecting pollution costs in product price.s •

If

-2strict liability is not imposed for the residual
damages caused by partially controlled polluting
activity, these damages will not be reflected in
the price of commodities produced by such activity.
As a resu:l-t, commodities with whose production pollution is associated will be underpriced relative
to commodities whose production causes no pollution,
resulting. in resource misallocation.

[po

This paper formally analyzes strictliabili ty and neglige;nce
in a market setting. The discussion emphasizes the impact of the
rules on the market ,price and on the number of. firms in the indusi

try.

For simplicity, the damage caused by each firm is assumed to

be determined only by that firm's "care"

(and not also by the firm's

output or the victim's behavior).ll
The argument that both strict liability and neg-ligenceare
efficient is correct in the short run when the number of firmscausing harm is fixed.

The market price in the short run is the same

under strict liability and negligence despite the fact that under
the rule of negligence firms do not bear the cost of their harmful
activity.

The argument that only strict liability is efficient is

correct in the long run when the number of firms is variable.

When

the negligence standard corresponds to the efficient level of care,
the market price in the long run under negligence is too low and
too many firms enter the industry.

However, when the standard is

chosen optimally, taking' into account the ipef.ficiency of the negligence rule, the standard exceeds

t~e

efficient level of care,

tbe price rises, and the number of firms

~alls.

The optimal second-

best standard may actually result in the same price and number of

In the long run, the number of firms is variable.

Short-Run Analysis

less production costs, external damages, and the cost of tak-

ing care:

z*, the level of care chosen by each

firm is z (see footnote 8 below).

Thus, the social optimum can be

reached under negligence if the stc.ndard is chosen properly--equal
to the efficient level of care.
III.

Long-Run Analysis

under strict liability, each firm chooses output and care to
maximize profits as indicated by (5), so that (6) and (7) are satisfied (implying at least that z = z*).

In addition, equilibrium is

characterized by zero profits:

(9)

P(nq)q -C(q) - D(z*) - z* =

o.

This is equivalent to the condition for the social optimum that
price equals average cost.

Thus, strict liability is efficient in

the long run.
Under negligence, assume initially that the standard is set at
the efficient level of care.

Firms maximize profits by choosing

output and care according to (8), so that (6) is satisfied and
z= z*.

The zero profit condition under negligence is therefore:

This has the beneficial effect of raising the output of each

firm (which was too low when

z = z*)

and of reducing the number of

firms •. The inefficiency created by inducing firms to take care
just above the efficient level is negligible since the effect on
social welfare of a marginal change in firms' care is zero at the
optimal level of care.

Thus, it is desirable to increase the stan-

dard to some extent.
There is a limit to how high the standard can be set and still
induce firms to meet the standard.

It is easy to show that the

highest feasible standard leads to the same price under negligence
as under strict liability; given this standard and the resulting
price, the output of each firm and the number of firms is efficient
under negligence.

Y

By reasoning similar to that used in the pre-

vious paragraph, it might seem, therefore, that the optimal secondbest standard should not be this high: the effect on social welfare
from lowering the level of care slightly (by lowering the standard)
would be beneficial while the effect on social welfare due to the
resulting marginal changes in firm output and the number of firms
would seem to be negligible.
is not correct.

Perhaps surprisingly, this argument

It can be demonstrated that the optimal second-

-7best standard under negligence might in fact lead to the same price,
firm output, and number of firms as under strict

liability.~/

The basis for this conclusion can be explained as follows.

It

is true that lowering the standard slightly from its highest feasible level improves social welfare through its effect on the level of
care and leaves social welfare unchanged by its effect on firm output.

It is not true, however, that lowering the standard leaves

social welfare unchanged through

i~s

effect on the number of firms

even though the number of firms was previously efficient.

This is

because the optimal number of firms given an inefficiently high
level of care is less than the efficient number of firms.

Since

lowering the standard reduces firms' costs and consequently increases the number of firms, this effect on social welfare is undesirable.

Therefore, whether the standard should be lowered de-

pends on the strength of this effect relative to the beneficial
effect on care.

Discussion

The model used here can be interpreted in two ways.

The

most natural interpretation is that the damage from each firm's output harms individuals who are not consumers of that output (e.g.,
a chemical industry pollutes a lake used for recreation).

The

other interpretation is that the damage falls on the consumers of
the firm's output but they underestimate it (e.g., food producers
sell products with misperceived carcinogenic effects).

Under the

second interpretation the model applies as it stands if the consumers are totally ignorant of the harm.

However, it is easy to modi-

fy it to allow the demand curve for the output to shift, depending

-8-

on who bears the damage.

As long as consumers underestimate the

damages, the basic results will apply.
(b)

In a sense, the problem discussed here with the negligence

rule in a market setting is that it is not possible to apply the
rule to the industry as a whole.

Courts are allowed to determine

only whether any particular f{rm is negligent with respect to the
activities over which it has control.

This is not sufficient to

correctly regulate the number of fj,:,ms in the long run since all

l

firms are acting the same way.

No firm can be held responsible for

the number of firms in the industry.
(c)

The same type of observation would apply in a non-market

setting in which there is free entry into the injuring activity.
For example, consider individuals who must decide whether to drive
to a nearby city--and thereby risk hitting innocent pedestrians--or
to not make the trip at all.

Under a negligence rule, too many in-

dividuals will make the trip even if all who do so take the proper
amount of care in driving.

The earlier formal analyses of strict

liability and negligence in a non-market context which concluded
that both rules were efficient assumed a fixed number of injurers.
(d)

A version of the entry problem with the negligence rule

also can arise in a market setting in the short run.

For example,

suppose there are a certain number of firms operating in the short
run in the absence of any regulation and that these firms have different costs of production (but, for simplicity, the same damage
functions and cost of taking care).

The rule of strict liability--

which would still be efficient with this generalization--may drive
some of the costlier firms out of business.

The rule of negligence,

however, may induce some firms which would have gone out of busi-

-9-

ness under strict liability to stay in business.

of this paper would not be affected if

each firm's total damage depends both on that firm's level of care

.If the negligence standard is' then appropriately

(f)

Some of the conclusions of this paper may be affected if

the total damage depends both on the firm's actions and the victim's
behavior

(e.g., the care exercised in using a lawn mower).

If the

number of potential victims is fixed--so there is no "entry issue"
on the victim's side--then the present results would be essentially
unchanged (putting aside the separate issue discussed in the previouscomment).

An appropriate defense of contributory negligence--

in which the firm would be free of liability if the victim did not
take his efficient amount of care--should in principle be added to
both the strict liability and negligence rules.

In equilibrium the

victim would take the correct amount of care, so the strict liability and negligence rules would operate as described in this paper.
If, however, the number of victims is variable, then in general
neither liability rule (with a defense of contributory negligence)
would be expected to be efficient.

Negligence would lead to ex-

cessive entry on the injurer side, while strict liability would en·' t ry on t h
