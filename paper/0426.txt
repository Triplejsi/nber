The Term Structure of the Forward Premium

ABSTRACT

Most studies of the efficiency of the foreign exchange market focus on a
single maturity —

usually

aone month exchange rate. However, one observes that

forward contracts of many maturities are simultaneously traded in the foreign
exchange market. The hypothesis that the foreign. exchange market uses all available
information has implications for the joint behavior of forward exchange rates of

various maturities. This paper theoretically and empirically examines these implications.

The paper proposes an equilibrium theory of the term structure of the forward

premium. By combining the theory of the term structure of (domestic and foreign)
interest rates with the hypothesis of interest rate parity, a simple expression
relating the six month forward premium to a geometric average of expected future one

month forward premiums can be developed. By assuming that the one and six month
forward premiums can be expressed as a bivariate stochastic process, one can derive

an expression for the expected one month forward premium. The theory will then impose highly non—linear cross equation restrictions on the parameters of the model.

Two methods of testing the validity of the restrictions are presented. The results
indicate that the data are consistent with the theory for Germany and inconsistent
with the theory for Canada.

Introduction

There have been numerous studies of the efficiency of the foreign exchange
(see Levich 1979 for a survey of many of these studies). However, most of these

studies focus on a single maturity —

usually

a one month forward exchange rate.

We observe that forward contracts of many maturities are simultaneously traded in
the foreign exchange market; yet there are surprisingly few studies that examine
the implications of several forward contract maturities (see Porter 1971, GIddy

1977 and Brillembourg 1978). The hypothesis of market efficiency has well known
implications for the relation between a forward exchange rate of a given maturity

and the subsequently observed spot rate. In addition, the hypothesis of efficiency
has implications for the joint behavior of forward exchange rates of various

maturities. This paper will theoretically and empirically examine these additional
implications.

Section ii will propose an equilibrium theory of the term structure
of the forward premium. By combining the (certainty equivalence) theory of
the term structure of (domestic and foreign) interest rates with the hypothesis of interest rate parity, a simple expression relating the six month
forward premium to the expected future one mouth forward premium can be de-

rived. It will be shown that the six month forward premium can be written
as a geometric average of expected future one month forward premiums. In

Section jj

it

is shown that a convenient and efficient method to extract

the expected one month forward premium can be obtained by assuming that a
general (bivariate) stochastic process generates the one and six month for-

ward premiums. The theory developed in Section ii will then impose highly
nonlinear cross equation restrictions on the parameters of the stochastic
process.

—2—
The restrictions imposed on the parameters of the model by the eco-

nomic theory are highly nonlinear. Sections IV and V discuss two methods
of testing the validity of the restrictions. Section IV provides a statistical test of the hypothesis that requires only the unrestricted estimates.

The rejection region, under the null hypothesis, is derived. The statistical
test proposed in Section V requires the restricted parameter estimates.
Maximum likelihood methods for estimating the constrained models are discussed and implemented.

II. The Economics

of the Term Structure of the Forward Premium

To develop a theory of the term structure of the forward premium, we

begin by assuming that interest rate parity holds. (See Porter 1971 for a
similar development). There is much empirical evidence in support of this
condition (Frenkel and Levich 1975, 1977). Interest rate parity states that
the expected rate of depreciation on foreign exchange equals the interest

rate differential. We can write this as:

The intuition behind these restrictions arise from the following

observations. We assumed that the CR,

a vector autoregression. That is, we regress both R1 and

against

lagged values of (R1i Re). Wold has shown the conditions under which

is valid (see Whittle 1963). If the economic agents realize this they

will use the parameters of the autoregression to generate their forecasts.
For the data to be consistent with the model the parameter values must be

restricted. These restrictions are summarized in equation (8) and
equivalently in equation (24).

IV. Econometric Tests and Results, I
The restrictions implied by equation (24)

are highly nonlinear.

There are two basic methods to test the validity of the restrictions im-

plied by the theory. The first method, discussed in detail in this section,
was originally proposed by Wald. This method requires obtaining the unrestricted maximum likelihood estimates p'

where we write A = A(tp) to indicate the dependence of A on ji.

The test

amounts to testing whether the vector h(4,) is significantly different from

the zero vector. The problem is to determine the shape of the rejection
region. The problem is intuitively solved as follows (Silvey 1975, pp. 115—
116, or Rao

1973, pp. 418—419):

To actually apply this test one needs an estimate of

from estimating (14).

For H, we numerically differentiate the 1x8 re-

parameters. Calling these estimates (1/n)B and H, the value W is

The results presented in Table 1 for Germany indicate a failure
to reject the validity of the hypothesis that the pure expectations theory

of the term structure of the forward premium is correct. The W—statistic
of 10.42 is insignificant, as indicated by a marginal significance level of

23.7 percent. The results in Table 2 for Canada indicate rejection of the
null hypothesis. The W—statistic of 21.84 is significant, as indicated by

a marginal significance level of 0.5 percent. The assumption that (Ri,R) is
stationary is equivalent to the assumption that the characteristic roots of the

matrix A are all less than one in modulus (see Sargent [1979a], p. 273). The roots
of A, using OLS estimates, were calculated and all were found to be less than one
in modulus.

V. Econometric Tests and Results, II
In the last section, we presented tests of the validity of restriction (24)

based on the unrestricted estimates. In the case of Canada,

we cannot determine the source of rejection. In this section, we shall
estimate the model with the restrictions imposed, and then compare the restricted and unrestricted models using a likelihood ratio test.

The restrictions implied by (24)

are highly nonlinear. Sargent

(l979b) proposes two alternative estimation strategies. The first method
requires estimating the first row of A, equation (l4a)

This procedure will converge if the characteristic roots of A are less than one

(24).

Hence, one (consistent) estimator of y, 6 is 4)(a, 8).

Under the restriction (24) the likelihood function in (25),
L(a, 8, y, cSifs},

becomes a function only of the a's and 8's. As

Wilson (1973) argues, maximum likelihood estimtes with an unknown V are
obtained by minimizing lvi, with respect to the a's and 8's, where

T

e (a, 8) a t(a, 8)'J
.E
t=l

where the e(a, 8), the residuals from (14) , are functions of the a's and
8's only, since they were calculated from (14) with (24) imposed.

A derivative free nonlinear minimization routine can be used to
estimate (14) under the restriction (24).

The IMSL subroutine ZXMIN,

which uses a quasi—Newton method, was used. Generally, 600 iterations
were required to obtain three significant digits. The least

squares estimates of a and

were used as starting values.

Tables 1 and 2 report, in addition to the unrestricted estimtes,
the restricted maximum likelihood estimates. In addition, the likelihood
ratio statistic, which is distributed x2(8), is reported along with the
marginal significance level.

The results for Germany indicate a failure to reject the null hypoth-

esis. The likelihood ratio statistic of 11.134 is insignificant, as indicated by the marginal significance level of 19.4 percent. The results
for Canada, a likelihood ratio statistic of 20.843 (marginal significance
level of 0.8 percent), indicate a rejection of the null hypothesis.
Not surprisingly, the results implied by the W—statistic and likelihood ratio statistic are very close (marginal significance levels of 23.7
percent and 19.4 percent for Germany, and 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent for

Canada). This is as it should be, since both tests are asymptotically
equivalent (Silvey 1970, p. 118), and the sample size is 188 observations.
Can we use the restricted estimates to locate the reason the null

hypothesis is rejected for Canada? Table 3 \presents an estimate of the
variance—covariance matrix of the restricted parameter estimates (a and )

for

Canada. Standard errors for y and

be analytically solved for in terms of a and .

The difference between the

restricted and unrestricted estimates of a and

the standard errors of the unrestricted estimates of y and

It

is interesting to note that the first restriction,

h1(p) = 0.211, is

also the largest in absolute value. Again the results are consistent between

the Wald test and likelihood ratio test.

The period being examined, April 1973 — Nay

1975,

was a time of adjustment

to a new floating rate system. It is possible that the

system

"noisiness" of the

changed over time (Hakkio (1979] presents evidence that the variance had

increased for Canada). To allow for this possibility, we split the Canadian

— 20 —

sample in two, and reestimated the restricted and unrestricted version of
the model. The results are presented in Tables 4 and 5.
For the first period we obtain a likelihood ratio statistic 21.465,

with a marginal significance level of 0.6 percent. So, we again reject the

null hypothesis for Canada for the first period. The likelihood ratio
statistic for the whole period and the first period are quite close. For
the second period we obtain a likelihood ratio statistic of only 13.302,

with a marginal significance level of 10.2 percent. Therefore, for the
second period we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore conclude that the data are consistent with the pure expectations theory of
the term structure of the forward premium——for the second period.
As before, the roots of the A matrix indicate that the process was stationary.
As shown in Hakkio (1979), the variance of the forecast error changed over

time in the Canadian case. Consequently, the data may not have been
stationary and so the econometric methodology may have been suspect.
Splitting the sample in two. presumably reduced the problem posed by

heteroskedasticity.

VI. Conclusions
Most studies that test foreign exchange market efficiency focus on
the relation between the spot exchange rate and a single maturity for the

forward exchange rate, usually the one month rate. This procedure ignores
the fact that more than one maturity currently is being traded. This
paper

extends the analysis of market efficiency so as to obtain implica-

tions concerning the joint movements of the spot exchange rate and the one

and six month forward exchange rate. Using the certainty equivalence theory
of the term structure of (domestic and foreign) interest rates and the

hypothesis

of interest rate parity, it is possible to write the six month

forward premium as a geometric average of the current one month forward

premium and expected future one month forward premiums. Testable implica—
tions are then derived by assuming that the one and six month forward
premiums are generated by a bivariate autoregression.

The hypothesis of rational expectations imposes a set of highly non-

linear cross equation restrictions on the parameters of the model. Two
different methods were then presented to test the validity of the restric-

tions. Both methods yielded identical conclusions. It was found that for
Germany the data were consistent with the theory of the term structure of
the forward premium. For Canada the data were inconsistent with the theory.
Hakkio (1979) found that the Canadian — U.S. exchange rate system ap-

peared to change over time with respect to the forecast variance.

To

examine the implications of this, we estimated the model over two subperiods.

We then found that although the data were inconsistent with the theory in the
first subperlod, the data were consistent with the theory in the second sub—

period. Due to the complex nature of the restrictions, the cause of rejection could not be fully ascertained. In addition, although the theory may
be rejected for Canada, there is no clear alternative theory that can be
accepted.

DATA APPENDIX

Weekly observations on the spot exchange rate and the one and
six month forward exchange rates were obtained for the period March 30,

1973 to December 30, 1976. The data were obtained from the Weekjy
Review of the Harris Bank. The exchange rates are wholesale bid rates
quoted in Chicago at 1:00-1:30 P.M. on each Friday. Most exchange rates
represent actual transaction prices.

Several filter programs were run to detect errors and suspect
observations were checked and corrected.
