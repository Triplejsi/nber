Exchange Rates, Money and Relative Prices:
The Dollar—Pound in the 1920's
ABSTRACT

This paper applies the analytical framework of the monetary approach
to exchange rate determination to the analysis of the Dollar/Pound exchange

rate during the first part of the 1920's. The analysis uses monthly data up
to the return of Britain to gold in 1925. The equilibrium exchange rate is
shown to be influenced by both real and monetary factors which operate
through their influence on the relative demands and supplies of monies.
Special attention is given to examination of the relationship between exchange

rates and the relative price of traded to non—traded goods. In the empirical
work the prices of traded goods are proxied by the wholesale price indices

and the prices of non—traded are proxied by wages. One of the key findings
of the paper is the estimate of the elasticity of the exchange rate with

respect to the relative price of traded to non—traded goods. This elasticity
is estimated with high precision and is shown to be .415 which provides an
independent measure of the relative share of spending on non—traded goods.
This estimate is consistent with other estimates obtained in studies of

expenditure shares. The paper concluded with a dynamic simulation which
indicates the satisfactory quality of the predective ability of the model.

This paper applies the monetary approach to exchange rate determination

to the analysis of the monthly Dollar/Pound exchange rate duingthe period
preceeding the return of Britain to Gold in 1925. The analytical framework
emphasizes that the exchange rate is influenced by real and ntrnetary factors.

Special attention is given to the relationship between the exchange rate and

the relative price of traded to non—traded goods. The estimated elasticity
of the exchange rate with respect to this relative price is shown to be about
0.4 which provides an independent measure of the relative share of spending
on non—traded goods.

The monetary approach. to the exchange rate emphasizes that, being a
relative price of two monies, the equi1ibrium exchange rate is. attained

when the existing stocks of the two monies are willingly held and that a
theory of exchange rate determination can be stated conveniently in terms

of the supply of and the demand for these monies. The equilibrium exchange
rate is influenced by both real and monetary factors which, according to
the analytical framework that is provided by the monetary approach, operate
through their influence on the relative demands and supplies of monies.1

Previous work showed that one of the important channels through which real
factors affect the exchange rate is the relative price of (internationally)
traded to non—traded goods ——

the "real exchange rate" [e.g. Dornbusch, l976b

and Calvo and Rodriguez (1977)]. In this paper we extend our earlier
analysis [Frenkel and Clements (1978)] by applying the monetary approach to

an examination of the Dollar/Pound exchange rate during the 1920tS. We
adopt the analytical framework developed by Dornbusch (1976b) with special

emphasis on the role of relative prices. In Section I we outline the basic
elements of the monetary model and in Section II we present the empirical

results. Section III contains some concluding remarks.

I. The
The key features of the model relate to assumptions concerning
(i) equilibrium in the money markets and (ii) interrelationships between
domestic and foreign prices through the condition of purchasing power parity.

price levels through terms which summarize the price structures in the two
economies.

The second link between domestic and foreign prices is provided by the

condition of purchasing power paritr. Assuming that purchasing power parity
applies to traded goods, we may express the parity as

Equation (8) expresses the exchange rate in terms of three basic determinants:
the relative price structure, the relative (nominal) money supplies and the

relative (real) money demands. Embodied in this relationship are the two
basic assumptions of money markets equilibrium and (traded goods) purchasing

power parity. As is evident the determinants of the exchange rate in (8)
include both real and monetary factors.
The discussion hitherto has not specified the determinants of the

various demands for real balances. In order to set the stage for the
empirical analysis it is assumed that the demand for money depends on real
income (y) and the rate of interest (i) according to:

(11)

of equation (11) are straightforward. For example, a rise

in the domestic relative price of traded goods results in a depreciation of
the currency, i.e. , a rise in S. The elasticity of the exchange rate with

respect to the relative price should approximate

——

the

relative share of

spending on non—traded goods. Likewise, a rise in the supply of domestic
money should depreciate the currency (raise S) with an elasticity of unity;

4

a rise in domestic income should appreciate the currency (lower S) since,
ceteris paribus, the rise in income creates a relative excess demand for
domestic money.

Finally, a rise in the rate of interest should raise S
-

since it reduces the quantity demanded of the domestic currency .

Analogous

inferences hold with respect to the effects of changes in the foreign variables.

LI. Empirical Results
In this section we apply the monetary model to an analysis of the Dollar!
Pound monthly exchange rate over the period February 1921 — May 1925-

during which exchange rates were flexible. The period is the same as in
Frenkel (1978) and in Frenkel and Clements (1978) and it terminates with

the return of Britain to gold. Details on the data and on data sources are

reported in the Appendix. Since there are no available data for the prices
of traded and non—traded goods 6 we proxied the prices of traded goods by the

wholesale price indices and the prices of non—traded goods by wages. For
(U.S. price) we used actual average hourly earnings of all wage earners7

and for P (U K price) we used an index of average weekly earnings
The use of these proxies for the relative prices permits an interpretation
of the estimate of the coefficient

in equation (11) in terms of the

elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the relative real wage rates.
Substituting the nominal wage rates w and w* for

and P, and the wholesale

price indices P and P for T and P yields in equation (11) ln[(w*/P*)/(w/P)J
instead of ln[(PT/PN)/(P/P)}. By this interpretation the coefficient 13

measures the elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the ratio of the
real wage rates, and the analytical framework implies that a rise in the domestic
real wage relative to the foreign real wage results in an appreciation of the

5

currency, i.e., a decline in S.

This positive association between the real wage

and the international value of the currency is explained by the fact that a
higher real wage reflects a higher productivity of domestic labor relative to
foreign labor.

In estimating the exchange rate equation our methodology was to estimate

an equation like ll) without imposing any of the restrictions of equality
between domestic and foreign parameters. We then proceeded to impose those
restrictions that, according to the F test, were compatible with the data.
The result of these tests suggest that the data are consistent with. the

joint hypotheses that

(i)

the domestic and foreign shares of spending on non—

traded goo&s are the same, i.e.,

(ii)

*,

the elasticity of the exchange

rate with respect to domestic income equals minus the elasticity with respect
to foreign income, i.e. fl = 1 * and, (iii) the interest (semi) elasticities

are the same, i.e. c =

a*.

The hypothesis of equality of the absolute values

of the elasticities with respect
----------=--------

to domestic and foredgn monies is rejected.8

The resulting OLS estimate of the exchange rate equation are
reported
in equation (12) with standard errors below the coefficients. An iterative
Cochran—Orcutt transformation was

employed-to account--for

first- order--serial

correlation of the residuals with p being the final value of the auto—
correlation coefficient.

_

in equation (12) are reasonably satisfactory. The

coefficient of relative prices is estimated with high precision and it

6

implies that the relative share of expenditures on non—traded goods is about

.42. It is interesting to note that Bilson (1978) estimated this share for
the U.K. and Germany during the 1970's to be .425; this estimate is also similar
to the one in Clements (1979) who, using a very different methodology, estimated
the marginal share of spending on non—traded goods in the U.S. (using recent data)
to be •37•9

The elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the domestic
money supply is 1.05 and is consistent with the homogeneity postulate that,
ceteris paribus, a given change in the supply of money results in an

equiproportionate change in the exchange rate. The elasticity with respect
to the foreign money supply does not differ significantly from zero and,
as indicated above, the data reject the restriction of equality between domestic

andforeign elasticities. IThére are three possible reasonsfor this rejection. First,

—
it

might

supplies

be due to the fact that _the definitions of the U S and the U K money
used in our monthly series are not strct1y the same.10 Second, it

might be due to the fact that the U.K. monetary series have varied much
less than that of the U.S.; the coefficient of variation of the U.K.
monetary series is about one—half that of the U.S. series. As a third reason
one should note the unique reserve currency role which was played by the U.K.
pound; as a result variations in the supply of the U.K. money might have
reflected variations in a third country's demand.

The elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the income ratio is
positive and significant indicating that, ceteris paribus, a ten percent
rise in the ratio of domestic to foreign income results in about a 1.9 percent

depreciation of the home currency. This result is in contrast with the

implicit assumption that the terms of trade between imports and exports

7

iere given. As a matter of iact, during the period of analysis the U.S.
terms of trade (measured by the ratio of U.K. to U.S. wholesale price
indices) have improved from 2.14 in February 1921 to 1.57 in J4ay 1925. The
correlation between changes in the ratio of incomes and changes in the terms
of trade and their effects on the exchange rate (along the lines suggested
in footnote 2 on page 4 above) might be responsible for the positive
dependence of the exchange rate on income.Another explanation ste

om the

distinction between current and permanent income along the lines developed by
Rodriguez (1976) in his analysis of the short—run interpretation of the
monetary approach to the balance of payments.11

Finally, the coefficient on the interest rate differential has the
expected (positive) sign but the parameter estimate is imprecise and does not

differ significantly from zero at the 95 percent confidence level. To
allow for a substitution between domestic and foreign currency we have also
included in the estimated equation the forward premium on foreign exchange
(in addition to the interest rate differential) and have experimented with

various restrictions. In all cases (probably due to the collinearity implied
by the interest parity theory) the coefficient on the forward premium did
not differ significantly from zero.
To examine how well the estimated model tracks the (logarithm of) the
exchange rate we have simulated the model dynamically using the parameter
estimates of equation (12) and taking only the initial value of the:exchange

rate as given. This dynamic simulation is a relatively severe test of the
predictive ability of the model since, in principle, the errors are cumulative.

he results of the simulation are satisfactory. The squared correlation
coefficient between actual and imu1ated exchange rates is .879, the mean
error is .007, the root mean square error is .027, and the mean absolute

8

error is .022. Theil's inequality coefficient12 (which ranges between zero
and one and which assumes the value zero in the case of perfect forecast)
is also extremely low ——

.009,

indicating the satisfactory quality of the

predictive ability of the model.

III. Concluding Remarks
In this paper we applied the monetary approach to the exchange rate to
an analysis of the monthly Dollar/Pound exchange rate for the period preceding

the return of Britain to gold in 1925. The analytical framework emphasized
the relationship between relative prices and the exchange rate and weview
the precise estimate of this relationship as one of the key results of the

analysis. The estimated elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to
the relative price of traded goods was shown to be .415 which provides an
independent measure of the relative share of spending on non—traded goods.
This estimate is consistent with other estimates obtained in studies of
expenditure shares.

The basic assumptions which underlie the analysis were the assumption
of money market equilibrium and the assumption of purchasing power parity.
A regress ion

of the logarithm of the

exchange ate

on the logarithm of the terms of

trade (proxied by the ratio of wholesale price iudices) yields an elasticity

of .897 with a standard error of .267. Thus the monthly data seems to be
consistent with the assumption that, on average, purchasing power parity

held. The estimated standard error of the regression ——

1.9 percent per

month —— indicates, however, that (as expected in an application of purchasing

power parities to monthly data) this relationship was not precise.13 The main
source for some of the mixed results in the exchange rate equation, however,
seems to lie with the assumption that both money markets have been

9

in continuous equilibria during each month of the sample period. A
useful extension would allow for a distinction between short—run and long—

run equilibria and would examine the dynamics of adjustment. it is noteworthy, however, that adding a 1aggd dependent variable to the estimated

equation did not improve the estimates ad yieldedn insignificant
coefficient on the-lagged dependent variable; thus, the process of adjustment seems to be much more complex.

Appendix

THE DATABASE

The data base is made up of 52 monthly observations on each variable

for the period February, 1921 to May, 1925. Data on the Dollar/Pound spot
exchange rate, and the United States and United Kingdom money supplies and
real incomes are taken directly from Frenkel and Clements (1978, Appendix B,
pp. 35—42).

Traded and Nontraded Prices

Wage data were used as a proxy for nontraded goods prices in both

countries. For U.S. wages, actual average hourly earnings of all wage
earners were used. This series is from National Industrial Conference
Board (1928, pp. 161—162).

Data for this series were not available from January 1922—June 1922.
We use the available data to interpolate the missing observations as follows.

First we regress the change in wages on a quadratic time trend. This yields
(standard errors are given in parentheses below each estimated parameter):

This equation was estimated with data from January 1921 through May 1925 with
a gap of six months representing the missing data.
Using the estimated coefficients we then interpolated values by setting

the period as

w is the estimated wage level.
To initialize this recursive relationship, we use the actual wage in
December 1921.

For nontraded goods prices in the United Kingdom an index of average

weekly earnings from Tinbergen (1934, pp. 105—6, column 29) was used. An
explanation of the data is available in Bowley (1929).
The wage series for the U.S. and the U.K. are listed in Table A—i.
Wholesale price indices were used as proxies for traded goods prices

in both countries. The data on wholesale prices are from Tinbergen (1934).

For the U.K. the wholesale price index is from pp. 105—6, column 21. The
primary source is the Board of Trade General Index. For the U.S. the wholesale price index is from pp. 210—11, column 28. The primary source is the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The wholesale price indices for the U.S., denoted by p, and the U.K.,

denoted by p, are listed in Table A—2.

Rates of Interest

The rates of interest are short term rates from Tinbergen (1934). For
the U.K. the rates are the day to day rate from pp. 105—6 column 17. These
rates are averages for the week ending by the 15th day of the month. For
the U.S. the rates are the call loan renewal from pp. 210—11 column 25.
These rates are averages of daily rates obtained from the New York Sun.
The rates of interest series for the U.S. (denoted by i) and the U.K.

(denoted by i ) are listed in Table A—3.

FOOTNOTES

*We are indebted to R. Stephen Hale for an extremely efficient research
assistance and to Rudiger Dornbusch and Hans Genberg for a useful discussion.

1. See, for example, Dornbusch (1976a, 1976b),

Frenkel (1976), Frenkel and

Clements (1978), Kouri (1976), Nussa (1976), Bilson (1978) and the various
studies in Frenkel and Johnson (1978).

2. For a discussion of the choice of the proper price index relevant for the
parity condition see Frenkel (1978).

In the presence of tariffs the

formulation in (7) should be modified in an obvious manner.

If domestic and

foreign traded goods are not the same, equation (7) would be modified to
become

=

AS

where A denotes the terms of trade ——

the relative price

of imported goods in terms of exported goods; in (7) the implicit value of

A is unity. In a manner that is familiar from the pure theory of international
trade the value of A depends on domestic and foreign

incomes as well as on

the various measures of commercial policies.

3. The formulation of the demands for money in (9)—(lO) assumes that
domestic bonds are the only relevant alternative to domestic money while
foreign bonds are the only relevant substitute for foreign money and thus
that the appropriate measures of the alternative cost of holding domestic
and foreign monies are respectively, domestic
In principle the spectrum of the margins

and foreign rates of interest.

of substitution could be broader

16

including the substitution of foreign bonds and foreign exchange for domestic

money. In that case the demand for domestic money would also include the
foreigh rate of interest and the forward premium on foreign exchange.

For

an elaboration see Frenkel and Clements (1978), Frenkel (1979) and Abel,
et.al. (1979).

4. The inference concerning the effect of a rise in income on the exchange
rate does not allow for the possibility that the rise in income may affect

the terms of trade X and thereby affect the exchange rate. The net effect
would depend on whether growth is neutral or biased towards one of the
commodities, as well as on the relationship between the magnitudes of the
various price elasticities (which determine the change in the terms of trade)

and the income elasticity of the demand for money. Another factor that is
ignored in the present formulation is the phenomenon of currency substitution
according to which a rise in income affects the demand for both monies with
the net result depending on the relative intensities of the two monies in
the portfolios of domestic and foreign asset—holders; see Frenkel and
Clements (1978).

5. This description of the dependence of the exchange rate on the various
right hand side variables should be interpreted with some care since in a
fundamental sense these variables are determined jointly with the exchange

rate. As a practical matter, however, outputs and the relative prices are
determined to a large extent by real factors that are exogenous with respect

to the exchange rate. The issue of simultaneity is potentially more serious
with respect to the relationship between the rates of interest and the exchange

rate. Likewise, the discussion did not distinguish whether the rise in the
rate of interest is due to a rise in the real rate or due to a rise in

17

inflationary expectations. It seems that the predicted positive association
between i and S is more likely to occur in cases where changes in the rate
of interest are dominated by changes in inflationary expectations, the
extreme case of which is of course the case of a hyperinflation; see

Frenkel (1976). In the empirical section we deal with the simultaneity
issue by employing in a two—stage least squares estimation procedure. The
exchange rate determinants in equation (11) were derived explicitly from

the previous equations characterizing the monetary model. It should be
noted, however, that the resulting determinants of exchange rate (money
supplies, incomes, relative prices and rates of interest) would also be
included in the typical "final" equation of alternative models of exchange
rate determination.

6. For a recent computation of the relative price of traded to non—traded
goods see Goldstein and Officer (1977).

7. We also tried proxying N by the average hourly earnings of skilled
males and none of the results reported below were materially affected.

8. The values of the various F statistics relevant for testing the
restrictions were all below the critical value at a conventional confidence

level. Testing the restriction that c =

restriction that 8 = 8* and that n =

F =

see Theil (1971, Sec. 3.7).

9. To allow for endogeneity of relative prices and interest rate differential
we have also estimated equation (11) using two—stage least squares estimation
procedure and employing Fair's method; the instruments were lagged values

18

of the dependent and independent variables and a constant. There was no
significant change in the estimates.

10. For the U.S. we used

while for the U.K. the available monthly series

do not include totaldeposits and thus we used deposits of the London
Clearing Banks. These banks accounted for, on average, 78% of total deposits
in the U.K. during the interwar years; see liowson (1975, p. 146).

11. In addition the results might be due to the poor quality of the income
series which is proxied for the U.S. by an index of volume of manufactured
output and for the U.K. is proxied by an interpolated index of industrial
production.

12. Theilts inequality coefficient U measures the quality of forecasts.
Denoting the series of predictions and outcomes by P. and A1, respectively,
U is

U =(P. -

and as can be seen the coefficient is bounded between zero and one and when

see Theil (1961).

13. The estimate of the purchasing power parity used two_stage—least—squares
estimation following Fair's method. The instruments were lagged values of
the dependent variables, a constant, time and time squared. For similar
inferences concerning purchasing power parity see Krugman (1978).
