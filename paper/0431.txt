Money and the Dispersion of Relative Prices

ABSTRACT

A price dispersion equation is tested with data from the German hyper—

inflation. The equation is derived from a version of Lucas' (1973) and Barro's
(1976) partial information—localized market models. In this extension, different
excess demand elasticities across commodities imply a testable dispersion equation,
in which the explanatory variable is the magnitude of the unperceived money

growth. The testing of this hypothesis requires two preliminary steps. First,
a price dispersion series is computed using an interesting set of data. It consists of monthly average wholesale prices of 68 commoditIes ranging from foods

to metals, for the period of January, 1921 to July, 1923. The next step is
the delicate one of measuring unperceived money growth. This estimation implies
the postulation of an available information set and also a function relating

the variables in this set to money creation. The function used was based on considerations related to government demand for revenue. The model receives support
from the empirical analysis although it is evident that unincluded variables have
important effects on price dispersion.

The existence of a positive correlation between absolute price level
variability and the dispersion of relative prices was observed by, for
example, Mills (1927), Graham (1930), and recently by Vining and Elwertowski

(1976). In his study of U.S. price behavior during the period 1920-26,
Mills says:

We have not however exhausted the possibility of discovering a relationship between price level and dispersion. It may be that dispersion depends upon the
violence of the price change, regardless of direction.
(1927, p. 284)
Graham finds in the post-World War I German hyperinflation an additional
dynamic element of price behavior
It is clear that with the initiation of an upward
movement in general prices a series of lags in individual prices developed, that these lags tended quickly
to disappear when stability of general prices was
reached on a new level, or when general prices fell,
but that they were nevertheless progressively eliminated
even though the general price level continued to rise.
(1930, p. 175).
This observation suggests that unexpected events may have an important role

in the determination of price dispersion. Individual prices disperse at
the beginning of an upward swing in the price level when the acceleration
is prestnnably unexpected. As inflation continues the element of surprise
wanes and prices tend to converge.

The studies cited above failed to offer an economic rationale for the

observed statistical correlation. Recently, a theoretical explanation of
the relationship between price level variance and relative price dispersion

was offered by Barro (1976). Using a localized markets framework of the
type described by Phelps (1970) and employed by Lucas (1973), Barro links
the dispersion of relative prices to the variance of the money supply.
The key elements of this model are, on the one hand, individuals possessing incomplete current information, and on the other, demand and supply in
each market reacting to relative prices as they are locally perceived.

Thus, agents are confronted with the problem of determining whether
locally observed price movements are caused by general inflation or by

shifts in relative excess demand. The larger the variance of the money
supply, the more likely are agents to attribute local price movements to

general inflation rather than relative shifts. Accordingly, as the money
variance rises local price changes induce smaller supply and demand responses.--

that is, excess demand becomes less elastic. Consequently, stochastic shifts
to local excess demand produce larger changes in individual prices, so that
the dispersion of prices across markets tends to increase with the variance

of money. In this specification of the model, in which all markets have the
same structure,

dispersion is

unrelated to the magnitude of realized money

shocks.

This paper modifies Barrots framework by interpreting each location to

be the market of a specific coodity, characterized by a particular excess
demand elasticity. Because elasticities vary across markets, aggregate shocks
affect each commodity price differently. Therefore, in this modified setup
price dispersion is positively related to the magnitude of these shocks.
The model also predicts that systematic or perceived money growth is

neutral with respect to price relationships. Accordingly, a money shock in
this model is defined to be the component of money growth that is currently

-3-

unobservable and cannot be inferred from currently available information.
Whereas the quotation from Graham suggested that sudden- -presumably un-

expected--shifts in money growth cause dispersion, in this model, unexpected
monetary expansion disperses prices only if it is, at least partially,
currently unperceived.

The main task of this study is to evaluate this hypothesis with data
from the German hyperinflation, a period of predominantly monetary distur-

bances. The period considered runs from January 1921 to July 1923. The
vertiginous monetary eocpansion initiated in August 1923 differentiates the

last phase of the hyperinflation and thus it is not included in the sample.

The theoretical framework, presented in section I, neglects some

important facets of the hyperinflation. Specifically, it ignores the foreign
exchange market and the sustained divergence between the internal and external values of the niark,1 which obviously are related to relative prices.

Also ignored in the main text are changes in the velocity of monetary

circulation. However, in a brief discussion, some general conditions are
given under which price dispersion is neutral with respect to velocity

changes. Finally, the only aggregate exogenous disturbances assumed to
be affecting the economy are periodic infusions of new money made by the
government. Real aggregate shocks are ignored .

Empirically,

they are

probably of relatively minor importance, and can be considered to be part
of the error term in the estimated equations.
The testing of the dispersion equation requires two important pre-

liminary steps. First, a price dispersion series is computed in Section II
using an interesting set of data.

It consists of monthly averages of 68

commodity prices ranging from foods to metals, for the period of January 1921

-4-

through July 1923 (31 months). Data were unavailable for the months prior
to January 1921. Next, a money growth equation is set up and estimated
in section III. To do so, both an information set available to agents
economy-wide and a functional form relating this set to money creation
are postulated and discussed. The explained part of money growth in the
estimated equation is taken as a measure of the perceived rate of monetary

expansion. Correspondingly, the unexplained part is interpreted as the
money growth rate that could not be perceived from the assumed information

set. These figures, in conjunction with the price dispersion series, are
used in section IV to test the price dispersion equation.
Parks (1977) has also tested a model of price dispersion using pre-

and post-World War II U.S. data. In Parks's model dispersion is explained
by changes in real income and the unexpected part of inflation, as measured

by the innovation in the inflation rate. In this specification expected
inflation and changes in real income are treated as exogenous variables.

He finds a strong positive correlation between unexpected inflation and

price dispersion. His tests also suggest a separate but smaller effect
of the actual inflation rate.

The present paper estimates an equation that relates price change
dispersion to the exogenous shocks affecting the economy, in this case

unperceived monetary injections. An additional monetary variable that is
theoretically relevant for price dispersion is the variance of money

shocks. An estimate for this variance is obtained from the money growth
analysis and is included in the estimation. The model receives significant
support from the empirical analysis. In particular, the variable measur-

ing unperceived money growth has substantial explanatory power for price

-5—

dispersion. The results also make clear that unincluded variables have
important effects on price dispersion. Some of these are briefly considered
in Section V.

I. The Model
The economy consists of an arbitrarily large number of physically
separated markets indexed by z.

In each location a specific commodity is

produced and traded. At each date t the agents, assumed to be risk neutral,
exchange money only for the commodity being traded in the market in which

they are currently located. At date t+1, agents change location at random
and the process is repeated. Consider now the information set available tO

the agents. It contains not only lagged values of all relevant variables,
but also current information which is limited to the local market price
and some economy-wide shared knowledge about current variables related

to money creation. Actual money growth, however, includes a random term
which is assumed unknown.

The supply and demand for commodity z assume the log-linear forms:

[M_EP]

+

(z)

(z) > a,

d >

The operator E is the mathematical expectation taken conditional on the
information available in market z at time t. For each commodity z,

P(z) - EPt is the locally perceived relative price. c(z) and

(z)

represent relative shifts to supply and demand respectively. The excess de-

mand shift, £(z)(z) -(z) is assumed serially uncorrelated, normally
distributed with zero mean and variance a

.

This

variance is assumed to

-6-

to be equal in all markets. For each z, c15(z) is the short run relative
price elasticity of supply. Disparity in the supply elasticities of
different goods follows from heterogeneous production functions. However,
in the long run relative prices are assumed fixed because of perfect substitutability on the supply side. The long run is measured here by one period,
after which all suppliers can shift to other markets.
Looking one period ahead, all the markets offer the same mean price,
but as shown below the corresponding variances differ according to the

excess demand elasticities. Because agents are risk neutral, they are indifferent between the markets and thus they choose a market for the next

period randomly. There is an additional point related to the ex-ante
variability of the individual prices. Intuitively, one would expect a
market with more price variance to be less desirable because local informa-

tion would yield price level estimates of lower precision. However, as
shown below, this turns out not to be the case.

On the demand side, the relative price elasticities are assumed constant

across markets. The demand function also includes the term Mt which
EPt
accounts for a real balance effect.
At the beginning of each period the stock of money in the economy is

increased by transfers from the government to the public. This new money
is assumed to be distributed equally across the markets. Within each market,
however, the transfers are allocated randomly among a large number of agents.

well, and therefore varies across markets.

across markets, A(z) is distributed according to a given density function

this distribution is assumed to be known.

Following Lucas (1973) and Barro (1976), the solution for prices
in terms of exogenous variables is obtained using the method of undetermined

coefficients. Given the log-linearity of the model, the solution for the
aggregate price level has the form

Observe that X(z) does not appear in (6). Since agents located in z
know this elasticity, they are able to isolate the composite disturbance

independently of X(z). Thus, while the ex-ante variance of prices depends
on the particular elasticity (this follows from equation (26) below), the
precision obtainable from the local information is independent of X(z).

The hypothesis expressed by equation (13) is that only the unperceived
part of money growth can affect price relationships. Note that the realized
values of the unperceived money growth appear in the relative price expres-

Sion. This follows from the confusion between m and Et(z). Since in
general Em m1, part of the money shocks in mistakenly perceived to be a

gate disturbance and therefore cannot be confused with a relative shift of

An empirical test of this equation requires a measure of dispersion
among prices or price indexes of different commodities.

Mills

(1927, Ch. III) discusses problems that the interpretation of this disper-

sion measure presents. For example, long run differential technological

changes will cause prices to disperse over time. One would like to filter
out such effects, because the focus here is on short run distortions caused

by incomplete current information. The problem is alleviated by using rates
of price change rather than price levels. Different trends do not affect
the variation of price change dispersion over time--although alterations

in these trends will. Thus, some of the long run relative price movements

effect can be filtered from the dispersion measure. What remains can be
considered to be captured by the random term in the dispersion equation.
The variance of the rates of change in individual prices is calculated

using equation (13) and the equivalent for t-l. This variance, defined as

This condition is the counterpart to Barro's assumption

The first term accounts for the positive interaction between the diver-

sity in elasticities and the strength of the relative shifts. A term of
this sort would be included also in the dispersion expression under full

current information. In the present case of partial information, the
fraction (1-0) appears here because agents typically underestimate the
magnitude of the relative shifts, thus diminishing their effect on price

dispersion. Because this underestimation increases with a the first

effect is a relative price equivalent of Lucas's hypothesis about the link
between the variance of the nominal disturbances and the slope of the Phillips
curve.

made to capture the different effects of

shifts in 2 have an important effect.

II. Construction of the Price Dispersion Series
This section reports the computation of a measure of price dispersion
for the hyperinflation in Germany during the period January 1921-July 1923.
The data set, consisting of 68 series of monthly averages of wholesale
commodity prices, is obtained from the German statistical yearbook, issues
of 1921/22 and 1923 (see reference under Statistisches Reichsamt). Other
series from this source, some reported only until December 1921 (7 commodities)
and others beginning only in January 1922 (21 commodities) were deleted in
order not to introduce a bias due to changes in the sample size and composition.

Prices are quoted from commodity exchanges of several German cities.4
Each series, however, originates in a single location.

The 68 commodities

include 27 food stuffs, 19 textiles and leathers, and 22 metals, oils and
coals. They are not finished goods but materials in a rather raw state.
Because weights for the different commodities are unfortunately not available, unweighted rates of price change are used.

Hopefully, the wide range

of commodities in the sample approximates the general relative price instability during that period.

The individual price rates of change are computed as the first difference

of the logarits of the prices.

III. Estimation of the Unperceived Part of Money Growth
Determinationof the unperceived component of money growth during
the hyperinflation requires a specification of the information set assumed

to have been available to the public and the functional form for calculating

the conditional expectation of money growth. Consider the expectation
conditioned on economy-wide or "global" information

This

term was

defined in section I to be the prior expectation, and is distinguished from
the posterior expectation because it does not incorporate the additional

information derived from local price observations.
This global information is assumed to consist of the current govern-

ment spending in foreign exchange units, S, the current exchange rate, e,
and one month lagged data on the money stock, price level and all other

macroeconomic variables. Not included is government revenue from taxation
and other sources, because this variable depends on the current level of
economic activity and is unlikely to be preannounced and to be widely known

contemporaneously. It is natural to assume that the part of government

-16-

expenditure consisting of the reparations to the Allied Powers was known
in foreign exchange terms. With respect to the other expenditure, the
implication is that nominal spending was observable and could be readily
converted given the exchange rate.
The prior expectation of money growth is derived from the government
monthly budget constraint, namely

= Se-

-

(1.6)

(other forms of nominal government revenue)

The superscript o indicates that the variables are not in logs but in

their original form. Equation (16) indicates that creation of high-powered
money equals the part of nominal expenditure that is not financed in some
other way.

would correspond here to the end of month money stock. The

other forms of government finance are taxes, net sale of bills, gold sold
to the public, etc.

If this other revenue comprised an approximately fixed proportion of
total expenditure over time, the budget equation above could be expressed as

M° -

(17)

M1

=

kSe

+ random term

where k (G<k<l) is the average fraction of the

expenditure financed by money

issue.

The first attempt to generate a perceived money growth series was made

using an equation of this type. Dividing (17)

through by M1, money growth

appears linearly related to Se/M1. The three variables in this ratio
are assumed currently known, and therefore this specification is consistent
with the notion that the conditional expectation can be formed using only
currently observable variables.

-17-

However, a regression of this form,5 including a constant, shows
that k was probably not constant over the period. Specifically, the
existence and pattern of residual serial correlation,6 plus some additional
considerations discussed below, suggest a nonlinear relationship between
money issue and spending during that period.
Assuming then that the fraction k is not constant over time, the

question is whether something can be said about its determinants. In
order to suggest an answer to this question, rewrite equation (17) as

random term

Equation (18) preserves the positive correlation between money growth
and the ratio of real expenditure to real cash balances, but unlike (17)

the fraction k is now allowed to vary over time.

It is now argued that

k is itself correlated with M/e and S.
To examine this correlation, assume first that S is fixed at some
value S0. This level of real spending can be financed by different mixes
of inflationary finance on the one hand, and taxation, debt issue, etc.
on the other; where the amount to be collected by money issue is expressed

as kS°.

In

the usual diagram plotting the demand for real balances as a

function of the inflation rate, ktS° is measured in

area

steady states by the

of the rectangle defined by i.t--the inflation rate--and M/e.

Consider now an increment in .

Real balances decline according to

the money demand function, and the revenue from inflation, ktS°, increases
as long as .i

is

below the rate that corresponds to a unitary demand elas-

ticity for real balances. Because real spending is constant, k increases

—18—

and hence the fraction of S° financed by other means declines.

This shift from taxation to money issue can be viewed as the policy

variable that brings about higher inflation rates. Classic works on the
German hyperinflation, like those by Graham (1930) and Bresciani-Turroni (1937),

describe an opposite direction of effect. Namely, the rate of depreciation
of the currency had a negative effect on the real yield from taxation due to
the interval of time existing between the occurrence of taxable transactions

and the actual payment of the taxes.7 The present discussion relies on the
correlation between the fraction of expenditure financed by money issue and
the inflation rate, rather than on a specific mechanism relating these two

variables. This positive correlation implies that kt and 1/(M /e) move in
the same direction. However, this coincidental movement does not hold for
all j.

When

.i

reaches the rate that maximizes the revenue from inflation

kt also reaches its highest level, and when it rises above that rate, k must

decline. In other words, the correlation between kt and l/(M/e) turns
negative in that range.
This decline in kt implies that the revenue from other sources must

go up. If tax collection and debt issue cannot be increased, (for example
due to the negative effect of inflation mentioned above) spending must be
partially financed by extraordinary means, such as sales of gold from the

Central Bank's stock. In fact, the balance sheet of the German Central Bank
shows that the stock of gold begins to decline significantly in April 1923,
after being fairly stable since 1920.8

Given this behavior of k when S is constant, equation (13) can be
approximated by the seinilogarithmic form

where b' is a positive coefficient, U' iS a random term of zero mean, and

the constant term is affected by the level of S°. In this specification, the

implicit fraction kt increases along with 1/(M/e) at lower and middle
ranges of this variable, but eventually declines when real balances fall
below a certain value.9
Equation (19) acquires more empirical content if real spending is not

fixed but rather fluctuates about a constant level. In fact, real government

spending exhibits this pattern during the period under study. From equation

(18), money growth varies positively with S. These fluctuations, which
can be interpreted as temporary deviations from a "normal level", are
assumed also to be correlated with the fraction k.-_while holding constant

which captures the longer run trend in the finance mix. The assumption here is that given relatively high costs associated with temporary shifts
in tax collection and debt issue, transitory movements in spending would be

financed primarily by adjustments in money issue. A positive correlation

between S and k would then result. However, a sufficiently high value
of S could be presumed to require extraordinary finance of the sort previously mentioned, so that kt might eventually decline.

However, the exchange rate is

not in general an exogenous variable in a money growth equation.

A correla-

tion between e and the error term u will exist via some unspecified
condition for equilibrium in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, the
cofficients in (22) do not correspond exactly to those in equation (21).

This property is not a drawback. On the contrary, the bias in the estimated
coefficients (relative to those in (21) ) reflects the part of u that can

be estimated from e. It therefore should be taken into account in cal-

culating gU
Turn now to the estimation of equation (21). There is a problem in
matching the available data on money with those on prices for the German

hyperinflation. Unlike the price series, which consist of monthly averages,
the available data on the money stock until January 1923 are end of month
figures.12

From January 1923 onwards, four quotations per month are

available. Thus, a proxy is constructed for the monthly average money
stock. For the period January/July 1923 it contains averages of the
beginning of month, end of month, and the three intermediate quotations

available. Until December 1922, the monthly averages are approximated
by linear interpolation of the end of month figures.

A further consideration arises. The estimation of equation (21)
from monthly average data on the money stock, rather than end of month
figures, means that both the current month's spending and that of the

previous month should be considered. Spending financed by money issue
during the previous month increases one-to-one the current monthly average stock but has, in general, a weaker effect on the prior month's

The pattern of the residuals from equation (23), which are reported in
the appendix, table III, suggests that their variance increased during the

as inflation progressed. A method similar to that proposed

sample period

by Glejser (1969), is adopted to correct for the apparent heteroscedasticity

procedure the variance is postulated to be determined by a set of variables

Nothing in this procedure for estimating the series of money variances
guarantees that all the fitted values from equation (26) would be positive.

Indeed, two of the fitted values have a negative sign. In order to use
the estimated series as a measure of variances, these two negative values

are replaced with the smallest positive value in the series. The series of
the square roots of these estimates are reported in column (4) of table III.

The general form of the equation is, however, robust to this transformation
of the data.

The next step is to test the stability of the coefficients in equation

(27) across two subperiods. Stability of the coefficients has particular

relevance here. If the equation is approximately stable, it seems easier to
asswne that it was known from the beginning of the period and that perceptions about money growth were formed using the same equation during the entire

sample.16 The period is divided into an approximately non-accelerating money
supply period until May 1922 and an accelerating phase beginning in June 1922.

An F-test applied to these two sub-periods yields the statistic F7 =

1.7,

with a corresponding 5 percent critical value of 3.0. Therefore, the hypothesis
of stable coefficients across these two sub-periods cannot be rejected at
the 5 percent significance level.

A regression in which the coefficients of Mt_l and e are unconstrained

produce coefficients of similar magnitude for the two variables. The F-test
for the linear constraint of equal coefficients yielded the statistic

F9 = 2.3, where the 5 percent critical value is 4.2.
V. Empirical Test of the Dispersion Equation

The tests of the price dispersion model in equation (15) are performed
using the dispersion series computed in section II and the unperceived
monetary shocks as measured by the residuals in equation (27).

If this is indeed the case, it would not be appropriate to test the model

The monetary shocks appear to have considerable explanatory power for

the 5% level but fails to be so at the 2.5% level.

Theoretically, the one month lagged money variance t.i belongs also in
the equation. However, when included, its coefficient is insignificant
with a t-statjstjc of .8.
The Durbin.. Watson statistic indicates

autocorrelated residuals, which

may be caused by omitted real variables (like changes in the pattern of

government spending,17 in income distribution, etc.) that are serially
correlated, or by the fact that the ni variable includes an estimation error.

In order to check wether the degree of significance of the estimated coefficient.s in (28) is affected by this autocorrelation, the equation is

reestimated using the Cochrane-Orcutt

technique. The results are quite

similar to those obtained before,

out this test the sample is divided first after May 1922, estimating the

equation separately for the two subperiods. This partition of the sample
is the same one adopted previously to test the stability of the money growth

equation. Then, the exercise is repeated dividing the sample at the end of
1922. The aim of this partition is cc sce how the model performs after removing from the sample the 7 months of i923, which had a much more uRstable

squares procedure with fairly weak results.

The additional structure given

to the equation seems to be rejected by the data, as judged by a higher sum
of squared errors than in the linear equation.

Observe that a value of zero for A reduces the equation to the linear

form of equation (15), in which the money variance is constant. The estimated
value for this parameter was .056 with a standard error of

.0658 The

interpretation of this result is not that the average 1/[cI(z)+o.] is likely

to be close to zero. Instead, it suggests that the detailed specification

of equation (30) is too stringent. For example, if the variance of the

-31-

relative excess demand shifts,

changes over time, this is more

of a problem in this approach, since c itself is being estimated as a
Constant.

V. Actual money growth

and

inflation in the dispersion equation

In this section additional variables that were mentioned in the literature as being related to price dispersion are tried in the equation. There
is no rigorous theoretical justification for their inclusion. Thus, only
loose verbal explanations are given.

Also, the variables related to infla-

tion are clearly not exogenous and therefore any

observed

correlation cannot

imply causality.

Actual money growth and

price

dispersion: A variable that can be

considered exogenous and, if one assumption of section I is violated, in
principle also relevant for price dispersion is the actual money growth.
Changes in the money stock can affect the dispersion of prices (even when
perceived) if the new money is spread unevenly across the economy, thereby

affecting relative demand in different sectors. This

type

of

effect was

discussed by Cairnes (1873) with respect to gold discoveries. In the
framework of the present model this type of effect could be represented
by changes in the relative excess demand variance
.

Since here the

focus is on price change dispersion, the corresponding variable in this
context is the change in the growth rate, or the degree of acceleration!
deceleration in the money stock.

This result denies the existence of any effect of relative demands following

the introduction of new money during this period. It supports the hypothesis
that money affects relative prices only if it is currently unperceived.

Inflation and price dispersion: In his analysis of price behavior during
the hyperinflation, Graham describes a positive correlation between the acceleration of price level and

the

dispersion of prices. Mills's findings in his

study of U.S. prices suggest that dispersion is positively correlated with both
acceleration or deceleration of the price level.

If the acceleration/deceleration in the price level is related to an
unperceived monetary expansion or contraction, the theory tested here predicts that the correlation mentioned above should be captured by a variable

measuring unperceived money growth. To test whether this is the

21n order to consider the effects of changes in
the velocity of money

circulation on price dispersion, I worked out a similar simple model in
which there is some current

public information about future money growth.

This information may be conveyed by political or military events that
are
believed to have implications for

the future state of government finances.

The prediction of future monetary expansion, which generates inflationary
expectations, affects the velocity of circulation in the current period.
With respect to relative prices, if the knowledge about future
money
growth is shared economy-wide, they will be unaffected by the change in

velocity. This neutral effect follows from the same mechanism determining
the neutrality of perceived

money. Since all agents share the same knowledge
and are assumed to use it in the same model to predict its effects,
they
will equally adjust their

EPt according to the change in velocity taking

place. A "one-time-junip" in all prices

therefore occurs, without affecting

their dispersion.

12Another problem stems from the form of the prior expectation, which

as it stands requires the use of end of month money stocks. See the
discussion below.

13mis effect can be seen by considering first a case where each month's
spending is spread evenly over the month, and say, it is financed only by

the issue of new money, In this

case the money stock grows linearly at,

in general, different rates within each monthly period. Then, if M_2,end
denotes the money stock at the end of month t-2, the inontly average for
t-l equals '1t-2,end +

from t-l to t equals 4

and that corresponding to month t equals

Thus the increase in the monthly average

Namely, spending evenly spread over

each month would imply equal weights for current and lagged spending in the
money growth equation.
Alternatively if spending is concentrated. at the beginning of the month,

the relative weight of lagged expenditure would be lower. At the extreme,
for example, if all spending is made only on the first day of each month
both t-l and t monthly averages increase equally by the amount of the t-1

expenditure. In this case lagged spending does not belong in the money growth
equation.

151n order to estimate the 33 variances needed to reestimateequation

(34), the m

series

were obtained from running the money growth equation

after adding the additional observation of October 1920.
16Estimation of a money growth equation in a similar context, using
the entire sample (for U.S., 1941 - 1973), was discussed and performed in
Barro (1977).
17The

magnitude of changes in the amount of

real government spending,

does not have any significant explanatory power.

was .0008 with a
C

error of .0004.

19However, the empirical implications of Sheshinski and Weiss's analysis

for price dispersion do not seem clear to me. An ambiguity arises
because of the probably positive effect of inflation on the frequency of

price changes that they derived. If the length of the observation period is
kept constant, a higher frequency of price change may diminish the measured

dispersion of price changes. The possibility of a negative effect of inflation on price dispersion in this framework can be seen in the following

example. Assume that the optimal frequency of price adjustments for all firms
is two months, and that part of the firms adjust their prices during odd-

numbered months and the rest during even-numbered months. Using monthly
data, dispersion of price changes will depend on the magnitude of price
changes corresponding to the group of firms currently adjusting prices.

Now

assume that inflation increases; as a consequence the magnitude of price adjustments.

goes

up, and also the optimal frequency is increased--say, to one per

• month. Since now all the firms adjust prices during the same month the disper-

sion of price changes collapes to zero, in spite of the larger individual price
changes.
