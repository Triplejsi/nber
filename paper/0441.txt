Effects of Minimum Wages on Human Capital Formation

-I
ABSTRACT

The hypothesis that minimum wages tend to discourage on the job

training is largely supported by our empirical analysis. Direct effects
on reported job training and corollary effects on wage growth as estimated
in microdata of the National Longitudinal Samples (NLS) and Michigan Income
Dynamics (MID) are consistently negative and stronger at lower education

levels. Apart from a single exception, no effects are observable among
the higher wage group whose education exceeds high school.

The effects on job turnover are: a decrease in turnover among
young NLS whites, but an increase among young NLS blacks and MID whites.
Whether these apparently conflicting findings on turnover reflect a distinction between short and long run adjustments in jobs is a question that
requires further testing.

EFFECTS OF MINIMUM WAGES ON HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION

capital formation

The two major avenues of human

are schooling and

job training. But the effects of minimum wages on human capital can be
quite different in the two

cases.

Theoretically, the effects of imposi-

tion, extension, or hikes of the minimums and of their coverage on

training on-the-job are unambiguous: job-training is discouraged. But
schooling may be discouraged or encouraged. Thanks to recent research,
especially that of Mattila (1978, 1979) it would appear that schooling is
encouraged by the minimum wage, an effect opposite to the expected job
training consequences.

As things stand, it seems that we do not, as yet, have any evidence
on the theoretically predictable case of job training,1 while we do have
an empirical answer to the theoretically ambiguous prediction about effects

on schooling. In this paper we try to fill two gaps: We explore the
theoretical considerations regarding effects of minimum wages on schooling,
and bring together evidence on the job training effects.

I. Effects on Schooling: Theoretical Considerations and Research
The basic question here is whether minimum wages increase or decrease
the rate of return to further schooling for youngsters at the relevant levels
of earning capacity (further schooling at this level is likely to mean
completion of high school and more up to perhaps junior college.)

1Work, in progress, by Hashimoto (1979) came to our attention after completion
of our research.

2

The same question was put forward

in

a more general form by one of

the present authors (Mincer, 1976) in terms of labor mobility: Since the
increased wage in the covered sector is an attraction but the reduced

probability of employment a deterrent, will labor on balance move to or

from the covered sector when minimum wages are imposed or raised2 The
answer depends on whether the minimum wage hike raises or lowers wage

prospects in the covered sector. Define "wage prospects" as

=

where pis the perceived2 probability of employment in the covered sector.
If

falls

(because

falls by more than the increase in wm) labor moves

out of the covered sector to the not—covered, reducing its wage (wa).

With unchanged prospects in the non—market, labor moves out of the market

as well. The flows continue, until in equilibrium

(where

is the non—market shadow wage.) It is not easy to measure p, even if a
definition of it could be agreed upon. Nor is

more than an abstraction.

W might be observed, but no one has tried to do so.
The evidence observed in the 1976 study and in a Canadian study

(Swidinsky, 1978) was the direction of movement: from market to non—
market. This direction of movement is implied by a drop in market wage
prospects, and rejects the hypothesis of their improvement via the minimum
wage.

is the "expected wage" in the covered sector, in the sense of a
expectation, if we assume risk neutrality. "Wage prospects"
are less than "expected wages" with risk aversion.

Now, if the evidence is correct, it follows that the profitability

of schooling is increased by the minimum wage hike. Let s0 be the
maximal schooling attainment of youngsters facing wages near the minimum,

so their wage prospects are .

Let s1

be the minimal schooling attainment

at which wages w are safely above minimum wages. In the simplest model,
the return to schooling is measured by w1-, and its (opportunity) cost
A
by w. A drop in w raises returns and lowers costs, and so improves the
profitability of schooling above s0 (though not above s1.) Had

increased

as a consequence of minimum wages, profitability of schooling in the

interval would have fallen. In that case we would have observed a decrease
in school enrollment and at the same time an increase in the labor force,
as well as an increase in unemployment exceeding that of disemployment

resulting from the minimum wage This scenario is rejected by the empirical
observations.

Thus the increase in school enrollment is predictable, given the

observed effects of minimum wages on labor force participation. The link
is economic, via changes in rates of return, not merely tautological in
the sense that schooling is part of the non-market.
It is worth noting that the question of effects of minimum wages on
the volume of welfare payments is analogous, indeed identical, to the

question about effects on school enrollment. A priori, one could argue
either way. Indeed, according to a survey by West and McKee (1979)
inducement to work has become a major argument in favor of minimum wages:3

3West and McKee (1979), p. 11

4

A final purpose of the minimum wage, articulated only
since the advent of widespread social security programmes,
has been that of providing incentive to work for employees
who are tempted to rely instead on pensions, unemployment,
or welfare benefits. Most governments recognise (at least
informally) the intimate relationship between social assistance and low-wage employment (since individuals may switch
back and forth frequently) by attempting to set minimum wages
somewhat above that which a single person can expect to earn
from such schemes. A latter—day purpose of minimum wage legislation, therefore, is to induce workers to search for jobs.
It is clear now,-given the evidence on labor force participation and
on enrollment effects of minimum wages, that the inducement argument is not

valid. Indeed, the logical conclusion is to the contrary: minimum wages
induce welfare, not work. However, without more direct empirical evidence,
this conclusion still remains in the realm of speculation.
Returning to the effects on schooling, it has been argued that these
effects are asymmetrical:4 school enrollment is likely to increase for the

non—poor and decrease for the poor. By extension a similar difference might
be

observed between whites and Blacks. But the theoretical basis for this

prediction

is weak. We would expect that the profitability of longer

schooling would increase for all groups. Indeed, the lower the pre—minimum
wage, the greater is the (%) reduction in ',

if it falls, according to the

Mincer (1976). model. Consequently, the rate of return to schooling increases more for the lower sub—minimum wage workers than for others, and
the inducement into longer schooling could be strong or stronger among

the poor. Mattila's empirical finding that school enrollment increased
for both Blacks and Whites is consistent with the negative effect of minimum wages on labor force participation in both groups (Mincer, 1976).
Mattila actually finds that black response coefficients are somewhat
stronger than those of the whites, which need not be surprising.

4See Welch (1974) and Ehrenberg—Marcus (1979).

5

Mattjla finds also that work of black students has decreased or not
increased in contrast to the growth of participation among white students.
These findings are supported by aggregate (CPS) data (Freeman and Medoff,

1979) and suggest possible effects of the welfare system. Since school
enrollment of children who are 18 or less is a condition of receipt of welfare
payments in eligible families, we would conclude that increases in welfare
enrollment induce reported school, enrollments in such families.5 At' the

same time their reported work activities are likely to be reduced.
It is true,

of

course, that both the financing and the motivational

(ability) factors produce a shorter schooling career of the poor compared

to the non—poor. This is true both before and after minimum wage hikes,
and levels should not be confused with change. The non—student proportion
of the relatively poorer population remains larger. This group must rely
on the labor market for personal economic advancement. It, therefore,
bears the brunt of the adverse minimum wage effects on job training.

II. Effects on Job Training
While minimum wages may be expected to prolong the length of schooling,

they create obvious barriers to job training. Job training must be financed,
at least in part, by the worker or apprentice, usually in the form of a

reduced initial wage. This means that even if current productivity of some
of the employed youngsters warrants paying the minimum wage, job training is
precluded for them since its provision would require paying initially a

achter and Kizn (1979) found also that enrollment rates for all young
(16-24) blacks were lower than those of young, whites in 1965, but the
situatioa was reversed in 1978.

6

subminimum.6

This

effect is another source of an increased demand for more schooling:

young persons with the ability and motivation to invest in their human capital

are lead to substitute longer schooling for job training.7 Moreover, the
additional schooling enables them to enter higher (than minimum) wage jobs
and reopens the possibility of subseguent job training as well.

Thus the labor market difficulties which the minimum wage generates

for low wage young workers are twofold: loss of jobs for some where wages
are initially below the minimum and loss of opportunities for training and

carees even for those whose initial productivity is worth as much or somewhat more than the minimum wage.

We may note, at this point, that minimum wages will tend to discourage
the formation of both "general", that is transferable skills, as well as
firm—specific
the

extent

capital, although the effects on

the latter may be weaker to

that the firm is willing to bear costs of training the worker.

Several types of supply responses may be expected as a result of mini-

mum wages: Those who are intellectually and financially able to prolong
schooling will do so, even if their interests are primarily vocational and they

would have preferred job training to staying in school. One may speculate
that the growth of junior colleges and of private vocational schools, as

6

This conclusion was stated earlier by Rosen (1972) and Feldstein (1973).
The discouragement of training could be avoided by separating payments
(of employers to workers) for work from payments (of trainees-workers to
employers) for training. It is the netting out of the two transactions
that creates problems even for workers whose iflitialvalue productivity
is not subminimum.

7Even if employers were indifferent between wage "packages" with or without
training as long as labor costs per hour are the same, workers who opt for
job training are worse off when the higher minimum wage without training
replaces the lower wage with training. For an elaboration of the "wage
package" analysis see Wessels (1979), in progress.

7

well as the growing demand for vocationalism in college curricula,

is partly a reflection of this response. And so is also the growing

tendency of students to combine school with market work Student
work is also partly encouraged by provision of the Fair Labor Standards

Act which creates differentials and exceptions for students. The
transition to full-time work at wages above the minimum wage hurdle is

made easier by part-period and part—time work while at school. Although
jobs of students are usually low—skilled and casual, they provide some

experience and some measure of financial independence. The "dead-end"
nature of many of these casual jobs creates no particular anxiety,

since they will be left behind as soon as the student has graduated
and acquired more rewarding capacities.

The early labor market difficulties produced by the minimum wage are
not easily surmounted by youths who are either unwilling or unable to pro-

long their schooling. Since opportunities for job training leading to
advancement on the job are blocked by the minimum wage for some of them,
the young school dropouts must choose jobs with little promise for

advancement or become a labor market dropout as well. Non-participation in the labor market, which is induced by the minimum wage, may be
financed by the family, by unreported market or illegal activities, or
by the welfare system.

The non-students who do not drop out of the labor market despite

their low productivity must contend with several obstacles: greater
difficulties (longer unemployment) in finding jobs in the covered sector,
and lesser growth on the job because of the reduced availability of training
8

This is shown to be the case in Mattila's work. There are, of course,
additional reasons for this trend which need not concern us here.

on the job. Although it may seem strange to assert that higher wages
increase turnover, this can happen in the longer run when minimum wages are
raised, since the reduction of firm—specific training in jobs which contain

it reduces the cost of turnover for the worker and for the employer. More
gerrally, employers can be expected to adjust to the raised minimum wage in

several ways: by (1) reducing employment of the relevant workers and substi-.
tuting capital and a somewhat higher quality of labor for them and (2) by
reducing these components of the wage package (such as training) which are

not included in (netted out of) paid-out wages. The implications for changes
in turnover in the long—run are ambiguous, because an upgrading of labor may
well reduce it, while a downgrading of the wage package (in terms of reduced

training opportunities) is likely to increase turnover. However, the workers
initially exposed to the minimum wage hike, some of whom may be later replaced,
will experience an increase in turnover because of the curtailment of job

training opportunities. In the short-run, prior to full adjustment, the
effects on turnover are also ambiguous, since quits will be reduced9 and layoffs increased in the covered sector.

We may summarize the relevant implications of minimum wages as follows:
(1)

Induced prolongation of schooling coupled with increased part-time work

of students (except for those on welfare.)

(2) Reduced pace of job advance-

ment, and (3) Eventually increased turnover for those non—students whose
jobs contained specific training opportunities.

9lndeed, in the only study that came to our attention, Mixon (1978) found
that minimum wages reduce quits in manufacturing industries. The estimated
coefficients of the Koyck distributed lag on his quarterly data imply that
this effect vanishes almost totally within a year.

III.

Empirical Analysis of Effects on Job Training
Our

empirical

work is designed to explore the effects of minimum

wages on job training. This task is difficult to carry out in any direct
sense: We have no time series on changes in the provision of training
that could be matched up with changes in minimum wage levels and in cover-

age. Even if such data on training were available, it may not be reasonable

to expect a clear correlation between the short-run variation in

minimum wages and the longer-term policies of firms regarding training of

their

employees. Indeed, the oscillation of minimum wages around a relatively

fixed ratio to average wages and the past updrift in coverage should have

convinced employers to view the minimum wage as permanent and to respond
in terms of long—run adjustments.

The less direct implications about wage growth and turnover can neither

be observed nor correlated with minimum wages in aggregate time series. Our
approach is to analyze longitudinal micro-data in which both wage growth,
turnover, and some responses to guestions about training are available.
Following Ehreriberg and Marcus (1979) we differentiate our sample of workers

by state of residence.1° First we estimate differences in wage levels across
states for the "same worker". These differentials serve as inverse indicators of the differing potential importance of the minimum wage across

states. That is, the lower the (standardized) state wage, the higher the
ratio of minimum to state wages, since the minimum wage is basically
uniform across states.11 The other state variable is the ratio of covered

states in MID data is simpler and more accurate.

of

11There are two sources of variation: differential proportion of coverage
by state laws and differences in levels of state minimum wages. On average,
about 10% of coverage is state coverage. The variation so introduced in the
minimum wage level is of minor magnitude, which we ignore.

into one:

differential.
tional

The effects of minimum wage variables are then explored in regressions
where wage growth, job tenure, and training dummies alternate as dependent

variables. These effects are estimated net of a set of factors which we
selected as determinants of the dependent variables. In what follows, we
describe the analysis of data from the 1973 and 1975 Michigan Panel of
Income Dynamics for a panel of white men,14 and for white and black young

men in the NLS panels for the two periods from 1967 to 1971. We restrict both

samples to non—students. 1967 is the year in which substantial increases in
the minimum wage and its coverage went into effect. The main reason for
choosing the earlier period in NLS was the availability of state identifi-

cations. The later period in MID was preferable because an appropriate
question on training became first available in 1976. Although the data sets are
not exactly comparable, the later MID sample is more likely to represent
the long-run effects than the NLS sample.

12The coverage ratio includes, in the numerator, the total number of private
and public sector employees covered by FLSA as of (cf) Feb. 1, 1970 (note
that the last change of coverage prior to 1970 was 1966) plus the number
covered by state minimum wages only (c5). The denominator is the total
number of private and public nonsupervisory employees in the state in 1969.
13The multiplicative formulation is theoretically superior to the linear, though
it need not be the best (of. Welch,l974).

-4The sample of black men was much too small in MID. The empirical analysis
was not extended to women.

11

Table 1 presents a list of dependent and independent variables used
in each of the four regression analyses of wage functions, wage growth,
job tenure, and training.

(1). Wage Functions
Our first step is to estimate the relevant state differences in

wages. Crude differences in wages will not do, because we want to know
the effects of imposed changes in the price of labor, and not whether

labor of higher "quality" receives more or less training. Consequently
we estimate wages facing the "same worker" in various states by running
wage functions across all individuals in the sample, using a standard
set of wage determinants such as schooling, experience, length of tenure,

as well as a number àf other personal and job characteristics listed in

Table 1. State dummies were added to the set of independent variables.
Their coefficients represent estimates of wage differences (for an average
worker with the same characteristics) between each of the states and an

arbitrarily chosen base state. In some degree these differentials
reflect cost of living differences, but whether or not they represent
differences in real wages, the impact of the minimum wage, itself

nominal, depends on its relation to the nominal wage level. We excluded
states with less than 10 observations in the sample, leaving 35 states
in the MID and in the NLS regressions.

We ran both the semilog and arithmetical wage functions. The former
produce percent wage differentials among states, and the latter yield

dollar differentials. The two sets of estimates rank identically. We

used both sets in the subsequent analyses as alternatives and noticed

no clear differences in results. The semilog wage functions showed a
somewhat higher R2 and a larger contribution of state dummies to R2.
To save space our

Tables

show only the partial effects of the combined

minimum wage variable: the coverage ratio (coy) divided by the index of the
standardized state wage (1 + sw). Separate effects of (sw) and of (coy) are
shown in the appendix.
Aside from the coefficients on the state dummies, the estimated
parameters of the wage functions are similar to those found in many
previous studies and are not of primary interest in the present one.

The major purpose of the wage regressions here is to estimate the inter—

state wage differentials. Incidentally, the inclusion of state dummies
has little effect on the estimated parameters of the other variables,

and it raises the multiple R2 about 25% (from .34 to .42) in the semilog

function. Not surprisingly, personal and job characteristics account
for most of the "explained" differences in observed (unstandardized)
wages among states.

(2). Wage Growth
The pace at which workers accumulate skills in their work careers
is an important factor in producing the upward slope of the typical wage

profile. We argue that the rate of skill acquision, hence wage growth,
will be impeded by the level and coverage of minimum wages. Of course,
individual skill and wage growth are affected by a number of other factors,

such as growth of the economy, the business cycle, level of education and
experience, migration and job changes, changes in health and family status,

14

and so on. We eliminate the economy—wide factors by studying wage changes
of different persons over the same calendar time interval. And we standardize
for the other factors, listed in Table 1.

Since the return on investhent in human capital is measured in
dollars (not in percentages), we used dollar wages to measure absolute

growth rather than logarithms to measure percent growth)5 Indeed, if
the volume of training (measured in dollars) were unaffected after an
increase of the minimum wage, with a higher base wage, percentage growth

would be diminished. Hence dollar growth provides a more convincing test

than percent growth)6
We analyzed differences in wage growth across individuals in two

alternative sets of regressions. For the findings shown in Table 2 (upper panel)
we used wages in 1975 as the dependent variable and wages in 1973 as one

of the independent variables. Hence, wage growth is shown by differences
in 1975 wages, given the wage in 1973. We also ran alternative regressions
where our dependent variable is the actual change in wages between 1973

and 1975. The results were quite similar, insofar as our research questions
and findings are concerned.

Our hypothesis is that lesser wage growth should be observed in states

where standardized wages are lower or the coverage larger)7

15The slope of semilog wage functions reflects the ratio of investment (in
job training or learning) to earning capacity. Return on the volume of
investment is obtained in the arithmetical function, hence the dollar volume
of job training is reflected in the slope (growth) of the dollar wage function
(Cf. Mincer, 1974).
16We replicated our wage growth regressions in log form and found the same qualitative results as in our Table 2. Hashimoto (1979) uses percent growth as a
test in his empirical model and observes qualitatively similar results.

17Although the correlation is weak, coverage is actually larger in higher wage
states.

15

The regression estimates in Table 2 indicate the net effects of the
minimum wage variable18 on wage growth of men with the same education,
experience, job tenure, marital status, health status, and union membership.
In the upper panel, which refers to 1973-75 wage growth in the MID,
the effects of minimum wages are negative and significant as predicted.

The two lower panels of Table 2 show results of wage growth regressions

based on NLS data. These are samples of young men, non-students who were at
most 25 years old in 1967. We observe their wage growth in 1967-69 and
again in 1969—71. The sample of black youth is large enough in NLS for
separate regression analyses. We ran regressions of wages in 1969 and 1971
on the various determinants as of 1967 and 1969 respectively, including the
lagged wage, and the minimum wage variables.

Minimum wage effects are negative and significant for whites in both

time periods. They are negative and mainly not significant for blacks.
A possible reason for lesser significance of black coefficients is that
the components of the minimum wage variable, state wage differentials (sw)
and coverage (Coy) could not be estimated separately for blacks.

We would expect the minimum wage to have a stronger impact in lower

wage groups within the states. We ran our regressions on progressively
smaller subgroups of people with at most high school education (HS) and

with less than high school (<HS). Although the samples became smaller,
and may therefore lose on statistical significance, we find that the
coefficients increase in size, the lower the level of education in the

MID panel. The pattern is less clear in NLS.

18The complete equations are available on request in an appendix.

As an additional check we singled out the highest education group

(13+) in the MID and in the white NLS sample. This group is least likely
to be affected by minimum wages in any state. We find that wage growth
is not affected by minimum wages in this group in the 1973-75 period in

MID or in the 1967-69 phase among NLS whites. The exception is a reduction
in wage growth in the 1969-71 period in NLS.

(3). Job Tenure
Although

on—the—job acquisition of transferable skills has no

obvious implications for

training

job turnover, elements of firm specificity

in

are likely to strengthen the degree of firm attachment. To

the extent that firm specific training is reduced by minimum wages, turn-

over should increase and job tenure decrease. This implication about
minimum wage effects is weaker than the wage growth hypothesis because
most acquired skills are largely transferable.

In MID data, which are not restricted to the very young, we find
that the length of job tenure is indeed shorter when state wages are lower

and coverage larger (Table 3). However, the effect of minimum wage
variables on job mobility of white young men in NLS (Table 3B) is to

lengthen job tenure. For NLS blacks minimum wages also appear to reduce
tenure, though the coefficients only border on significance.

The difference between NLS and MID in the time periods may represent
a distinction between shorter (NLS) and longer—run (MID) effects of the

major 1967 changes in minimum wage legislation. In the short run wages

rise but the nature of the job does not change. In that period minimum
wages increase layoffs

and

reduce quits in the covered sector. Two—

thirds of the separations of young NLS whites are quits, but only half of

black separations are quits. Consequently, minimum wages may reduce turnover of young whites, but not of young blacks. In the longer-run, the reduction of training produces an increase in turnover, as in the MID data. The
patterns by education are not clear, which leaves the turnover hypothesis
uncertain pending further evidence.

(4). Reported Job Training
Our final test is perhaps the most direct, although the reported data

may be a bit more subjective. In the MID we examine answers to a question
first posed in 1976: "Do you feel you are learning things on your job that
could lead to a better job or to a promotion?" We used a dummy dependent
variable with value 1 if the answer was affirmative and 0 if negative. Prior
to 1976 a narrower question was asked only of those with education not

exceeding high school. The question was whether during the past year they
received any kind of training other than schooling. We ran the 1975 answer
as a dummy. The 1976 answers were regressed on the 1975 levels and the 1975
on the 1973 levels of independent variables. The results are shown in Table 4.
The coefficients of the minimum wage variable are negative, as expected,

and increase in size and significance as we move to the lower education
groups in the MID panel.

In the NLS sample of young men, we coded answers of those who

received training on the current job. The concept of training is
narrower than in MID, as it appears to refer to formal rather than

all training. The minimum wage reduces training in both racial groups

and time periods. The coefficients are significant in most cases. No
effects are observed in the more educated (13+ years) subsample in MID
and in NLS.

The NLS data contain some information on job training off the firm,

excluding school. We might expect the minimum wage to encourage such
training as an alternative to in-firm training, though not to (publicly

subsidized) schooling. In regressions not shown here, the coefficients
were generally not statistically significant, but most of the signs were
in the predicted direction, that is positive.
On the whole, the findings in the NLS regressions tend to be favorable to our hypothesis, although they are not as strong as the findings
in MID.

(5). Conclusions
The hypothesis that minimum wages tend to discourage on the job

training is largely supported by our empirical analysis. Direct effects
on job training and the corollary effects on wage growth as estimated
(in Tables 4 and 2, respectively) are consistently negative and stronger
at lower education levels. Indeed, apart from a single exception, no

effects are observable among the higher wage group whose education exceeds
high school.

22

The effects on job turnover are: a decrease in turnover among
young NLS whites, but an increase among young NLS blacks and MID whites.
Whether these apparently conflicting findings on turnover reflect a

distinction between short and long run adjustments in jobs is a guestion
that requires further testing.
