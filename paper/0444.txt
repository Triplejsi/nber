Estimating the Expected Return on the Market:
An Exploratory Investigation

ABSTRACT

The expected return on the market is a number frequently required for
the solution of many investment and corporate finance problems. However,
by comparison with other financial variables, there has been relatively little
academic research on estimating this expected return. The current practice
for estimating the expected return on the market is to take the historical
average of realized excess returns on the market and add, :It to'the current
observed inte're~t: rate. While th;i:smodel does explicitly relfect the dependence of the market experience return ,on the interest rate, it does not
take into account the effect of changes in the level of risk associated
with the market.
Three models of equilibrium expected market returns which do reflect
this dependence are analyzed in this paper. Estimation procedures are
derived which incorporate the prior restriction that equilibrium expected
excess returns on the market must be positive. The parameters of the models
are estimated using realized return data for the period 1926-1978.
The principal conclusions from this exploratory investigation are:
~irst, in estimating models of the expected return on the market, the nonnegativity restriction of the expected excess return should be explicitly
included as part of the specification. Second, estimators which use
realized return time series should be adjusted for heteroscadasticity.

Introduction
Modern finance theory has provided many insights into how security

prices are formed and has provided a quantitative description for the
risk structure of equilibrium expected returns.

In the most basic form

of the Capital Asset Pricing Model,ll this equilibrium structure is given
by the Security Market Line relationship:
ai - r •

where

a

and a

ai (a -

Namely,

is the riskless interest rate; and

is the ratio of the covariance of the return on security

with the

return on the market divided by variance of the return on the market.
,This same basic model tells us

t~at

all efficient or optimal portfolios

can be represented by a simple combination of the market portfolio with
the riskless asset.

Hence, if

and

return and standard deviation of return on an efficient portfolio, then

called the Price of Risk.

From (1.1) and (1.2), one can determine the optimal portfolio
allocation for an investor and the proper discount rate to employ for the
evaluation of securities.

Moreover, these equations provide the critical

"cost of capital" or "hurdle rates" necessary for corporate capital
budgeting decisions.

Of course, (1.1) and (1.2) apply only for the most

basic version of the CAPM, and indeed, empirical tests of the Security

will be the dominant factor.-

Thus, at least for common stocks and broad-based equity portfolios, the
basic model as described by (1.1) and (1.2) should provide a reasonable

Of course, all one needs to know to apply these formulas in solving
portfolio and corporate financial problems are the parameter values.

beta services.

For practitioners, there are beta "books" and

While for the most part these betas are estimated from

time series of past returns, various accounting data have also been used.
In their pioneering work on the pricing of options and corporate
liabilities, Black and Scholes (1973) deduced an option pricing formula
whose only nonobservable input is the variance rate on the underlying stock.
As a result, there has been a surge in research effort to estimate the variance

. rates for returns on both individual stocks and the market.

Although this

research activity is still in its early stages of development, variance rate
estimates are already available from a number of sources.
In contrast, there has been

little

academic research on

estimating the expected return on either individual stocks or the market.
Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1976; 1979) have carefully cataloged the
historical average returns on stocks and bonds from 1926 to 1978.
However, they provide no model as to how expected returns change through
time.

There is no literature analogous to the term structure of

-4interest rates for the expected return on stocks, although there is
research going on in this direction as, fOr example, in Cox, Ingersoll,
and Ross (forthcoming).
One possible explanation for this paucity of research on expected
returns is that for many applications within
finance, only relative pricing relationships are used, and therefore,
estimates of the expected returns are not required.

Some important

examples of such applications are option and corporate liabilities pricing
and the testing for superior performance of actively-managed portfolios.
However, for many if not most applications, an estimate of the expected
return on the market is essential.

For example, to implement even the

most passive strategy of portfolio allocation, an investor must know
the expected return on the market and its standard deviation in order to
choose an optimal mix between the market portfolio and the riskless asset.
Indeed,· even if one has superior security analysis skills so that the
optimal portfolio is no longer a simple mix of the market and the riskless
asset, TreynJr and Black (1973) have shown that the optimal strategy will
still involve mixing the market portfolio with an active portfolio, and
the optimal mix between the two will depend upon the expected return and
standard deviation of the market.

For a corporate finance example, the

application of the model in determining a "fair" rate of return for
investors in regulated industries requires not only the beta but also an
estimate of the expected return on the market.

As these examples

illustrate, it is not for want of applications that expected return
estimation has not been pursued.
A more likely explanation is simply that estimating expected returns
from time series of realized stock return data is very difficult.

As is

shown in Appendix A, the ·estimates of variances or covariances from the

-5available time series will be much more accurate than the. corresponding
expected return estimates.

Indeed, even if the expected return on the

market were known to be a constant for all time, it would take a very long
history of returns to obtain an accurate estimate.

And, of course, if

this expected return is believed to be changing through time, then
estimating these changes is still more difficult.

Further, by the

Efficient Market Hypothesis, the unanticipated part of the market return
(i.e., the difference between the realized and expected return) should not
be forecastab1e by any predetermined variables.

Hence, unless a significant

portion of the variance of the market returns is caused by changes in the
expected return on the market, it will be difficult to use the time
series of realized market returns to distinguish among different models
for expected return.
In light of these difficulties, one might say that to attempt to
estimate the expected return on the market is to embark on a fool's
errand.

Perhaps, but on this errand, I present three models of expected

. return and derive methods for estimating them.

I also report the results

of applying these methods to market data from 1926 fo 1978.
The paper is exploratory by design, and the empirical estimates
presented should be viewed with that in mind.

Its principal purpose is

to motivate further research in this area by pointing out the many estimation problems and suggesting directions for possibly solVing them.
reasons for taking this approach are many:

The

First, an important input for

estimating the expected return on the market is the variance rate on the
market.

While there is much research underway in developing variance

-6estimation models, their development has not yet reached the point where
there is a "standard" model with well-understood error properties.
Because this is not a paper on variance estimation, the model used to
estimate variance rates here is a very simple one.

Almost certainly,

these variance estimates contain substantial measurement errors, and these
alone are enough to warrant labeling the derived model estimates for
expected return as "preliminary."

A second reason is that the expected

return model specifications are themselves very simple, and undoubtably
could be improved upon.

Third, only time series data of market returns

were used in the estimations, and as is indicated in the analysis, other
sources of data could be used to improve the estimates.

As a reflection

of the preliminary nature of this investigation, no significance tests are
provided and no attempt is made to measure the relative forecasting
performance of the three models.

-7II.

The Models of Expected Return
The appropriate model for the expected return on the market will

depend upon the information available. For example, in the absence of
any other information, one might simply use the historical sample average
of realized returns on the market.
tion.

Of course, we do have other informa-

For example, we can observe the riskless interest rate.

Noting

that this rate has varied between essentially zero and its current doub1edigit level during the last fifty years, we can reject the simple sample
average model for two reasons:

First, it can be proved as a rather

general proposition that a necessary condition for equilibrium is that
the expected return on the market must be greater than the riskless rate
(i . e., a » r. 11

Hence, if the current interest rate exceeds the long

historical average return on stocks (as it currently does), then the
sample average is a biased-low estimate.

Thus, one would expect the

expected return on the market to depend upon the interest rate.

Second,

the historical average is in nominal terms, and no sensible model would suggest
. that the equilibrium nominal expected return on the market is independent
of the rate of inflation which is also observable.

Both these criticisms

are handled by a second-level model which assumes that the expected excess
return on the market,

a - r, is constant.

Using this model, the current

expected return on the market is estimated by taking the historical average excess
return on the market and adding to it the current observed interest rate.
Indeed, a model of this type represents essentially the state-of-the-art
with respect to estimating the expected return on. the market •.§.1

While it need not always be the case,- a generally-reasonable

assumption is that to induce risk-averse investors to bear more
risk, the expected return must be higher.

Given

in the aggregate,

the market must be held, this assumption implies that, ceteris paribus, the
equilibrium expected return on the market is an increasing function of the
risk of the market.

Of course, if changes in preferences or in the

distribution of wealth are such that aggregate risk aversion declines
between one period and another, then higher market risk in the one
period need net imply a correspondingly higher risk premium.

However, if

aggregate risk aversion changes slowly through time by comparison with
- the changes in market risk, then, at least locally in time, one would expect higher levels of risk to induce a higher market risk premium.
If, as shall be assumed, the variance of the market return is a
sufficient statistic for its risk, then a reasonably general specification
of the equilibrium expected excess return can be written as

Since it has already been assumed that variance is a sufficient statistic
for risk, with little loss in generality, it is further assumed that
market returns can be described by a diffusion-type stochastic process
in the context of a continuous-time dynamic mode1.

The specifi-

to as "Model 111" is indicative of models where it is assumed that aggregate risk preferences remain relatively stable for appreciable periods of
time.
"Model

makes the alternative assumption that the slope of the

Capital Market Line or the Market Price of Risk remains relatively stable

"Model #3" is the state-of-the-art model which assumes that the
expected excess return on the market remains relatively stable for
appreciable periods of time even though the risk level of the market is
changing.

Its specification is given by
(11.8)

Of course. if the variance rate on the market were to be essentially
constant through time, then all three models would reduce to the state-ofthe-art model with a constant expected excess return.

However, from the

work of Rosenberg (1972) and Black (1976) as well as many others, the
hypothesis that the variance rate on the market remains constant over any
appreciable period of time can be rejected at almost any confidence level.
MOreover, given that the variance rate is changing, the three models are

in the sense that if one of the models satisfies

While we have assumed that

E[Yjls,a2(t)]

aCt), it must be estimated.

Hence, these

models as special cases of (11.1) will be of empirical significance only

-12if for the available data set, the variance rate can be estimated more
accurately than the expected return.

If the principal component of such

a data set is the time series of realized market returns, then it is
shown as a theoretical proposition in Appendix A that, indeed, the
variance rate can be more accurately estimated when the market return
dynamics are given by (11.5).

As an empirical proposition, the studies

of both Rosenberg (1972) and Black (1976)

show that a nontrivial portion

of the change in the variance can be forecasted by using even relatively
simple models.

Further, along the lines of Latane' and Rendleman (1976)

and Schmalensee and Trippi (1978), it is possible to use observed option
prices on stocks to deduce "ex-ante" market estimates for variance rates
by "inverting" the Black-Scholes option pricing formula.

Hence, models

of the type which satisfy (11.4) hold out the promise of better estimates
for the expected return on the market than can be obtained by direct
estimation from the realized market return series.

Model Estimates:

1926 to 1978

In this section, market return and interest rate data from 1926 to
1978 are used to estimate each of the three models presented in Section
II.

The model estimators are the ones derived in Section III.

The

monthly returns (including dividends) on the New York Stock Exchange
Index are used for the market return series.

This index is a value-weighted

portfolio of all stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.

The U.S. Treasury

Bill Index presented in Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1979) is used for the
~iskless

interest rate series. The monthly interest rate from this

index is not the yield, but the one-month holding period returns on the
shortest maturity bill with at least a thirty-day maturity.
The interval

h

over which it is assumed that the variance rate on

the market can be treated as constant was chosen to be one month.

The

riskless interest rate is also assumed to be constant during this interval,
and one month is, therefore, the observation interval.

~ata.

At least

in periods in which daily return data are available, this interval is
long enough to permit reasonable estimates of the variance rate along
the lines discussed in Appendix A, and it is short enough so that the
variation in the variance rate over the observation interval is
substantially smaller than the variation in realized returns.
Other than satisfying the condition that

value for the length of the time period over which

constant.

Perhaps other data besides market returns would be helpful.

For example, if the data on large samples of individual investors'
holdings of various types of assets such as those used in the Blume and
Friend study (1975) were available for different points in time, it
might be possible to use these data to estimate the changes in aggregate
relative risk aversion over time.

However, given the explorato.ry nature

of this investigation, the route taken here is simply to estimate the models
assuming different values for

T ranging from one year to fifty-two years

and to examine the effect of these different choices on the model estimates.
A third choice to be made is the value to assign to
uniform prior distribution for

Y •

Unlike the lowerbound nonnegativity

restriction on Y., there are no strong theoretical foundations for an

For

to be part of a valid prior, the

market return data used to form the posterior cannot be used to form an
empirical foundation for/,the upperbound restriction.

Again, estimates of

aggregate risk aversion from the investor data used in the previouslycited Blume and Friend study might provide some basis for setting

However, in the absence of such other information, a reasonable choice
is a diffuse prior on the nonnegative real line with

no attempt is made to adjust

In using the estimation formulas from

Section III, it is assumed that the estimated variances are the true
values of the variances.

This is the principal reason why the empirical

results presented here must be treated as "preliminary" and it is also
the reason why no significance tests are attempted.
As discussed in Appendix A, a simple but reasonable estimate for
the monthly variance is the sum of the squares of the daily logarithmic
returns on the market for that month with appropriate adjustments for
weekends and holidays and for the "no-trading" effect which occurs with a

•

-24portfolio of stocks.

Unfortunately, daily return data for the NYSE Index

is available only from 1962 to 1978.

A long time series is essential

for estimating expected returns on stocks and sixteen years of data is
not a long time series.

Therefore, to make use of the much lonper monthly

time series, a variance estimator using monthly data was created by
averaging the sum of squares of the monthly logarithmic returns on the
market for the six months just prior to the month being estimated and for
the six months just after that month.

With this variance estimator, all the available market return data except
the first six months of 1926 and the last six months of 1978 can be used
to estimate the models.
Although no explicit

While these brief comparisons ,cannot be considered an analysis of the

-Z8the results from this period are consistent with the others.

This was

a period of both large positive and negative realized excess returns
with both large changes in variance and large variances especially in
the early 1930's when the market had a large negative average excess
return.

From the regression estimators, (II.Z),

has in its

numerator the unweighted average of the (logarithmic) realized excess
returns.

Y has in its numerator the weighted average of these

excess returns where the weights are such that each excess return is
"deflated" by that month's estimate of the standard deviation.

unlike

That is,

in which each observed excess return has the same weight,

Y puts more weight on observed excess returns which occur in lowerZ
than-average-standard-deviation months and less weight on those that
occur on higher-than-average-standard-deviation months.

Inspection

of the regression estimator for Hodel 113 will show that the weighting
of the realized excess returns is similar to that of

Y except the
Z

effect is more pronounced because each month's return is divided
. by that month's variance.

Hence, in a period such as the early

1930's when, expost, large negative excess returns occur in months
where the variance is also quite large, the differences between
and

Of

course, just the opposite effect will occur in periods when, expost,
either large negative excess returns occur in months when the variance

when the variance is large and a number of negative excess returns
occur in months when the variance is small.

-29.To provide further evidence in support of this explanation and to
further underscore the importance of the nonnegativity constraint,
especially as

-30Since the variance estimates and return data axe identical for the l3-year
overlapping period 1965-1978, the differences between the estimates
presented in Table

IV.2 and those presented in Table IV.4 reflect the

effect of a change from a l6-y.ear to a l3-year observation period.

The

three-year period 1962-1965 eliminated by this change was one in which
the realized excess returns on the market were mostly positive .and the
variances were relatively low.
For Model #1, the effect of this change on the posterior estimate

Of course, the expected excess

estimate for Model 113 is simply a constant.

In Table IV.7,

the same summary statistics are presented for the realized excess
returns on the market and for the realized returns on the riskless
asset.
Inspection of Table IV.7 shows that the average of the expected
excess returns varies considerably across the three models.

The

"Constant-Preferences" Model III is the lowest wUhan average of 0.665
percent per month or, expressed as an annualized excess return, 8.28
percent per year.

The sample average of the realized excess returns on the market

was 0.655 per.:'-ent per month, or, annualized, 8.15 percent per year •.
This sample average is also the point estimate for the expected excess
. return on the market according to the state-of-the-art model.
Even with these large differences in the average estimates, it is
unlikely that any of these models could be rejected by the realized
return data.

The variance of the unanticipated part of the returns

on the market is much larger than the variance of the change in expected
return.

That is, the realized returns are a very "noisy" series for

detecting differences among models of expected return.
In examining the average excess returns in Table IV.7, one might
be tempted to conclude that Model III "looks" a little better because its

However, as inspection of (11.2.1) makes clear, the regression estimator
Y
l

is such that this must always be the case when the variance estimator

is of the type used here.

This observation brings up an important issue

with respect to estimates based upon the state-of-the-art model.
If the strict formulation of that model is that the expected
excess return on the market is a constant or at least, stationary over
time, then the least-squares

estimate of that constant is given by

However, from Table IV.7,the annualized difference

and the sample realized return average is 221 basis points.

This difference is quite large when considered in the context of
portfolio selection and corporate finance applications.

The reason for

the difference is that the sample average of realized returns is only
a least-squares estimate if the variance of returns over the
period is

con.::~ t.ant •

If the variance is no t cons tan t, and it isn't,

then the estimator should be adjusted for heteroscadasticity in the
. "error" terms.

This is exactly what the estimator

Y
3

does.

Of course, the sample average of realized returns is a consistent
estimator and the measurement error problem in the variance estimates
rule out formal statistical comparison.

However, the large difference

reported here should provide a warning against neglecting the effects
of changing variance in such estimations and simply relying upon
"consistency" even when the observation period is as long as 52 years.
As mentioned, the sample average of the realized returns will

provide an efficient estimate of the average expected excess return if

-34Model 111 is the correct specification.

However, even if that is the

belief, then for capital market and corporate finance applications,
Yl

times the current variance will provide a better estimate of the

current expected excess return than the state-of-the-art model because
it takes into account the current level of risk associated with the market.
A similar argument applies to using the ratio of the sample
average of the realized excess returns to the sample standard deviation
for estimating the Price of Risk under the hypothesis that it is
constant, or at least, stationary over time.

From Table IV.7, using the

realized return statistics, the estimate of the Price of Risk is 0.114
per month whereas the least-squares estimate

Y which takes into
2

account the changing variance rates is 0.1867 per month.

Again, this

difference is quite large.
To further underscore the importance of taking into account the
change in the variance rate when estimating the expected return on the
market, we close this section with a brief examination of the time series
of market variance estimates.

The average monthly variance rates for the

market returns are presented in Table IV.8 for the thirteen successive
four-year periods from July 1926 to June 1978.

Over the entire 52-year

period, the average annual standard deviation of the market return was
20.4 percent.

However, as is clearly demonstrated in Table IV.8, the

variance rate can change by'a substantial amount from one four-year
period to another, and it is significantly different from this average
in many of the four-year periods.

*Using formula (IV.3) for the variance

-35It has frequently been reported that the market was considerably
more volatile in the pre-World War II period than it has been in the
post-war period.

That observation is confirmed here with an average

annual standard deviation of 27.9 percent for the period July 1926 to
June 1946 versus 13.8 percent for the period July 1946 to June 1978.
However, a significant part of this difference is explained by the
extraordinarily large variance rates in the 1930-1934 period.

Thus,

if this period is excluded, then the average annual standard deviation
for the other twelve four-year periods is 16.6 percent.
Because the state-of-the-art model assumes a constant variance
rate, the large differences in variance rates among the various subperiods
causes this model's estimates to be quite sensitive to the time period
of history used.
th~

So, for example, if the 1930-1934 is excluded, then

estimated Market Price of Risk based upon the other forty-eight

years of data changes by 33 percent for the state-of-the-art model
estimator.

However, this same exclusion caases Model #2's estimate,

. to change by only 8 percent.

Conclusion
In this exploratory investigation, we have established two substantive

results:

First, whether or not one agrees with the specific way in

which it was incorporated here, it has been shown that in estimating
models of the expected return on the market, the nonnegativity restriction
on the expected excess return should be explicitly included as part of
the specification.

Second, because the variance of the market return

changes significantly over time, estimators which use realized return
time series should be adjusted for heteroscadasticity.

As suggested by

the empirical results presented here, estimators based upon the assumption
of a constant variance rate, although consistent, can produce substantially different estimates than the proper least-squares estimator even
when the time series are as long as fifty years.

As demonstrated by the

analysis of :Hode1 113, these conclusions apply even i f the model specification is such that the expected excess return does not depend upon
the level of market risk.
There are at least three directions in which further research along
these lines may prove fruitful.

First, because the realized return data

provide "noisy" estimates of expected return, it may be possible to
improve the model estimates by using additional nonmarket data.

Examples

of such other data are the surveys of investor holdings as used in Blume
and Friend (1975); the surveys of investor expectations as used in Malkiel
and Cragg (1979); and corporate earnings and other accounting data as
used in Myers and Pogue (1979).

Because these types of data are not

available with the regularity and completeness of market return data, it
may be more appropriate to include them through a prior distribution

-37rather than as simply additional variables in a standard time series
regression analysis.

If a prior distribution is to be used to incorporate both

these data and the nonnegativity restriction, then the sensitivity of
the model estimates to the particular distribution chosen warrants careful
study.
A second direction for further study is the length of time over which
it is assumed that the

Y.
J

can be treated as essentially constant (i.e., T).

In the analysis presented here, the estimates of
only used the data for the specific subperiod.

for different

So, for example, the

Y.

J

for the period 1930-1934 was computed using only the observed returns
for 1930-1934.

Clearly, better estimates could be obtained by including

the pre-1930 observations as well.

Therefore, for a given

T, the

estimates will be improved by developing a procedure for revising the
prior distribution using past estimates of Y.•
J

The third and most important direction is to develop accurate
variance estimation monels.

As previously discussed, such models have

. applications far broader than simply estimating expected returns.

Such

models should benefit from inclusion of both option price data and
accounting data in addition to the past time series of market returns.
Perhaps

other market data such as trading volume may improve the estimates

as well.
While there are obviously many problems to be overcome in both
the estimation and testing of expected. return models, it is hoped that
this paper will stimulate further research effort and with it, some
solutions to this important problem.

By "dominant factor," we do not mean that most of the variation in an
individual stock's realized returns can be "explained" by the variation
in the market's return. Rather, we mean that among the systematic
risk factors that influence an individual stock's equilibrium expected
return, the market risk of that stock will have the largest influence
on its' expected return.

It is shown in Rothschild and Stiglitz [1970] that the demand for a
risky asset in an optimal portfolio which combines this asset with the
riskless asset, need not be a decreasing function of the risk of that
asset.. Hence, it is possible that an increase in the riskiness of the
market will not require a corresponding increase in its equilibrium
expected return. For further discussion of this point,. see Merton
[1980].

Estimating the Variance Rate From Time
Series of Realized Returns

In the Introduction, it was claimed that the variance of returns can
be estimated far more accurately from the available time series of
realized returns than can the expected return.

We now show that this

claim is correct provided that market returns can be described by a
diffusion-type stochastic process as in (11.5) and that the mean and
variance of these returns are .slowly-varying functions of time.
As discussed in detail in Section I I of the text, under the hypo-

thesis that the mean and variance are slowly-varying functions of time,
the true process for market returns can be approximated by assuming
that

That is, nothing is gained in terms of

Thus, for stock return

data and observation intervals of a month or less, the bias from a noncentral estimator of the variance can be neglected.
More important than the issue of bias is the accuracy ?f the estimator.

lin, it depends only upon the number of observations.

Thus, unlike

the accuracy of the expected return estimator, by choosing finer observation intervals

~,

the accuracy of the variance estimator can be improved

for a fixed value of

h.

To further emphasize the point, consider the extreme case where both
the mean and variance are constant for all time.

The accuracy of the

expected value estimator will depend only on the total length of
calendar time for which return data are available (e.g., 52 years).
However, the accuracy of the variance estimator will depend critically on
whether these data are available annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily.
The standard deviation of the variance estimate using annual data will

A4

be approximately ninteen times larger than the standard deviation of
the estimate using daily data over the same calendar period.

Since

neither the mean nor the variance are constant for anything like this
length of calendar time, the practical advantage of the variance
estimator's accuracy depending upon

n

rather than

h

is that a

reasonably accurate estimate of the variance rate can be obtained using
daily data while the estimates for expected return taken directly from
the sample will be subject to so much error as to be almost useless.
Additional discussion on these points can be found in Merton [1976,
p. 336-339].

In the theoretical limit of continuous observation,
infinity for any finite

n

goes to

h, and therefore, the variance rate could in

principle be estimated without error for any finite interval.

However,

in practice, the choice of an ever-shorter observation interval
introduces another type of error which will "swamp" the benefit of a
shorter time interval long before the continuous limit is reached.
This error is caused by not knowing the exact length of time between
successive trades.

For example, suppose that the closing price of a

stock as reported in the newspaper was not the result of trade at 4:00
PM, but rather the result of a (last) trade which occurred at 3:00 PM.
If

~

is one week and if the last trade the previous week did occur

at 4:00 PM, then the observed price change occurred over a 167 hour
interval and not a 168 hour interval as assumed.

While this actual

shorter time interval will cause an underestimate of the variance rate,
the magnitude of the error is only 0.6 percent.
~

However, suppose that

is the six-hour interval from the 10:00 AM opening to the same day

AS

4:00 PM closing.

Then, even if the first trade occurs at 10:00 AM,

the actual interval for the observed price change is five hours and not
six, and the magnitude of the error in the variance rate would be 16.7
percent.

Of course, if the first trade actually took place at 11:00 AM,

then the error would be 33.3 percent.

Thus, the "true" time interval

between trades is a random variable.
For actively-traded stocks and a

of the order of a week or more,

~

this error will generally have a negligible effect on the variance
estimates.

However, for daily observations, it can have a nonnegligible

effect for individual stocks, and it will definitely be important for a
large portfolio of stocks such as the NYSE index.

It is more important

for a large portfolio because it is likely that a significant number of
the stocks in the portfolio will not have their last trade near the
closing time.

Since the closing value of the index is computed using

the last traded prices and since stocks tend to be contemporaneously
positively correlated with one another,

th~

observed daily changes in

the index will exhibit positive serial correlation.

This positive

correlation is not "real" in the sense that one could make money trading
in the individual stocks contained in the index because at 4:00 PM,
trades could not have been executed at these last (and earlier) prices.
However, if no adjustment is made for .this "nontrading" effect, then
the sum of squared daily logarithmic changes in the index 'will produce
a significandy biased-low estimate of the variance rate.
A method for correcting for this problem is as follows:
denote the observed change in the index as contrasted with

Let
~

~

A6

which is the true change.

Since it is not known for how many days this

"non-trading" effect lingers, it was simply assumed that after three
days, there is no effect.

A model specification which captures this

non-trading effect is given by
