Sterilization and Monetary Control Under
Pegged Exchange Rates: Theory and Evidence

ABSTRACT

In veiw of recent strong evidence that substantial sterilizatipn of the

is formulated in which central banks exercise no control over their domestic

money supply despite their sterilization activities. This model is compared
with a more general model in which the balance of payments and domestic money

supply are both influenced by the central bank's domestic policy goals. In
order for the central bank to exercise monetary control, three conditions
must be met: assets are not perfect substitutes, goods are not perfect substitutes, and expected depreciation is not "too -responsive" to the balance

of

payments. The third condition may be met for small but not large reserve

flows. Reduced form tests are derived which show for Canada, France, Germany,

Italy, Japan, th Netherlands, and the United

Kingdom that domestic policy goals

is no longer empirically tenable for analysis of quarterly data and that more

STERILIZATION AND MONETARY CONTROL UNDER
PEGGED EXCHANGE RATES:
ThEORY AND EVIDENCE

University of California, Los Angeles
National Bureau of Economic Research

Standard discussions of the monetary approach to the balance of payments under pegged exchange rates have proceeded on the assumption that
no sterilization operations are attempted by the central banks of the

countries.' Recent findings of the NEER project on the
International Transmission of Inflation Through the World Monetary System
provide strong evidence that the direct effects on national money supplies
of current balances of payments are very largely sterilized by offsetting

transactions in domestic credit instruments.2 This paper outlines in
Section I a general model incorporating sterilization which encompasses
as a special case a modified version of the monetary approach in which
both reserve flows and domestic credit flows are endogenous variables.

*Valuable comments on a earlier draft were received from Anthony
Cassese, Daniel Friedman, Dan Lee, James Lothian, Michael Melvin, Anna

Schwartz, and Alan Stockman and in seminars at Emory University, the NBER—
New York, and UCLA. The calculations were performed on the TROLL system at

Generally, nonreserve central banks can exercise control over their domestic
money supply in the short—run unless certain conditions, which imply valid-

ity of the monetary approach, are met. In this monetary—approach special
case, central bank attempts to exercise monetary control are futile and instead simply induce exaggerated reserve flows.
Section II presents a simple direct test of whether determinants of
monetary policy other than the current balance of payments influenced the

nominal money supply given foreign variables determining money demand. For
quarterly data all seven countries in our sample (Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) showed clear evidence
that monetary control was, in fact, exercised under the Bretton Woods system

of pegged exchange rates. This evidence is strongly inconsistent with the
validity of the monetary approach to the balance of payments either in its

standard or modified form for analysis of quarterly data. Thus there is a
relevant "short run" within which central banks can and have exercised
monetary control under pegged exchange rates.

3

I. Analysis

The analysis proceeds in four steps: First, sterilization is formally defined in terms

of

the m'oney—supply reaction function of the

central bank. Next, a modified monetary approach is presented which is
consistent with partial sterilization. Then a more general model is
developed in which the central bank maycontrol its domestic money supply;
if this control is not present, the model reduces to the modified monetary

approach. Finally, the

conditions for monetary control are interpreted

in terms of responsiveness of capital flows, trade flows, and the expected
depreciation of the exchange rate.

A. Sterilization and the Money—Supply Reaction Function
The central bank of a nonreserve country will resist an incipient
appreciation (for example) of its exchange rate by buying some foreign

reserves with its domestic base money.3 This new base money increases
the domestic money supply. Standard central—bank procedure involves offsetting sales of domestic assets (for example, government bonds) for base

money. These offsetting transactions are said to sterilize the effect
of the balance of payments on the money supply.

In the standard monetary approach, the construct of domestic credit

(base money less reserves) or its change has been assumed exogenous. This
assumption is unwarranted if monetary authorities sterilize the balance
of payments in whole or part so that a balance of payments surplus induces

a decrease in domestic credit. But, of course, the immediate sterilization might be reversed so rapidly that for all practical purposes no
sterilization occurred over a period of observation such as a quarter.

4

Then the exogenous—domestic—credit assumption would be acceptable for
analysis of quarterly data.

A money—supply reaction function provides a formal

statement

of the

behavior of the monetary authorities working through the banking system.
The existence and extent of sterilization is measured by the coefficient
of the contemporaneous scaled balance of payments in the reaction function.

A

genera]. form of this reaction function is

MogM=aft+X+u

(1)

where M is the nominal money supply, B the balance of payments surplus,
H nominal base or high—powered money, and X a vector containing all other
variables which systematically affect the monetary authority's behavior.
Note in particular that lagged balances

may

appear

in X since

issue of ultimate concern is monetary control within the period of

the

observation.

of

of payments

If a is

1, then there is no sterilization since the balance

payments leads to a proportionate increase in the money supply. If a

is zero, then complete sterilization is practiced. Values of a between
o

B.

and 1 indicate partial sterilization.4

A Modified Monetary Approach
While

the

received monetary approach has been based on the assumption

that nonreserve countries do not sterilize in whole or part, this assump-

tion is in no sense essential to the theoretical approach.5 The really
essential idea is that the

given

domestic money supply is demand determined

the exchange—rate—converted foreign price level and foreign interest

rate. Any attempt of monetary authorities to vary the quantity of money

.5

from this demand determined growth Mog H will induce massive capital
flows, trade flows, or both until the money supply is equated to Mog H.
To

illustrate, suppose that the demand—determined change in money

is given by:

M0gHZd+e

(2)

If the balance of payments is indeed infinitely elastic with respect to
incipient

deviations from Alog H, then

fi8

(AlogM—Z6—c)

(3)

where e is negative infinity. That is any attempt by the central bank to
increase (decrease) money relative to Mog H results in an unbounded

balance of payments deficit (surplus). So equation (3) implies, given
0 =

—, that
tlog M= Z5 +€

(4)

Equation (4) and the money—supply reaction function (1) form a recursive
system in which the change in money is determined by demand.and this, plus

the "domestic policy" portion (X$ + u) of monetary policy determine the
balance of payments:

ft=(Z5+c—X8—u)

(5)

The balance of payments is the inverse of the sterilization parameter times
the

difference between the demand—determined money growth and the domestic—

policy money growth.

6

The modified monetary approach is illustrated graphically in Figure

1. The vertical line indicates the infinite elasticity of the balance
of

payments with respect to incipient deviations of money—supply growth

from its demand—determined level. The positively sloped line is the
money—supply reaction function.6 Their intersection determines the

equilibrium balance of payments (.)ec Note that an increase in unemployment which shifted the reaction function to the right (more money

growth for a given balance of payments) results in a substantial decrease
in the balance of payments which just balances the desire for more money
growth.

In conclusion, the existence of partial sterilization does not imply
any monetary control by a nonreserve central bank under pegged exchange
rates. It may just result in accentuated balance—of—payments movements.
C.

A More General Model

If neither

goods nor assets are perfect substitutes, it no

longer

follows that the balance of payments will be infinitely elastic with
respect to the money supply growth rate. Other factors (such as those
appearing in

trade

supply and demand equations) represented by the vector

S will also play a role in determining the balance of payments so that
equation (3)

is expanded to

4=0

When

combined with the reaction function (1), we obtain a

It can be readily verified that as the balance of payments elasticity goes
to negative infinity the solutions (7) and (8) go to the modified monetary
approach solutions (4) and (5). Thus, the modified monetary approach is,

indeed, a special case (for S = —a') of this more general model.
The more general model is illustrated by Figure 2. The vertical

(due to increased unemployment,

in fact does increase money growth as well as decreasing the balance

of payments. The relative size of the two effects of course depends on
the slopes of the two equations.

Note that our model deletes the concept of domestic credit entirely.
One can derive the equilibrium value of the scaled change in domestic credit
from equations (7) and (8) ——

or

(4) and (5) in the modified—monetary—

approach special case —— and the usual identity taking the growth rate of
the money multiplier as given, but it is an accounting construct which as an

endogenous variable adds nothing to the exposition. As will be discussed
further in Section II, the negative correlation between the scaled change in

8

domestic credit and the scaled balance of payments makes for easy confusion
in empirical analysis.

Conditions for Monetary Control

Unless the balance of payments is infinitely elastic with respect to

money growth, the central bank of a nonreserve country does exercise a

degree of monetary control. This control is not absolute (if

0) in

the sense that the balance—of—payments effects will enter the bank's choice

of

money growth, but neither will these effects completely overwhelm all

other influences such as domestic unemployment or inflation goals. Since
lagged balances of payments may be counted among those other influences,
the pegged system may be quite stable dynamically via specie—flow type

adjustments, but this is a different process than envisioned by the monetary approach. This subsection examines in more detail the crucial param—

either assets or goods being perfect substitutes Internationally. If

assets are perfect substitutes and the derivative of the interest rate R
with respect to money growth is negative due to a liquidity effect, then
overwhelming capital flows will force the domestic interest rate to its

parity value. Similarly if goods are perfect substitutes and the derivative of the contemporaneous price level P with respect to money growth is
positive, overwhelming trade flows will force the domestic price level to

its parity value. Either of these cases are sufficient, but it is not
necessary for either or both to hold In order to obtain 8 —

Obviously it is an empirical question whether these three conditions
for monetary control are met for any relevant observation length, and we

shall turn to some empirical evdence shortly in Section II. But first, the
third condition (12) raises an interesting possibility. Suppose that the
probability of a revaluation increases with the absolute value of the scaled
balance of payments and the expected (signed) magnitude of the revaluation

varies with the value of the scaled balance of payments. Then the expected
depreciation might be determined by a

function

like

(tLt)

(13)

where g' is, of course, negative. The derivative of interest is

d (B/H)

2g

(14)

which increases in absolute value with the absolute value of B/H. Thus,
there is some reason to suppose that condition (12) might hold for "small"
absolute values of the scaled balance of payments but fail if the central
bank attempted a policy which is "too" inconsistent with international

conditions. This is illustrated in Figure 3. The central bank exercises
a degree of monetary control so long as it stays in the negatively sloped

portion of the international balance curve. (f it shifts into the vertical range, however, overwhelming speculative capital flows result.9

Empirical Results

Blejer (1979) applied the Cranger—Sims causality test to quarterly data
for France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom and found that
scaled

changes in domestic credit "cause" scaled reserve flows in all five

(albeit as part of a two—way feedback structure for Sweden and the United
Kingdom).

Blejer erroneously claimed that this supports the monetary ap-

proach, but it in fact suggests short—run monetary control since the test
shows that past changes in domestic credit affect current reserve flows.

This evidence for short—run monetary control is not conclusive, however,
since past changes in domestic credit might have been induced by reserve
country actions which have current effects on foreign prices and hence re-

serve f 1ows)° It is simply not appropriate to apply an exogeneity test
to two

endogenous

variables.

The analysis of Section I suggests two research strategies which

focus directly on the issue of monetary control: The first is to fully
specify the more general model and estimate equations (1) and (6) by a
simultaneous system method to test whether

is, indeed, zero. This method

is being pursued in the Mark III International Transmission Model and is

beyond the scope of the present paper. The second approach is to proceed
on the assumption that the null hypothesis of no monetary control is true

and perform some classical hypothesis tests. Following this second path
allows us to avoid the difficulty of fully specifying the variables which

belong

in S.

These hypothesis tests rely on-the -difference between the reduced

forms for Mog M under the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.

Note that neither X8 nor SX enter in the reduced form if the null hypothesis

is true. One test of the null hypothesis is to add the domestic variables
X8 to the reduced form (4) and test whether they fail to enter as required
by the null hypothesis. That is, the null hypothesis implies 4) = 0

in

EslogM4)X8+Z6+c

(15)

A more powerful test would also include SA, but this requires a full
specification of the alternative hypothesis as noted above.
The empirical tests are based on the quarterly data bank developed
for the NEER Project on the International Transmission of Inflation and
the money—supply reaction functions in the Mark III model, both of which
are described in Darby and Stoclcinan (1979). We must first specify which

variables appear in the vector Z. Following Stockman's standard form, we
include in Z the change in the U.S. interest rate iR.e the change in domestic

real income Alog yj2 and the change in an exchange—rate—converted income—

weighted index of foreign prices Alog (EPF)J3 Table 1 reports estimates of
the reduced—form (and structural) equation (4) for Alog N on this specifi-

cation of Z for all seven nonreserve countries in the data bank. The

pegged periods used in the estimates are indicated in the table. These regressions seem very poor compared to standard monetary approach results.
The reason is that standard estimates move domestic credit to the right—

13

hand side on the erroneous assumption that it is exogenous. This provides
2

a spuriously high R

Following Genberg (1976), we can improve the fit of the regressions by

using the short—run money—demand function introduced by Chow (1966). This
amounts to adding the change in the logarithm of lagged real money or Alog (M/P)_1

to the vector Z. Table 2 reports the results obtained using the Chow
specification. These results are rather more favorable to the monetary approach although the R2s are not very impressive in an absolute sense. Let
us now proceed to the reduced—forut tests.

The reaction functions In the Mark III model are very general in form

to allow for cross—country differences in timing of response. For the
pegged period included variables, other than a scaled balance of payments
term,

are a time

spending,

or

trend, current and lagged unexpected real government

lagged semiannual

inflation rates, ligged unemployment rates

logarithmic transitory incomes, and lagged scaled balance of payments.

When all these variables (except the current B/H) are added

to the regres-

sions reported in Tables 1 and 2, we can do the joint test whether the
coefficients of the additional variables are all zero as implied by the

null hypothesis. The results of these F tests are reported in Table 3. For
the Chow—money—demand—function the modified monetary approach (no monetary
control) is rejected strongly for the United Kingdom, France, and

Japan

and

at the 10 percent significance level for Canada and Germany. Similar, though
more erratic, results are obtained for the long—run—money—demand function.

Consider the tests, however: They ask whether all the additional variables
reduce the sum of squared residuals by significantly more than would be ex-

pected for such a number of unrelated random variables. Since not all of

14

these variables enter any given reaction function this is a low—power test
(it is hard to reject the null hypothesis).

A sharper test first estimates equation (1) using fitted values of

B/H based on all the variables In X and Z. Since X and Z are independent
of C,

null

the resulting estimated XS should not enter in equation (15) if the

hypothesis is true. This saves degrees of freedom by imposing the

constraint implied by the alternative hypothesis: that the domestic
policy

variables enter proportionally to how they enter in the reaction

function.

Tables 4 and 5 report regressions corresponding to those in Tables
A

1 and 2 with the addition of a term in XS. We now see that

but

one (Canada in Table 4)

in every case

differs significantly from zero and so we can

reject the null hypothesis of no monetary control)4 The difficulty with
Canada in Table 4 appears to be in estimating.a reaction function using only
data for the brief period that Canada was on a pegged exchange rate and only

III. Suary and Conclusions
Recent

empirical research on sterilization had

demonstrated

that

standard monetary approach models which assume domestic credit exogenous

are invalid. This paper presents a modified monetary approach model
which retains the message of central—bank lnpotence despite extensive
sterilization activities. A more general model was also sketched under
which the central bank's policy objectives do influence the change in
the money supply. There was very strong evidence of at least short—run
monetary control in the quarterly data examined. This need not indicate any
long—run monetary control, but I conclude that the simplicity of the monetary
approach (in standard or modified form) is no longer empirically tenable for

use with quarterly data. More general models must be specified and tested
to explain the simultaneous determination of nominal money and the balance
of payments under pegged exchange rates.
