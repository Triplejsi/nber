Flexible Exchange Rates in the 1970's

ABSTRACT

The 1970's witnessed the dramatic evolution of the international monetary system

from a regime of pegged exchange rates into a regime of flexible rates. This paper
surveys the key issues and lessons from the experience with floating rates during the

1970's. The main orientation is empirical and the analysis is based on the experience
of the three exchange rates: the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/French Franc, and the Dollar!

DM. The first issue that is being examined is the efficiency of the foreign exchange
market and the degree of exchange rates volatility. The analytical framework emphasizes
that exchange rates are the prices of assets that are traded in organized markets and are

strongly influenced by expectations about future events. The principal finding is that
the behavior of the foreign exchange market has been broadly consistent with the efficient

market hypothesis. The second issue concerns the relationship between exchange rates
and interest rates. It is shown that during the inflationary period of the 1970's,

exchange rates and interest rates were positively correlated. This positive association
is interpreted in terms of the role played by inflationary expectations. The analysis
draws a distinction between expected and unexpected changes in interest rates; it is
demonstrated that changes in exchange rates are strongly associated with the unexpected

component of changes in the interest rates. The third issue concerns the relationship
between exchange rates and prices. It is shown that the experience of the 1970's
does not support the prediction of the simple version of the purchasing power parity

theory and that the deviations from purchasing power parities can be characterized

by a first—order autoregressive process. These deviations are then interpreted.

I. Introduction
Our recent experience with a system of flexible exchange rates had led
to a renewed interest in the operations of foreign exchange markets and in

studying the principal determinants of exchange rates. The 1970's witnessed
the dramatic evolution of the international monetary system from a regime of
pegged exchange rates which prevailed for about a quarter of a century since
the Bretton Woods conference into a regime of flexible (though managed) rates.

The emergence of the new legal and economic system confronted traders,
national governments and international organizations with new economic problems,

choices and instruments. During the 1970's exchange rates have fluctuated

widely and inflation rates accelerated. The international monetary system
had to accommodate extraordinarily large oil related shocks which affected

trade flows in goods and assets. Huge oil payments had to be recycled.
Uncertainties concerning future developments in international politics reached

new heights and the prospects for the world economy got gloomier. These
developments have placed unprecedented pressures on the markets for foreign

exchange as well as on other asset markets. They have been associated with a
large slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, and have resulted in speeding up the
creation of new institutions like the European Monetary System which provides the

formal framework for the management of exchange rates among members. The increased
interdependence among countries and the recognition that exchange rate
policies by one national government exert influence on other economies have

also induced a legal response from international organizations. For example,
in late April 1977 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund
approved the details of the second amendment to Article IV of the amended
Articles of Agreement dealing with the principles and procedures for surveillance
of member countries' exchange rate policies.

2

These developments provide the background for this paper which is
intended to present a brief survey of key issues and lessons from the

experience with floating rates during the 1970's. The main orientation of
the paper is empirical and the analysis is based on the experience of three

exchange rates: the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/French Franc and the Dollar/DM.
In Section II I analyse the efficiency of the foreign exchange markets by
examining the relationship between spot and forward exchange rates; in that
context I also examine and interpret the extent of exchange rate volatility.
The analysis of the foreign exchange markets is important because it sheds
light on several questions like (i) have exchange rates fluctuated "excessively"?
(ii) is there evidence that speculation in the foreign exchange markets is

destabilizing? (iii) is there evidence that there is "insufficient"

speculation in the foreign exchange markets? (iv) is there evidence for a
market failure in the sense that there are unexploited profit opportunities?
These issues are relevant for assessing the performance of floating rates as
well as for discussing whether there is a case for government intervention in

the foreign exchange markets. The analytical framework that is used for
interpreting the volatility of exchange rates and the association between spot
and forward rates is the modern theory of exchange rate determination.
Within this perspective exchange rates are viewed as the prices of assets that
are treded in organized markets and, like the prices of other assets, are
strongly influenced by expectations about future events.
The relationship between exchange rates and interest rates is analysed in
Section III from the perspective of the monetary approach to the exchange rate.
This analysis is of particular relevance in view of the new policies of the Federal
Reserve Board that are intended to curb inflation and to support the dollar and

which were announced on October 6, 1979. One of the key issues that is raised

3

in this section is the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated

changes in rates of interest. The policy implication of this distinction is
obvious. As an analytical matter this distinction is important because the
modern approach to exchange rate determination implies that exchange rates
are strongly influenced by "news" which by definition are unpredicted.
Therefore, unanticipated rather than anticipated changes in interest rates

should have a strong effect on changes in exchange rates. This prediction is
tested empirically.

Section IV analyses the relationship between exchange rates and prices

by examining the patterns of deviation from purchasing power parities. This
examination is relevant for assessing whether the flexible exchange rate
system was successful in insulating national economies from foreign shocks,
and whether it provided policy makers with an added instrument for the

conduct of macroeconomic policy. The evidence on deviations from purchasing
power parities is also relevant for the discussion of whether there is a case

for managed float. Section V concludes the paper with some concluding
remarks.

II. The Efficiency of the Foreign Exchange Market and the Movement of
Exchange Rates

In this section I analyse the principal characteristics of the
relationship between spot and forward exchange rates which seem to emerge

from the experience of the 1970's. Following an analysis of the efliciency
of the foreign exchange market I discuss the more general issues underlying
the relationships between spot and forward rates and their volatility.

4

TI.l The Efficiency of the Foreign Exchange Market
One

of

the central insights of the monetary (or the asset market)

approach to the exchange rate is the notion that the exchange rate, being
a relative price of two assets, is determined in a manner similar to the
determination of other asset prices and that expectations concerning
future course of events play a central role in affecting current exchange
rates

If the foreign exchange market is efficient and if the exchange rate is
determined in a fashion similar to the determination of other asset prices, we
should expect current prices to reflect all currently available information.
Expectations concerning future exchange rates should be incorporated and reflected

in forward exchange rates. Thus, to examine the efficiency of the market I
first regress the logarithm of the current spot exchange rate, 2,n S, on
the logarithm of the one—month forward exchange rate prevailing at the
previous month, £n Ft_l, as in equation (l).2

(1)

If the market for foreign exchange is efficient and if the forward

exchange rate is an unbiased forecast of the future spot exchange rate,

then we expect that (1) the constant term in

properties of the foreign exchange market during the German hyperinflation of

exchange rates during the 1920's see Frenkel and Clements (1980), for an
application to the 1920's and the 1970's see Krugman (1977); for an interesting,
analysis using time—series and cross—section data see Bilson (1979), for an

equation (1) should not differ

significantly from zero,3 (ii) the slope

coefficient should not differ significantly from unity and, (iii) the
residuals should be serially uncorrelated. I examine three exchange
rates: the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/Franc and the Dollar/DM. Equation
(1) was estimated using monthly data for the period June 1973 —

July

1979.

The beginning of the period was determined by the attempt to concentrate
on the experience of the current exchange

rate regime (following

the initial post Bretton—Woods transition period). The resulting ordinary
least squares estimates are reported in Table 1. Also reported in Table
1 are additional regressions which will be analysed shortly.

As may be seen for the Dollar/DM

exchange rate the hypotheses that (at the

95 percent confidence level) the constant term does not differ significantly
from zero and that the slope coefficient does not differ significantly from

unity cannot be rejected. These hypotheses are rejected for
the Dollar/Franc exchange rate and are rejected (marginally) for the

Dollar/poundexchange rate. The joint hypotheses, however, that the constant
is zero and that the slope coefficient is

unity can not be rejected at the

95 percent for the Dollar/Pound and the Dollar/DM exchange rates and at the
99 percent for the Dollar/Franc exchange rate. The test statistics for
testing the joint hypotheses are reported in the column headed by F in
Table 1.

It was argued above that in an efficient market, expectations concerning

future exchange rates are reflected in forward rates and, that spot exchange

rates reflect all currently available information. If forward exchange
3More precisely, if (assuming risk neutrality) the forward rate
measures
the expected value of the future spot rate, than the constant term in the
logarithmic equation (1) should be —O.5a2; see Frenkel (1979).

rates

prevailing at period t—l summarize all relevant information available

at that period, they s'iould also contain the information that is summarized

in data corresponding to period t—2. It thus follows that including
additional lagged values of the forward rates in equation (1) should not
greatly affect the coefficients of determination and should not yield

coefficients that differ significantly from zero. The results reported in
Table 1 are consistent with this hypothesis; in all cases the coefficients

of £n t—2 do not differ significantly from zero and the inclusion of the
additional lagged variables does not improve the fit. Furthermore, in all
cases the Durbin—Watson statistics are consistent with the hypothesis of
the absence of first—order autocorrelated residuals and an examination of
higher order correlations (up to 12 lags) shows that no correlation of any
order is significant.

To further examine the relationship between the various exchange
rates we note that one of the assumptions underlying equation (1) was the

notion that the forward exchange rate measures the unobservable value of

the expected future spot exchange rate. This assumption provided the
justification for using equation (1) instead of the more fundamental relationship
that is embodied in equation (2):

where (S

t—l) denotes the expected spot exchange rate for period t based
on the information available at period t — 1. If, however, the forward

exchange rate at t —

is a "noisy" proxy for the expected future value of
the spot rate, (i.e., it measures it with a random error) then we would obtain
that

and substituting equation (3) into equation (2) yields:

(4)

in St = a + b in Ft_i + (E

bvi).

In this case the error term in equation (1) would be

=

— bvi,

and the

assumption that the covariance between in Ft_i and u is zero would entail
a specification error, and the application of the ordinary—least squares (OLS)
procedure would yield inconsistent estimates due to the classical errors in
variables bias.

In order to examine the possibility that the OLS estimates might be
subject to the errors in variables bias, one needs to test the

hypothesis that cov(ut, in F1) = 0.

This test follows the specification

test outlined by Hausman (l978). To perform the test equation (1) was
estimated by applying the OLS procedure as well as by using an instrumental

variables (IV) estimation method. Under the null—hypothesis of no mispecification
the OLS coefficients vector b0 is an efficient and an unbiased estimate

of the true coefficient vector. Under the alternative hypothesis of
misspecification the vector b0 is biased and an unbiased coefficient
vector b1 can be obtained by applying an instrumental variables

estimation procedure. The test—statistic relevant for testing the

the foreign exchange market during the 1970's and by Frenkel (1980a, l980b)

null-hypothesis can be written as

(5)

m =

(b1

-

b0) (var b1 - var b0)1(b - b0)

where var(b1) and

var(b0) denote the variance—covariance matrices of

and b0, respectively. Under the null—hypothesis m is distributed (in
large samples) as

with two

degrees

of freedom. Table 1 reports the

results of estimating equation (1) by applying the instrumental variables

estimation method. As may be seen for all exchange rates the two vectors of
coefficients b1 and b0 are very close to each other. For example for the
Dollar/Pound exchange rate, the constants are .033 and .035 and the slopes
are .956 and .953 —

well below 5.99 ——

consequently, the resulting m statistic is .90 which is

the

critical value of X2(2) at the 95 percent confidence

level. The m statistics corresponding to the other exchange rates are also
below this critical value. It is concluded, therefore, that the use of the
forward exchange rate as a proxy for expectations does not introduce a
significant errors in variables bias and thus the use of the OLS estimation
procedure seems appropriate.

The efficiency of the foreign exchange market and the rationality of
using data from the forward market to measure expectations can also be analysed

from a different angle. Consider equation (6):

(6)

=

o+

at +

+

+ wt

where x denotes the percentage change in the spot exchange rate (2n St —

in
in

S....1), ir1 denotes the forward premium on foreign exchange (in Ft_1 —

Sr_i), t denotes time, n denotes the number of lags, and w denotes an

error term. If

summarizes all available information concerning the

future evolution of the exchange rate, then given the value of the forward

10

premium t—l' the past history of the percentage change of the exchange rate
should not "help" the prediction (i.e., the past history should not be viewed
as Granger—causing future changes), and the joint hypotheses that a and f3.
1

are zero should not be rejected. The results of applying these tests
to the three exchange rates for various number of lags are reported in Table
2; also reported in Table 2 are the results of testing the joint hypotheses
that a1 and

are zero and that 'y,

the

coefficient of the forward premium,

is unity. The relevant statistic for testing the null—hypothesis is an F—
statistic which is reported in Table 2. As is evident in all cases the
null—hypothesis can not be rejected at the 95 percent confidence level
since the values of the various F—statistics fall well below the corresponding

critical values. It is concluded therefore that the forward premium on
foreign exchange may be viewed as a rational expectations measure of the
percentage depreciation of the currency in that it incorporates the
available information that is contained in the series of past depreciations.

The principal conclusions that may be drawn from the previous
discussion are that the behavior of the foreign exchange market during the
1970's has been broadly consistent with the general implications of the
efficient market hypothesis and that the forward exchange rate summarizes the
relevant available information concerning the future evolution of the rate.

11.2 Exchange Rate Movement: Volatility and Predictability
In this section I analyse the volatility of exchange rates and the

extent to which this volatility is predictable. To set the stage for the
analysis I present in Figure 1 the percentage daily and quarterly changes in

the three exchange rates. This figure indicates that the various exchange
rates have been very volatile and that the degree of volatility of day—to—day
changes in the exchange rates have been extraordinarily high and has been

much smaller when averaged over longer periods.

Further, the standard errors

of the regressions in Table 1 indicate that the forecasts of future spot

exchange rates based on the forward rates are imprecise: the standard errors
of the equations are about 3 percent per month.

These characteristics of price changes are typical to auction and

to organized asset markets. In such markets current prices reflect expectations
concerning future course of events, and changes in expectations are immediately

reflected in corresponding changes in prices. Periods which are dominated by
uncertainties, new information, rumors and announcements, are likely to be
periods in which changes in expectations are the prime cause of fluctuations

in asset prices. Further, since the information which alters expectations
must be new, the resulting fluctuations in price cannot be predicted by lagged
forward exchange rates which are based on past information.

5

Therefore,

during such periods, one should expect exchange rates to exhibit large
fluctuations and to be unbiased but imprecise forecasts of future spot rates.
To gain further insights into the implications of this perspective on
the relationship between predicted and realized changes in exchange rates, I
present in Figures 2—4 plots of predicted and realized changes in exchange rates
for the three pairs of currencies where the predicted change is measured by

the lagged forward premium. Also presented in these Figures are the
differentials in national inflation rates which are discussed in Section IV.

The key fact which emerges from these figures is that predicted changes in
exchange rates account for a very small fraction of actual changes.6
5The analysis of the role of "news" in determining current exchange
rates and in explaining forecast errors from the forward rate has been made
forcefully by Nussa (1976a, l976b, 1977, l979a). See also Dornbusch (1978).
The large degree of volatility is also analysed by McKinnon (1976) who
attributes it to insufficient speculation.
6These and the following empirical regularities are analysed in detail
in Mussa (1979a). See also Frenkel and Mussa (1980). An interesting extension
would examine the relationship between the variances of predicted and actual
changes in exchange rates in a manner analogous tothat of Shiller (1979).

This fact suggests that the bulk of exchange rate changes seem to be due to
"new information" which, by definition, could not have been anticipated and

reflected in the forward premium or discount which prevailed in the previous
period.

In order to examine this hypothesis I present in Figures 5—7 plots
of the spot and the contemporaneous forward exchange rates for the three pairs

of currencies. Also presented are the ratios of national price levels which
are discussed in Section IV. If the dominant factor underlying changes in
rates is "new information" which alters views about current and expected
future exchange rates by approximately the same amount, then one should

expect a high correlation between movements of spot and forward rates. This
fact is clearly demonstrated by Figures 5—7 where it is seen that spot and
forward exchange rates tend to move together and by approximately the same
amplitude (the vertical difference between the two rates correspond to the

forward premium or discount on foreign exchange). The high correlation between
movements in spot and forward rates is expected since the two rates respond

at the same time to the same flow of new information. This characteristic
is typical to the foreign exchange market as well as to other markets for

stocks and durable assets. The recent pattern of gold prices provides a
useful example of this general principle. Table 3 reports the spot and the
future price of gold as recorded recently in the New York Commodity Exchange

on four recent consecutive days. The two key facts which are illustrated by this
Table are the extent of day—to—day volatility in gold prices and the
uniformity by which these changes are reflected in the price of gold for
immediate delivery as well as in the prices for the twelve future delivery
dates.

Another feature which is revealed by Figures 5—7 is that the
contemporaneous spot and forward exchange rates are approximately equal
and thus indicating that the market's best forecast of the future spot

rate is (approximately) the current spot rate. This phenomenon reflects the
fact that, as an empirical matter, exchange rates have followed (approximately)

a randon walk process. For such a process current prices are indeed the best
forecasts of future prices. To the extent that the exchange rate had some
drift, the above statement should be interpreted in reference to that drift.
This empirical phenomenon seems to correspond to the actual paths of exchange
rates even though it does not reflect a theoretical necessity.

The final characteristic of the foreign exchange market is described
by Figures 8—10 which plot for the three pairs of currencies the spot exchange

rate and the forward premium on-forward exchange. Since the units of the spot
rate and the forward premium are fundamentally different, the two series were
normalized by subtracting from each series its mean and by dividing by the

corresponding standard error. The fact which emerges from these Figures is
that generally (though not always) there is a positive correlation between
the

expected depreciation of the currency (as measured by the forward premium

on foreign exchange) and the spot exchange rate. This positive correlation
may be

are

rationalized by noting that currencies which are expected to depreciate

traded at a discount in the forward market and, on average, these

currencies also command a lower foreign exchange value in the spot market.
This correlation is interpreted further in the next Section.

III. Exchange Rates, Interest Rates and Innovations
In this section I analyse the relationship between exchange rates and
interest rates from the analytical perspective of the monetary approach to

the exchange rate. To set the stage for the analytical development it is
useful to recall the typical analysis which generally predicts a negative
association between the rate of interest and the exchange rate. According
to that analysis a higher rate of interest attracts foreign capital which
induces a surplus in the capital account of the balance of payments and
thereby induces an appreciation of the domestic currency (i.e., a lower spot

exchange rate). Another variant of the popular approach states that the
higher rate of interest lowers spending and thus induces a surplus in the
current account of the balance of payments which results in a lower spot exchange

rate. A third variant of this approach claims that the higher rate of interest
implies (via the interest parity theory) a higher forward premium on foreign
exchange and to the extent that at a given point in time the forward exchange
rate is predetermined by past history, (an assumption that is clearly rejected
by the evidence on the comovements of spot and forward rates), the required
rise in the forward premium will be brought about by a lower spot rate (i.e.,

by an appreciation of the domestic currency). Whatever the route, this
approach predicts a negative relationship between the rate of interest and
the spot exchange rate (or alternatively, a positive relationship between
the rate of interest and the foreign exchange value of the domestic currency).
These predictions, however, do not seem to be in accord with the

broad facts. Over the recent period the rise in the rate of interest in
the U.S. (relative to the foreign rate of interest) has been associated with
a rise in the spot exchange rate (i.e., with a depreciation of the dollar).
Figure 11 illustrates the point by plotting the foreign exchange value of

the U.S. dollar against the interest rate differential. As is evident, in

contrast with the popular prediction, the higher (relative) rate of interest
in the U.S. has been associated with a higher exchange rate (i.e., with a

lower foreign exchange value of the dollar). This contradiction however does
not arise when the exchange rate is analysed from a monetary (or an asset
market) perspective to which we now turn.

The major building blocks of the monetary approach are hypotheses
concerning the properties of the demand for money and money market equilibrium
and hypotheses concerning the link between domestic and foreign prices.7

Consider first the equilibrium in the money markets. The supplies of
domestic and foreign real balances are M/P and M*/P* where M and P denote
the nominal money supply and the price level, respectively, and where variables

pertaining to the foreign country are indicated by an asterisk. Denoting the
demands for real balances by L and L* (both of which are functions which
are specified below), equilibrium in the money markets is attained when

(7)

L = M/P and

(8)

L* =

M*/P*.

From equations (7)—(8), equilibrium in the money markets implies that the
ratio of the two price levels is:

()

P _M L*

p*M*L

7For theoretical developments and applications of the approach see,
for example, Dornbusch (1976a, 1976b), Kouri (1976), Mussa (1976a),Frenkel
(1976), Frenkel and Johnson (1978), Frenkel and Clements (1980), Bilson (1978),
Hodrick (1978), and Frankel (1979).

The second building block links domestic and foreign prices. Assuming
the simple version of purchasing power parity implies that:8

which expresses the exchange rate in terms of domestic and foreign supplies

exchange rate and to set the stage for the empirical estimation, assume that

according to:

used in equation (10) see Frenke]. (1978). This simple version of the purchasing
power parity theory Is used here to simplify the exposition. To the extent

that there are systematic deviations

from purchasing power parity they can
be incorporated into the final exchange rate equation; Similarly, to the
extent that purchasing power parities holds in the long run but not in the
short run, the final exchange rate equation will reflect these dynamic
characteristics. To the extent that purchasing power parity pertains
to traded goods only, the exchange rate equation would also contain
terms which relate to the relative prices of traded to non—traded goods;
for a formulation along these lines see Dornbusch (1976b) and for an
empirical application see Clements and Frenkel (1980). A more refined
specification would allow for the effects of tariffs on the relationship
between domestic and foreign prices as well as for short—run effects of
unanticipated money on output rather than only on prices and the exchange
rate.

Equation (14) relates the exchange rate to the ratios of domestic to foreign
money supplies and incomes and to the interest rate differential.9 Most
pertinent to the present purpose and in agreement with the facts summarized
by Figure 11, equation (14) yields a positive relationship between the rate of

interest and the exchange rate. The economic interpretation of this association
in the context of the U.S. dollar and the inflationary environment is as
follows: a rise in the domestic (relative) rate of interest is primarily
dominated by a rise in the expected (relative) rate of inflation which induces
a decline in the demand for real cash balances; for a given path of the
nominal money supply asset market equilibrium requires a price level which

is higher than the price which would have prevailed otherwise. Since the
domestic price level is linked to the foreign price through some form of
purchasing power parity, and since the path of the foreign price is assumed
to be given, the higher domestic price can only be achieved through a rise
in the spot exchange rate (i.e., through a depreciation of the currency).
This explanation of the positive association between interest rates
and exchange rates has an intuitive appeal in that it implies that in an

inflationary environment a relatively rapid rise in prices is associated
with high nominal rates of interest as well as with a depreciation of the

9it should be noted that a similar set of variables would also
appear in the reduced form of a variety of alternative models. The dependence
of the demand for domestic money on the domestic rate of interest and the
dependence of the demand for foreign money on foreigii rate of interest is
assumed only for simplicity of exposition. A more general formulation would
recognize that the demands for domestic and foreign monies depend on all
margins of substitution. See Frenkel and Clements (1980).

31

currency in terms of foreign exchange. The traditional prediction of a
negative relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate may
however be reconciled with the monetary approach under the assumption that it
concentrates on the short—run liquidity effects of monetary changes.

Accordingly, in the short—run, a higher rate of interest may arise from
tight money which induces an appreciation rather than a depreciation of the
currency.

It should be emphasized however that during an inflationary

environment (like the one prevailing in the U.S. in recent years) the
variations in the rate of interest are most likely to be dominated by
variations in inflationary expectations rather than by liquidity effects

associated with changes

in the ratio of money to bonds. In such an

environment the rate of interest is expected to be positively correlated with
the exchange rate.

The discussion provides an illustration of the difficulties associated

with using the rate of interest as the relevant monetary indicator. Traditionally,
the height of the rate of interest was the criterion for assessing whether
monetary policy has been easy or tight: a high interest rate was interpreted
as indicating a tight monetary policy while a low interest rate was interpreted

as indicating an easy monetary policy. By now it is well recognized that
during inflationary periods it is vital to draw a distinction between nominal
and real rates of interest and, as a result, during inflationary periods the
rate of interest may provide a very misleading interpretation of the stance

of monetary policy. The same logic applies with respect to the analysis of the
relationship between exchange rates and interest rates.

rhe short—run liquidity effects is emphasized in Dornbusch (l976b).
The role of inflationary expectations in dominating excharice rate developments is
emphasized in Frenkel (1976). Frankel (1979) and Edwards (1979) attempt to
integrate these two factors.

32

The foregoing analysis also provides the explanation for the observation
(which was noted in Section 11.2) that generally there is a positive correlation

between the forward premium on foreign exchange and the level of the spot

rate. Since the spot rate is expected to be positively correlated with
interest rate differential and since according to the interest parity theory
that differential must equal the forward premium on foreign exchange, it
follows that the forward premium is also expected to be positively correlated

with the level of the spot rate.11 That positive correlation may also be
rationalized by noting that currencies which are expected to depreciate
are traded at a discount in the forward market and, on average, these
currencies also command a lower foreign exchange value in the spot market.
Prior

to proceeding with the empirical evidence on the relationship

between exchange rates and interest rates it

might

be useful to highlight

some of the main features of the monetary approach which are reflected in
equations (11) and (14). First, these equations demonstrate the symmetric
roles that are being played by the supplies of domestic and foreign monies

and the demands for these monies. Since the demands for monies depend on real
variables like real incomes as well as on other real variables which underlie
expectations and rates of interest, it is clear that the monetary approach

"For evidence on the robustness of the interest parity relationship
see Frenkel and Levich (1977). The positive association between the spot
exchange rate and the forward premium has been interpreted in terms of an
explicit monetary model. It is noteworthy that this positive association
would be predicted by any model in which current exchange rate reflects

immediately the expectations of future depreciation.
(1976a) and Frenkel and Mussa (1980). Since the rate

See for example Mussa
of interest and the
exchange rate are dimensionally incomensurate, their association raise
questions that are familiar from the discussions of the Gibson Paradox. In a
separate paper I intend to examine the relationship between exchange rates
and the forward premium (or the interest differential) in light of the
various explanations of the Gibson Paradox.

does not imply that the exchange rate depends only on the relative supplies
of money; nor does it imply that real variables do not affect the equilibrium

exchange rate. Second, from the policy perspective the monetary approach
brings to the forefront the implications of the homogeneity postulate:
ceteris paribus a rise in the quantity of money results in an equiproportionate

rise in the exchange rate. This illustrates the intimate connection between

monetary policy and exchange rate policy. Third, the
positive relationship between interest rates and exchange rates and the central
role played by inflationary expectations imply that policies which attempt to
induce an appreciation of the currency should aim at reducing inflationary

expectations. The reduction in inflationary expectations would halt the
depreciation of the currency in terms of goods and in terms of foreign
exchange, and would result in lower nominal rates of interest while maintaining
(or even raising) real rates of interest.

The discussion in Section II and in particular the contributions by
Mussa (1977, l979a) and Dornbusch (1978) emphasized that the predominant cause

of exchange rate movements are news which could not have been anticipated. It

was also argued in Section II that the forward rate seems to summarize the
information that is available to the market when the forward rate is being

set. We may therefore express the spot rate at period t as a function of
factors which have been known in advance and are summarized by the lagged
forward rate, as well as a function of the tInews.?

(15)

in S = a + b in Ft_i + "news't
The empirical difficulty is in identifying the variable which measures

the "news." Assuming that asset markets clear relatively fast and that the "news"
are immediately reflected in (unexpected) changes in the rates of interest we
may

write

equation (15) as

34

where the bracketed term denotes the innovation in the interest differential

and where Eti (i —

denotes the interest differential which was expected

to prevail in period t based on the information available at t —

1.

The

expected interest rate differential was computed from a regression of the
interest differential on a constant and on two lagged values of the differential.12
The previous analysis of the relationship between interest rate differential
and the exchange rate implies that the coefficient

is expected to be positive.

Table 4 reports the OLS estimates of equation (16) for the three

exchange rates over the period June 1973—July 1979. As may be seen, in all
cases the coefficients of the unexpected interest differential are positive

and in most cases the coefficients are statistically significant. In order to
verify the importance of using the series of innovations in the interest
differential, Table 4 also reports estimates of regressions which replace the
innovations by the actual series of the interest differential as well as
regressions which include both the innovation and the actual differential.
In all cases the coefficients of the actual interest differential do not
differ significantly from zero.

13

To allow for a simultaneous determination

of interest rates and exchange rates, equation (16) was also estimated using

a two—stage—least—squares estimation procedure. These results are reported in
Table 5 in which again in all cases the coefficients of the

unexpected

interest differential are positive. These coefficients are highly significant

12An alternative way to compute the expected differential would
use data on the term structure of interest rates. Since data on the
differential of 2—month rates are not readily available, this computation
would require interpolations.

'3In order to check whether the dollar rescue policies of November 1978
have had a systematic effect on the estimates, these regressions were also
estimated for the period up to September 1978. The results did not change
materially.

On the whole the record shows that during the 1970's exchange rates and
interest rate differential have been associated positively and thus indicating
that during that inflationary period the same factors which induced a rise in
the interest differential also induced a rise in the spot exchange rates.
Furthermore, consistent with the hypothesis that current changes in exchange
rates are primarily a response to new information, the evidence shows the
importance of the innovations in che interest differential.

The principle that current exchange rates already reflect expectations
concerning the future course of events implies that changes in exchange rates

are primarily due to innovations. In the present section this principle was
applied to the analysis of the relationship between exchange rates and interest

rate differential. The principle however is general. For example, it implies
that the relationship between a deficit in the balance of trade and the
exchange rate depends crucially on whether the deficit was expected or not.
A deficit that was expected may have no effect on the exchange rate since

the latter already reflected these expectations. In contrast, an unexpected
deficit in the balance of trade may contain significant new information that
is likely to induce a strong effect on the exchange rate.14

14For a further elaboration on the relationship between exchange rates,
and the current account see Dornbusch and Fischer (1978) and Rodriguez (1978).
For a special emphasis on the role of innovations in the trade balance see
Mussa (1979c) and for empirical evidence see Hakkio (1979b).

Iv.

Exchange Rates and Prices
One of the striking facts concerning the relationship between prices

and exchange rates during the 1970's is the extent to which the evolution of
prices and exchange rates have not coincided.

The originators and

proponents of the purchasing power parity doctrine (Wheatley and Ricardo
during the first part of the 19th century and Cassel during the 1920's) have
viewed the doctrine as an extension of the quantity theory of money to the

open economy. By now the concensus seems to be that purchasing power
parities can be expected to hold in the long—run if most of the shocks to
the system are of a monetary origin which do not require changes in relative

prices. To the extent that most of the shocks reflect "real" changes (like
differential growth rates among sectors), the required changes in sectoral
relative prices may result in a relatively loose connection between exchange

rates and aggregate price levels. The experience during the 1970's illustrates
the extent to which real shocks (oil embargo, supply shocks, commodity booms

and shortages, differential productivity growth) result in systematic deviations

from purchasing power parities. As illustrated in Figures 2—4 short run
changes in exchange rates have not been closely linked to short run
differentials in the corresponding national inflation rates, particularly as

measured by consumer price indices. Furthermore, this loose link seems to
be cumulative. As illustrated in Figures 5—7 divergences from purchasing
power parities, measured in terms of the relationship between exchange rates
and the ratio of consumer price indices, seem to persist.

The loose link between prices and exchange rates is illustrated in
Table 6 which reports the results of regressions of changes in the

exchange rates on changes in (wholesale) prices. As may be seen, for the
Dollar/Pound and the Dollar/Franc exchange rate the slope coefficients are

very close to unity; for the Dollar/DM exchange rate the slope coefficient

is less close to unity. Furthermore, in all cases the parameter estimates
are extremely imprecise. The results are even poorer when the wholesale
price indices are replaced by the cost of living indices. It should be noted,
however, that to some extent this phenomenon is specific to the 1970's.
During the floating rates period of the 1920's, the doctrine of purchasing
power parities seems to have been much more reliable.15
The discussion in Section II emphasized that in periods which are
dominated by "news," which alter expectations, exchange rates (and other

asset prices) are expected to be highly volatile. Aggregate price indices
on the other hand are not expected to reveal such a degree of volatility since
they reflect the prices of goods and services which are less durable and
therefore are likely to be less sensitive to the news which alter expectations

concerning future course of events. It follows therefore that in periods
during which there are ample "news" which cause large fluctuations in exchange
rates there will also be large deviations from purchasing power parities.16
The different degrees of volatility of prices and exchange rates are
illustrated in Table 7 which reports the average absolute monthly percentage

changes in the various exchange rates and prices. As is evident, the mean
absolute change in the various spot exchange rates has been about 2 percent
per month (and even slightly higher for the changes in the forward rate).
The magnitudes of these changes have been more than double the magnitudes

1For evidence see Frenkel (1976, 1978, l980b) and Krugman (1978).

l6 this see Nussa (l979a). It is noteworthy that the emphasis in
the text has been on the words large fluctuations; this should be contrasted
with periods during which there are large secular changes in the exchange
rate (like the changes which occurred during the German hyperinflation).
During such periods the secular changes do not stem necessarily from "news"
and need not be associated with deviations from purchasing power parities.

of

the changes in most of the various price indices as well as in the

ratios of national price levels. For example, the mean monthly change in
the cost of living price index was .4 percent in Germany, .7 percent in the

U.s., .9 percent in France and 1.2 percent in the U.K. These differences are
even more striking for the detrended series.

The notion that exchange rates have been volatile is clearly illustrated

by Figures 2—4 and by Table 7. The comparison of the magnitudes of the
changes in the exchange rates with the magnitudes of the changes in the price
indices and in the ratios of national price levels may suggest, according
to a narrow interpretation of the purchasing power parity doctrine, that

exchange rate fluctuations have been "excessive." The previous discussion
however has emphasized that exchange rates, being the relative prices of
assets, are fundamentally different from the price indices of goods and
services and therefore are expected to exhibit a different degree of volatility

in particular during periods that are dominated by "news." An alternative
yardstick for measuring the degree of exchange rate fluctuations would be a

comparison with prices of other assets. Indeed, while exchange rate changes
have been large relative to changes in national price levels, they have been
considerably smaller than changes in the prices of other assets like gold,
silver, many other commodities that are traded in organized markets, and

common stocks. For example, Table 7 also reports the mean absolute monthly

percentage change in stock market indices. As may be seen the mean monthly
change in these indices ranged from over 3 percent in Germany to over 6

percent in the U.K. By these standards it is difficult to argue that exchange
rates have been excessively volatile.

The fundamental difference between the characteristics of exchange
rates and national price levels is also reflected in their time series

properties. The monthly changes in exchangerates exhibit little or no
serial correlation while national price levels do exhibit a degree of serial

correlation. The serial correlation of national price levels has been
rationalized in recent macroeconomic theorizing in terms of costs of price
adjustment, the existence of nominal contracts, confusion between relative
and absolute prices and confusion between permanent and transitory changes.
This difference between the time series properties of exchange rates and
prices is reflected in the low correlation between the practically random
month—to—month exchange rate changes and the serially correlated differences
between national rates of inflation.
Given the short run deviations from purchasing power parities, it
is relevant to explore whether these deviations tend to diminish with time

or tend to persist or even grow in size. In order to examine the patterns of
the deviations I have computed the autocorrelation functions and the partial
autocorrelation functions of these deviations for the wholesale and the cost

of living price indices. The deviation from purchasing power parities during
month t is denoted by A and is defined as:

(17)

= 2n St —

in(P/P*)

Figures 12—14 illustrate the patterns of the deviations for the three exchange

rates. As may be seen the general pattern is very similar for the three
exchange rates and for the two price indices. In all cases the autocorrelation
function tails off at what seems to be an exponential rate and in all cases

the partial autocorrelation function shows a spike at the first lag. This
pattern seems to indicate (as might have been expected on the basis
of the time series properties of exchange rates and price indices)
that the deviations from purchasing power parities follow a first order

autoregressive process. It is noteworthy, however, that in all cases the
value of the autoregression term is about 0.9 indicating the possibility

that the series may not satisfy the

stationarity requirement. To allow for

this possibility I have also examined the autocorrelation functions and the
partial autocorrelation functions of

—

t—l'

i.e., of the first difference

of the deviations from purchasing power parities. The results indicate that
these differences are serially uncorrelated and thus implying that the
deviations

follow a random walk processP In view of this possibility i

conclude that the deviations from purchasing power parities seem to follow
a first order autoregressive process but that the data do not provide
sufficient evidence to reject the alternative hypothesis of a random walk.
Finally it may be noted that the main difference between accepting the AR(l)

rather than the random walk hypothesis relates to the economic interpretation

of the two alternative processes. The random walk process implies that
deviations from purchasing power parities do not tend to diminish with the

passage of time while the stableAR(l) process implies that there are
mechanisms which operate to ensure that in the long run pruchasing power

parities are satisfied. For the purpose of forecasting the near future,
however, there is a very little difference between using the AR(l) process

with an autoregressive coefficient of 0.9 and using the random walk process.

V. Concluding Remarks
In this paper I examined some aspects of the operation of flexible

exchange rates. The analysis was based on the experience of the 1970's. The
principle conclusions which may be drawn from the empirical work are:

(i) In spite of the extraordinary turbulence in the markets for foreign

171f the deviations follow a random walk process than they do not
entail (ex ante) unexploited profit opportunities. For an analysis of
equilibrium deviations from purchasing power parities see Saidi (1977).

48

*

exchange, it seems that to a large extent the markets have operated
efficiently. It should be noted however that the concept of
"efficiency" that is being used in this context is somewhat narrow
in that it only refers to the notion that the markets do not seem

to entail unexploited profit opportunities. A broader perspective
should deal with the social cost of volatility in terms of the
interference with the efficiency of the price system in guiding
resource allocation as well as with the cost of alternative outlets
for the disturbances that are currently reflected in the volatility
of exchange rates.

(ii) The high volatility of exchange rates (spot and forward) reflect an
intrinsic characteristic of the relative price of monies and other

assets. The price of gold, the price of stocks as well as exchange
rates between national monies depend critically on expectations
concerning future course of events, and adjust rapidly in response

to new information. In this perspective the exchange rate (in
contrast with the relative price of national outputs) is being
viewed as a financial variable.
(iii) During inflationary periods variations in nominal rates of interest
are dominated by changes in inflationary expectations; as a result,

high nominal rates of interest are expected to be associated with
high exchange rates (a depreciated currency). This relationship was
demonstrated within the analytical framework of the monetary approach

to the exchange rate, and was supported by the empirical work. In this
context the key finding was the dependence of exchange rate changes

on the changes in the rates of interest. This finding is in accord
with the analytical prediction that current exchange rates already
reflect current expectations about the future while changes in the

49

current exchange rates reflect primarily changes in these expectations
which, by definition, arise from new information.
(iv) 'Ifle experience ot trie 1970's does not support the predictions of the

simple version of the purchasing power parity doctrine which relates
the values of current prices to current exchange rates. The empirical

work showed that deviations from purchasing power parities can be
characterized by a first order autoregressive process.
One of the key analytical insights that is provided by the

monetary (or the asset market) approach to the exchange rate is that
exchange rates do not reflect only current circumstances but also
reflect those circumstances which are expected to prevail in the

future. This anticipatory feature of the exchange rate (which is
emphasized by Mussa, 1979b) does not characterize (at least to such

a degree) the prices of national outputs. As a result, during periods
which are dominated by frequent changes in expectations about the future,
one may expect to find frequent deviations from purchasing power parities
when the later are computed using current prices.18

18This phenomenon was recognized by Gustav Cassel —— the most
recognized proponent of the purchasing power parity doctrine. Since
this paper was prepared for presentation on October 20, 1979 —— the date
of Cassel's birthday (Cassel was born on October 20, 1866) it seems
appropriate to conclude with the quote that reflects this key idea.

"The international valuation of the currency will, then
generally show a tendency to anticipate events, so to speak,
and become more an expression of the internal value that
the currency is expected to possess in a few months, or
perhaps in a year's time" (Cassel, 1930, pp. 149—50).

DATA APPENDIX
1. Exchange Rates

The spot exchange rates are end of month rates obtained from the IMF tape
(May 1979 version, updated to July 1979 using the November 1979 issue of the
International Financial Statistics) obtained from the International Monetary Fund.
The forward exchange rates are end of month rates for one month

maturity. The forward rates for the U.K. Pound and the DM for the period
Jund 1973 — June 1978 are bid prices obtained from the International Money

Market (1MM). For the period July 1978 —

July

1979 they are sell prices

obtained from the Wall Street Journal. The forward rates for the French
Franc for the period June 1973 —

July

1974 are bid prices calculated from

the Weekly Review publication of the Harris Bank which reports the spot rate
and the forward premium; in each case the closest Friday to the end of the

month was chosen. For the period August 1974 — June 1978 the rates are bid
rates obtained from the 1MM and for the period July 1978 —

July

1979 they

are sell prices obtained from the Wall Street Journal.

2. Prices
The wholesale and cost of living price indices are period averages obtained
from the IMP tape, lines 63 and 64, respectively.

3. Rates of Interest
All interest rates are 1—month Eurocurrency rates obtained from the Weekly

Review of the Harris Bank. In all cases the figures used correspond to the
last Friday of each month.

4. Stock Markets
The stock market indices correspond to the last trading day of the month. The
sources are Capital International Perspective, Geneva, Switzerland, monthly
issues.
