The Mark' III International Transmission Model

ABSTRACT

This paper presents a summary and estimates of the Mark III International
Transmission Model, a quarterly macroeconometric model of the United States,
United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands

estimated for 1957 through 1976. The model is formulated to test and measure
the empirical importance of alternative channels of international transmission
including the effects of capital and trade flows on the money supply, of export
shocks on aggregate demand, of currency substitution on money demand, and of
variations in the real price of oil.
Major Implications of the model estimates are:

(1) Countries linked by

pegged exchange rates appear to have much more national economic independence than

generally supposed. (2) Substantial or complete sterilization of the effects
of contemporaneous reserve flows on the money supply is a universal practice
of the nonreserve central banks. (3) Qtiantities such as international trade
flows and capital flows are not wei.1 explained by observed prices, exchange

rates, and interest rates. (4) Explaining real income by innovations in
aggregate demand variables works well for U.S. real income but does not trans-

fer easily to other countires. The empirical results suggest a rich menu
for further research.

The Mark III International Transmission Model provides a convenient
framework for testing a variety of hypotheses about the workings of and
linkages among individual macroeconomies. It is a quarterly niacroeconometric
model of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, and the Netherlands estimated for 1957 through 1976.1 A number of
hypotheses are incorporated in the structure of the model so that the data
can decide their empirical relevance; test results for those hypotheses will

be reported in this paper. Other hypotheses could be left for separate

*The Mark III Model is an element in the NBER project on "The International
Transmission of Inflation through the World Monetary System." Our partners
in this effort —— Arthur E. Gandolfi, James R. Lothian, and Anna J. Schwartz
have made innumerable contributions to this modeling and created the NBER
quarterly international data base used in estimating the model. The authors
acknowledge the able research assistance of Daniel N. Laskar, Michael T.
Melvin, M. Holly Shissler, and Andrew A. Vogel and helpful suggestions from
members of the project Advisory Board and the UCLA Monetary Economics Workshop. An exploratory version of the model was reported in Darby (1979). A
fuller statement (Including derivations) of the model summarized here will
appear in the proposed NBER volume reporting project results. This work has
been funded by grants from the National Science Foundation (grant numbers
APR76—l2334 and APR78—13072), Scaife Family trusts, and Alex C. Walker
Educational and Charitable Foundation, and Relm Foundation. The research
reported here is part of the NBER's research program in International Studies.

1The international data base created as part of the larger project has consistent data series for all these countries from 1955 to 1976, but two years
of data are used due to various lags in the model and in the definitions of
expected values. The data bank is presently being extended through 1979.
These additional data will be used for post—sample prediction tests.

I. The Model

Brief ly the model consists of three sorts of submodels: (1) the reserve country (U.S.) submodel, (2) the nonreserve, pegged—exchange—rate

submodels, and (3) the nonreserve, floating—exchange—rate submodels. These
submodels are outlined in Tables 2, 3, and 4, respectively, using the nota-

tion of Table 1. Since these submodels are quite similar it is simplest to
go through them equation—by—equation. The reserve and nonreserve pegged
submodels each consist of eight or nine behavioral equations plus nine

identities. These basic behavioral equations can be identified by the
endogenous variable upon which we have normalized for simultaneous estimation as the real—income, price—level, unemployment—rate, nominal—money,

interest—rate, export, import, import—price, and capital—flow equations. An
additional behavioral equation is added for the nonreserve—floating submodels
where the exchange rate is also endogenous. In these submodels we renortual—
ize the import and import—price equations to obtain the exchange rate given
the balance of payments determined in the new exchange intervention function.
This is detailed in the equation outlines below.

Real Income — Equations (Rl) and (Ni)

The real income equation is a generalization of the Barro (1978)
equation which expresses output as responding to shocks (innovations) in the
determinants of aggregate demand with persistance effects modeled by a partial adjustment process on lagged logarthmic transitory income
[log y.

The innovations which we consider (in nominal

money, real government spending, and scaled net exports) enter with a four—
quarter distributed lag, so the partial adjustment process is really imposed only after the initial four quarters.

4

Price Level —

Equations CR2) and (N2)

The price level equation is obtained by equating nominal money supply

and demand and solving for the price level. The demand for money function
used is generalized from that of Carr and Darby (1979). The Carr—Darby
function allows for different adjustment processes depending on whether a

change in nominal money is anticipated or unanticipated. The logarithm of
real money demand is assumed to be a function of logarithmic permanent and
transitory income, the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate
allowing for expected depreciation, the lagged logarithm of real money, and

a four—quarter distributed lag on the money shocks.2 Thus a typical non—
reserve money demand function would be:

Renormalizing in terms of the price level gives us equation(Nl) with the
signs reversed from those of the money—demand equation. A negative sign on
M. in the price level equation implies that there is a shock—absorber increase in money demand due to an unanticipated increase in nominal money
supply over and above that indicated by movements in real income and the
interest rate.

2The foreign interest rate is included at the suggestion of Don Mathieson
and Michael Hamburger to test for the substitutability of foreign bonds for
domestic money. The U.S. interest rate is used for the nonreserve countries
and the U.K. interest rate is used for the United States. Carr and Darby
(1979) entered only the current money shock, but our distributed lag permits the data to determine a more complicated adjustment process.

5

Unemployment Rate —

Equations

(R3) and (N3)

This is a dynamic form of Okun's law to allow for a distributed lag

effect of real income growth on changes in the unemployment rate. It is
included only in the U.S., U.K., and French subniodels. The other countries
in the model have unemployment rates which are uncorrelated with present

and past changes in real income. For those countries, transitory real income replaces the unemployment rate in the nominal money reaction functions.

Nominal Noney —

Equations

(R4) and (N4)

A standard nominal money reaction function (N4) has been adopted for

the nonreserve countries. We have specified a form with sufficient generality
to allow for varying lags in acquisition and utilization of information by

the various monetary authorities.3 The reaction functions explain the
nominal money growth rate by the current and appropriately lagged balance of
payments, the lagged unemployment rate or transitory real income, lagged
inflation rates, and current and lagged innovations in real government

spending. Semiannual observations were used for lagged values to reduce the
number of fitted coefficients except for the unemployment—rate or transitory—
income variable for which preliminary experimentation suggested a complicated

lag pattern. Since under floating exchange rates more attention can be
paid to inflation goals and less to balance—of—payments equilibrium, we
used a floating dummy variable (DF.) to estimate shifts in the inflation

and balance—of—payments coefficients during the floating period. The U.S.
equation CR4) differs from the nonreserve equations in (a) omitting all terms

3Preliminary investigation uncovered substantial variation in how quickly
different countries responded to the various determinants. In the exploratory
Mark II version of the model, money reaction functions were tailored to the
individual countries (see Darby (1979)). Experience with that approach indicated both difficulties in cross—country comparisons and with understated
standard errors. The approach also does not prejudge whether domestic credit
is predetermined.

involving the balance of paytnents4 and the floating dununy and (b) including

two lagged dependent variables in response to a seemingly complicated adjustment process indicated by earlier work.

Interest Rate —

Equations

(R5) and (N5)

The interest rate is based on a goods market equilibrium condition,
but problems were encountered in specifying a dynamic investment function,
As a result, we explain the nominal interest rate by the expected infla-

tion rate and the real interest rate. The latter depends on the
lagged expected inflation rate, time, the lagged interest rate and four—
quarter—distributed lags on innovations in nominal money, real government

spending and real net exports. Thus, the interest rate and real income equations can be interpreted as reflecting the outcome of a short—period IS—LM
model which shifts around long—run equilibrium in response to current and

lagged innovations in the demand variables. Persistent effects on the real
interest rate are possible via the lagged expected—inflation and interest
rates.

Exports —

Equations

(R6) and (N6)

We measure exports as a fraction of income.

5

These scaled exports are

explained by logarithmic transitory income, time, the lagged dependent variable to allow for partial adjustment, foreign real income, the logarithm of
the real price of oil (dollar price divided by the U.S. deflator), and four
quarter distributed lags on the domestic and foreign price levels and on the

4mis exclusion was investigated at length in work reported in Darby (1980a).
5We similarly measure imports and capital flows as a fraction of income so
that a balance of payments scaled as a fraction of income results from imposition of the identity to assure asset market equilibrium.

7

exchange rate. We do not constrain the foreign price level to enter
converted by the exchange rate because purchasing power parities may have
changed with removal of capital controls simultaneously with pegged exchange

rate changes. We allow for different effects of exchange rate changes
during the pegged and floating periods.

Imports —

Equations (R7), (N7P), and (N7F)

The scaled imports variable is explained by permanent income, lagged
dependent variable, and distributed lags on the relative price of imports
and domestic transitory income for the reserve and nonreserve pegged submodels.
For the non—reserve floating submodels, this import demand equation is
solved (renormalized) for the current relative price of imports.

Imports Prices —

Equations

(R8), (N8?), and (N8F)

Itwas necessary to first difference the import price equation to clear
up severly autocorrelated residuals. In (R8) and .(NBP),the first difference
of the logarithm of import prices is explained by a constant and the first
differences of the logarithm of the real oil price, the scaled import variable,
the logarithm of foreign real income, the logarithm of the foreign price level,
the logarithm of the exchange rate, and also by the lagged dependent variable.

This import supply equation was solved in the floating version (N8F) for the
first difference in the logarithm of the exchange rate.

Capital Flows —

Equations

(R9) and (N9)

The scaled net capital outflows is explained by the domestic and U.S.

interest rate and the expected growth rate of the exchange rate,6 the logarithm
6

For the U.S. equation the U.K. interest rate and exchange rate serves as the
foreign variable.

8

of the real price of oil, the scaled balance of trade, time, logarithmic transitory
income, the first differences in the logarithms of domestic and foreign real
income, and distributed lags on first differences of domestic and U.S. Interest
rates, of the expected growth rate of the. exchange rate, and of the logarithm
of real income.

Balance of Payments —

Floating

(N1OF) only

In the nonreserve floating model, a tenth behavioral equation is added

to complete the model in view of the addition of the logarithm of the exchange
rate to our list of endogenous variables. This is our exchange intervention
equation which explains the scaled balance of payments by the lagged dependent
variable and the log change in the exchange rate as compared to the same log
change lagged one quarter and to the lagged differential between the domestic
and U.S, inflation rates.

Identities —

Equations (Rll)—(R17) and (Nll)—(N17)

Ldgarithmic permanent income is defined in identities (Ru) and (Nh).
Identities (R12) and (N12P) determine the scaled balance of payments; this is

solved instead for scaled imports in the floating (N12F). Money and export
shocks are defined in Identities (R13), (R14), (N13), and (Nl4). Identities
(Rl5) and (N15P) define the relative price of imports; in the floating case,

this is solved for import prices as in (N15F). The expectational identities
(P16), (Rl7), (N16), and (N17) are for expections of next periods prices and

exchange rate based on current information. Their specification is discussed
in Section II. Nominal—income—weighted geometric averages of the other seven
countries' real income and prices are defined by identities (P18), (P19), (Nl8),

and (Nl9). The weights W. are the ratios of country j's total nominal income

9

(converted by E. into dollars) for 19551 — 19761V to the total for all eight

countries. The parameters basey. and baseP. set the indices y and P to 1 for
1970 and are listed with the Wi's in Table 8. Although these variables are
endogenous for the whole model, they are treated somewhat differently in the
simultaneous equation estimation method outlined in Section IV.

10

II. Expected Values

There are four explicit plus one implicit expectational variables in the

model: The explicit variables are (4.log •)*,

(4log

P•)*, (log M.)*, and

(X/Y); (log gj)* also must be estimated in creating the exogenous variable
g.,. The first two

of

these variables appear in the model with leads so that

they are based on current information. Therefore we treat them as endogenous
for purposes of estimation.7 The other three expected values are based only
on lagged information and are therefore treated as predetermined for purposes of estimation.

The three predetermined expectational variables are all based on optimal

univariate ARIMA processes. We also tried defining (log M.)* in terms of a

transfer function based on the money supply reaction functions (R4) and
(N4), but the univariate process worked somewhat better both in terms of
explanatory power and in meeting our prior notions regarding the values of

coefficients.8 Since we are treating real government spending as exogenous,
it was appropriate to model (log g)* by a univariate ARIMA process. Because of the short lags in the export equations and the relatively minor
role of export shocks in the model as estimated, we did not attempt a full—

scale transfer function approach for (X/Y).
For the expected inflation rate (4Elog P)* we adopted a transfer function based on the price—level equations (R2) and (N2) with information lags

(R17),

(N16), and (N17).

is understandable if the acquisition and processing of information is
costly. See Darby (1976) and Feige and Pearce (1976). Further research on
the sensitivity of estimates to alternate definitions of (log M.)* will be
reported in the project volume.

imposed. As detailed in Table 5, the expected inflation rate (4ilog
is the systematic part of a transfer function which has as input series

current and lagged

exchange—rate—adjusted foreign interest rate, two lags of log P., and
three lagged money shocks. Note that since this expected inflation rate
appears in the interest rate equation, it is appropriate to assume that
the information set includes current interest rates.
Finally, expected growth in the exchange rate (4ilog E. t+l)* differs

by period and country. In general we do not wish to use the forward rate
for this expectation because (1) this would require an additional equation
for each nonreserve country to explain endogenously the forward rate's movements relative to movements in the expected growth in the exchange rate, and
especially (2) the forward rate data are incomplete. For the floating period, we

fitted regressions explaining E÷i by the current values of the variables
appearing in the exchange rate equation (N8F) and the lagged dependent

variable. No significant autocorrelation appeared in the residuals. The

predicted value of these regressions is used as (4ilog Et+i)*. Details
are in Part A of Table 6. For the pegged period, we use a transfer function
which has input series useful to predict both a revaluation and movements

absent a revaluation. The expected change due to a revaluation is assumed
to vary with the level of the scaled balance of payments and with this level

times its absolute value.9 Movements absent a revaluation are captured by
the current growth rate and the logarithmic difference between the actual
and pegged values of E... The latter variable may serve as well in predicting

9This formulation closely approximates an expectation based on a Tobit
analysis in which both the probability of a change and the size of the change
varies with the balance of payments.

12

revaluations. Finally lagged revaluation dummies are included because of
the different meaning of the variables in the quarter immediately following

a revaluation. Details are given in Table 6, Part B.

13

III. International Linkages
The behavioral equations in the model can be divided into the domestic

sector and the international sector. The domestic sector would contain the
real—income, price—level, unemployment—rate, nominal—money, and interest—rate

equations. The international sector determines exports, imports, import
prices, capital flows, and the implied balance of payments given a pegged exchange rate or exports, import prices, the exchange rate, capital flows, the
balance of payments, and the implied imports for floating exchange rates.

This section discusses how international influences modeled in the international sector affect the domestic sector.
In the early monetary approach to the balance of payments literature,

much was made of the "law of one price level." In the Mark II model, we
attempted to enter the exchange—rate—adjusted foreign price level directly
into the price level equation, but only the domestic demand and supply for

money were significant. Two explanations .arose: (1) International price
arbitrage is trivial in impact for the aggregate price level. (2) The "law
of one price level" holds, but the balance of payments forces nominal money
supply to adjust practically instantaneously to real money demand times the

world determined price level. Therefore the Mark III model allows foreign
prices to affect the domestic price level via affecting first the trade
balance, then the balance of payments, then nominal money, and finally the

price level. If this pattern takes substantial time, it is consistent with
a Humean specie—flow mechanism but not the "law of one price." In addition,
an indirect "currency substitution" channel permits movements in the exchange—
rate—adjusted foreign interest rate to affect real money demand and hence
the price level.

Similarly the impact of capital flows so much emphasized in the recent

monetary approach and asset approach literature enters indirectly. Domestic

14

interest rates are determined by domestic conditions including nominal money.
If they are inconsistent with the interest rate determined by asset arbitrage,
then capital flows would be induced which would affect the balance of payments,

then nominal money, and ultimately interest rates. Many recent writers
have suggested that massive capital flows would thus overwhelm any attempt
at independent

monetary policy by a nonreserve country maintaining pegged

exchange rates. We investigate the empirical importance

of this channel

here.

Note especially that in
asset

our

model both the trade balance channel and the

channel may operate simultaneously.

Some other economists have emphasized the absorption approach
via which foreign changes in income may affect domestic output and interest

rates via changes in export demand. This is reflected in the real export
innovation terms present in both real income and interest rate equations.
They in turn may affect nom-LnRl. money indirectly while balance of payments

effects would enter directly into the nominal money reaction functions.

At this stage, it is clear that the logarithm of the real price of oil

enters into the export, import price, and capital flow equations. A future
paper will test whether there is an additional direct effect of this and
other international supply shocks on the real income and price level equations, or whether they operate through their effects on the balance of
payments and net exports.

15

IV. Estimation Methods
If a simultaneously determined model such as ours is estimated by ordi-

nary least squares (OLS), simultaneous equation bias occurs. This arises
because the endogenous variables respond to each other so that the random
disturbance in any one behavioral equation may be reflected in movements

of all the other endogenous variables. As a result when some endogenous
variables are used to explain the behavior of another endogenous variable,
their values are potentially correlated with the random disturbance in the

equation. Their OLS coefficients will reflect not only their effect on the
variable being explained but also the effect of its residual on them. Simultaneous equation methods are used to remove this spurious correlation due to
reverse—causality.

The most popular simultaneous equation methods are two—stage and three—
stage least squares (2SLS and 3SLS, respectively.)10 Unfortunately neither

exists for our model. This is because the first stage of each approach involves obtaining fitted values of each of the endogenous variables which are

uncorrelated with the other endogenous variables. This is done by fitting
OLS regressions for each endogenous variable as a function of all the pre-

determined variables (exogenous and lagged endogenous). In large samples,
these fitted values are uncorrelated with the residuals in the behavioral
equations and, when substituted for the actual values in OLS estimates of

the behavioral equations, give unbiased estimates of the coefficients. Unfortunately when the number of predetermined variables equals or exceeds the
number of observations, the first stage regressions can perfectly reproduce

'9ther, more complicated methods exist but could not be entertained for
such a large model as ours because of software and computing budget litni—
tat ions.

16

the actual values of the endogenous variables and no simultaneous equation
bias is removed.

We reduce the number of predetermined variables relative to the number

of observations in two ways: (1) For each country we use as predetermined
variables only domestic variables for that country plus fitted values of

only those foreign variables which enter that country's submodel. The
fitted foreign variables are obtained by fitting interest rates, income, and

prices on each foreign country's own domestic variables and then forming
indexes (where necessary as indicated by identities (R18), (Rl9), (N18), and
(Nl9)) of these fitted foreign variables.

(2) Using this reduced set of

predetermined variables,11 we take sufficient principal components to explain
over 99.95% of their variance. Usually this involves thirty to thirty—five

components (Indicating thirty to thirty—five independent sources of varia-

tion in the instrument list). However, in estimating certain equations for
short subperiodsU it is necessary to limit the number of principal components
to half the number of observations In the subperiod. In either case these
principal components are used as our matrix for obtaining fitted values of
the endogenous variables in the first stage of our 2SLS regressions.

In suary, the model is estimated by the principal—components—2SLS
method where (a) the basic instrument list for each country consists of
domestic predetermined variables plus fitted values of those foreign
variables which appear in the model based on foreign predetermined variables,

and (b) this basic instrument list is spanned by a number of components

11The actual lists of predetermined variables for each country are presented
in Table 8.
12That is, for the floating period for all nonreserve countries except
Canada and the pegged period for Canada.

17

either equal to half the observations being used or sufficient tO explain
over 99.95% of the variance in the basic instrument list, whichever is
smaller.

18

V. Estimation Results

The estimated model is reported in Tables 9 through 18. We also discuss the estimates equation—by—equation.

Real—Income Equations (Ri) and (Nl) — Table 9
For the United States, there appear to be substantial effects from
money shocks and weak to nonexistent effects from both real government

spending and export shocks. For the nonreserve countries, a few apparently
significant monetary shocks enter, but we generally cannot reject the

hypothesis that all the money shock coefficients are zero. This is shown
in Table 9A where only Canada among the nonreserve countries reaches even

the 10 percent level of significance. The apparent impotence of monetary
policy in the nonreserve countries may be real or it may reflect either a
greater measurement error in defining the money shocks or a stable monetary
policy which would also reduce the signal—to—noise ratio in the N. data.13
The other demand shock variables, with occasional exceptions, also do
not seem to have much systematic effect on the nonreserve countries' real

incomes. The sensitivity of these results to alternative definitions of
demand shocks and effects of anticipated variables will be examined in a
future paper.

131f for example the nonreserve central banks smoothed out the Federal
Reserve Systeni's erratic growth—rate changes via an effective sterilization
policy, the actual variation In money shocks might be too small to estimate
a significant coefficient even though a substantial monetary shock, if it
were ever attempted, would have a substantial effect on real income. Although such effective sterilization appears consistent with results reported
below, the authors are not agreed on its existence; see Stockman (1979) and
Darby (l980b).

19

Price Level Equations (R2) and (N2) —

Table

10

The price—level equations have the difficulties usually encountered in

the stock—adjustment formulation: A tendency for autocorrelatlon in the
residuals to bias the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable toward 1

and the long—run demand variables toward zero. We have included three
lagged money shocks in addition to the current one suggested by Carr and

Darby (1979). These serve to explain current movements in demand variables
in what are nearly first difference in (log P—log N) equations. Software
difficulties prevented us from trying a correction for autocorrelation.14
The fact that current money shocks enter with a coefficient near —1
indicates that expected rather actual money enters in the price level equa-

tion. With a coefficient of —1, money shocks affect the current price level
only via indirect interest rate or real income effects. The shock—absorber
adjustment process suggested by Carr and Darby is thus supported by the
data.

The foreign—interest—rate channel (.5) is both significant and of the
right sign only for the United Kingdom and Japan. Further, if we recall
that interest rates are measured as decimal fractions, we see that both
elasticities are very small in absolute value and compared to the elasticity

of money demand with respect to the domestic interest rate. Nonetheless we

are able to detect some asset substitution in two of our eight countries.

14The current TROLL system regression package has a program defect when
2SLS and correction for autocorrelation are used simultaneously. France,
Germany, Italy, and Japan appear to have significant positive autocorrelation
judging from Durbin's h statistic.

20

Unemployment—te Equations (R3) and (N3) — Table 11
The unemployment rate equations indicate conformity to a dynamic version
of Okun's Law for the United States, United Kingdom, and France.

For the

other countries there was no significant correlation between changes in the

unemployment rate and past and present changes in real income. As the
equation was not required for the model, it was dropped for those countries.

Nominal—Money Equations (R4) and (N4) — Table 12
The U.S. reaction function (R4) indicates a negative impact of lagged
inflation on nominal money growth, surprisingly weak (though) positive

effects from unexpected real government spending, and a stimulative effect
from a two—quarter lagged change in the unemployment rate. The time trend

term is extremely potent: For plausible steady—state values it increases
the growth rate of nominal money from 0.2 percent per annum in 1956 to 5.9

percent per annum in 1976. Although plausibly related to a gradual increase
in target inflation as a result of experienced inflation, the trend term
will be investigated in detail in a future paper on alternative monetary
standards.

The results for the nonreserve countries reported in Part B of Table
12 are generally acceptable except for Italy which appears to follow no

systematic policy. The key element for international transmission is the
effect of the balance of payments on the money supply. Table 12A indicates
what fraction of the balance of payments is not sterilized by the central

bank —— a value of 1 indicates no sterilization and a value of 0
indicates

omp1ete sterilization. During the pegged period, sterilization appears to
have been a universal practice, although there was a substantial impact
effect of the balance of payments on the German and Japanese nominal money

21

supply. When we take account of lagged adjustments all countries except
Italy appeared to respond, albeit partially, to the balance of payments.

In principle a lagged adjustment may

be

sufficient to maintain a pegged

exchange rate system)5 The continued impact of the balance of payments on
nominal money during the floating period is consistent with a joint policy
of exchange intervention and monetary adjustments in response to exchange
rate pressures.

Interest—Rate Equations (R5) and (N5) —

Table

13

The interest rate equations are not particularly satisfactory in terms

of expected values of the coefficients: The expected—inflation effect is
small to nil and so is the liquidity effect of nominal money shocks. Real
government spending shocks generally have a negative impact effect on

interest rates. An efficient—markets/random—walk story might appear to offer an explanation, but these are short—term rates which can move in

predictable ways in an efficient market. Further the contemporaneous shocks
should help explain the random walk. We suspect the solution to the puzzle
may lie in the formation of expectations, but leave this as an area for
future research.

Export Equations (R6) and (N6) — Table 14

The export equations are generally acceptable although price influences do

not seem very strong. An increaseñ real oil price enters as a proxy for in—

15The implications of sterilization (and hence endogenous domestic credit)
are examined in Darby (1980b) and Stockman (1979).

22

creased

real income of the omitted rest of the world and has the expected

positive sign except for Japan. Foreign real income has much weaker positive
impact than would be expected from the absorption approach. The sum of the
current and lagged domestic price level is negative for all countries except

the U.S. and Canada, but the effects are universally weak. Similarly foreign
prices and the exchange rate generally have weak positive effects.

Import Equations (R7) and (N7P) —

Table 15, Part A

The import demand equations display a J—curve type effect. An increase in
relative import prices initially (except for Germany and Italy) increases the

nominal value of imports relative to nominal income. Lagged quantity adjustment, indicated by negative coefficients on lagged relative import

prices, gradually offset the initial increase. While the price effects are
rather stronger here than for exports,'6 again there is no evidence of a
"law of one price level" operating strongly in the current period.

Relative—Price—of—Imports Equations (N7F) —

Table 15, Part B

During the floating period, we solve the import demand equation for the
relative

price of imports. The equations have no obvious problems but the

implied parameter estimates are frequently quite different from those in Part
A

of Table 15. This may be due to biases from the (different) lagged dependent

variable which appears in each equation.

Import—Price Equations CR8) and (N8P) — Table 16, Part A

The import supply equations Indicate that increases in foreign prices increase
import prices, although the coefficients are insignificant for the United States

may be because with relatively reliable import price data we can
estimate separate import demand and supply equations while the export
equation is a market equilibrium equation in which the exchange rate and
foreign price level enter directly.

and Canada. Changes in exchange rates are significantly positive for the four
countries which changed their peg during the period of estimation, but not for

Canada, Italy, or Japan. There also appears to be a positive quantity effect
for a few countries. Oil prices are important only for the U.S., Italy, and
perhaps the Netherlands.

Exchange—Rate Equations (N8F) —

Table 16, Part B

The inverted import supply equations are used to explain exchange rate

movement during the floating period. Although it is somewhat arbitrary in a
simultaneous model which one is declared ntthe!t exchange rate equation, this

one was chosen because exchange rates entered most directly and stronglyhere.
The approach clearly worked well for France, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands

and not so well for the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany. Why this is so
is puzzling to us.

Capital—Flows Equations (R9) and (N9) —

Table

17

The capital—flows equations worked poorly indeed for the United Kingdom
and Japan, apparently reflecting the effectiveness of their capital controls.
For the other countries, net capital outflows generally were negatively related (albeit weakly so) to either the exchange—rate adjusted interest
differential [R. —

(4log E t+l —

R11

or to changes in this differential,

judging from the coefficients estimated on its component parts. But the estimated
coefficients are neither large nor precisely estimated as would be suggested

by discussions of "interest arbitrage" in the asset approach. Apparently
foreign and domestic securities are treated as rather imperfect substitutes

in the portfolio. Alternatively, one must suppose most movements in the differential reflect changes in the equilibrium value with no flows resulting.

24

Balance—of—Payments Equations —

Table

18

These equations attempt to model intervention in the floating—exchange—

rate markets. With few degrees of freedom, we could not experiment with
lags or alternative variables and based the equations on the variables

popularly discussed: movements in the exchange rate relative to recent
movements or lagged relative inflation rates and the lagged dependent

variable. This approach certainly did not explain intervention by the central banks of France or the Netherlands, but was otherwise reasonably

serviceable. We investigated explaining the Netherlands—German exchange
rate and hence the Netherlands—U.S. exchange rate, but this approach was
even less successful.

25

VI. Conclusions and Areas for Future Research

The research reported in this paper seems very informative to us in
the sense of inducing revision of prior beliefs and suggesting areas for

future research. This doubtless reflects the emphasis on theoretical as
opposed to empirical research in international macroeconomics. Hopefully
this imbalance will be redressed in view of the demonstrated payoff and of
the reduced cost of empirical work consequent upon the development of the
data bank by James Lothian and Anna Schwartz.

Our main empirical results can be summarized as saying that the rational—
expectations—natural—rate results found for the U.S. do not transfer easily
to other developed countries and that linkages among countries joined by
pegged exchange rates appear much looser than is usually assumed at least in

the monetary—approach literature. In particular, substantial or complete
sterilization of the effects of contemporaneous reserve flows on the money

supply is a universal practice of the nonreserve central banks. Much future
research by members of the International Transmission Project and others is
required to substantiate or overturn these results, but the questions are
clearly posed.

In greater detail, our major empirical findings are;

1. Although a natural—rate/rational—expectations reaLincome equation confirms strong effects from money innovations and weak effects from government spending and export innovations in the U.S., the other seven countries
had little by the way of significant response to demand innovations.

2. The shock—absorber money demand equation of Carr and Darby receives con—
firmation. Thus innovations in nominal money have little effect on contemporaneous inflation despite small contemporaneous movements in real income
and the interest rate.

NOTES:

1. Certain variables listed as predetermined variables are not listed
here because of extreme inulticollinearity with listed variables or
because they are not predetermined generally for the whole sample
period.
2. Fitted foreign instruments (indicated by superscript FIT) are obtained
by fitting log y., log P , and R on the domestic instruments for
country j for j

1, .

. . , 8.

The indices (log R)FIT and (log pR)FIT

are obtained by applying identities (R18), (R19), (N18), and (Nl9)
using the weights in Table 7.

3. The DF. variables are included only for estimates spanning the entire
period; i.e., they are omitted in estimates made for only the pegged
or floating period.

4. For nonreserve countries other than the United Kingdom and France,
log y. —

log

y is substituted for u,.

54

General Notes for Tables 9 through 18

1. Standard errors appear in parentheses below the estimated coefficients.
The t-values appear below the standard errors. Unless otherwise noted,
the period of estimation is 19571 — 19761V.

2. All estimations are based on the principal—components—2SLS method (see
Section IV)

using

the TROLL system at M.I.T.

3. We generally report Durbin's h for equations with a lagged dependent
variable. In those cases in which Durbin's h cannot be calculated
(is imaginary), we report instead the (biased) Durbin—Watson statistic
in brackets.

NOTES: 1. The reported F-statistics are appropriate for testing the
joint hypothesis that all four of the demand shock variables
of the type indicated have a coefficient of zero. Such a
test is conditional upon the other variables entering in the
equation.

2. For F(4/66), the 10 percent significance level is 2.04, the
5 percent significance level is 2.52, and the 1 percent
significance level is 3.63.
