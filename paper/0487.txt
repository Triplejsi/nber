to Promote Saving

ABSTRACT

This paper examines six possible reforms of the U.S. personal income
tax system.

The paper evaluates the proposals by estimating the dynamic

analog to compensating variations using a medium-scale general equilibrium
model designed to allow a broad range of tax policies.

We find that pro-

posals to index the tax system for inflation tend to provide large welfare
gains, while other measures designed to raise the net-of-tax return to
capital are successful to the extent that they serve as ad hoc-offsets
for inflation or to the extent that they partially integrate the corporate
and personal income taxes.

Results also indicate that intertemporal and

interindustry efficiency gains are of comparable importance.

Finally,

results suggest that additional intertemporal welfare gains can be achieved
at the cost of a more regressive over-all tax structure.

Economic research as well as popular attention has focused in recent
years on the intertemporal and interindustry efficiency distortions in
the U. S. tax system.

This paper estimates the welfare gains from proposals

intended to reduce distortions imposed by the present tax structure, and
notes the degree to which these gains derive from intertemporal or interindustry corrections.

Our model and results support three propositions.

First, the proper allocation of new capital is as crucial as the creation
of new capital itself.

Second, tax reform plans to index the system against

inflation are more potent in this combined task of increasing savings and
allocating investment efficiently than are ad hoc measures designed to encourage saving, such as interest income exclusions, capital gains exclusions
or pension liberalization.

Finally, larger welfare gains from removal of

intertemporal and interindustry distortions entail the cost of a less progressive tax structure, since high income groups tend to save a higher
proportion of their income.
We examine six alternative plans which might be discussed in an effort to increase consumer savings through the personal income tax system
in the United States.

These plans attempt to affect savings through an in-

crease in the real rate of return either by direct tax cuts on savings or by
indexing tax rates against inflation.

The paper.presents estimates of static

and dynamic resource allocation effects for the six plans, and compares them
to results obtained in earlier work on the impacts of more sweeping reforms.
A medium-scale numerical general equilibrium model is used which integrates
the U. S. tax system with consumer demand behavior by household and producer
behavior by industry.

- 2-

The static or annual welfare measures are derived by comparing the

1973 base year to a single counterfactual equilibrium, and they concentrate
mostly on interindustry distortions.

Ranking the six plans by the size of·

the gain, results indicate that extensive inflation indexation of the U.

s.

tax system would yield the largest annual static efficiency gain, more
than $4 billion (1973 dollars).

Excluding 60% of dividends from the per-

sonal tax base would have an effect about half as large, while indexing
capital gains alone would further reduce the gain.

Proposals to exclude

70% of interest income from the personal tax base or to decrease the capital
gains inclusion to 30% augment welfare still less.

A plan to increase pen-

sion, Keogh, and IRA maxima and to expand their scope engenders fairly
small static welfare gains because they do not operate so as to decrease
interindustry distortions in the allocation of capital.
Our dynamic measures of welfare gain are derived by comparing an entire sequence of equilibria under the new-tax regime to the sequence generated from the 1973 tax regime.

It not only captures gains from reducing

capital misallocation, but also records intertemporal efficiency gains
from reducing the "double tax" on savings.

Dynamic effects exceed static

ones, and our analysis indicates that the extensive indexation plan

may

yield gains whose present value is approximately $200 billion, or about 1/2
of 1% of the discounted present value of an "expanded" income stream to the
U. S. economy after correction for population

growth.~1

The dividend ex-

clusion yields present value gains of about $100 billion, while the other
plans are less successful.

Plans differ in their distributional impacts,

although these findings depend on the nature of replacement taxes used to
preserve government revenues.

The size of dynamic resource allocation ef-

- 3 -

fects are sensitive to the choice of the replacement tax, while static gains
are more robust.
The relative magnitude of the gains involved depend largely on one's
perspective.

They could be treated as upper bounds, since the disequi1ib-

rium losses likely to be incurred are not captured in our model.

On

the

other hand, the size of the gains is reduced by our assumption that financial
policies do not change.

The best plans discussed here offer welfare bene-

fits approximately as large as those accruing with the complete integration
of the corporate and personal income taxes, as discussed in Fullerton, King,
Shoven, and Whalley (1980a and 1980b).
At least four choices greatly influence the size of welfare gains and
the proportions of those gains derived from removal of interindustry and
intertempora1 distortions.

First, we employ 0,,4 for the uncompensated

savings elasticity with respect to the net rate of return.

Intertemporal

distortions would be greater, and hence their role more important, if this
elasticity were higher. 11

Second, we use .04 to discount future welfare

gains from intertempora1 corrections.

Fourth, our estimates of the elasticity of 8ub-

stitution between capital and labor in each industry vary between 0.6 and

- 4-

1.0.

Higher elasticities of substitution would imply larger interindustry

distortions.

Consequently, the relative size of gains from the removal of

interindustry and intertemporal distortions cannot be forecast with precision.

Our results make it apparent, however, that the order of magnitude

of the gains is similar.
I.

Saving, Inflation, and Income Taxation.
The U. S. tax system's treatment of capital imposes two major types

·of distortion.

The first of these is an intertemporal one.

Savings occur

of of after-tax income, yet its return may be taxed again by both the corporate and personal income taxes.

This additional taxation has the effect

of raising the cost of saving, thus biasing consumption plans towards the
present and away from the future.
industry one.

The second large distortion is an inter-

Different industries incur different effective capital tax

rates due to varying degrees of incorporation, age structures of assets,
debt/equity ratios, and other financial policies.

Rational investors will

equalize rates of return net of all taxes that discriminate by industrial
location.

Therefore, as producers set the marginal cost of capital equal

to its marginal product, the latter must differ by industry.

Reallocation

of capital from low to high marginal product industries could consequently
increase total product.
Both intertemporal and interindustry distortions are aggravated by
the presence of inflation.

With respect to taxes on labor income, the progres-

sive nature of the personal income tax (PIT) ensures rising marginal and
average tax rates for individuals as inflation occurs, unless rates are
systematically reduced.

Since saving varies positively with real income,

the effect of inflation through its impact on the personal income tax may

- 5 -

be to reduce private saving.
With respect to taxes on capital income, inflation creates illusory
capital gains which are nonetheless taxed as if they were real.

The value

of shares in an industry should rise by an amount approximately equal to che
inflation rate times that industry's ownership of capital stock, and these
purely nominal gains are then taxed as income.

Inflation simultaneously

reduces the real value of permissable depreciation deductions for calculating
the corporate or personal income tax base.

Furthermore, with the deduction

of interest payments and inclusion of interest income in tax bases, inflation
lowers the effective rate of tax on borrowers and increases the rate on
lenders.

Because industries differ with respect to (a) the proportians of

capital gains that are real and nominal, (b) the age structure of their assets, and (~) the proportion of investment financed by debt, the effect of
infTation will not only increase capital taxes on real capital income, but will
do so differentially by industry.
The present tax system thus contains a considerable anti-savings bias,
aggravated by its inflation non-neutrality.

Consequently, there exists a

prima facie case for encouraging saving through the tax system and its
treatment of inflation.

Since proposals to increase saving through the tax

system do so by increasing the return to postponed consumption, and as inflation increases effective personal and corporate income tax rates, proposals to promote saving tend to partially offset the real effects of inflation.

Conversely, attempts to make taxes on labor and capital income

inflation neutral11 will increase the real return to saving.

Welfare ef-

fects of a plan to raise savings and reduce intertemporal distortions will
be heavily influenced by the reform's impact on reducing interindustry dis-

- 6 -

tortions caused by inflation, and vice versa.
Advocates and opponents of various proposals to increase saving and
index taxes have taken sides with necessarily partial knowledge of their
plans' long term productive and distributive impacts.

Our estimates

below show that the effects of typical proposals on national income vary
considerably, while distributive impacts range from extremely regressive
to approximately neutral.

The remainder of the paper evaluates some of

these tax reform proposals by simulating them in a dynamic general equi1ibirum model of the U. S. economy.
This model, developed by Fullerton, Shoven, and Whalley for the U. S.
T!easury Department, is based on disaggregated micro data.

It captures the

effects of a tax change on factor prices and output prices, thus measuring
both the sources side and uses side of income simultaneously.

The initial

parameters are obtained in a manner that ,allows us to replicate the 1973
U. S. economy as an equilibrium.

We assume that the 1973 economy was both

in equilibrium and that it was on a steady-state growth path.

Welfare im-

pacts of a proposal are then determined by calculating its model-equivalent
form, obtaining an equilibrium for a counterfactua1 economy in which the reform has

b~en

implemented, and then comparing this economy to the unaltered

base equilibrium sequence.
The next section formally introduces and describes six concrete proposals for tax structure reform.

These plans are similar at least in spirit

to existing proposals in government and political circles.

The third section

discusses the general equilibrium model used to evaluate the proposals
and notes the sources for the data and exogenous parameter values employed.
Section IV considers the simulation results obtained, while a concluding
section summarizes the insights they reveal.

Finally, in an Appendix we

- 7 -

specify how each tax proposal is translated into modelled rate and equation changes'for the purpose of calculating the counterfactua1 economy.

Six Reforms.
The first proposal considered, P1, is a plan to raise the maximum

and it does far less to remove inter-

industry distortions or to correct for inflation.

Increasing these maxima

effectively serves to reduce the proportion of an individual's savings subject to taxation, and thus reduces the inter·tempora1 distortion caused by
the tax system.

In principle, any plan to expand pension/Keogh/IRA cover-

age or to raise their ceilings has an ambiguous effect on inducing new
savings.

While the price effect is clearly positive, since the effective

cost of postponing consumption is reduced, the income effect is likely to
have a negative impact.

Since we use an estimate from Boskin (1978) of .4

for the uncompensated elasticity of savings with respect to the net rate of
return, our results show that P1 does have a strong, positive

imp~ct

on

savings.
The second proposal considered, P2, makes 70% of personal interest re~

ceipts deductible from the personal tax base.

It might have a larger wel-

fare gain, however, since the interest exclusion generates reductions in
interindustry and other distortions, as industries with disproportionately
large amounts of debt finance tend to be relatively highly taxed by corporate or other tax systems.
The third proposal consists of the imposition of a60% dividends exclusion from the personal income tax basJYcombined with the elimination of
the $100 dividend deduction. i

As

the value of the $100 deduction amounts

to only about 4% of dividends paid in 1973, the net effect is to substantia1ly reduce the average rate of taxation on personal savings.

Since dividends as a return to savings are taxed at

and personal level, increasing the exclusion helps e1im-

inate an important source of intertemporal distortion.

Furthermore, due to

~different

rates of incorporation and financial policies across industries,
on dividends
the extra tax/implies various rates among various industries. The ef-

ficiency gains from dividend exclusion may therefore be especially strong.
P4 is based on a recent proposal by Senator Russell Long (D.-La.) to
reduce the percentage of capital gains includable in the personal income
tax to 30%.

While P4 may be partially intended to counteract the rising

effective capital tax rates due to inflation, it does so in an ad hoc

- 9 -

manner.

Its main consequence is to raise the rate of return to holding

corporate stock.

As with P2 and P3, only one of several forms of savings

receives a reduction in intemporal distortion, and then only a partial one.
Their relative potencies will depend on the extent to which interindiustry
distortions are also lessened.

Welfare gains will also be affected by

the plans' distributional impacts, primarily because of different propensities to save.

Since high income consumers save a higher proportion of

their incomes, a progressive (regressive) tax change will tend to reduce

saved. ~/

In contrast to P4, the next plan does involve the inflation indexation
of capital gains.

The added real tax burdens on capital gains income

i~

posed by inflation may cause significant net welfare losses, as well as
creating large income redistributions.

On the other hand, an inflation in-

dexation proposal would be slightly more difficult to implement than any
of the plans previously mscussed. Any scheme would be necessarily imperfect

The degrees of excludability allowed in P2 and P3 were chosen with the intention of making them comparable in terms of additional capital formation
to P5.
The final proposal considered, P6, is one designed to almost completely index taxes on income from capital against inflation. 9 !

It is the only

- 10 -

plan involving changes to tax laws other than on the personal income tax.
P6 includes the indexation of depreciation deductions for corporate income taxes, incorporates the indexation of capital gains, and also involves
changes in the treatment of interest income.

Taxation of dividends at a

constant rate with only insignificant deductions renders its taxation approximately inflation-neutral.

The other major taxes such as those on

property and rent income, are also approximately ad valorem taxes on
factor income, and as such are inflation neutral.

In general, any tax

levied in an ad valorem fashion, either on a product or on a factor's income,

will be inflation neutral.

A tax with a variable average

rate or which taxes nominal value that fails to increase pari passu with
inflation will have its effective rate vary with inflation.

Nonetheless, the practical problems of implementation

Indexation of capital gains corresponds exactly to that of plan 5.

construction from disaggregated

microeco~omic

Its

data allows interindustry

distinctions unobtainable in most macroeconomic models.

A brief outline of

the model is provided here.
The economy is divided into nineteen profit-maximizing industries,
each of which produces a single output from a,combination of capital services,
labor serv~ces, and the outputs of other industries.

Capital services are in

fixed supply during a given period, but grow over time as investment occurs.
Labor endowment is in fixed supply at any instant, but grows over time at
a constant rate.

Labor supply in any period is variable and equals ag-

gregate labor endowment less leisure:.time.

Labor s,Upply is thus determined

by leisure demands, which depend on relative prices and income.

Both

labor and capital are perfectly mobile across industries.
Each industry has a Cobq-Douglas or other Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function 'over primary inputs, where the elas-

ticity of substitution is chosen as a

t~est-guess"

value from evidence in

Each output is used in part as an intermediate input through

a fixed-coefficient input-output matrix.

Outputs can also be purchased by

government, used for investment, or be converted via a fixed coefficient
transformation into one of fifteen consumer goods.

There is a simple for-

eign trade sector to close the model, but for all practical purposes this
model of the U. S.

e~onomy

should be considered to be a closed one.

There are twelve consumer classes, differentiated by their 1973 income
levels.

Consumers in each class possess initial endowments of labor and

capital services which can be sold for use in production or to government.
Perfect factor mobility' and perfect competition combine to ensure equality
of the net-of-tax return among industries.

As noted above, a consumer can

also choose to buy some of his own labor endowment as leisure.

We model all

gov.ernment transfers as essentially lump-sum payments to consumer groups in
proportion to their observed 1973 receipts from social security, unemployment compensation, food stamps, and other welfare programs.
Consumer demand functions are based on CES utility functions with
double nesting.

The choice between present and future consumption is rep-

resented by the outside nest, and the elasticity of substitution between
~

those two types of consumption is based on an estimate of the uncompensated savings elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax rate of return.
We use the value of 0.4 found by Boskin (1978). The breakdown of present
consumption into commodities and leisure is represented by the inside nest,
and the elasticity of substitution between those two subsets is based on an
estimate of the uncompensated labor supply elasticity with respect to the
net-of-tax wage. For this latter value we use 0.15. This choice is discussed

- 13 -

in Fullerton (1980a). All classes have the same form of utility function, and
identical labor supply and savings elasticities. They do have different demands for all commodities, however, with the parameters determined from
Consumer Expenditure Survey data.
The various Federal, state and local taxes are typically modelled as
ad valorem tax rates on purchases of appropriate products or factors.

Cor-

porate income taxes and property taxes are modelled as different effective
rates of tax on use of capital by industry. Social security, workmen's compensation and unemployment insurance appear as industry taxes on labor use.
Personal income taxes operate as different linear schedules for each consumer group, with marginal tax rates increasing from an average of 1% for
the lowest income group to 40% for the highest income group.
In our benchmark model

inflation has effects on real taxes

through

the capital gains and interest income taxes and by the use of depreciation
allowances based on historical costs. Consequently, inflation has the real
effect of altering each industry's tax on use of capital services
and hence its effective price of capital services.

On the other

hand, the inflation rate remains an exogenously specified parameter.
There is

an implicit presumption in the model

that

various

tax policies do not have differential impacts on the inflation rate itself.
Instead, the model has been adjusted to obtain 'different effective capital
tax rates for different inflation rates.

Effective capital tax rates are

calculated by measuring each industry's real use of capital services with
replacement cost depreciation.
The model is parameterized for 1973 using data from the National
Income and Product Accounts, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the Treasury Department's merged tax file.

These

- 14 -

data are adjusted for known inaccuracies 9f government collection procedll
ures and for general equilibrium consistency requirements. / This "benchmark" data set is used to solve backwards for relevant preference parameters
and tax rates. so that the model solution can replicate the benchmark equi1ibrium.

The user can specify different tax rates

equations to re-

calculate a simulated "counterfactua1" equilibrium with different resource
allocations for comparison with the benchmark.

The model is solved using

Merrill's variant of Scarf's algorithm for an equilibrium price vector
where excess demands and profits are zero.
Capital accumulation occurs through the act of saving by consumers and
replacement investment by firms. less depreciation.

Savings is treated as

the sixteenth consumer good, and involves the purchase of producer goods in
fixed proportions to form a composite investment good.

The conversion from

expected future consumption to demand for savings is based on a myopic expectations assumption:

consumers take the current return to capital as the

expected future return in deciding how much to save.

In a steady state,

this myopia will turn out to be realistic.
The notion of a static benchmark equilibrium is extended to a benchmark steady state in which all values grow proportionately

at the effective

Labor force growth is evenly divided between popu-

lation changes and Harrod-neutral technical progress.

A tax policy change

causes divergence from the original steady state path, and alters the economy's
factor ratio and utility levels at any instant.

The model's essential

convexity makes asymptotic convergence to a new steady state path an almost
certain event.

The new steady state

ratio of effective labor units to capital service units and unchanging relative prices.

The net adVisability of a policy change will depend on the

- 15 -

size and timing of changes in consumer utility levels, the distribution of
those changes, and the discount rate used to compare the two sequences.
It is important to recognize the somewhat limited sense in which we
simulate general equilibria.

Various financial policies are captured in

our modelling of capital income distribution flows, but we assume these policies to be fixed because we have no estimates of the elasticities of corporate financial policy with respect to the effective prices of finance.
Therefore, for example, a reduction in the dividends includability in the
PIT base does not induce corporations to alter the fraction of net income
they distribute as dividends.

This assumption of corporate non-responsive-

ness causes the present value estimates to be biased downwards.

Sensitivity

analysis can be performed by allowing corporations 'to alter their financial
patterns in a logical direction but by an essentially arbitrary amount.

extreme corporate reaction assumptions lead to

welfare gains of roughly 50 to 100% more than the gains registered in the
nonresponsive case.
The model as specified does not include aspects of disequilibrium such
as factor unemployment.

It measures real effects without a money equation,

expressing all prices in relative terms.
~

Voluntary unemployment is captured

through the labor/leisure choice, though, and the interaction of exogenously specified inflation with effective tax rates is modelled by adjusting
those rates appropriately.

The model is thus complementary to short-run

Keynesian disequilibrium models rather than competitive with them.
Finally, the model requires that government run a balanced budget. 13 /
Therefore, when policy changes generate alterations in the tax equations
and parameters, the revenue gain or.loss implied cannot be recorded as a

- 16 -

government surplus or deficit.

The model further specifies that the gov-

ernment obtain a specific real value of goods and services over time, with
its purchasing power defined by means of a Laspeyres price index.

Conse-

quently, each policy change that implies a loss of government purchasing
power must be compensated by a tax increase that just offsets that loss.
The model is constructed to allow for automatic changes in the income tax
structure to provide the extra tax to maintain an "equal yield."

This

equal yield can be realized by imposing a lump-sum tax on all consumer groups
in proportion to their initial net incomes, or by increasing the marginal
tax rate of each class by a constant amount (additive scaling), or by multiplying the marginal rate of each class by a constant fraction (multiplicative scaling).

This last method can impose severe deadweight losses on the

economy, because proportionately more of the revenue is obtained from the
high7income, high-saving class.

Some might prefer' its progressive nature,

however, since the capital tax reductions of the six proposals are often
regressive.

Rather than comment on the desirability of different distributional

impacts, we present the reader with alternative replacement taxes.

The

tradeoff between efficiency and distributional impacts will be noted below.

We then obtain the number of dollars needed to pay each consumer in each
period to be able to reach the

H sequence of the benchmark, and discount

those dollars by the assumed 4% discount rate.
Table 2 presents a number of summary statistics for the six plans,
including the static or annual measures of welfare gain in columns I and 2.
The static measures of efficiency shown in column I are the changes in expanded income, defined as the sum of national income plus leisure, evaluated at the geometric mean of pre- and post-policy change prices.

Column

two gives the percentage change of national income alone, and can thus be
affected by labor/leisure choices.

We use the real income figures rather

than. compensating or equivalent variations in static comparisons because
the utility contribution of savings may be inaccurately assessed by consumers due to their myopic expectations.
Column 3 shows the revenue shortfalls generated by the various proposals
when revenues are replaced by lump-sum taxes on. consumers.

This type of re-

placement tax was used here to isolate the effects of the plan without combined effects from scaling marginal tax rates.

A "cost-effectiveness" ratio,

equal to the dynamic welfare gain with multiplicative scaling divided by
this first year revenue shortfall is also computed and shown in column
4.

Column 5 presents the relative price of capital services in the first

year and column 6 the relative price of capital in year 50.

The latter

set of figures should be close to the steady state price ratio.

Column

7 gives the first year's percentage increase of savings over the benchmark value for each reform, while column 8 gives the same figure for

- 22 -

year 50.

Finally, column 9 provides the percentage increase in capital

stock after 50 years with each reform.
Table 3 presents the twelve income classes along with the distributional results of each plan.

We examine only the initial distribution effects

from the static model because the dynamic model is not able to obtain satisfactory estimates of distributional impacts.

Table 4 shows the nineteen

industries in the model, and presents a comparison of capital tax rates by
industry for the six plans.
Examining Table 1 first, it is apparent that the P6 extensive indexing plan dominates all other proposals by large amounts, regardless of the
replacement tax.

Welfare gains are about $200 billion in present value.

Results of sensitivity analysis suggest that the added depreciation deduction accounts for most of the gain.

A reason for the strong showing

of both P6 and the P3dividends exclusion proposal, with about $100 billion
of gains, lies largely in their removal of interindustry distortions.
They both go a long way towards reducing taxes on capital and thus much

fn

intertemporal distortion as well. 14

fact, the gain from inflation index-

ing is nearly equal to the elsewhere estimated gain from full integration
of the corporate and personal income taxes. lil

It is also evident from

Table 1 that there is a sizeable welfare gain to be had from the F5 indexing
capital gains alone, over $60 billion.

This exceeds by more than $30

billion the gain from P4" (jncreasing the capital gains exclusion to 70%).
To lielp explain this result, turn briefly to Table 4, which suggests that
P5 (gains indexing) is more successful than P4 (gains exclusion) in reducing the effective capital tax rates on those industries with particularly high rates, thus giving it a stronger interindustry effect.
it also reduces

f

That

(the average proportion of capital income taxable by

- 23 -

the personal income tax} by a larger amount attests to its superior ability
in reducing intertemporal distortions as well.
The dynamic welfare benefits from adopting PI (pensions liberalization)
or P2 (interest exclusion) are comparable to the gains from implementing
P4 (capital gains exclusion).

This result in itself is noteworthy, since

it suggests that interindustry effects are extremely important.

PI offers

purely intertemporal efficiency gains, and P2 offers large intertemporal
benefits relative to P4.

16

/

Nonetheless, P4 compensates by achieving

greater interindustry gains than PI or P2.

Note, however, that the weight

of the intertemporal gains is apparently greater for the lump-sum replacement, where intertemporal efficiency gains are not offset by revenue-preserving taxes on both labor and capital income.
The static welfare results in the first two columns of Table 2 conform
to the pattern set in Table 1, with the exception of a reversal of ranking
of P4

(~apital

gains exclusion) and PI (pensions liberalization).

Pension

liberalization looks relatively worse here because the static measures do
not adequately capture intertemporal effects, where it is strongest.
(jnterest exclusion) does relatively

bette~,

P2

though in the case of multi-

plicative scaling for tax replacement it actually induces a fall in national
income.
Turning to column 3 of Table 2,it is seen that the extensive indexation package requires a much larger income tax increase to offset its implementation than does any other plan.

The interest exclusion plan also

demands a rather large replacement tax, particularly relative to the size
of the welfare gain it offers.

Proposals 3 (dividends exclusion), 4 (gains

exclusion) and 5 (gains indexation) require relatively small replacement
taxes, and thus have high cost-effectiveness ratios, shown in column 4.

- 24 -

While the cost-effectiveness ratio provides a rough indicator of net benefits
per dollar of tax revenue» it does not demonstrate that these plans are most
desirable in the sense of, providing the largest net gains or savings increases.
The price of capital services relative to the price of labor services

Columns 7 and 80f Table 2 present savings responses to each of the
proposals.

Pl~

the direct savings subsidy, has the largest impact, followed

closely by the extensive indexation plan.

The other savings plans gener-

ate an amount of savings roughly 1% over the benchmark case in each year.
Column 9 provides similar information, that PI and then P6 do the most to
raise future capital stocks through savings.
Looking at the distributional patterns appearing in Table 3, importance
of the form of tax replacement is evident:

multiplicative scaling greatly

enhances the gains or reduces the losses of the poorer classes.

On

the

other hand, multiplicative scaling induces lower welfare gains °in both the
static and dynamic present value estimates than either other replacement.
It has been found both here and elsewhere that a strong tradeoff exists
between the size of the welfare gain and its distribution to the poorer
classes. 17/

This is only mitigated on occasion by the fact that the very

bottom income groups, consisting largely of retirees, own significant amounts
of capital.
All proposals are regressive when additive scaling is used for tax replacement.

- 26 -

PI remains a somewhat regressive plan.

With the exception of benefits

accruing to the twelfth income class, the distribution effects of P3
(dividends exclusion) and P4 (gains exclusion) are not far from being
proportionate.

Again excluding the twelfth class, P6 (extensive indexation)

even enjoys a progressive distribution of gains.

All proposals provide a

percentage gain to the richest class far larger than to any other class.
P6, however, is a Pareto improvement in the sense that every class is made
'better off regardless of the tax replacement.
The capital tax rates presented in Table 4 are valuable for comparisons
relative
of/interindustry tax differentials. The rates do not iriclude certain pension tax exclusions modelled as general savings subsidies.

A cursory glance

shows that of the proposals modelled as directly affecting the capital tax
rates (P2 through P6),

P6 (extensive indexing) reduces capital tax

rates by a far larger amount than do the others.

It seems especially ef-

fective in reducing tax rates for the most heavily taxed industries, and
thus yields more interindustry gain as well as intertemporal gain.
Most of the results obtained are consistent with a priori expectations.
The gains accruing to the proposals involving increased exclusions (P2,
P3, P4) largely reflect the fact that they represent movements towards personal and corporate tax integration.

The size of the gains from indexing

schemes attest to the importance of inflation in increasing both intertemporal and interindustry distortions.

Obviously, these welfare impacts

would have been even more important if 1980 data had been available so
that 1980 inflation rates could be used.

Conclusion.
This paper analyzes six alternative plans to increase savings by cut-

ting taxes on capital income.
forms, and include

The capital tax cuts appear

in different

effortsto reduce the real impacts of inflation on the

taxation of real income.

We employ a recently constructed general equi-

librium model for the U. S. economy and tax system.

The paper discusses

the model and its use of disaggregated data in the third section, and outlines the model equivalent forms of the proposals in an appendix.
Extensive indexation of capital taxes for inflation is shown to yield
present value dynamic gains of about $200 billion, comparable to the welfare
gains obtainable from integration of the personal and corporate income taxes.
A 60% exclusion of dividends from the personal income tax offers gains of
about $100 billion, based on the assumption of unchanging financial policies.
The gains for indexing only capital gains for inflation are over $60 billion,
indicating that this proposal dominates the proposal to reduce the capital
gains inclusion to 30%.

The distribution of the gains among the income c1as-

ses is similar for the two proposals.
Both the static and dynamic results indicate that interindustry efficiency
gains are of the same order of magnitude as intertempora1 ones.

The plan

most successful in terms of generating new savings and capital formation,
PI, is among the least successful in terms of welfare gains measures.

The

simulations serve to emphasize our first proposition that increased capital
is only valuable if used properly.

In general, the inflation indexing plans

prove effective in achieving both greater capital formation and its proper
allocation.

the second proposition notes, the proposals to increase the

not divorce resource allocation effects from a welfare analysis of the

i~

- 28 -

pacts of proposed savings incentives.
Dynamic and static gains are highly sensitive to the chosen yield preserving tax, as these taxes impose differing welfare losses themselves.

It

is apparent that the results will also be highly sensitive to the inflation
rate chosen.

In general, non-neutrality of the U. S. tax system ensures

that inflation will have significant real effects.
As our third proposition states, there is an apparent inverse rela-

tionship between the size of welfare gain obtainable and its progressive
impact for any particular plan.

The cost of increased capital accumula-

tion through reduced intertemporal distortions appears to be a redistribution
of income shares from poor to rich.
As a summary observation we draw attention to the one plan which pro-

vides gains to all classes, even if the percentage gains differ, regardless
of replacement .tax assumption.

This plan, involving the provision of ex-

tensive inflation indexation, also happens to be the plan with the largest
dynamic welfare gain, accruing from improvements to intertemporal efficiency
and interindustry efficiency.

These two strong. attributes of the indexing

plan are only offset by its possibly greater administrative complexity.

APPENDIX

The general equilibrium model is designed to allow a variety of methods
of distributing income from different assets, and to capture the influence
of the major taxes imposed on each type of capital income.

This Appendix

discusses the modelling of capital taxes and personal taxes on capital income, and explains the changes made to the benchmark data set and equations
in order to model the proposed reforms.
The capital tax calculation computer program, TMOD, first estimates
total returns to capital in each of the nineteen industries.

It reads in

,

data on dividends, retained earnings, rents paid, interest payments, unincorporated capital income and imputed interest payments in each industry.

We

aim to allocate capital according to where it is used rather than by the
sector in which the returns are ultimately received.

The imputed interest

payments prevent the Finance/Insurance industry, which enjoys positive net
interest income, from being credited with negative capital use.
Our goal is to determine the capital tax rate (eTR) in each industry
as a function of the relevant tax laws, institutional patterns, and financial practices.
~

To find the CTR in an industry, we divide capital taxes

by net capital factor income.

We define a unit of capital as that amount

which earns an annual return of $1 net of all taxes that discriminate according to industrial location.

This definition stems from the requirement

of a Walrasian equilibrium that marginal factor returns net of all taxes
be equalized across industries.

Because effective taxation on capital in-

come at the personal income tax (PIT) level depends upon the industry from

The effective propor-

tion of taxable capital gains is reduced by the deferral allowed, assuming
retained earnings are immediately capitalized in the value of corporate
stock but that the stock is not immediately sold.

Estimates of the deferral

value suggest that it is considerable; we multiply the percentage of gains
includable,

PINCL,

by 50% to account for this deferral. 1973 tax law pro-

vided for 50% inclusion of capital gains in the PIT base, giving PINCL a
base value of a half.

With inflation, the annual increment in capital

recognition must be taken of the approximately 17.2% of corporate stock

Taxation on

savings through these channels is virtually nonexistant, but the model
already treats this tax break as part of a 30% savings exclusion from the
PIT, since approximately 30% of household savings in 1973 occurred through
these vehicles.

To avoid doubly crediting this tax break, 17.2% of retained

earnings must be treated here as being fully taxable.

industry.

Having described the manner in which the model derives capital tax
rates, we proceed to consider the changes incorporated in order to capture
the goals of the six tax reforms.

The proposal to raise pension maxima is

treated as an increase in the savings exclusion from 30 to 40%.
The plan to increase the interest exclusion is also straightforward.
Flow of Funds data on assets and liabilities suggest that the gross lending
by households is $793.2 billion, while lending by pensions and insurance
companies is $323.7 billion, or

29%

of the combined value.

Insurance and

pension income is lightly taxed but this exclusion is treated elsewhere.
Therefore interest excludability should only pertain to the sum directly
. paid to individuals.

We use gross rather than net household assets to de-

termine our weights, on the grounds that P2 does not affect the ability of
individuals to deduct interest payments from their taxes.

Letting

PI1~INCL

denote the percentage of interest income fully taxable at personal rates,
~

we have
g1

=

P1NT1NCL·(.7l} + .29

(9)

The impact of the excludability proposal, P2, is to reduce PINT1NCL from
1 to .3,

or

from 1 to one half.

The next three proposals involve only single parameter changes.

The

plan to remove the $100 dividend dequction but to allow a 60% dividends

- 36 -

exclusion from the personal tax base starts with the assumption that the
percentage distribution of total dividend income accruing to nontaxable
insurance companies and pensions equals their share in equity holdings,
the aforementioned 17.2%.

Referring to the percentage of dividends includ-

able in the PIT base as PDIVINCL,

~IV

gDIV

= PDIVINCL·(.828} +

may be written as

(10)

.172.

The model equivalent form of P3 is to change PDIVINCL from .9444 to .389,
or

from .96 to one half.
The proposal to increase the capital gains exclusion, P4, is modelled

in a like manner.

The term PINCL in equation (8) is reduced from .5 to

.3 to capture the reduction in capital gains includability from 50% in
1973 to Senator Long's suggested 30%.
The P5 proposal set forth as an alternative to Senator Long's proposal would
index capital gains by removing the capital gains tax on purely nominal appreciation in stock values.

This is achieved in the model by setting

~

equal to zero in equation (8).
The final, comprehensive indexing package involves several substantive
changes.

As with P5, capital gains indexing is achieved by setting

~

/ in equation (8) to zero. Indexing of depreciations is achieved in the following
manner. We start with the assumption that the indexing scheme will permit a
reduction in the tax liability of the i thindustry by an amount equal to

are found by aggregating and adding corporate capi-

to unpublished estimates of noncorporate depreciation obtained from the
Commerce Department.
The third element in comprehensive indexing involves the removal of
part of taxable interest income from the PIT.base and elimination of part
of the individual and corporate deduction for interest payments.

SCB figures

suggest a 1973 inflation rate of roughly 7% and prime interest rate of
slightly more than 8%.

Assuming the average loan was at 9%, a real interest

- 38 -

rate of 2% emerges.

Since 7/9 of interest income was only nominal,

we reduce the value of PINTINCL from 1 to 2/9 in the equation:
gI

=

PINTINCL· (.262) + (.738)

(14)

The removal of 7/9 of the deductions ~laimed on household interest
payments as well means that only household net interest-bearing assets,
some $114.9 million, should enter the weighting scheme.

This lowers the

weight on PINTINCL to .262 (compared to P2 in which gross interest-bearing
assets entered the weighting scheme). The impact of this measure is not
net
great, since most/interest income accrues to pensions and insurance companies, which are already favored.

The value of gI

only falls from 1 to .942.

Since it is not the intention of indexing to allow both interest payments and interest receipts to be deducted, corporate interest deductability is decreased to 2/9 of total interest payments.

Individuals and

corporations are thus allowed only a real deduction invariant with the inflat ion rate.

In principle, 7/9 of interest deductability for noncorporate

enterprises should also be removed.
a highly impractical proposal.

We felt, however, that this would be

Much unincorporated business, particularly

in agriculture, has a high ratio of interest payments to gross income.

A

reduction in their interest deductability could imply tax liability in excess of cash receipts since gain occurs as a lower real value of debt.
Without significant institutional changes, it is unclear that this could
be accoIIDnodated without severe

disruption:

It is also most unlikely that

the Congress would consider such a reduction in the first place.

We there-

action has the effect of increasing corporate taxes in industry by the

The tax rates and deductions are all based on our 1973 data and tax
laws. Our comparisons are all based on changes to the 1973 economy
and the following dynamic sequence based from the 1973 economy, which
had a $100 dividend exclusion.

In our model, individuals all have the same utility functional form.

Data consistency requirements imply differences in some parameters;
exogenously chosen ones are assumed identical across individuals.
Each CES form has constant marginal utility of income, though these
values may differ by class since parameters differ.

True inflation neutrality would be difficult, if not impossible to
achieve. Individuals and firms alter financial practices in manners
that prevent any practical proposal from achieving inflation neutrality.
Any change to capital tax rates such as the indexation of all capital
income could thus cause capricious capital gains and losses, following
the adage that an old tax is a good tax. Proposals for indexation
and their shortcomings are discussed in Brinner (1973) and Folsom (1978).

Plan 3 (60% dividend exclusion from the PIT) does relatively well here
because of its role as a partial corporate and personal tax integration

more than does P4.
