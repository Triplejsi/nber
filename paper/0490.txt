Interternporal Substitution and the Business Cycle

ABSTRACT

This paper summarizes the theoretical role of intertemporal substitution

variables in the "new classical macroeconomics." An important implication
is that positive monetary shocks tend to raise expected real returns that are
calculated from the usual partial information set, but tend to lower realized

real returns. After reviewing previous empirical findings in the area, the
study reports new results on the behavior of returns on the New York Stock Exchange and on 'freasury Bills. The analysis isolates realized real rate of return
effects that are significantly positive for a temporary government purchases

variable and significantly regative for monetary movements. However, the results
do not support the theoretical distinction between money shocks and anticipated

changes in money. Since the study focuses on realized real returns, which can
be measured in a straightforward manner, there is no evidence on the hypothesis
that expected real returns, which are calculated on the basis of incomplete in-

formation, rise with monetary disturbances. Because this proposition is sensitive
to the specification of information sets, It may be infeasible to test it
directly.

Intemporal substitution variables play a major role in the

new "equilibrium" models of the business cycle. A central feature
of these models is the response of supply to perceived temporary
opportunities for unusual rewards to working or producing; that is,

to relatively high anticipated real rates of return. In some cases,
as in explanations for the non-neutrality of money, the intertemporal

substitution mechanism is combined with confusions between general

inflation and shifts in relative prices. In these circumstances the
expectations of high returns are not borne out by the behavior of

subsequently realized returns. In other settings, such as temporary
increases of government purchases during wartime, economic expansion
is stimulated by accurately perceived rises in real rates of return.

The first part of this paper summarizes the theoretical role of
intertemporal substitution variables in the "new classical macroecomonics."
Some of this discussion draws on material from my survey paper (Barro,

l980b). The later parts of this section stress empirical hypotheses
concerning the contemporaneous and lagged effects of monetary and
government purchases variables on realized real rates of return.
The next section describes briefly some previous empirical findings

that relate to the business cycle role of intertemporal substitution

variables. This discussion is followed by some new empirical evidence
on realized real rates of return. The analysis deals with returns on
New York Stock Exchange stocks and on Treasury Bills. The principal
results concern reduced form effects of monetary and government
purchases variables on these realized returns.

I. Theoretical Analysis

A. Setup of the Model
Consider the type of model where goods and services are traded
in a large number of localized markets or "islands," indexed by a

parameter z. A simple version of the imperfect information/intertemporal substitution story, due to Phelps (1970) and Lucas and
Rapping (1969) and related to ideas advanced by M. Friedman (1968),
allows individuals to receive current information on local prices

P(z), but at most lagged information about the economy-wide average
price level P or other nominal aggregates like the money stock. The
underlying idea is that local prices reflect a mixture of the unperceived nominal aggregates and a variety of local factors that are
specific to markets, individuals, occupations, etc.

Fluctuations in

these local elements, which involve changes in the composition of
technology and tastes, re-evaluation of individual talents or
opportunities, and the like, are viewed as having far more significance
than general business conditions for individual fortunes (Lucas, 1977,

pp. 19-20). In particular, the exploitation of these local opportunities
may require rapid and large responses by individuals, whether in terms
of accepting or offering a job, making a sale, undertaking an invest-

ment project, and so on. Under imperfect information conditions,
individuals attempt to purge the general price component from their
observed price signals in order to make the appropriate allocative
decisions.

-3-

Specifically, suppliers in a local market compare their observed
current price or wage opportunities with expectations of prices or

wages at alternative times and places. In a simplified setting where
individuals visit only one market each period and where intermarket
mobility over time is sufficient to make all markets look equally
attractive one period ahead, the margin of substitution will involve

a comparison of P(z) with EP+i, which is the expectation formed
today in market z of next period's general price level. In this
setting the expected price for "next period" represents the perceived
long-run average reward for the pertinent type of labor service or

other good. Changes in current actual prices (wages) relative to
anticipated future prices (wages) are viewed as inducing substantial

intertemporal substitution on the supply side. In particular, the
temporary nature of the perceived wage or price offer implies a
substitution toward current activities and away from planned effort

at an array of future dates. Similar intertemporal substitution
would not arise for the case of a perceived permanent change in a
relative price variable such as the current real wage rate.

The relation of observed to anticipated prices appears as the
central relative price variable in the models of Lucas (1972, 1973),
Sargent (1973), Sargent and Wallace (1975), Barro (1976), et al.

The precise form of the relative price variable differs across models.

For example, Lucas (1973, p. 327) writes his supply variable in

logarithmic terms as P(z) -

EP;

that is, EP appears without

explanation instead of EPti. However, most of his results would
be unaffected by this difference in form.

-4-

Sargent (1973, P. 434) an& Sargent and Wallace (1975, p. 242) use the
variable Pt -

Et lPt, where E lPt is the average expectation formed last period

of this period's price level. A direct comparison of

with EiPt is difficult

to reconcile with the interteinporal substitution or search stories of labor

supply. Notably, in contrast to the interteinporal substitution model, the
Sargent/Wallace setup seems to predict a supply response to a contemporaneously

understood monetary change that was not predicted at date t-1. However, in

many cases the contemporaneous expectations, EP or EP1, would be formed
by updating the prior value, Et1Pt, for the information contained in current
data. If current information is limited to that contained in a local price

observation, P(z), then a formulation based on a variable like P(z) —
may be indistinguishable from one involving P(z) -

EPt.

For example, if

the Bayesian updating rule appears in linear form as EPt =

OP(z)

+

(l_e)Et1P,

where the 0 coefficient would depend on the relative values of price variances
across markets and over time (see Lucas (1973, p. 328) and Barro (1976, p. 9)),

then P(z) -

EPt

=

(l_0)(P(z)

_E 1P)__that is, the two forms of relative

price variables would be linearly related. The two specifications would be
distinguished only by structural breaks that shifted the value of the 0 parameter
or by the existence of additional variables, such as war conditions or foreign
shocks,

that provided extra contemporaneous information about the general price

level.
The impact of a variable like Pt - Et

has been rationalized along

long-term nominal contracting grounds by Gray (1976) and Fischer (1977).

The

argument is that previous expectations of current prices determine some portion

—5—

of current contractual nominal wages, which would then be compared

with current prices to determine the supply of commodities by firms.
This interpretation is disputed in Barro (1977) on the grounds that
efficient contracts would not permit variables like employment to
be influenced by perceived, purely nominal disturbances.

A direct comparison of next period's expected nominal price
with currently observed prices is appropriate only if stores of
value earn a zero nominal rate of return; that is, if fiat money is

the only available asset. More generally, as noted in Lucas and
Rapping (1969), McCal].uzn (1978), Barro (l980a), and King (1978),

the anticipated future prices would effectively be discounted by
the available nominal interest rate over the applicable horizon.
Instead of specifying a supply response to Pt(z) relative to

EzPti which is a measure of the anticipated one-period real
rate of return on money from the perspective of market z, the
pertinent variable would be the expected real rate of return based
on the holding of assets that earn a nominal interest rate
Rt.

Equilibrium business cycle models typically incorporate a
positive speculative response of supply to perceived excesses of
observed prices over anticipated (future) normal values; that is,

to unusual real rate of return opportunities. An

analogous type

of spcculation implies a negative effect of the same type df
relative price variable on the demand side (Barro, 1976, p. 5;

-6-

B. Friedman, 1978, P. 76). In a specification that employs an
anticipated real rate of return measure as the relative price
variable, the aggregate demand equation when considered as an
average over the markets would exhibit the conventional negative
substitution effect of expected real interest rates on consumption
and investment.

Suppose that aggregate supply and demand are influenced by the
same relative price variable; for example, by an anticipated real

rate of return with comparable information on prices, etc., on both

sides of each local market. If the other right-hand side variables
for supply and demand are exogenous real variables, then an equilibrium

solution would involve a dichotomy between monetary variables and the

real sector. The equation of supply to demand would determine output
and the anticipated real rate of return in each local market as

functions of the exogenous real variables. Therefore, in this type
of model it is essential for obtaining a link between nominal

disturbances and real variables that the monetary shocks impact directly
on excess coiimodity demand.1 One possibility would be a real balance-

type effect on commodity demand or supply. In Lucas's (1972, p. 106)
overlapping-generations model in which money is the only store of
value, a positive real balance effect on aggregate demand corresponds

to the older generation's incentive to spend all of its savings from

the previous period.2 For the context of households that have access
to interest-bearing assets and that effectively plan over an infinite
horizon (perhaps because they have an operative bequest motive), it

is argued in Barro (l980a, pp.

)

that

the principal direct monetary

effect on excess commodity demand would involve the discrepancy between the

money stock and

its

contemporaneously perceived value. Essentially, this

setup ignores the wealth effect corresponding to changes in the excess

burden due to anticipated inflation. The formulation implies, in
particular, that equal increases in total money and in the desired

money stock have no direct effect on excess commodity demand. The
distinction between this type of specification of the monetary wealth
effect and the real balance type specification arises primarily in
analyses of anticipated inflation, which involve changes in real

balances but no changes in money relative to perceived money. If last
period's money stock is viewed as observable, the latter variable
becomes the unperceived part of current money growth, denoted by

mt -Em.

of prices across markets, R is a one-period nominal interest rate on an

asset that is assumed to be traded economy-wide, s'd > 0 are relative price

elasticities, s'd > 0 are "wealth" elasticities, and the 6(z)'s are local
disturbance terms that add to zero in summations across the markets. In the
present setup there is only one form of interest-bearing asset--notably, the

model does not encompass imperfect substitutability between bonds and equity
claims. Further, some of the results depend on a setup that allows individuals
to observe an economy-wide nominal interest rate, rather than a pre-set global

real rate of return. Constants, economy-wide real shocks, or systematic
effects on natural outputs could readily be added to equations (1) and (2).

The assumptions that goods not travel across markets during a
period and that local prices are completely flexible generate the equi-

librium condition for each commodity market, y(z) =

y(z).

the model would have to be closed to determine

P(z)'s by specifying some sort of portfolio balance condition. However, for present purposes, the main results can be obtained by

studying the intermediate equations (3) and (4)4

Association Between Money Shocks and Output
The direction of association of output with money shocks in
equation (3) depends on the relative magnitudes of some elasticities.

The speculative supply coefficient a, which is stressed in these
types of models, entails a positive relation, but the demand

coefficient d has an opposite implication. A sufficient condition
for obtaining the "normal" net positive relation is that money shocks

impact directly nstly on the demand side; that is, >

8.

The direct

monetary effect on supply--which can be viewed as reflecting a wealth effect
on demand for leisure--is, in fact, typically assumed to be negligible in
macroanalysis.

Behavior of Rates of Return

As stressed by Sargent (1973, pp. 442-44), there is a direct tie between
departures of output from its natural value (which is itself treated as constant on average across markets in the present setting) and departures of

the anticipated real rate of return from the natural rate. Since money
shocks impact positively on excess commodity demand, the relative price

variable r(z) moves positively with m -

Em

in equation (4) in order to

maintain clearing of the local commodity market.

-10-

It should be stressed that the pertinent variable above is the antici-

pated real rate of return, rather than the realized value.

In models with an

economy-wide nominal interest rate where monetary aggregates are not observed

contemporaneously, the realized and anticipated returns tend to move in opposite

directions in response to a money shock. For example, consider a setting where
nominal aggregates are observed with a one-period lag, where money growth rates
are serially uncorrelated, and where no elements of persistence in output are

introduced (see below). Under these conditions, a change in this period's
money stock would be reflected one-to-one in next period's price level. Because
5
of incomplete current information about nominal aggregates, equilibrium expected

future prices end up rising by less than the actual (full current information)

mean value of future prices; that is, by less than one-to-one with the current

monetary disturbance. The full equilibrium then involves current prices rising
relative to the "sluggish" expected future prices, but by less than one—to-One

with the current money stock. Portfolio balance typically requires the implied
increase in current real money balances to be accompanied by a decrease in the
6

current economy-wide nominal interest rate.

The rise in the anticipated real

rate of return is consistent with these results because the decline in the

nominal interest rate is smaller in magnitude than the rise in current prices
relative to expected future prices (that is, than the magnitude of decline in

locally expected inflation rates). Note, however, that the mean (full current
information) realized real rate of return must have fallen, since nominal interest rates have declined and the rise in the mean of actual future prices is
greater than that of current prices.

—11—

The inverse effect of money shocks on current nominal interest rates is
not a central element in the above story. Positive serial correlation in the
money growth process can reverse this effect, essentially by introducing the
feature that the perceived parts of current money shocks signal future money
creation and general inflation, which lead to increases in the current economy-

wide nominal interest rate. This change leaves unaltered the conclusions
regarding anticipated real rates of return. Unperceived monetary injections
continue to raise anticipated real rates of return as indicated in equation (4).

(The rise in the nominal interest rate cancels the effects of anticipated general inflation in the formula for expected real rates of return.)
The effects on realized real rates of return in models with an economy-wide
market that sets a nominal interest rate are generally dependent on the nature

of the serial dependence in the money growth process. Positive serial correlation--which characterizes the post-World War II U.S. experience--implies that a
current money shock has an even larger effect on the actual (full current information) mean value of future prices relative to the effect on currently anticipated (partial current information) future prices.

The mechanism involves

the inverse effect on next periodts money demand of the inflationary expectations that arise after the current money shock has been fully perceived.

Be-

cause of this effect, the presence of positive serial correlation in the money
growth process reinforces the inverse effect of money shocks on realized real
rates of return.

The preceding story applies to the effects of unperceived monetary movements on contemporaneously expected real rates of return and on subsequently

realized returns. If nominal aggregates are observed with a one-period lag,
the

present type of model would not account for effects of money shocks on

output or expected real returns that last beyond the initial "period." Per-

sisting

effects of monetary and other disturbances have been explained in a

1"

number of models, such as Lucas (1975) and Sargent (1979, Ch. XVI), from
consideration of stock adjustment effects. A key element in these
models is the existence of "exce;s capacity" in periods following

the positive shock to aggregate demand. For example, the initial monetaryinduced response of investment, production and employment is reflected

later in increased stocks of capital, inventories, employees, etc. Because
of stock adjustment costs in a generalized sense, these high levels of stocks
boost commodity supply7 beyond the time at which nominal disturbances are fully

understood. However, the spur to aggregate demand--which was provided initially
by the direct impact of the nominal shock--must now be generated by a reduction
in expected real rates of return (that is, by a decline in prices relative to
8

expected discounted future prices).

.

.

Since incomplete information is not a

part of this excess capacity effect, the reduction in expected real returns
would now coincide with a decline in the (full current information) mean
value of subsequently realized returns.
To summarize, unperceived monetary disturbances would induce a contemporaneous increase in expected real returns, to be followed (when information
on nominal aggregates becomes available and when the excess capacity effect

becomes important) by a drop in expected returns. Realized real rates of
return would be reduced throughout the period subsequent to a monetary shock.

C. Effects of Government Purchases
Interteoral substitution effects associated with movements in government purchases have been stressed in papers by Hall (1979) and Barro (1979).

These effects arise in the context of temporary purchases, such as wartime
expenditures, which have a strongly positive impact on aggregate demand.9

—13—

Long-run changes in the share of gross national product absorbed by govern-

ment purchases have a corresponding inverse effect on households' permanent
disposable income, which tends to eliminate the net impact of these purchases
on aggregate demand.'°

The positive effect of temporary

induces

a rise

in

government purchases on aggregate demand

current conunodity prices relative to expected, discounted

future prices; that is, an increase in expected real rates of return. This
price movement restores commodity market clearing through a combination of

reduced private demand and increased aggregate supply. The positive supply
response reflects the interteinporal substitution of factor services and

final products toward periods with relatively high (discounted) values of
wages and prices, which signal unusual rewards for intensive work effort and

production. This behavior implies that periods with high values of government
purchases relative to "normal," such as wartime, will also be periods with

relatively high values of output. The substitution effects set off by temporary government purchases have been stressed by Hall (1979, section 2),

who points out also that this mechanism differs in some important respects
from the response of supply to monetary misperceptions that occurs in some
business cycle theories that stress interteniporal substitution effects, as

discussed above. The effect of temporary government purchases on the time
arrangement of work and production does not rely on elements of misperception
with respect to the general price level or other variables. In particular,
the hypothesized positive effect of temporary government purchases on anti-

cipated real rates of return carries over in this case to a positive ffect
on the (full current information) mean of subsequently realized returns.

-14-

Lagged effects of temporary government purchases on output and real

rates of return are ambiguous. If the private plant and personnel that
produce to government order were entirely non-specific for this purpose,

then the persistence effects of shifts in government purchases would parallel

those of monetary shocks. In particular, the excess capacity prevailing in
future periods would tend to maintain high levels of output. Future real rates
of return would be depressed in this case. However, the opposite conclusions
emerge when factors are specific to government-ordered work. Therefore, the
primary theoretical hypothesis is for a positive effect on real rates of

return

(and output)

of the contemporaneous value of temporary government

purchases.

For empirical purposes I utilize a series for the "normal" ratio of
government purchases to GNP that was
time

constructed

in Barro (1979, part II). A

series analysis of rtal government purchases was used to relate the expected

value of future purchases to currently observed variables. Shifts in the
ratio of federal plus state and local non-defense purchases to GNP appeared
to be permanent, in the sense that the most recent observation of this

variable provides the best prediction for future values.11 Similar behavior
characterizes movements in the defense purchases ratio when these changes do

not accompany wars. The only temporary movements that were isolated were the
shifts in defense purchases that were associated with wars. This behavior
is exhibited for the period since 1941 by the series labeled (gW - gW) j•

table

1, where gw is the ratio of real defense purchases to real GNP and

is the constructed expected long-run average value of this ratio. Because

the (gw - gw

)

variable corresponds to a gap between the current and

"normal"

—15—

values of the purchases ratio, rather than to a spread between actual and

aunts, it should not be surprising that this variable exhibits
a substantial amount of positive serial correlation. In particular, the large
"anticipated't

years with small negative values of (gW - gW) are

by a smaller number of wartime years with larger excesses of gW over gW•
(However, war years cannot be deemed special, since they constitute 42 per
cent of the years since 1941 and 33 per cent of those since 1946.12) The present
analysis does not encompass any effects of war that are not proxied by the tem-

porary purchases variable. For example, the investigation does not deal with
separate effects of patriotism, conscription, or changing probabilities of victory,
which could influence future property rights.

II. Previous Enirical Findings on theBusiness Cycle Role of Intertemporal
Substitution Variables
Sargent (1976) estimates a model from quarterly U.S. data over the 1951

to 1973 period. The analysis includes a price-surprise term, Pt -

_l1

as

a key explanatory variable. (Recall that Pt represents the log of the price
level, which is measured in this
is

case

by the GNP deflator.) A major

finding

the minor explanatory role for the unenloyment rate of this price surprise

variable, which has an estimated coefficient that is negative, but with a
t-value of only 2.0. When the ndel is reestimated by Fair (1979, pp. 703—08)

It seems likely that the Sargent and Fair estimates are confounded by
simultaneity problems; clearly, in an OLS regression with the unemployment
rate as a dependent variable, the sign of the estimated coefficient on the
price-surprise term would depend on whether demand or supply shocks were
dominant

over the sample. Fair (1979, P. 704) uses only the nominal money

stock and

population as exogenous variables for carrying out two—stage least

squares; deleting Sargent's (1976, p. 234) government purchases, employment

and

surplus variables because they were absent from the structural model.

(The treatment of the surplus as exogenous is surprising in any case.) Since
the contemporaneous realizations of the two exogenous variables and of the
long-term flQm]Jlal interest rate Cwhich is treated by Fair as predetermined)
are

the main basis for distinguishing supply effects of the

is

unclear that

estimates can be interpreted as supply parameters. For example, one

would question the independence of the interest rate from supply disturbances.

These doubts are reinforced by the dramatic reversal in sign for the

price-

surprise coefficient that arises when Fair (p. 706) adds the years 1974-77

to the sample. The natural interpretation is that adverse supply shocks
were

important since 1974, with these shocks producing a positive correlation

between

the

unemployment rate

and price movements (and nominal

interest rate

changes).
The price-surprise term,

-

E1—111,

is also not an appropriate representa-

tion of the intertermporal substitution variable in business cycle models,
as discussed above.'4 The relevant comparison is between current prices

—17—

(or wages) and expected future values, so the EiP would be replaced by a
variable like EtPt+l. The introduction of (partial) contemporaneous information
into the expectational calculation substantially complicates any empirical

analysis. In some cases (see below) it is possible to avoid the problem of
exp1icity constructing expectations by studying the behavior or realized real

rates of return. Finally, a nominal interest rate would appear also in the
interterrnporal substitution variable; that is, EP+1 would enter in discounted
form for a comparison with Pt.
The empirical analyses of annual U.S. data since World War II that are
summarized in Barro (l980c) deal primarily with reduced form effects of money

shocks on the unemployment

rate, output

and

the

price level. The investigation

is extended to quarterly data in Barro and Rush (1980). The major finding is

statistically significant and quantitatively important expansionary influence on real economic activity of a constructed money shock variable. The

the

positive

response of output to a monetary disturbance is estimated to peak

with a 3-4 quarter lag, then gradually diminish to become insignificant

about

7 quarters.

The negative response of the unemployment

rate

after

is similar,

although possibly revealing a slightly longer lag relative to that of output.

The empirical evidence did not indicate any periods of contractionary response
following the roughly two-year interval of above normal real activity following

a money shock. Given the relatively minor role played by price surprises in
the results of Sargent (1976) and Fair (1979) discussed above, it appears that
these monetary influences on output and the unemployment rate involve channels
that have yet to be isolated.

—18—

The results in Barro (1979) document positive output effects of govern-

ment purchases for annual U.S. data since 1946. There is some indication
that the largest expansionary influence applies to temporary movements in
purchases; but, as noted above, the only temporary variations that have been

isolated are parts of the defense expenditures associated with wars. Long-run
changes in defense spending are estimated to have a significantly positive,

but smaller, effect on output. The output effect of non-defense federal plus
state and local purchases is imprecisely determined. The relatively small
amount of sampling variation in this explanatory variable and the necessity of

using an instrument for estimation purposes imply a large standard error for

the estimated coefficient.'5 Lagged effects of governemnt purchases on output

are unimportant in the annual data. As. in the case of the reduced form
monetary studies, the results on government purchases lack a description of
the relative price variables that stimulate an increase In supply.
Bortz (1979) uses quarterly post-World War II U.S. data to explore the
reduced form effects of money shocks on the realized real rate of return from
3—month

by
out

Treasury Bills. The study uses

Barro and

Rush (1980)

the nney shock series constructed

and measures real returns on Treasury Bills by netting

changes in the consumer price index. The prinipal finding (Bortz, 1979,

table 3)

is

a significantly negative effect of the contemporaneous and three

quarterly lagged
t-values for the

values of money shocks on the realized real return. The
estimated coefficients from

lags zero

to three are

in a

range from 2.4 to 2.7. Some statistical tests indicate a preference for a
form that utilizes

money shock variables over an alternative that employs

-19-

actual growth rates of the money supply. Overall, these results support the
theoretical implications of business cycle models that stress intertemporal
substitution variables.

Hall (1979, P. 16) uses quarterly, post-World War II U.S. data to estimate
a "labor supply" function with an intertemporal substitution measure as a

right-side variable. He finds a significantly positive effect Ct-value =

2.4)

of this price variable on total employment when military purchases and military

employment are used as instruments. The implied elasticity of labor supply
with respect to the current real wage rate is about one-half. Hall's basic
inference (p. 17) is that increases in military purchases and employment induce

an increase in aggregate employment via a rise in the intertemporal substitu-

tion variable. This finding accords with Hall's theoretical arguments and
with the analysis of government purchases that was presented above. However,
there is some di.fference between Hall's intertemporal substitution variable

and the previously discussed real rate of return variables. Hall's yariable

stitute for future leisure, it may be preferable to rewrite the substitution
variable in terms of current nominal wage rates relative to discounted expected
future nominal wage rates; that is, as an expected real rate of return with
the rate of nominal wage rate change substituting for the rate of price change.

However, if cyclical movements in real wage rates are relatively unimportant,

the distinction between this form of the intertemporal substitution variable
and Hall's construct will be minor.

III. New Reduced Form Evidence on Realized Rates of Return
This section presents some evidence from annual, post-World War II U.S.

data on the effects of monetary and government purchases variables on realized

real rates of return. The focus on realized returns avoids a serious empirical
problem concerning the formation of price expectations. As the theoretical
section makes clear, for the interval where movements in monetary aggregates

are not directly observed, the sign of the effect of monetary disturbances on
anticipated real returns depends on whether conditioning is done on partial or

complete current information. Perceived real returns based on partial information rise with money shocks, while those that could have been calculated based

on full information decline. Not surprisingly, the empirical results are highly
sensitive to the choice of which current information to use in forming expecta-

tions. Some of these problems are avoided by completely neglecting current
observations in these calculations, but issues are then raised concerning the

timing of receipt of lagged information. Further, this procedure incorrectly
ignores some contemporaneous information, such as war prospects, that should
be included in determining expectations of future prices.
The theory does have several clear implications concerning the behavior of

realized returns, as is clear from the earlier discussion. These propositions
can be tested in a reasonably straightforward manner.

A drawback of this pro-

cedure is that it fails to test directly a key hypothesis that is associated

—21—

with equilibrium business cycle theory--namely, the positive effect of monetary
disturbances on contemporaneously (and incorrectly) percieved real returns.

The concluding section contains some additional discussion of this gap in the
analysis.

Nominal rates of return are measured empirically in two ways: first,
as the annualized return to maturity on 3-month Treasury Bills sold on secondary
markets; and second, as the total return on a value-weighted portfolio of all

New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks. The latter series is reported by the
Center for Research in Security Prices of the University of Chicago. In interpreting the results it should be recalled that the theory applies to a setting

of an economy-wide nominal bond market. The implications posed by the existence
of equity shares has not been examined in the theoretical framework.
For the Treasury Bill series the return for year t, (RT)t, is the annual

average of the 3-month bill returns. For the NYSE, the return (RMV)t applies
to the period from Janaury 1 to December 31 of year t. Realized real returns
have been constructed by subtracting either the annual rate of change of the
seasonally-unadjusted wholesale price index (WPI) measured from January of
year t to January of year t+l, or the change of the seasonally-adjusted GNP
deflator (PGNP) measured from the first quarter of year t to the first quarter

of year t+l.16 There is a minor discrepancy in the timing between the inflation
rates and the nominal returns, but the results were insensitive to some altera-

tions in this dating.17
I have examined also the behavior of constructed "after-tax" real returns

variables. The tax rate applied to the nominal returns is the one implicit
in the relation between the nominal yield to maturity on Moody's Aaa rated

—22—

corporate bonds and that on Standard ,

Poor's high grade municipal bonds. The

tax rate is determined in table 1 from the formula, i = 1 - (R

municipal

/R

),

Aaa

where the R variables represent nominal yields. This calculation assumes that
corporate and municipal bonds are equivalent except for the (federal) income tax

exemption on municipals. I have used the same tax rate variable to adjust
Treasury Bill and equityreturns, although this procedure neglects various
differences in the tax treatment of these two types

of returns.

Because of this

and other problems, the constructed after-tax returns series should be regarded

as subject to considerable measurement error. However, the tax rate variable
that was used may capture the major secular changes in the true average marginal
tax rates on the two forms of asset returns.

For the case of monetary shocks, I focus on the current and lagged effects
of the annual money shock variable DMR (table 1), which was derived from the
analysis in Barro (1980c,

).

Essentially,the

values for annual average Ml

growth appear relative to the growth that is associated typically with current

correspond roughly to the average annual real

spot returns. Therefore, these returns should exhibit the theoretical relationships, which predict a negative effect of contemporaneous and lagged money
shocks, and a positive effect of the contemporaneous value of government purchases
relative to normal.

—23-

The NYSE returns reflect both average spot discount rates and the effects
of innovations on asset values, For example--with the expected time path of
real share earnings held fixed--an inverse effect of a money shock on real
discount rates would imply an upward adjustment to contemporaneous real asset

prices. Realized returns up to the date that includes the shock would be moved

upward, while

subsequent

returns would be pushed downward. The "contemporaneous"

effects revealed by the present time-aggregated annual data would be ambiguous,
si.nce they involve the offset of these two forces, The analysis of contemporaneous effects is complicated further if the shocks alter projections of real

share earnings. These difficulties do not pertain to the analysis of lagged
effects, Which would presumably be incorporated into asset prices before the

start of year t, Therefore, lagged monetary shocks would be expected to exert
a negative effect on realized real NYSE returnsi8

The basic empirical results appear in table 2. All regressions apply to
annual data for the 1949-77 period, The starting date was dictated by the
strong effect of World War II controls on the reported price data from 1943 to

1947, Some of the data after 1977 were unavailable at the time of this study.
I consider first the behavior of the stock returns, RMV. The findings are
similar for these returns whether inflation rates are measured by the WPI or

-24-

by the GNP deflator. For convenIence, I discuss only the results that use
the WPI.

The estimated effects of the temporary government purchases variable on

realized real returns, RMV-D(WPI), are positive throughout. For specifications
that include also the money shock variable DMR, the t-.values of the estimated

government purchases coefficients are in the neighborhood of 2. For example,
with DMRtI as the only additional explanatory variable, the estimated coeffi—

dent on the (gW gW) variable is 5.1, s.e. =

2.6

(line 1 of the table) for

the pre-tax real rate of return regression; and 3.8, s.e. =

2.1,

for the case

of after-tax returns (line 5). The results are basically similar except for
a small deterioration of the fit if the lagged value of the gW -

g)

variable

replaces the current value, With the DMRt 1 variable as the other explanatory
variable, the estimated coefficient of the temporary government purchases
variable is then 4.7, s.e. =

2.1,

2.6,

for the pre-tax returns case; and 3.9, s.e. =

for the after-tax returns. When the contemporaneous and lagged values of

the (gW

gW) variable are entered simultaneously, the estimated coefficients

are both positive20 but, because of the high degree of intercorrelation between
these variables, the estimated coefficients are individually insignificantly

different from zero.
There is some indication that permanent movements in government purchases

do not have the real rate of return influences that are produced by temporary

shifts. The variables g1 and g1 (gP is the ratio of real non-defense

for the after—tax values (line 7). (The estimated coefL.

fit of the equations that contain actual values of money growth are actually
superior to those based on the DMR values, which differs sharply from comparisons
of estimated equations for output and the unemployment rate (Barro, 1980c,

Regressions were run also with sets of DMR and DM variables included
simultaneously, which permits tests for the significance of a set of DMR or

DM variables, conditional on the inclusion of the other set. For example, for
the case of pre-tax returns where a contemporaneous and one-year lag value of
each variable is considered, the test for significance of the DMR values, given

-26-

the inclusion of the DM's, corresponds to the statistic F3 =

0.9.

The

corresponding test for the significance of the DM values, given the inclusion
of the DMR's, yields the statistic F.. =

2.1.

Since both statistics are beloc

the 5 per cent critical value of 3.4, the hypothesis of zero effect for either
the set of DMR variables or the set of DM values, given the inclusion of the

other set, would be accepted at the S per cent level. Nevertheless, the results
can be viewed as suggesting (at a significance level below 95 per cent) some nega-

tive impact on subsequent real stock returns of the perceived growth rate of money

(which would be closly related to anticipated future monetary growth rates),

given the values of monetary shocks. In this respect the results are reminiscent
of those of Faina and Schwert (1977, pp. 135, ff.), who have stressed the puzzling

negative relation between anticipated inflation (as measured by the nominal
interest rate on Treasury Bills with one-month maturity) and subsequently realized
NYSE returns. Related results have been presented by Jaffe and Mandelker (1976)

and Nelson (1976). These types of findings are elaborated and some explanations
are offered in Fania (1980, pp. 21, ff.).

The results for realized real returns on 3-month Treasury Bills show much
less explanatory power for the government purchases and monetary variables.

A negative effect of the contemporaneous monetary shock does appear, which
parallels the results from quarterly data that were reported by Bortz Q.979)

and discussed above. For example, for the pre-tax returns net of WPI inflation,
the estimated coefficient on DMRt is —1.4, s.e. =

0.6

while that for the after-tax returns is -1.5, s.e. =

(line 10 of table 2);

0.7 (line 14). The result

that the contemporaneous money shock effect is negative on the Treasury Bill
returns and insignificant for the NYSE returns does accord with the theoretical

discussion. The Treasury Bill regressions do not indicate a preference for the
DM form of the equations, although the hypothesis of zero coefficients for either

-27-

the set of DMR variables or the set of DM values would be accepted, given the

inclusion of the other set. In either form of the equations, the contemporaneous
(artnual) value has the only significant monetary effect. One and two-year lagged

values of the DMR or DM variables are insiiificant (lines 10 and 14).
For the cases where the DMR variable is included, the temporary governmont purchases variable has

a positive estimated effect on the Treasury Bill

returns, with t-values close to 2. The estimated coefficient for the case of
pre-tax returns (line 10) is 1.3, s.e. =

is 1.4 s.e.

0.7;

while that for the after-tax case

0.7 (line 14). However, the government purchases variable becomes

insignificant when the WPI is replaced by the GNP deflator to measure the

inflation rate (lines 26 and 30). CThe t-values for the contemporaneous
monetary variables remain close to 2 in this case.)
I will consider now some details of the estimates for the equations based
on the WPI that use the explanatory variables DMRt,

and (gW_gW)•

Although this equation form is more understandable on theoretical grounds than
that expressed in terms of DM values, it should be recalled that the statistical

results do not reinforce this choice of form. The actual values of the pre-tax
realized real returns from the NYSE and from 3-month Treasury Bills are shown
in table 3 along with estimated values and residuals from the regressions
shown in lines 2 and 10 of table 2.

The estimated coefficient on DMRt

l

in the RMV equation (table 2, line 2)

of -8.3 implies that a one percentage point money shock reduces the mean of

next year's real NYSE returns by more than 8 percentage points! Since the
estimated standard error from the money growth rate equation that generates
the DMR values is .014, the results imply that monetary fluctuations have

-28-

produced large movements in ex ante real returns, on the NYSE.

However, this

relationship should be viewed in perspective to the sample standard deviation
of the realized real returns on stocks, which was .195 from 1949 to 1977.23
Since the estimated coefficient on DMRt

in the Treasury Bills equation (iine l0)

is negligible, the effect of DMRt . on the NYSE returns represents also a differential effect on the expected real returns from stocks and short-term government
securities.

The estimated coefficient for the (gW_gl) variable of 5.8 in line 2
implies a very large positive effect of war on real NYSE returns.

For example,

the Korean War values for (fgW) of .026 imply that the realized real
returns would be higher by .24 than those associated with the typical peacetime

value for (gW_gW) of -.015. It is clear that this magnitude of effect could
not be extrapolated in a linear form to the World War II experience, where

the values of gW - gW) are above 0.3.24 These results should not be viewed as
indicating that war is good for the stock market. Rather, the basic finding is
that the high values of temporary government purchases associated with wartime
imply an increase in the required real rate of return on equity--that is, a rise

in the discount rate applied to anticipated earnings. In this context it
w

is notable that the results remain similar if the lagged value for (g -g )--

which is presumably known by the start of year t--replaces the contemporaneous
value. However, the present results do not rule out a separate effect of new
information about war conditions on equity prices, which could work through
an effect on anticipated earnings flows.

-29-

There is, of course, no inconsistency between efficient capital markets
and a predictable pattern either of overall real returns or of the return

f.iZEerential between stocks and Treasury Bills. The present results can be
interpreted as showing a strong positive effect of war and (money-induced)

recession on the return premium for stocks. It has, however, been argued
(for example, in Nelson, 1976, p. 482; and Fama and Schwert, 1976, p. 136)
that assets like common stocks should not exhibit lower expected returns than
less risky assets like Treasury Bills.25 For the estimated values shown in
Table 3, this situation occurs for 7 of the 29 years of the sample (1956, 1960,

1969—70, 1972-74). All of these years except for 1960, but no other years in
the sample, exhibit negative estimated real returns on stocks. These results
apply to equations that include the contemporaneous values DMRt and (gW gW)•

However, basically similar results obtain if only the lagged variables DMRt1

and (2W_gW)

returns

are used as regressors. In this

case negative expected real

on stocks apply for 1951, 1956, 1960, 1969, and 1972-74.

It is likely that the ftmctiQnal form could satisfactorily be restricted

to confine the expected real NYSE returns to exceed either those on Treasury

Bills or zero. For example, estimates of the functional form,

[RMV- DCWPI)Jt = exp[a0

+a1DMR +a2DMR +a3(g"— g')]

+ error

term,

which restricts the estimated values to be positive, yields a log likelihood
that is only 1.1 below that of the linear form

(table

2, line 2). Although

the linear and non-linear forms of the return equationS have

not

presently

been set up to allow for a test of nested hypotheses, these results suggest
that the appearance of negative estimated Cor expected) real NYSE returns
not an important problem.

IV. Conclusions
In some respects the new empirical findings support the theoretical
model--notably, in isolating realized real rate of return effects that are
significantly positive for the temporary government purchases variable and

significantly negative forthe monetary variables. The statistical preference
for actual monetary movements over the constructed money shock variable and
the relatively weak effects on real Treasury Bill yields are less satisfactory
features.

A different issue concerns the extent to which the present empirical analysis
distinguishes hypotheses of equilibrium business cycle theory from those of more

conventional macroanalysis. The usual IS/LM model predicts a positive effect of
government purchases on rates of return, which should presumably be interpreted

as an effect on real, rather than nominal, returns. In this respect the predictions
parallel those of the equilibrium models. The IS/LM story involves crowding-out
of private demands with no mention of positive supply effects, but the direction

of interest rate response would still be positive. An important difference in the
"equilibrium" approach is the stress on temporary government purchases, which does
receive some support from the empirical results,
With respect to monetary movements, the IS/LM framework suggests a negative
response of interest rates, although the distinction between real and nominal

rates is less clear in this respect. The equilibrium analysis predicts a negative

effect on realized real retums and an ambiguous impact on nominal returns (which
involves an effect on generally anticipated inflation). The stress on monetary
shocks, rather than perceived movements in money, in the equilibrium viewpoint
was not borne out in the present results, as mentioned above.

-31.-

The correspondence in some respects for the rate of return implications of
the equilibrium approach and other macro theories does not, of course, rule out

the present statistical results as valid tests of both types of theories. Al—
though real rate of return effects that are positive for government purchases and
negative for money growth may not be surprising, I cannot find much past empirical
evidence that bears on these propositions.

One hypothesis that sharply distinguishes the equilibrium model with incomplete information on monetary aggregates from more standard macroanalyses is the
prediction of a positive effect of money shocks on contemporaneously (and errone-

ously) perceived real rates of return. As discussed above, this hypothesis cannot
be tested directly from observations on realized returns, precisely because the
incomplete information structure predicts that monetary disturbances move ex post
returns in a direction opposite to that of ex ante (partial information) returns.
Satisfactory testing of this hypothesis seems to require an explicit calculation
of price expectations conditional on partial current information.
whether this analysis is feasible.

Therefore, a direct monetary effect on excess comnodity demand is unnecessary.
Similarly, in Lucas (1973, pp. 327-28), nominal income is exogenous and supply

depends on P(z) _EP. Models where a separate form of relative price
variable influences investment demand, as in Lucas (1975, p. 1124), do not require

and portfolio balance before discussing any solution properties. Ultimately,
the substantive differences would involve the real effects of anticipated

inflation, as indicated n the text.

commodity price and a global nominal interest rate are considered in Barro

6This decrease may

occur if the induced rise in current output has a

strong effect on current real money demand.

7Elements of adjustment costs on tKe demand side--for example, the planning
costs for investment that are stressed by Kydland and Prescott (1980,
would imply maintenance of high levels of aggregate demand in periods subsequent

to a shock (which would be followed by later periods of increased capacity). These
effects reinforce the persistence of high output, but offset the inverse effect

on real rates of return in some future periods. Similarly, an inverse effect
of monetary shocks on producers' finished goods inventories (as opposed to inventories of goods-in-pro-cess and materials), which are stressed by Blinder and
Fischer (1978), would tend to sustain high levels of demand. Overall, the excess
capacity effect would be dominant in future periods if the principal initial
effect of monetary disturbances is on work and production, rather than on con-

sumption. In this circumstance the aggregate of future stocks——whether held
by businesses or consumers--will end up higher than they otherwise would be.

—37-

8 above, changing expectations of future money growth and associated general
inflation would not alter the conclusions about expected real rates of return.

9Direct substitution in utility or production functions of government purchases for private consumption or investment expenditures, as stressed by

Bailey (1971, pp. 152-55), offsets the positive aggregate demand effect of
temporary government purchases.

10This argument is independent of the method of public finance if house-

holds view deficits as equivalent to current taxation. The full direct offset of private for public demands arises when privately desired captial stocks
are invariant with the level of government purchases.

11Neither this ratio nor the defense purchases ratio exhibited significant

drift. A drift does appear since 1929 in the ratio of transfers to GNP.
12War years are classified as 1941-45, 1950—52, and 1965—72.

a direct positive influence of govenmental activities on aggregate supply.

'6The

January-to-January consumer price index (CPI) yields results that

are very close to those obtained with the GNP deflator. The CPI's treatment of
housing costs seems to impart meaningless sensitivity of the index to variations
in nominal interest rates, which I had thought might particularly be a problem

in the present context. However, the CPI probably provides a better measure
than the WPI of true transactions prices. The WPI may be less sensitive than
the other indices to problems of measuring quality change, which are likely to
be most serious for services.

17For example, a shift to December-to-December or February-to-February
values for the WPI had negligible effects on the results.

'8This conclusion could be altered by two effects that I believe to be

minor. First, there is a lag in obtaining initial reports on the money stock
(which is now less than two weeks); and second there are subsequent revisions

21The contemporaneous values of g' and gP are also insignificant, but the
endogeneity of these variables (which include real GNP in the denominators) may

cause some estimation problems, especially in the case of the g coefficient.

22For the pre-tax returns equation with the DMRi and (g_gW) variables

included also, the estimated coefficient on t-2 is -2.4, s.e. =

2.5.

For

the after-tax returns case, the result is —2.2, s.e. = 2.1..

23The mean real return was .082. With the GNP deflator used to measure
inflation, the mean real return was .077 with a standard deviation of .180.

24However, the nominal return on stocks, RMV, from 1942 to 1945 is quite

high, averaging .24 per year (see table 1). The reported inflation rates are
probably meaningless for this period.

25Treasury Bills do not provide a riskiess real rate of return; for example,
the sample mean return net of WPI inflation is .006 with a standard deviation

of .045. With the GNP deflator used to measure inflation, the sample mean
return is .002 with a standard deviation of only .019. The relative riskiness
of stocks and Treasury allis depends also on covariances wIth returns from

other assets, such as human capital and real estate. Conceivably, the dependence of these covariances on money shocks, etc., could account for occasional
negative risk premia on stocks.
