Components of Manufacturing Inventories

ABSTRACT

This paper presents a structural model of production and inventory

accumulation based on the hypothesis of cost minimization. It differs
from previous attempts in several respects. First, it integrates the
analysis of input inventories with output inventories, treating the two

stocks separately. Second, it distinguishes between temporary and permanent
fluctuations in sales as they are anticipated by the industry. Third, it
allows for a more general structure of adjustment costs, and in particular
for a cost changing the production level rather than only for deviations
of the production level from a fixed target.

Empirically, there are three principal conclusjôns. This iodel.per—
forms much better than those with no cost of production adjustment allowed.

Disaggregation of inventories provides significant insights into the dynamics

of the adjustment process. However, the restrictions on our model implied by
the continuous—time stochastic control theory that we utilize are rejected

by the data. We believe that a more disaggregated specification or a more
detailed econometric treatment of the discrete—time nature of the observations
would avoid this difficulty.

1. Introduction
Investment in inventories is central to most theories of aggregate
economic fluctuations, even though it comprises a very small part of total

output. In the U.S., on average, only 0.7% of GNP is devoted to this use.
Nevertheless its crucial role in the business cycle is apparent from the
fact that it accounts for over 18% of the standard deviation of output
*

growth since 1947.
Inventory investment has proved to be very difficult to satisfactorily

explain. Most theoretical work, following the justifiably celebrated paper
by Metzler (1941), assumed that inventories were homogeneous and simply held

for resale. Part of the difficulty with studying the complex roles of inventories in the economy may be that there is a great heterogeneity in the

components of aggregate inventory investment. Input inventories are different
from output inventories; and different industries have characteristically
different responses of inventories to exogenous shocks.
Although there have been several excellent empirical studies of inventory
**

behavior

by type of inventory and by industry , most econometric work has also

followed Metzler. Either all types of inventories were lumped together for
purposes of estimation, or only finished goods inventories were-considered.
In fact, more than two thirds of the inventory by U.S. manufacturers is in

materials and supplies or work in process, not finished goods. A further

*

This is based on data from 1947—1979. We took the ratio of the standard
deviation in the first differences of real CNP minus the first differences
of inventory investment, to the standard deviation of the former series alone.

disturbing omission is the role of unfilled orders as "negative inventories,"

which is of great importance in durable goods manufacturing. In durable goods
manufacturing unfilled orders are on average, about four times the finished
*

goods inventories.
In recent years, macroeconomicshas emphasized the roles of expectations

formation and optimization by economic agents. Inventories have been recon—

sidered

**

from this point of view.

However, as in the microeconomic analyses

mentioned above, the heterogeneity of inventories by stage of fabrication

has not been considered. We believe that our understanding of the role of
manufacturing inventories in economic fluctuations will benefit from such a
disaggregated approach in an optimizing framework.

In this paper we attempt to give a theoretical model of inventory holding

based on cost minimizing behavior. Our goal is to allow for a variety of
costs in the theoretical model and to see which of these are empirically

important. We also want to study the interaction between inventories at
different stages of fabrication and to see whether these decisions are interrelated as the theory predicts.

Our principal empirical results are two—fold: First, we find strong
evidence for costs of variable production rates; that Is costs of changing
the rate of production, as opposed to costs of operating steadily above

minimum average cost. Second we find significant evidence, though somewhat
weaker, for the interaction between inventories at different stages of

fabrication. Both of these phenomena have, to our knowledge, received little
mention and no empirical analysis previously.

*

In 1976 inventories of finished products in durable goods industries were
$22.5 billion while unfilled orders, deflated by the wholesale price index
for durable manufactured products were $91.2 billion.

—3—

Our model is similar to most previous work in assuming that sales are

exogenous. Inventory holders develop expectations about the future time

pattern of demand. One of our secondary goals was to use the statistical
characteristics of the innovations in the sales process in the behavioral

model. Specifically, increases in demand that are perceived as temporary
may evoke much different responses than those perceived as permanent.
The contrast between temporary and permanent sales fluctuations can be
seen most easily by considering two industries with identical cost structures

and facing random sales with different time series characteristics. Industry
A experiences primarily temporary variations in sales while in industry B,

the variations are longer—lived, inducing the same overall variance. Suppose
there is an excess of sales beyond the expected. Industry A can meet the
demand out of stocks and, gradually make up for this shortfall with only a

slight increase in production. There is relatively little risk that such a
gradual response will find the industry with its stocks running dangerously

low. Industry B, on the other hand, must respond more drastically to sales

variation since it is a signal of stronger demand in the future. How would
an outside observer know that the different responses of firms A and B stem
from the differences in their sales expectations rather than from lower
adjustment costs in industry B than in industry A?

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Our data is
described in Section 2. Section 3 gives a brief overview of the methodology
and sets up the basic framework of both the construction of the model and

its implementation. The nature of the costs faced by firms is described
in Section 4. Section 5 applies the theory of optimal control to the cost

minimization problem under conditions of certainty. Since this method
utilizes the principal of first—period certainty equivalence, the stochastic

—4—

structure of the model and its relation to the data are discussed separately,

in Section 6. In Sections 7 and 8 we derive the optimal controls

explicitly,

for two different specifications of costs, in terms of the underlying parameters.
Section 9 contains a description of the implementation of these methods and
the empirical results.

2. The Data

Much of the shortcomings in earlier empirical work may be traced to

problems in the available data. Until recently, the only manufacturing
inventory data available by stage—of—fabrication was measured at book value.

But this book value data is practically meaningless. Rapid price increases
and the resulting changes in accounting method from FIFO (first—in, first—out)
to LIFO (last—in, first—out) in an attempt to avoid taxation of illusory

inventory profits, cause severe distortions. However, recent work by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis has provided corrected, constant dollar inventories, by stage of fabrication, for durables and nondurables manufacturers,

at the two—digit SIC level. Given this data, which extends from the last
quarter of 1958 to the end of 1976, there is some hope of implementing
theoretical models of heterogeneous inventory investment.

While data is available for many two—digit industries, we have chosen to

study only four of them. We limit our sample because the other industries
were obviously at variance with the theoretical model we posit, or had
obviously erroneous data. First, although we consider the stock—order
distinction to be an important part of inventory behavior, our model cannot

accomodate unfilled orders. We thus are compelled to drop industries main—

taming unfilled orders. Of thom industries which produce chiefly or entirely
to stock, only two (Stone, Clay and Glass — SIC 1132, and Instruments — SIC #38)
are durables manufacturers.

Second, we were forced to omit two other industries for specific reasons

concerning the data. Tobacco (SIC #21) has very little finished goods or
work—in—process inventories which together compose only 8% of total inventories.

—6--

Given the special nature of tobacco products, it is questionable whether the
remaining 92%, which probably consists mainly of aging tobacco leaves, should

really be classified as materials and supplies. The other industry omitted
here is Petroleum (SIC #29) which, for some unknown reason, possesses (according

Our

to our data) large but essentially constant work—in--process inventories.

inability to determine the reason for this has led to the omission of this
industry.

The remaining seven industries were all suitable candidate for study.
Computational difficulties (described below) made it infeasible to consider

three

*
of the seven industries whose detrended sales series were not best described

by either an ARNA (1,1) or a pure Markov process.
The remaining four industries are Food (SIC #20), Chemicals (SIC #28),

Rubber and Plastics (SIC #30) and Stone, Clay and Glass (SIC #32). Stone,
Clay and Glass is the only durable goods industry of the four. Table 1 presents
relevant summary statistics for these industries for the sample period.
Though these industries differ markedly in the types of products they produce,
their inventory—sales ratios and composition of total inventory stock are

rather similar. One other result worth pausing to contemplate is the size
of the standard deviation of inventory investment relative to average

sales ——

about one percent. While this does not imply that inventory investment

3. Basic Approach

Our method assumes that observed inventory behavior represents the

industry's optimal actions given the available information. More specifically,
we will be assuming that each industry solves a stochastic control problem.

The objective is to maximize expected discounted net revenues. There are two
controls: the rate of production and the rate at which raw materials are

received. Sales are treated as exogenous, and are assumed to follow a known
stochastic process. Therefore, with the passage of time, observations of
sales alter the industries' beliefs about future sales.

We are interested in using observations of sales, production and deliveries
of materials to infer the structure of adjustment costs that are fundamental

determinants of the system. We first show how the optimal controls depend

upon these unobserved parameters. Thus we use the empirically observed
behavior to reconstruct what they must have been.

This modelIs grounded in a particular view about the use of inventory
stocks to smooth out the activities of the firm over time. We imagine that
the inventory adjustment process is somewhat "intermediate—run" in nature.
In principal, a divergence of inventories from desired values could be
mitigated by adjustments of a longer run nature, such as planned fixed invest—
*

ment, or of a shorter—run nature, such as cash management of the industry.
**
Prices could also be varied. All these possibilities are ruled out; by
assumption production and deliveries are

assumed to be the only elements

in the industries' plans that are responsive to undesirable inventory levels.

*

Caves , Jarrett and Loucks (1979) take an approach like this and relate the
flexibility of the firm's operations to seller concentration at the 3—digit
industry level.
**

And likewise advertising and all other.potential manipulators of demand.

—9—

A second aspect of the "intermediate—run" nature of these responses

relates to our empirical method. The data are quarterly. Information about
sales and inventories is surely available to plant managers on a more frequent

basis than that. We will be implicitly viewing the quarter to quarter
responses as the optimizing values. If much faster adjustment were possible,
and if information could be utilized much more quickly, our data would not

correctly describe the workings of the system. On the other hand, if information were not received and processed within one quarter, our presumption
that the industry is responding optimally given all lagged observations would
*
be erroneous. While we have no evidence to bring to bear at all, one quarter
seems about right with respect to both of these considerations.
Because our data are at the industry level, it is appropriate to measure

sales and inventories relative to capacity, or trend. The idea is that it
is departures above or below the trend that cause costs to depart from their

theoretical minimum values. These values could never really be maintained, being a—
cheived only in the :ilealized state of smooth steady growth of capacity matched

by a corresponding non—stochastic evolution of demand.
In each industry we have data on sales and on inventories in three stages,
finished goods ,work in process and materials. Each of these series are
**
detrended separately.

The reason for this is that the ideali-zd cost

minimizing levels may not be following precisely the same patterns of growth.
For example, as new plants in the industry are brought "on line" and old ones
are "retired" the optimal level of inventories relative to production may not

*

This may seem farfetched at the plant level, but if different firms within
an industry face similar market conditions and if they are imperfectly informed about each other's status, then we may be closer to this danger at
the industry level.
**
We tried various specifications, these are described in section 9.

—10—

remain constant. An equally important example is the evolution of superior
inventory management techniques, often accelerated by the computer. These
are exogenous to our study in that they are assumed to affect the optimal
inventories relative to sales, but not the quarter to quarter movements

relative

*

to this level.

Production should, in principle, be separated into two distinct activities:
the act of taking materials and converting them into work in process, and the
act of taking work in process and converting it into finished goods, either

for immediate sale or addition to stocks. Such a system seemed to be too
complex, so we have taken a pair of similar approaches. In the first one,

which we will call the WP system, materials stocks are ignored. What we
will call "production" in this system is the act of converting work in
process (14P) into output. "Deliveries" of inputs are to be understood

as the act of putting goods in the (WP) stage. Within this formalization
therefore, we cannot distinguish between "true deliveries" from outside the

industry and "deliveries" that describe the initiation of work on materials
previously held as stocks within the industry.

The second approach identifies deliveries as the inputs that enter from

outside the industry, either into stocks of materials or work in process.

We simply sum up these two series, calling the composite WM. In this system
production is defined as taking WM and

converting

it into finished output.

In the empirical section of the paper, we present estimates for only

the WM system.

**

*

To the extent that this factor has influenced the structure of costs of
adjustment as well as the ideal cost minimizing levels our model is inadequate.
These parameters, in real terms, are assumed to be constant.

—11—

The same theoretical model underlies both the WP and WM systems.
The basic variables of this model, all deviations from trend levels, are denoted:
S = shipments
F =

finished

goods inventories

W = work in process, or work in procesS plus raw materials, according
to the context.

As mentioned above, there are two activities under the control of the decision—maker, production (P) and receiving

deliveries CD). In our model it

is perfectly possible that the same physical goods are received as deliveries

and sold as output entirely within one quarter. We do not place any restrictions on the intensity with which the P and D activities can be operated; in
particular their values are not constrained by the beginning of quarter levels

of the stocks of work in process and materials. Stock—outs are not regarded
as a problem, since all variables are deviations around trend; P and

D can be negative while actual produccion is continually undertaken. We take
S to be exogenous. As there are no unfilled orders, it is assumed that all
shipments are made immediately out of stocks. The value of S together with
the choice of P and D determines the changes in the stocks of inventories;
and thus, over time, the evolution of the entire system.

—12—

4. Types of Costs
Our theoretical model utilizes a Continuous time structure even though

observations are made at discrete intervals. This is purely because a discrete time version of the optimization problem would have been much more

complicated, and well beyond analytica. tractibility. Our approach can
perhaps be defended as an approximation.

We have t1identities
P — S

WED -

P - D

-F -

S

where all variables are measured in physical terms ——

that

is, in units of

equivalent final output. The data are in terms of the value of
the goods. However, as long as the share of value added at each stage of the
process is a constant, the neglect of value added will not affect our results.

It will be convenient for us to use F and W as the decision variables
rather than P and f, so these identities are equivalently the definitions

of P and D in terms of S, F and W,

P ES+F
(4.1)

.

DES+F+W

Notice that these definitions allow an increment in S to be instantaneously
accomodated with no change in inventories by an equal simultaneous increase
in P and D.

We take four kinds of costs into

account: production, deliveries, and

holding the two kinds of inventories. Each of these costs is assumed to be
quadratic. We will also allow for a quadratic "interaction" term between

—13—

holding the two kinds of inventories. Trend levels, if tracked exactly, are

assumed to result in the least—cost method of production. Operating the
basic activities, or holding the stocks, at levels above trend entails the
use of less efficient techniques, for example overtime labor, supplies of
materials that do not exactly match normal specifications,or less easily

accessible storage locations. Operating below trend saves resources, but
for the usual reasons these economies are limited by returns to scale considerations.

In addition to quadratic terms in the deviations from trend levels,

we can also consider quadratic terms in the rates of change of these four

variables. It may be more expensive to be alternatively above and below
trend than to remain above trend by a fixed amount for some time, and then

steadily below trend for an equal interval. Costs of this type include
labor force adjustment costs, costs of seeking out new sources of supply
which will not be used on a steady basis, or the higher prices which might

be charged by a usual

source to whom a steady commitment for orders

(implicit or explicit) is not made. Similarly quadratic terms in the rates
of change of inventories represent the costs of putting goods in or taking
them out.

There are two reasons for allowing an interaction between inventory

levels, but not elsewhere. First, economically, we envision production,
deliveries and storage as separate activities and so no interactions are

allowed between them. The two kinds of storage may
share facilities or equipment and therefore we might imagine, for example,
that the marginal cost of holding extra finished goods is higher if a larger
amount of work in process is preempting the most easily accessible storage
space.

—14—

Our second reason is more practical. Were more interaction terms allowed
the model would be underidentif led. But if the interaction between the two

inventory holding costs were omitted from the specification, an additional
complex, highly non—linear, constraint on the parameters would have been

introduced. Overidentifying restrictions of this type would have rendered
estimation impossible. The specification we did use imposes a single linear
J.

cross—equation restriction.
The quadratic nature of costs is necessary in our approach for a technical

but very important reason. The stochastic dynamic programming problem whose
solution we assume governs observed behavior is solved by looking at the
"certainty-equivalent" problem ——

that

is the deterministic program in which

all disturbances have been set equal to zero. We utilize the principle of
?tfirst_period_certainty_equivalencelt which will be discussed in much more

detail below. This principle is valid only when the objective is quadratic,
**

and the equations of motion are linear

,

in

the states and controls. Quadratic

costs can of course be viewed as an approximation to more general functions,
but other equally valid approximations would not have this certainty—equivalence

property. On the other hand, there seems to be little hope for any practical
alternative.

Summarizing this discussion we can write the instantaneous cost of
operating at levels P and D as

5. Control Theory Applied
The objective function in stochastic control theory is written as the

minimization of an integral. In the present case, discounted profit maximization means minimizing the integral of (

t:.2)

minus shipments (S), all

of which can depend on time, multiplied by e_rt, where r is the instantaneous

discount rate. We will assume that r is constant. Therefore, still neglecting
uncertainty, we have from (4.2) and the identities (4.1), the objective function

now describe the way in which the system evolves over time.

Here our discussion must be divided into two parts since the choice of the
control variables depends upon whether or not we admit costs that are quadratic

in the rates of change of D, P, F, and W in the objective. These differences
are primarily formal; the same basic assumptiors will be maintained.

Let us begin with the simpler problem where such costs of adjustment

are absent. It is natural to take S, F and W as state variables since they
define the initial conditions facing the industry at any moment. The control
variables are F and W. From any given initial levels of S, F and W, and given
any path which the exogenous future of S will follow, the use of F and W
can control the paths of F and W, or, equivalently, of P and D.

—17—

In order to apply the first—period certainty equivalence principle we

must insure that the evolution equations are linear. The assumptions used
to guarantee this linearity and the relationship between these assumptions and
the data are crucial elements of the analysis.

Because of linear terms in the objective it will be notationally convenient to add a constant

to the list of the state variables. We thus

denote the state variable vector as

(5.2)

x =

(1,

S, F, W)'

and the control vector as

u

(f',w)'

We want to write

xHx+Gu
for some matrices of cotistants H and C.

It is clear that the only problem

can arise with S which is exogenous and therefore must be written as a

function of its own level, S, and perhaps the constant. Recall that all

our state variables are deviations from trend. Therefore the constant can
have no effect. We are left with only one possibility,

=

ss

for some 5. We assume iS < 0 to ensure that the system is not explosive. To
summarize, under complete certainty S is an exogenous function of time and is,

in theory, arbitrary. But to apply the principle of first—period certainty

—18—

equivalence it is necessary to assume that S is a very special kind of
function, namely a simple exponential return to trend.

We now turn to the more complicated model where costs are allowed to

depend on rates of change. The specification of states and controls must
be modified since quadratic terms in F and W enter the instantaneous objec-

tive. It is natural to regard these as the controls and take both inventories and their rates of change into the state vector. Initial values of
all of the state variables will be necessary for the system to be well—
defined.

As above, the second row in each matrix is a consequence of the exogeneity

6. First—Period Certainty EQuivalence and the Sal Process

It is the raison d'tre for our model that S does not follow

a known path. Uncertainty about the future of S is of two kinds. If the
average level of S were a known function

of time, there might still be

fluctuations around it. In addition as we move through time some of the
initial uncertainties about future values of S may be partially resolved.
Thus the sequence of expected values of S will change as new information
is gathered.

Both of these issues are dealt with in the principle of first—period
*

certainty

equivalence.

If the objective is quadratic and the equations

of motion are linear, the controls that maximize the objective when all
random variables are set equal to their expected values at the initial date
are the same as the controls that solve the full stochastic dynamic optimization
**

problem.

(Of course, after the initial date the controls of the original

certainty—equivalent problem bear no relation to those of the full optimi-

zation. One must write the new certainty equivalent problem and solve again.
It is precisely the idea of first—period certainty equivalence that a sequence
of simpler problems can be used to replace a single, but much harder,one.)

To make use of the thoery outlined above, we must have a stochastic
process for sales that has its expected deviation from trend converging geo-

metrically to zero. We now consider how such a situation could arise and

*

**

We are greatly indebted to Richard Clarke for discussions on this point.

If

it is possible to learn about the uncertainties earlier, or more accurately,
by varying the level of the controls then this principle does not apply. In
our case this is not a problem since sales are completely exogenous.

—21—

whether our data on sales could justify assuming such a process.

Our first idea did not fit the data well, hut is nevertheless a useful

point to begin describing the basic method. It is based on our desire to

distinguish between permanent and temporary innovations in the salprocess.

with the application of control theory.

In light of this we tried another formulation, one which did not manifest

a similar interpretation.

We fit the deviations from trend to an ARMA

process of varying structure, seeking the most descriptive, statistically
significant form. In three of our industries a second order autoregressive

7. Solution of the Certainty Equivalent Model: No Adjustment Costs

We now return to the analysis of the certainty equivalent model under

the hypotheses described above. In this section we present the case of no
adjustment costs, and in the next section the more general cost function is

analyzed. We will describe the optimal control for this problem. Then we
will show how this solution imposes a constraint on the parameters of our
estimating equations and how one can recover the underlying cost parameters
from these estimates.

We write the instantaneous set cost function, whose integral is to be
minimized, as a quadratic form in the states x =

u = (F,W)', with the following notation

The key feature of solutions to this type of control problem is the

introduction of a matrix T, which is used to define the optimal control

implicitly. I is a time—dependent square matrix with the dimensionality

of the state vector: 4 x 4 in the present case. It is known that T satisfies the following matrix differential equation ,

T =

—TB

-

H'T+

called

the Riccati equation.

(TG + N) B1 (N' + G'T') — A

The optimal control is defined from T by

u = —B'

C

N'+G'T')

x

Employing this method in our problem is made much simpler by two observations.
First, if we choose A and B to be symmetric, then T will be symmetric. This

reduces the number of variables in the Riccati equation. Second, the station—
arity of our problem insures that optimizing the coefficients of the state

variables, —B1 (H'T + N'), are not time dependent. Thus we know that, as
a function of time, T(t) = T e_rt for some fixed matrix T, and hence in the

—27—

Riccati equation we can write the left hand side as —rT, evaluating at t = 0.
This converts the Riccati equation to a system of polynomial (quadratic)
equations for the unknown elements of T, rather than a system of differential
equations for unknown functions of time.

whereas the simpler model had the
corresponding coefficients summing up to

explained as follows. On impact, F + W goes

down by "dt unitstt after a unit increase in S. But since S =
5S, in the next

small interval of time it continues to fall by (1 + 5)dt. Thus the second
derivative would be computed as —6.

This is not really rigorous because S cannot
change by discrete jumps

T23, T24, T25, T26 and b1. Note that
this identifies h2 as well.

viii) The remaining Riccati condition

(8.22) determines T22.

—34—

While the foregoing procedure would, in principle, allow us to recover
the model's structural parameters from its reduced form estimates, the
solution is quite messy and does not allow a clear understanding of the
relationship between the reduced form coefficients and the parameters of the

underlying model. Such an understanding would be helpful, since most previous
empirical work on the subject has started with the reduced form and estimated

it directly. We would like to know what their previous reduced form estimates
suggest about the firm's cost function, given the stochastic process des—
cribing sales.

Fortunately, if we focus on finished goods inventories for the moment,
a simpler relationship between reduced form and structural parameters obtains.
In particular, if we ignore the costs related to deliveries (m0, m1, and m2)
and work—in—process inventory stocks (g0, g1, g2,

and k1) and, further,

assume that there is no cost in changing production (b2

0),

we obtain a

model with F as the lone control variable with the state vector equal to

(l,S,F).

9. Empirical Methodology and Results
Before estimating the linear decision rules for inventory behavior
suggested by the discussion above, we must transform our data to conform

to the assumptions of the model. Since our model is concerned with deviations
from trend, our first task is that of detrending the data.

We need to preserve the identities

relating inventories, sales, production

and deliveries in the detrended data, hence we are limited to a procedure that
estimates trends for each series and subtracts it from the original series thus
obtaining the detrended version.

Given this approach, there are many

ways to estimate the trends; our experiments suggest that the particular esdionmethod
used is of minor importance. Our chosen detrending technique consists of
regressing sales, finished goods stocks, and work—in—process stocks (for
the "WP" version of the model) or the sum of work—in—process and materials
and supplies stocks (for the "WN" version) individually on a constant, time,
*
and higher moments of time.
These higher moments are included to pick up
any non—linearities (as would be present if the underlying trend were

exponential rather than linear). To test the sensitivity of our results, we
also detrended the inventory series by regressing them on the sales trend

directly, rather than on the moments of time. The resulting regressions
using these two sets of data are virtually identical, and only the first set

is presented. Since we estimate time trends separately for each series, our
procedure allows for advances in technology over time which induce changes in
the long—run inventory—sales ratio or the composition of inventory stocks.
*

Actually

a third degree polynomial was used.

—38—

Having detrended the series, our next task is to determine for each
industry the ARNA process best describing

the evolution of its sales. A

second order autoregressive process provides

the best fit for three industries

SIC #38). For the

—39—

Given perfect knowledge of , e and all past realizations of sales,

o(and hence

may be calculated once s is observed.

This is precisely

the behavioral assumption we apply to the firms themselves.

In practice,

our sample of S's is finite and 4 and 0 are estimated with error. Ignoring
the latter problem, we can deal with the former one by assuming all values
of

to be zero prior to our first observation of sales, then recursively

generating subsequent values of u from (9.1) and finally omitting the first

several such values. In practice, our first observation of sales is for the
first quarter of 1958, and we have estimated our final regressions for the
sample period 1960:1 to 1976:4.

In replacing St with S* in our behavioral regressions, we must remember
that actual sales in the current period are still

and some compensating

adjustment for this must be made. Intuition suggests that an increase in
temporary sales should be equivalent from the firm's viewpoint to a decline
in initial stocks of finished goods, and indeed this proves to be true; in
other words, the firm's costs depend on the sum of current sales and on the beg inning
of period stocks of finished goods. Holding future expectations constant an
increase in current sales

is indistinguishable from a drop in initial

stocks. Thus, we can correctly represent the future sales expectations and
at the same time account for the fact that current sales contain a temporary

component by subtracting this component, S =

--u,

from initial finished

goods inventories.

While our decision rules apply to a continuous time process, our data

is quarterly. We approximate the above equations by setting the sales decay
rate—5 equal to (1 —

), and

replacing inventory stocks at time t with the

beginning of quarter stocks, Ft_i and W1. We represent the rates
and rates of change of inventory investment by the first and second differences

Note that no adjustment for S is made to AFi. Such an adjustment
would implicitly change the value of lagged production, and hence the
cost of setting current production, which we would not want to do.
Also observe that, though the models with and without adjustment costs are nested
in that setting the parameters by b2, m2, g2 and h2 in this model with adjustment
costs equal to zero yields the simpler model, the discrete approximations we
estii1ate are not nested. This follows frorn the different specification of

the cross—equation constraint on the sale coefficients in the two models, and
is a result of the approximation error involved in using discretely observed

data to describe a continuous time process.

We also performed these hypothesis
tests on the constraints when corrections
for heteroscedasticity are introduced. The F equation
always contributed more
to the SSR in the stacked
regression than the W equation. The equations were
re—estimated without significant
changes in any coefficient or in the test statistic.

—42—

Aside from the obvious explanation that the models may be misspecified,
there remain other possible reasons for these negative results. First of all,
our use of quarterly data to approximate a continuous time process may be

inappropriate. Barring an attempt to rederive the model in a discrete—time
framework (which would be very difficult) we might approach this problem

by

estimating the models ung monthly data.

At present, however, data of

the same quality as ours is not available at monthly intervals. Another
plausible explanation might be that the error process is not first—

order autoregressive. Again, this could be tested by using alternative
specifications.

Despite our findings concerning the validity of these models, there
are still a number of interesting results present in the regressions. Looking
first at the unconstrained version of the simple model, where changes in
inventories are regressed on lagged stocks and sales, we see that the implied
adjustment speeds of changes to own stocks are large in comparison to those
found by previous researchers.

For example, in SIC #20 (Food), the coefficient

of F*1 in the finished goods equation is -.558, implying

that 56% of a surplus

in initial stocks of finished goods will be run down within a quarter. The

corresponding coefficient for W1 in the W regression is —.648. These
adjustment speeds are lower in SIC industries #28 (Chemicals) and #30 (Rubber
and Plastics), but higher in SIC 1/32 (Stone, Clay and Glass). Part of the

explanation for these faster implied adjustment

speeds may come from our use

of detrended data. In addition, in contrast to many past studies, we have
allowed for cross—effects in our regressions.

We would expect these coefficients,

of F on

and W on F1, to be positive: an unwarranted level of work—in—

process inventories can be partially lowered by stepping up production;
production can be lowered to reduce finished stocks, keeping more goods

"in the pipeline". Some evidence that such effects are present appears in
these regressions. Six of the eight cross—effect terms in the four industries are positive, though only two are significant.

Turning to the more complicated model which includes adjustment costs,
we continue to focus on the unconstrained estimates, in light of our rejection

of the cross—equation constraints. Note that because the dependent variables

are now MF and

the assumption of the simpler model that lagged changes

in stocks have no effect on current changes would imply that the coefficients

of own changes equal —l in the current regressions. In all four industries,
at least one of the four lagged change terms introduced by the assumption of

adjustment costs is significant. In all, seven of the sixteen new coefficients
(in the four industries) are significant. Only the effect of lagged changes
in W on current changes in F is never significant. This suggests that the
richer specification is necessary to adequately model inventory behavior.

10. Conclusions

We have tried to give a structural account of inventory investment in

manufacturing industries that produce to stock. Although our results must
be viewed with caution because of technical problems such as the use of discrete data in estimating a continuous—time model, we still feel justified in

asserting several results. First, the model with production adustment costs
obviously describes the data much better than without them. These previously
neglected costs should be given a prominent role in future work. Second,
disaggregating inventories by stage of fabrication we have seen how the interactions between production and deliveries give rise to important "feedback"
and "feedforward" effects that are neglected in more aggregative analyses.

Third, we have shown how a careful distinction between "temporary" and
"permanent" innovations in sales can be important in the implementation of
inventory investment models.
