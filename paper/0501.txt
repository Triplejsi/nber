Adjustment to Variations in Imported Input Prices:
The Role of Economic Structure

ABSTRACT

This paper introduces an imported input into a model of art open

economy with developed financial markets, a flexible exchange rate,

and some degree of market

power on the export side.

The model is designed to investigate the impact of an increase
in imported input prices on the exchange rate, domestic interest

rate, income and nontraded—goods prices. The analysis reveals that
changes in various structural parameters, such as the degree of

market

power or the extent of

openness,"

"demand—side openness" or "financial

alter the transmission of foreign price disturbances fo

the domestic economy.

One of the most important economic disturbances in recent years

was the fourfold increase in oil prices in 1974. Preceded by a
series of harvest failures and a period of expansionary domestic

policies in most countries, the explosive rise in oil prices was a
factor behind the acceleration of price increases and the formation
of adverse inflationary expectations. It also worsened unemployment
and current—account positions in most oil—importing countries.

The adjustment of oil-importing countries to the higher oil prices

has not been uniform. As can be seen in Table 2, inflation
rates have differed considerably across most oil—importing countries
despite the common external oil price shocks.

This differential response can be partly attributed to differences in
policy reaction and partly to more fundamental differences in economic

structure. Such structural characteristics as an economy's openness,1

3

its

goods,

degree of market power, the elasticity of substitution among

factors or financial assets, the composition of trade, and the extent
of wage indexation may affect the way an economy adjusts to an oil
price increase.

The implications of variations in structural characteristics for
the transmission of external price disturbances have not been adequately

or systematically studied. Both the theoretical and empirical literature
is relatively sparse with the exception of some pioneering work in the
development field (Harberger 1964) and some more recent studies in
international finance (Whitman, 1969; Bruno and Sachs, 1979; KatseliPapaefstratiou, 1980; Flood and Marion, 1980).
Section 2 of this paper develops a simple general equilibrium model
to analyze

the impact effects of a one—shot increase in the price

an imported intermediate good, such as oil, on

the

of

domestic prices, income,

domestic interest rate and the exchange rate of an oil-importing

economy with developed financial markets and a flexible exchange rate.
This framework would apply to most European countries which have various
degrees of market power on the export side but can be considered "small"

on the import side. The proposed framework of analysis is an extention
of some earlier work by both authors (Marion, 1977, 1979; Katseli—
Papaefstratiou, 1979, 1980) and others (Findlay and Rodriguez, 1977;

Buiter, 1978). The

analysis shows that an

increase in

imported input

prices depreciates the nominal exchange rate and reduces the domestic

interest

rate. Both nominal and real income fall. The impact on

nontraded goods prices and on the real exchange rate depends upon
specific parameter values.

4

Section 3 of the paper discusses the role of structural characteristics

in the transmission process. While the model can be used to isolate the
effects

of numerous structural parameters on the transmission process,

we choose to focus on

to

four:

(1) market

power, (2) the marginal propensity

save, (3) the substitutability of financial assets (financial open-

ness), and (4) the share of traded goods in total consumption (real

demand—side openness). The present study, which concentrates on

theoretical

foundations

the.

of the problem, indicates that these structural

characteristics affect the transmission process in significant ways.
For

example, it is shown that

decreased market power dampens both the

depreciation of the home currency and the
follow

drop in nominal income that

a rise in imported input prices. Increased asset substitutability

exacerbates the depreciation of the home currency but dampens the drop
in nominal income. An increased marginal propensity to consume traded

goods exacerbates the depreciation of the exchange rate but does not
modify the drop in income.

5

2. The Model

Consider an economy with a financial sector and a goods sector.
The financial sector consists of two domestic, nontraded assets,
namely money and interest—earning bonds, and an internationally—traded

bond. The goods sector is composed of four goods. The economy
produces and domestically consumes a nontraded (home) good, imports a

finaland añintermediate good, neitherofwhich is produced domestically,
and exports a final good which is produced domestically and consumed

at home and abroad. While there is some degree of market power on the
export side, the country is a price—taker in both import markets. The
disaggregated financial and goods sectors together determine four

endogenous variables: the domestic interest rate, the exchange rate,

the price of nontraded goods and income. The full model is set out
and described below.

The asset—market specification draws on the work by Tobin (1969),

The demand for money depends on the

domestic interest rate and income.

The demands for both interest-bearing bonds depend on the domestic

interest rates and

and foreign

on wealth. The demand for domestic

bonds also depends on income. The specification assumes •that changes

in

income affect only the demands for domestic assets while changes

in wealth affect only the demands for interest—earning assets. In
addition, it is assumed that the demand for money is homogeneous of
degree one in income.2
The specification of asset demands does not take into account
wealth

holders' expectations of future exchange—rate

movements. These

are worked out in Appendix 1. Since we are interested in the shortrun effects of the

oil price rise, and since the 1974 price hike

was generally unanticipated, it does not seem inappropriate to assume
static

expectations.

Asset demands are stock demands, and they are realized instan—

that

actual holdings of assets always reflect the desired

of the portfolio. Because exchange rates are flexible, the

stock of money is exogenously determined by the central bank

and equal

to the money holdings of the private sector:

In the short run, the stocks of interest-bearing assets available to
domestic residents are also fixed and equal to the demands for those

assets:

Labor Markets
There

are two domestically—produced goods in this economy:

Cl)

the exportable good, which uses labor (N) and a fixed stock of capital
(K) in the production process, and (2) the nontraded good, which uses

labor, a fixed capital stock and an intermediate import good. The
production function for the exportable good is:

=

F(Nxi

;

0

and for the nontraded good:

H =

min{G(NHI 1(H), —R} ;

0

It is assumed that while capital and labor are gross substitutes in
domestic production, value added in the home goods sector and the
imported input are used in fixed proportions, with bHI the input-output
coefficient, set equal to unity for convenience.3

11

Profit-maximizing
nominal

behavior in the two sectors would imply that the

wage is equated to the value of the marginal product of labor

in the export-good sector but to the net value of marginal product
in

the nontraded good sector. Thus,

long as entrepreneurs watch their own prices while workers watch the

CPI, the supplies of nontraded goods and export goods will be positively

wage rigidity. The results hold equally well for the other cases
mentioned.

Commodity

Markets

Equations (5)-•(ll)
is continuously

describe the market for nontraded goods, which

cleared, the income identity and prices.

Given the assumption of nominal

wage rigidity,

the supply of

goods in (5) is negatively related to the net real wage
inthatsector. The demand for home goods depends on the relative
nontraded

prices of all final consumer goods, which are assumed to be gross

substitutes in demand, anddesiredconsumptionexpenditures,which is defined
in equation (7) as the difference between income and desired saving. (The
distinction between national income and disposable income is ignored.)

The demand function is homogeneous of degree zero in all prices and
consumption and the indifference curves are assumed to be homothetic.6
In the presence of intermediate goods, GNP is equal to value added

which, in

value

turn, is equal to the total value of production minus the

of imported inputs (equation 6).

Desired real saving, which is equal to the flow excess demand for
wealth, is homogeneous of degree one in real income and real wealth,

yielding (8) in nominal terms. If desired wealth exceeds the actual
stock of wealth, domestic residents save. In the absence of government
debt creation or domestic money creation, the private sector accumulates
wealth through the balance of payments.
The price equations for all traded goods are given by equations

13

(9)—(l1). The country

is

assumed

to

be small on the import side so

that (10) and (11) simply convert the international prices into

domestic currency units. The country is not small on the export side,
however. It is assumed to possess some market power (k) which is
measured by decreasing elasticity of demand (in absolute value) for

exports. Thus, the domestic—currency price for the exportable is
not fixed but is itself a function of the exchange rate, domestic

supply conditions, and

d.

world

market conditions.7

The Solution
The model can be solved for four endogenous variables —

the

price

of nontraded goods, the exchange rate, the interest rate and value

added. Since we are interested in the short-run effects of an increase
in intermediate good prices, the model is solved holding asset stocks
fixed.

In Appendix 3 we show that a sufficient condition

stability

for local

of the system is that the country not be too large on the

export side — or more generally, that a depreciation of the home currency,

ceteris

paribus, must increase value added. In the present model, where

an increase in value added implies an

increase

in saving and hence an

improvement in the current account, this condition is equivalent to the
Marshall—Lerner

condition. Whereas most portfolio—balance models stress

the importance of the Marshall—Lamer condition
in

for dynamic stability,

this model the condition becomes relevant for local stability as well.
Imposing

the

Marshall—Lerner condition, we report the effects of an

increase in the international price of the
variables in Table 3.

the nontraded goods market following the increase in the price of the

< 0 and ZpH

is unambigously positive.

Table 3 also shows that the increase in the price of the imported
input unambigously depreciates the home currency, lowers the domestic

interest rate, and reduces nominal income. As has been shown elsewhere
(Katseli—Papaefstratious, 1980), the income response depends on the

character of the underlying production function. If the imported input
is a gross complement to the domestic factors of production, then an
increase in the price of the input will, ceteris paribus, increase its

total share in income, reducing value added. Table 3 also indicates that
an increase in imported input prices lowers real output but has an ambiguous effect on the real exchange rate.

The results in Table 3 are consistent with those obtained by Findlay—
Rodriguez (1977) and Buiter (1978) even though their models abstract
from a nontraded—goods sector, specify perfect asset substitutability,

and are dissimilar in some other respects. In the Findlay—Rodriguez
model, an oil price rise reduces real output and has an ambiguous effect

on the real exchange rate. In the Buiter model, it reduces real value
added and depreciates the nominal exchange rate.

a function of a number of structural parameters, such as the degree
of market power on the export side (k), the marginal propensity to

substitutability of domestic and

foreign

the marginal propensity to consume

nontraded goods (m.H)l the own and cross-price elasticities of demand
(B11, B11.; i =

E)

and so

forth. The solutions in Table 3 can be partially differentiated
with respect to each of these parameters in order to determine what
effects changes in structure have on the transmission of external

price disturbances. The differential path of adjustment experienced
by industrialized countries after the series of price increases in
oil and other raw materials may be understood, in part, by differences
in these structural characteristics.

Rather than provide a complete taxonomy, we choose to focus on four
structural parameters, namely the degree of market power in the export

market (k), the marginal propensity to save (g), the degree of financial
substitutability

and the marginal propensity to consume traded goods

(mT 1-rn11). The results of partially differentiating the solutions

in

with respect to each of these structural parameters are

however.

These findings can best be understood by recognizing that as the

a given depreciation become larger. From footnote (7) we have

As k increases, the depreciation caused by the increase in P produces a
larger increase in the domestic price of exportables and thus a smaller
drop in value added than would otherwise be the case. The increase in
now causes a smaller drop in money demand, dampening the depreciation of

19

home currency and the drop in interest rates

required

to restore

money-market equilibrium.

Decreased market power

implies that a given depreciation

implies a greater substitution towards home

and also a bigger income effect. However, since decreased

market power actually dampens the depreciation of the home currency,

its net effect on the demand
percentage

for home goods and consequently

on the

change in home good prices is uncertain.

In summary,

the

results suggest that economies which differ in

market power but are otherwise similar in structure and policy attitude

should experience different degrees of currency depreciation. Countries
with relatively less market power on the export side should experience
a

smaller depreciation of their currencies following an increase in

imported input prices. The results also suggest that countries which
differ in market power may experience different degrees of income

decline. These observations might be relevant in analyzing the impact
of the oil price increase on various European economies.

20

b.

The Marginal Propensity to Save

An increased marginal propensity to save (g) also affects the
way an external price disturbance is transmitted to the economy.
Table 4 shows that an increased marginal propensity to save dampens

the depreciation of the home currency and moderates the drop in

interest rates and income that accompany a rise in P. Its effect
on the percentage change in nontraded—goods prices depends on specific

parameter values.

These findings can be understood, in part, by examining expression (13)

(13)P.

The terms on the right-hand side of (13) represent the supply—inflationary
and demand—deflationary effects in the home goods market brought about

by the increase in P. If the drop in supply exceeds the drop in
demand, (13) is negative and home—good prices will increase.

Expression (13) indicates that an increase in the marginal pro-

pensity to
in

save reduces the demand—deflationary effect of an increase

P, requiring a greater increase in home—good prices to restore

equilibrium

in that market. Consequently, if an increase in imported

input prices raises home—good prices -

effect dominates so that ZPH,P > 0 —

that

then

is, if the supply-inflationary

an increased marginal

propensity to save will exacerbate this price increase. If, on the

21

other hand, the demand—deflationary effect dominates, so that domestic
prices fall, an increased marginal propensity to save will dampen or
even reverse this price decline.
Since

an increased marginal propensity to save requires a greater

increase in
than

would

prices, it

causes

a smaller drop in value added

otherwise be the case. Consequently, the drop in money

demand will be moderated, dampening the depreciation of the home

currency and the drop in -interest rates required to restore money—
market equilibrium.

These results suggest that differences in the marginal propensity
to save can cause economies to react differently to changes in imported
input prices. Economies
will

with a greater marginal propensity to save

tend to experience increased upward pressure on home—good prices,

a smaller depreciation of their currencies and

Asset Substitutability

c.

The substitutability of foreign and domestic bonds, which might
be considered an index of financial openness, can be approximately

measured by r' the partial derivative of the demand for foreign
assets with respect to the domestic interest rate. To see this,
suppose that the demand functions for both foreign and domestic
bonds are exponential functions:

As can be seen in equation (16), there is a correspondence between
and the substitutability of interest—earning assets given a change
in the domestic interest rate.

The results of differentiating the solutions in Table 3 with

respect to f are reported in Table 4. Greater asset substitutability
(i.e., a larger negative number for f) implies that there will be a
larger shift in the demand for foreign assets for any given change

in the domestic interest rate. Thus an increase in

which reduces

the interest rate will create a larger excess demand for foreign bonds
and a larger excess supply of domestic assets, thereby exacerbating

the depreciation of the home currency and dampening the fall in

income and the domestic interest rate. The effect of increased asset
substitutability on the percentage change in home—good prices is
unclear.

In summary, one would expect countries which are more financially
open — whose domestic assets are closer substitutes for foreign
assets —

to

experience a larger depreciation of their currencies and a

smaller drop in their interest rates than those which are relatively closed.

ambiguous results. If it is assumed instead that the economy faces

a world of perfect asset substitutability then an increase in the price
of the intermediate input will have the same qualitative effect on
home—good price3 nd the exchange rate but will not alter the domestic

interest iate or nominal value addec. The reasons for these latter
results are straightforward. With perfect asset substitutability and
static expectations, the domestic interest rate cannot deviate from
the foreign interest rate. Nominal value added does not change because
the direct dampening effect on value added due to the increase in imported

input prices will be offset exactly by the depreciation of the home currency.

25

Differentiating

this new set of solutions with respect to mT we

find that increased demand—side openness exacerbates the depreciation

of the home currency but has no effect on nominal value added or the
domestic interest rate. Its effect on home—good prices depends on

specific parameter values. If the increase in imported input prices
raises home—good prices-——that is, if the supply—inflationary effect
dominates the demand—deflationary effect in the home—goods market———

then increased consumption of traded goods dampens the inflationary

pressures. If an increase in imported input prices lowers home—good

prices, this drop is exacerbated.
These results can best be understood by recognizing that greater
demand—side openness increases on net the demand—deflationary effect

of a rise

in

It

reduces the substitution effect away from traded

goods as the home currency depreciates and it increases the substitution
effect away from home goods towards traded goods once the price of home
goods starts rising. Both substitution effects tend to increase the
net demand—deflationary effect in the home—goods market.
The results suggest that the

degree

of demand—side openness has

important implications for the way an economy adjusts to a change in

imported input prices. Economies with a relatively greater fraction of
traded goods consumed should experience a larger depreciation of their
currencies but a smaller inflationary effect on nontraded—goods prices.

26

4.

Conclusion

The macroeconomic model shows that an increase in imported raw
material prices will depreciate the home currency and lower nominal
value added, real output and domestic interest rates. The effects on the
real

exchange rate and on nontraded—goods prices depend on specific

parameter values. If the supply—inflationary effect dominates the
demand—deflationary effect in the nontraded—goods market, then prices

in

that market will rise.

The analysis also suggests that differences in economic structure
do affect the transmission of external price increases t. the domestic

economy. This might

account,

in part, for the varied experiences of

oil-importing countries following the oil-price increase in 1974. Much
research still needs to be done to isolate the effects of other structural parameters on the transmission process and to test the resulting
hypotheses empirically.

Footnotes

1.

Openness is measured in different ways. Real—side openness can
be measured by the value share of exportables in total GDP or
by the value share of traded goods in total consumption expend-

itures. It can also be measured by the degree of dependence
on imported inputs. Financial—side openness might be measured
by the proportion of foreign assets in total wealth or by the
degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign interestearnings assets.

Given the supply of exports, which is expressed in

home currency units nP = 2,rip° ÷ S1 9.nX, and the demand for
exports, which is expressed in foreign exchange units

Expectations can be endogenized in many ways. One simple way is

to

assume regressive, or inelastic, expectations. This means that a

percentage increase in a variable generates the expectation of a
percentage decrease.

For example, the expected

exchange rate is:

ct<O

When a = —1, expectations are completely inelastic. The future exchange

rate is expected to return completely to its previous level. When
-l <

a

0,

the future exchange rate is expected to be at a level in-

between the past rate and the currently prevailing rate. Of course,
when a =

expectations are static.

expected rate of change in home—good prices can be expressed

a similar fashion:
=

; —l<y<O

The three equations (1-Al), (3-Al) and (5-Al) can be solved for

the impact effects of a change in international prices on the price
of nontraded (home) goods, the nominal exchange rate and the domestic

interest rate. A sufficient condition for local stability of the
system is that the trade be negative and that the 3 x 3 determinant
be negative, where

14 and 2 are defined below Table 3 in the text.

Stability requires that 2 be positive. In other words, a depre—
ciation must increase value—added and thus saving, improving the
current account.

This condition is equivalent to the Marshall—

Lerner condition.

In addition, a negative determinant requires that the bracketed term

in

a13 be positive. This will be true as long as the Marshall—Lerner

condition holds and as long as g "S.

g.

The interpretation of this

second condition is as follows. A depreciation of the home currency
generates an expected appreciation, lowering the expected real return
on foreign assets and increasing the expected real return on domestic

assets. Stability is ensured if the net effect of the actual depreciation

35

on expected real rates of return is to raise consumption on the home
good.

Imposing stability, a change in imported input prices will have the
same qualitative effects on the endogenous variables assuming inelastic
expectations as it does assuming static expectations.

Stability is ensured if the trace is negative and the determinant

is negative. Thus stability requires that the expression

embodied in

a13 and a33 be positive. Economically this means that a depreciation
must raise value added and hence the demand for domestic money. Since
an increase in value added also increases saving and the incipient
current—account surplus, the condition that

the Marshall-Lerner condition. Note that stability requires the home
country to be sufficiently small on the export side. As k —> 0 (as the
country possesses increasing market power on the export side),
