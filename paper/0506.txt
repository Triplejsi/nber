Does Anticipated Monetary Policy Matter?

ABS TRACT

Recent theorizing with business cycle models which incorporate features
of the Friedman—Phelps natural rate model along with rational expectations

lead to the following policy conclusions. Anticipated changes in aggregate
demand policy will have already been taken into account in economic agents
behavior and will thus envoke no further output or employment response.
Therefore, deterministic feedback policy rules will have no impact on output

fluctuations in the economy. These policy implications of what Modigliani
has dubbed the Macro Rational Expectations (MRE) hypothesis are of such
importance that a wide range of empirical research is needed for its verification or refutation.

Recent empirical work has tested the "neutrality" implication of the MRE

hypothesis that an icipated monetary policy does not affect output or unemploy-

ment. Although this empirical work has frequently been favorable to the MRE
hypothesis, it suffers from several deficiencies that create suspicion about

the robustness of the results. This paper is an attempt to conduct an econometric
investigation of the implications of the MRE hypothesis which does not suffer

from these deficiencies. The results here strongly reject the neutrality
implications of the MRE hypothesis: unanticipated movements in monetary policy
are not found to have a larger impact on output and unemployment than antici-

pated movements. This evidence casts doubt on previous evidence that is cited
as supporting the view that only unanticipated monetary policy is relevant to
the business cycle.

INTRODUCTION

Recent theorizing has focused on business cycle

models which

incorporate features of the natural rate model of Friedman(1968) and
Phelps (1970) with the assumption that expectations are rational in

the sense of Muth (1961). An important conclusion from this research

(1972),

[ucas

Sargent and Wallace (1975) and Barro (l976]is that anti-

cipated changes in aggregate demand policy will have already been taken
into account in economic agents' behavior and will thus evoke no further

output or employment response. Therefore, deterministic, feedback,
policy rules will have no impact on output fluctuations in the economy.
This

leads

to the implied policy prescription that the monetary author-

ities should pursue a price level stabilization target, and a constant
money growth rule is one candidate for such a policy (e.g., Wallace
(1976)), These policy implications of what Modigliani (1977) has
dubbed the Macro Rational Expectations OIRE) hypothesis rims counter to

much previous macroeconomic theorizing (as well as the views in policy

making circles), It is thus of such importance that a wide range of

empirical research is needed for its verification or refutation.

empirical work has frequently been favorable to the MRE hypothesis,
as will be shown below, it does suffer from several deficiencies that

create suspicion about the robustness of the results. There is thus
a need for further empirical research which does not suffer from
these deficiencies, and this has stimulated this paper's attempt to
provide additional econometric evidence on this issue.
The next section of the paper discusses the previous empirical research on this subject, and the econometric methodology in the empirical

tests of this paper. The following section then presents the outcome
from these empirical tests and. a final section contains concluding remarks.

the right—hand—side variables.1 If (1)

estimation methods.

'This is easily seen in a case iorked out by Abel and Mishkin (19T9)
where only the contemporaneous unanticipated variable is included in
an equation like (l)

The implicit assumption made in all the empirical work cited in the In—
troduction holds that all the right—hand—side variables are exogenous
and hence

are

uncorrelated with the error term. However this

assumption

is never subjected to tests in this work and so we must be careful in
interpreting the evidence on the s's.

Rational

expectations implies that the anticipations of Mt will be

formed optimally, using all available

information, and as is usual

in

this literature, models are assumed to be linear. An equation which

and the residuals from this regressIon are then used as the unanticipated

movements in money growth: i.e., y in (1) is assumed to equal the OLS esti—

often led to misleading results.2 The specific problem with this two—

is rather that the resulting test statistics are inappropriate. This procedure implicitly assumes that the covariance of the

joint estimates, as here, then ignoring

them

as is done in the two step pro-

cedure will lead to test statistics that do not have the correct asynrptotic

distribution. Misleading inference is then a possible outcome of using this
two—step methodology.

In addition, this methodo1or does not allow a full testing of the implications of the MRE hypothesis. This hypothesis embodies two propositions:

that

This procedure is

superior to the two-step procedure although it is far more expensive to

compute. Not only will more efficient parameter estimates of 's and y
result because both (2) and (1.) make use of information from each other in

the estimation process, but the tests will be more efficient as well. In
addition, this non—linear procedure generates valid tests of both implications of the MRE hypothesis.

The joint test involves a likelihood ratio test for whether the (2) and

satisfies the rationality constraints that the y are equal in

both equations as well as the neutrality constraints (5 = a) that exclude
the anticipated M's from (1). One way to proceed is to estimate with full—

as well as the unconstrained (2) and (6) system 'there &=O and y=y are

Non—linear least squares estimation of the constrained (2) and (4)

system proceeds with the same identifying assymption used in the previous
research on this topic that the unemployment or output equation is a true

reduced form.5 This implies that the covariance of the error terms from

(2) and ()

is

zero. Failure to correct for heteroscedasticity both with-

in and across the equations in the system would also result in inappropriate test statistics, and heteroscedasticity corrections can have a

51n the case where only contemporaneous MMe appears in equation (4),
imposition of this assumption, even if it is untrue, will not invalidate the test statistics on the rationality and neutrality hypotheses.
See Abel and Mishkin (1979). However, it is not clear that this desirable
result that the above assumption does not matter to the tests of interest
here carries over to the case where lagged M_Me enter equation (4).

9For example in model number 2.1 in Table 2, the unconstrained money
growth equation is estimated with 79 degrees of freedom, while the unconstrained output equation is estimated with only 70 degrees of freedom. This
is a difference of over io%. In the case of Model number 5.1A in Appendix
2, this problem is even more severe: the degrees of freedom for the unconstrained money growth and. output equations are now 79 and 32, respect—

stating this problem is to say that the weIghting mat—

22.69 reported in Table 3. In the models found in Appendix II which use

One remaining issue concerning estimation needs to be discussed. In

this paper we are particularly interested in obtaining correct test sta—
tjstjcs for our models, so it is critical that the suprious regression
phenomenon [Granger and Newbold (19711.)] be avoided..19 Therefore, partic-

ular attention must be devoted to the serial correlation properties of

the error term, ,

of

equation (11.) and (6). This is especially important

because no theoretical argument guarantees that it will be white noise and
evidence in Barro and Rush (1978) indicates that it has appreciable serial

correlation when postwar quarterly data is used. In the estimation here,
the error terni, c, is assumed to be a fourth order AR process. This specification for the error term was chosen because fourth order autoregressions

usually eliminate most serial correlation in quarterly, macro time—series.
Indeed, Durbin—Watson statistics and the residual autocorrelations of the
estimated model indicate that this serial correlation correction is suc—
cessful in reducing the residuals to white noise.

20

see Plosser arid Schwert (1978).

201n the models estimated here, the Durbin—Watson statistics for
range from 1.82 to 2.15, none of which indicates the presense of first
order serial correlation. Furthermore, the Box—Pierce.(1970) Q—statistic
for the first twelve autocorrelations of
range from 5.25 to 12.11.2 so
that the null hypothesis that these twelve autocorrelations are zero cannot be rejected at the 5 percent level. (The critical Q(12) at 5 percent

and for similar reasons it will also inva1.date tests of the pro-

casts doubts on this previous empirical work.
In this paper, the specification of the money growth equation is

approached in quite a different way from that used by Barro (1977) and the

other studies mentioned above. The reason for this is as follows. It is
difficult on prior grounds to exclude any particular piece of information

from the money growth equation, for it differs by an expression involving
the unanticipated FEDVt. Clearly then, using residuals from the money
growth equation to proxy for unanticipated money growth is valid when only
lagged variables are included in this equation or if there are no errors
in forecasting FEDVt. The issue of how important an issue this is empirically depends on the magnitude of the forecasting errors for FEDVt relative to

able for their om inscrutable reasons. Thus, the economic theory that a
researcher uses to explain his money growth specification might be relatively unimportant in deciding on the validity of his particular specification versus another researcher's.

The discussion above suggests that an atheoretical statistical procedure might be superior to economic theory for deciding on the equation

(2)

specification. The procedure used here amounts to running multivari—

ate, Granger (1969)

tests.

Note that the issue here is the predictive

content of information — — which is what Granger tests are really meant to
analyze — — and it does not involve the tricky concept and issue of econo-

mic causality which has led to so much confusion in the literature.23 The
multivariate time—series specifications for equation (2) are chosen using

the following criterion. Money growth can be regressed on its oni four

lagged

values (again

values

to insure white noise residuals) as well as on four

of a wide ranging set of macro variables, such as: the

quarterly Ml or M2 growth rate, the inflation rate, the growth rate of nom-

inal GNP, the growth rate of real GNP, the unemployment rate, the treasury

bill rate, the growth rate of real government expenditure, the high employ—

inent surplus, the growth rate of'
ments on

the

federal debt and the balance of pay-

current account. This particular list of variables was chosen

SPECIFICATION OF TI LAG LENGTH IN T NPE EQUATION (1)

A riniary objective of this study is to obtain more information on

the robustness of results with the M1E model of equation (1). As has been
discussed by McCalluzn (1979), the theoretical framework underpinning equa-

tion (1) does not specify what the lag length, N, should. be on unanticipated '

money growth. The standard

criterion

for chosing this lag length is empi-

rical: for example, Barro (197'7) and Rush (1978) choose the lag length on
the basis of excluding lagged unanticipated money growth. variables if their

coefficients are not significantly different from zero in the model of

equation (1). This yields a lag length which is fairly short -

- two

years

or under.

There are several reasons why this paper does not restrict itself to

estimation of models with only this short lag length. Research which
studies an equation of the form of (1) with other variables besides money
growth as the aggregate demand policy variables finds that unanticipated
aggregate demand variables lagged as far back as twenty quarters are sig-

nificantly correlated with output and unemployment.2 Thus, it is plausible that estimating models with longer lags on unanticipated money growth
might reveal interesting new information.
Furthermore, if the MRE hypothesis is not valid, then choosing the lag

THE RESULTS

The tests of the NBE hypothesis in the text use seasonally adjust-.
ed, postwar quarterly data over the 1951...76 period and

the

joint esti—

ination procedures outlined in the previous section. Following Barro and

Rush (1978), the data are seasonally adjusted and Ml growth is chosen
as the monetary variable. The data are discussed in more detail in the

appendix. Again in pursuit of information on robustness, both out-

quarterly

models are estimated in this paper (i.e., where

unemployment rate

or the log of real GNP).

The natural

level of unemployment or output, y is estimated as a time trend here as
in Barro (1978). A more complicated Barro (1977) specification, has
been avoided, because as is indicated by Small (1979) and Barro (1979),
its validity is doubtful.

The first step in pursuing the MBE tests is to specify

the

variables

in the money growth equation (2). The multivariate, Granger procedure
outlined in the previous section yields an Ml money growth equation that
has the following variables in the Z—vector:
the 90—day treasury

bill

rate and the

lagged values of Ml growti,

high—employment surplus. The

resulting ordinary least squares results with standard errors in parentheses are

as follows:

are so

close to those of Barro

Because the econonietrician's life is

made difficult by the absence of direct measures of expectations for most
variables in the economy, poor specification of expectations formation
is alwars

a

danger in this line of research. Although, misspecification

of money growth equation (2) would lead to an error—in—variables bias in
the coefficients of the unemployment or output equation, the question is

how severe this bias would be. Money growth is apparently quite hard to
forecast

so that the variance of the true forecast error could. be sub—

stantial. In addition, Feige and Pierce (1976) have made the argument
that autoregressive expectations models might be "economically rational"
because other information might have little incremental predictive
power once the past history of the variable to be predicted is taken into

account.26 This argument implies that the variance of the measurement
error in the money growth expectations model used here may

be

small in

relation to the variance of the forecast error. If this occurs, then the

errors—in—variable bias m be negligible and

quite

different information is included in the money growth equation

here. Other research with a similar system to that estimated here also
finds that changing the specification of the time—series model used to

decrjbe money growth expectations does not lead to substantial differences in the results.27

The likelihood ratio tests in Table 3 are not too unfavorable to the
I'ffiE hypothesis. The tests for the 2.1 output model do not call for re-

jection of either neutrality or rationality propositions, nor the joint

hypothesis, The marginal significance level of each test is defined as
the probability of finding that value of the likelihood ratio statistic
or higher under the null hypothesis, where a value less than .05 would
indicate a rejection of the null hypothesis at the five percent level,

model similar to equation (1) where unanticipated short rates are an explanatory variable. In this model, use of an autoregressive specification
to describe short rate expectations leads to results similar to those obtained with the use of a forward rate to describe short—rate expectations.
This is even stronger evidence that the view promoted above is credible,
since forward rates are a more direct measure of expectations.

tion. The coefficients on anticipated money growth have no obvious
pattern, are never significantly

different

from zero and are in seven

out of eight cases smaller in absolute value than their asymptotic stan-

dard errors. However in the unemployment equation, some coefficients on
anticipated money growth are significantly different from zero at the
five percent level, and this leads to the rejection of neutrality in

Table 3. Here, the last two lag coefficients on anticipated money growth
are the most significant with asymptotic t-.statistics exceeding 2.5.

This creates the suspicion that even longer lag lengths for unanticipated
and anticipated money growth may' lead. to strong rejections of the NEE

hypothesis.
Table 5 contains estimates of the output and unemployment equations
in which longer lags (twenty) of unanticipated money growth are used as

explanatory variables, Although in neither case are coefficients on unanticipated money growth. lagged more than 7 quarters significantly dif-

ferent from zero, as is evident in Table 6, strong rejections of the MRE

hypothesis now occur. The unemployment model rejects the joint hypothesis of neutrality and rationality, while the seperate test of the component hypotheses indicate that the main contributor to the rejection is the
neutrality constraints: rationality' of expectations is not rejected at

the 5% level while neutrality is. The results on the output model are
even more negative. The probability of obtaining that value of the likelihood ratio statistic or higher under the null joint hypothesis is only

1 in 5000. Here the contribution of each set of constraints to this rejection is nearly equal with both the rationality and neutrality con-

straints rejected at the 1% level. Because excluding relevant variables

Non—Linear Estimates of Unemployment Equation

— 29 —

Output and unemployment equations were also estimated using M2 growth
rather than Ml growth as the policy' variable. These results, which are
not reported here in the interests of conserving space, indicate that Ml
growth versus M2 growth in the estimated models does not lead to different
conclusions.29 However, using unanticipated. M2 growth rather than Ml
growth does lead to some deterioration in the fit of the equations as well
as lower asrniptotic t—statistics. The use of seasonally' adjusted versus

seaaonally unadjusted data also does not appear to be

an

important issue

in the empirical work here. For example when seasonally unanadjusted Ml
data is used to estimate output and unemployment models rather than seasonally' adjusted data, the results are not appreciably different.3° Other

eirjcal work which uses a model resembling the constrained (2) and 4)

system also does not find that using seasonally adjusted versus unadjust—

monetary policy matters. Econometric models of this type are just now being developed, Taylor (forthconiing) for example, but to my knowledge sim—
ulation results which display the-reducedform. and 5 coefficients are
not yet available.
29For example, the 2.lA M2 model does not lead to rejection of the
joint hypothesis. Here the specification of the M2 time—series model was
also generated with the multivariate Granger (1969) procedure discussed in
the text. The likeUhood ratio statistic is x2(l5) = 18.1 with a marginal
significance level of .26. However, the M2 results for the additional models
explored in this paper are also as negative to the E hypothesis. For example, the .i..1A model with M2 data leads to a likelihood ratio statistic for
the joint hypothesis of 2(28) = 58.90 with a marginal significance level of
.0006.
30

.

Because a fourth order autoregression is not su.ficient to reduce the

seasonally unadjusted Ml growth to white noise, values of the unadjusted Ml
growth for lags 5 through 8 replaced. the SURPLUS variables in the equation
(2) specification. The coefficients and asymptotic standard errors of the
2.1A. model estimated with unadjusted. data are close to those reported in Table
2 and the likelihood ratio statistic of the joint hypothesis in this case is
x2(J-9) = 29.T5 with a marginal significance level of .0551. The unadjusted results for the 4.1A model are also unfavorable to the NEE hypothesis as is true

CONCLUSION

The title of this paper asks the question "Does Anticipated Monetary

Matter?" The empirical analysis here responds with a strong yes.
A closer look at models with money growth as the aggregate demand policy
Policy

variable reveals that the neutrality proposition of the NRE hypothesis is
rejected, particularjly when long lag lengths are allowed to enter output
and unemployment equations. Furthermore, contrary to the implications of
the MRE hypothesis, unanticipated movements in monetary policy do not have
a larger impact on output and unemployment than anticipated movements.
The other proposition embodied in the NPE hypothesis, that expectations

are rational, fares better in the empirical tests here. Although the ration—
ali-ty hypothesis does not come out unscathed — — there is one rejection at

the 1 percent level— — none of the other rationality tests in the text re—
ject at the 5 percent level.

32

When the MPE component hypotheses of ration-

ality and neutrality are tested jointly, strong rejections occur in the out-

put and unemployment models with long lag lengths. In one case, the proba-

bility

of finding that value of the likelihood ratio statistic under the null

joint hypothesis

32

was only 1 in 5000.

I

do not cite the rationality test results in Appendix II because, as
the discussion in Section II indIcates, they may not be as reliable, In
further work on the NRE hypothesis (Mishkln (l98Oc)) with inflation and nominal GNP growth as aggregate demand policy variables, the results are even
more favorable to the rationality hypothesis: there are no rejections at the
5% level o the rati,onality' constraints, The
on neutrality, however
are less favorable, with even stronger rejection of the

results

than are found here.

neutrality constraints

— 32 —

There is one qualification of the results that warrants further discussion. This paper has followed the previous research in this area by

using the identifying assumption that the output and unemployment equa-

tions are true reduced forms. It is not clear whether the invalidity of
this assumption might lead to rejections of

the MRE hypothesis even if it

were true. Thus, the results here are by no

of

means a definitive rejection

this hypothesis. However, this work does cast doubt on previous evi-

dence — — also of a reduced form nature — — that is cited as supporting
the

view

that
