State and Local Taxes and the Rate of Return
on Non—Financial Corporate Capital

ABSTRACT

Although

states and localities collect a substantial amount of revenue from

corporate profits taxes and property taxes on corporate capital, these taxes
have been inadequately reflected in previous calculations of the effective

corporate tax rate and the pretax rate of return to corporate capital. The
present study focuses on non—financial corporations and begins by estimating
the profits taxes and property taxes which these corporations pay to state and

local governments. These estimates are then used to calculate the pretax rate
of return on non—financial corporate capital; the results suggest that the
conventional omission of state—local property taxes leads to an understatement

of this rate of return by about one percentage point. The effective tax rate
on non—financial corporate profits is also computed, taking account of state—

local taxes. These taxes amount to approximately sixteen percent of the pretax
profits of non—financial corporations. The total effective tax rate on these
corporations is shown to have risen substantially during the past two decades;
it averaged more than seventy percent in the most recent five—year period.

The series for the rate of return and effective tax rate are used to compute

the real after—tax rate of return on non—financial corporate capital. The
calculations show that this number has declined recently, reaching 2.3 percent

in 1979. This is to be contrasted with after—tax returns of over five percent
which prevailed during the mid—1960s.

STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND ThE RATE

OF RETURN ON NONFINANCIAL CORPORATE CAPITAL

Martin Feldstein*
James Poterba*
In measuring corporate profits, the national income and product accounts
treat state and local property taxes very differently from the profits taxes

levied by all levels of government. Pretax profits are defined as profits
before corporate income taxes but after all of the state and local property

taxes paid by corporations.1 We believe that this method is conceptually
incorrect and that it significantly distorts the measurement of the national
rate of return on additions to the stock of corporate capital.
Although all of the taxes paid by corporations are costs from the
private viewpoint of the shareholders, these taxes do not represent social

costs. From a national or social viewpoint, the marginal product of capital
is the total addition to national output and not the addition net of the taxes

levied on capital or capital income.2 A correct measure of capital productivity
therefore requires adding the state and local property taxes to the national

1 An earlier version of this paper incorrectly stated that the national income
accounts measured pretax profits after state and local corporate profits taxes
as well as property taxes. We are grateful to John Gorrnan of the Bureau of
Econoniic Analysis for pointing out this error. Since property taxes are much
larger than profits taxes, the error did not lead to any incorrect qualitative
conclusions.

income account measure of pretax income.1 The present paper presents alternative estimates of the state and local property taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations and the implied total pretax profits.
In 1979, state and local governments collected more than $33 billion
in

taxes on

the

capital

or capital income of nonfinancial corporations. This

the state personal income taxes on the dividends of shareholders as

well as the state and local taxes on corporate property and

profits.

State

and local taxes on the capital income of nonfinancial corporations now exceed
16 percent of real pretax capital income and 60 percent of that income net of

all federal, state and local taxes. It is clear from these figures alone that
recognizing state and local taxes is important for calculating the total
effective tax rate on capital income as well as for assessing the pretax rate
of return on corporate capital.

Section one of the present paper presents annual estimates of the state
and local taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations for the years l948 through

1979. Because of the difficulty of calculating the property tax paid by nonfinancial corporations, three alternative estimates are presented. Section two
uses these tax estimates to calculate expanded profits and the implied rate Of

return on nonfinancial corporate capital. The third section then calculates
the effective tax rate on the capital income of the nonfinancial corporate sector.
This effective tax rate reflects the federal, state and local taxes paid by

corporations, shareholders and creditors. There is a brief concluding section.

1 This expanded pretax profits differs from the social product of capital
if there are externalities, economic rents, nonconstant returns to scale, or
monopoly power. This distinction will be ignored in the current paper.

1. State and Local Taxes Paid by Nonfinancial Corporations
Nonfinancial corporations pay two basic types of state and local taxes

that are based on capital or capital income: corporate profits taxes and
property taxes. There are 'no official estimates of either type of tax paid

by nonfinancial corporations. This section presents our own estimates of the
annual values of both taxes for the period since 19148.

The total corporate profits tax accruals of state and local governments
for all types of corporations is calculated by the Department of Commerce and

published in the National Income and Product Accounts.1 The preliminary
value for 1979 is l14.3 billion. We divide this amount between nonfinancial
and financial corporations in the same ratio as the federal corporate income tax

accruals are divided between these two types of corporations. In 1979, for
example, nonfinancial corporations accounted for 81 percent of total federal

corporate tax liabilities.2 On the basis of this information, we estimate that
the state and local corporate tax liability for nonfinancial corporations as
$11.6 billion. Similar values for other years since 19148 are shown in column 1

of Table 1. Note that the tax rose from only $1.0 billion in 1960 to $2.9
billion in 1970 and $11.6 billion in 1979.
The total value of state and local property tax collections appears

of the NIPA contains a detailed breakdown of state and local government receipts.

The total corporate profits tax liability is reported in Table B—l9
of the 1980 Economic Report while the corresponding figure for nonfinancial
corporations is reported in Table B—il. The 1979 figures are preliminary.
The Department of Commerce follows the same procedure, based on the NFC's share
of federal profits, for allocating state and local profits taxes. Therefore,
the profits tax liabilities data reported, which include federal, state and
local taxes, reflect the share of NFC federal profit taxes in total profit
taxes.

in the national income and product accounts- but no distinction is made between
the taxes levied on the property of nonfinancial corporations and the taxes
levied on the property of households, unincorporated business and financial cor-

porations. The total state and local property tax receipts for 1979 were $63.9
billion. Because calculating the share of property taxes levied on nonfinacial
corporations is difficult, we present three different estimates based on three

different assumptions. All three estimates are based on the Department of

series of the replacement value of stocks of reproducible

Commerce
assets

and

physical

the Federal Reserve estimates of the current market value of land

holding.2
More specifically, the total value of property that is subject to
state and local property tax is calculated as the sum of plant and equipment,
land, and residential structures minus the amounts of those types of assets

owned by nonprofit institutions.3 The total value of taxable property estimated
for 1979 was $5,516 billion. Within this total, nonfinancial corporate business

1 See Table 3. of the National Income and Product Accounts.
2 These estimates are presented in "Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy," a
periodical document of the Division of Research and Statistics of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The figures used in the calculation
presented in this paper are from the version dated February, 1980.
3 Data on land and reproducible fixed assets are presented in the table
"Tangible Asset Allocations"of the document cited in the previous footnote.
For 1979, the total value (including that held by tax—exempt non—profit
institutions) was $5683 billion. State and local jurisdictions differ in
their treatment of inventories; to be conservative, we exclude inventories
from the tax base and thereby reduce the fraction of property taxes assigned
to nonfinancial corporations.

accounted for $1,670 billion or 30 percent of the total taxable capital stock.1
Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 present the two series of taxable capital stocks.
If all jurisdictions taxed all property at the same effective tax
rate, it would be appropriate to assign state and local property taxes in the

same ratio as the value of the property itself. In fact, however, effective tax
rates differ substantially among jurisdictions and among property classes within

jurisdictions. Within jurisdictions, business property tends to be taxed more
heavily than residential property or agricultural land2; this implies that
nonfinancial corporations bear more than a proportionate share of the total

property tax. The variation in effective tax rates among jurisdictions could
either strengthen this tendency or reverse it. Because of this uncertainty,
we present three separate calculations. The first assigns property taxes in the
same ratio as the value of the property; if the variation in tax rates among
jurisdictions is uncorrelated with the mix of property types, this "equal tax"
assignment is a conservative understatement of the property tax paid by non-

financial corporations. The second and third calculations are almost certain to

bound the true value. The second method assumes that the effective tax rate on
nonfinancial corporate property is three times the effective tax rate on other

1 Including inventories would raise the total taxable capital stock by $635
billion to $6151 billion; for nonfinancial corporations, the increase would be
$522 billion to $2192 billion. This expanded definition would raise the share
of nonfinancial corporate property from 0.30 to 0.36.

2 The effective tax rate has two components: the assessment—price ratio and the
tax rate on assessed value. The 1977 Census of Governments Taxable Property
Values and Assessment—Sales Price Ratios reports the assessment price ratio on
commercial and industrial property to be higher than that on any other class
of property. Netzer's (1973) comments based on his analysis of the evidence
indicate that the equal—effective—tax—rate assumption is probably conservative.

—7—

property.1 The third method assumes the opposite imbalance: the effective
tax rate on other property is three times the rate on the property of non-

financial corporations. For 1979, these two assumptions imply that nonfinancial
corporations may pay as much as 56.1 percent of the total state and local
property tax or as little as 12.7 percent.
Column 4

of

Table 1 reports the total state and local property tax

collections2 while columns 5, 6 and 7 report the property taxes assigned to

nonfinancial corporations by the three assumptions. Note that the basic
assumption of method 1 (i.e. the assumption that nonfinancial corporations
pay the same effective tax rate as other property owners) implies that NFCs paid
$19.3 billion in property taxes during 1979.

2. Expanded Profits and the Rate of Return on Capital
Several

recent studies have estimated the total pretax return to

capital with appropriate adjustment for the effects of inflation on the

traditional

accounting measures of corporate income.3 The common procedure

in all of these studies is to define total capital income as the sum of (1)
corporate interest payments and (2) corporate profits with a capital consumption

adjustment and inventory valuation adjustment. The rate of profit

calculated
--

is then

as the ratio of this measure of total capital income to the

This

implies that, for 1979, nonfinancial corporations paid 56.7 percent
of the property tax even though they only had 30.3 percent of taxable
property.

2 This series is taken from NIPA table 3.4, line 13.
3 See Nordhaus (191I), Feldstein and Summers (1971)

and

Holland and Myers (1979).

There is no need to adjust for changes in the real value of corporate debt
(due to inflation or interest rate changes) since any gain by the equity
owners represents an equal loss to the creditors and leaves total capital
income unchanged.

replacement value of the corporate capital stock defined to include fixed
capital, inventories and land)These

estimates rely on the work by the Department of Commerce during

the past decade that led to their publication of estimates of economic
depreciation

and of the replacement cost of fixed business capital.2 The

Federal Reserve Board's "Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy" incorporate
these Commerce Department estimates and also provide unpublished Commerce
Department estimate,s

of the market value of inventories and their own

of the market value of land. The capital stock is

estimates

basis

3 and

income is defined in the corresponding way.

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 present this conventional measure of total
corporate income and the implied net rate of return. Column 3 expands the
measure of total corporate income by including the estimate of the state and
local property taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations on the assumption of,

equal effective rates of property tax on all types of property, i.e., column 3

1 Land is, of course, included at an estimated market value. Lovell (1978)
presents estimated profit rates that include only plant and equipment in the
capital stock; since inventories and land represent about 35 percent of the
total NFC capital stock, this measure is very seriously incorrect.

2 These data are
of

more fully described in the April, 1976 issue of the Survey

Current Business.

3 The capital stock is measured net of depreciation in contrast to a gross
capital stock from which scrapping is deducted. All of the estimates in the
present paper are therefore comparable to the "net" profitability series in
Feldstein and Summers (1977) and not to the "gross" profitability series.
14 These figures differ from the rN series in Feldstein and Summers (1977) only

because of data revisions. Data revisions affect the earlier years in the
series because of the new estimates of the values of land and inventories.

is

the sum of column 1 of Table 2 plus column 5

of

Table 1. The corresponding

rate of return, calculated by dividing column 3 by the same capital stock

series that

is used to go from column 1 to column 2, is presented in column 14•

For the 30 year period from 19148 through 1919,

the total pretax rate of

return (column 14) averages 11.4 percent. By contrast, the conventional return
based on capital income after state and local property tax payments is only 10.2

percent. The failure to add state and local property taxes back into the total
return to capital caused previous estimates to understate the rate of return by

about 1.2 percentage points or nearly 11 percent. The estimates for overlapping
decades (also shown in Table 2) indicate that this difference has

remained

fairly constant over the post—war period with some tendency for a larger gap in
the second half of the period than in the first half.
Columns 5 and 6 present alternative estimates of the net rate of return
based on the two extreme assumptions about the property tax rates on nonfinan-

cial corporations and other types of property. The assumption that the nonfinancial corporations pay a property tax rate equal to three times the rate paid
on other property yields the series shown in column 5 and implies that the
conventional estimate of the rate of return understates the true value by

about 2.1 percentage points. Conversely, the extreme assumption of 'under—
taxat ion' of nonfinacial corporate property implies that the conventional

estimate understates the true rate of return by about 0.5 percentage points

(column 6). It seems safe to conclude that the truth lies somewhere between
these extremes and that the conventional estimate of the rate of return has been
too low by between one and two percentage points, implying that the true value
exceeds the conventional estimate by between 10 and 20 percent.

3. Effective Tax Rates
The effective tax rate on the capital income of nonfinancial
corporations depends on the federal, state and local taxes that are paid
by the corporation itself and by the corporation's shareholders and creditors.
These include the corporate income taxes, the property tax, the personal tax
on dividends and capital gains, and the personal and corporate taxes on the

interest income received by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporationsJ
In an earlier paper, Feldstein and Summers (1979) calculated the
effective tax rate on the capital income of nonfinancial corporations. In contrast
to previous studies that were limited to the corporate rate, the Feldstein—Summers
analysis included also the federal taxes on dividends, capital gains and

interest. They defined the effective tax rate as the ratio of the combined

tax

liability to the real pretax capital income. The present study redefines

this tax rate in two fundamental ways.
include

The

total tax burden is expanded to

the state and local taxes discussed in Section 2 as well as the state

and local taxes paid by shareholders and creditors. The real capital income
of the nonfinancial corporations is also expanded by including the state and

local property taxes. Since the effective tax ratio is less than one, adding

1 The logic of this calculation implies that it would also be appropriate
to include sales taxes to the extent that they represent a tax on the
consumption financed by the dividends, interest and capital gains of nonfinancial corporations, i.e., to the extent that these sales taxes are a
substitute for personal income taxes. It would not be appropriate to include
the sales taxes paid by nonfinancial corporation as such or the tax that they
pay based on their payroll. This classification of taxes is equivalent to
basing the effective tax rate on the taxes that would be borne by corporate
capital if there were no change in the capital—labor ratio or the allocation

of

capital in response to the taxes themselves.

equal

amounts to the numerator and denominator would

raise

the ratio. In fact,

the numerator is increased by more than the denominator so the effective tax

ratio rises even more. In addition to this fundamental change in the definition
of the effective tax rate, we also take this opportunity to make several smaller
improvements in the previous Feldstein —Summers procedure.
Table 3 presents each of the components of the total effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate is expressed as a percentage of what we shall call the

"adjusted real capital income" of the nonfinancial corporations. This adjusted
income is the total pretax capital income of the nonfinancial corporations
adjusted for tbe corporation's losses on non—interezt bearing financial assets
(cash, demand deposits arid net trade credit). These losses are calculated as
the product of the percentage change in the personal consumption deflator and

the total value of these non—interest bearing assets.1 We adjust these for
inflation because they represent a real loss to the corporation without being
a real gain to any explicit provider of corporate capital; i.e., the loss on
net trade credit is similar to a price reduction, the loss on cash is a gain
to the government, and the loss on demand deposits is a gain to commercial banks.
The adjusted real capital income series presented in the first column
of Table 3 is based on the assumption of equal effective property tax

rates.

This series therefore differs from the figures in column 3 of Table 2 only

1 Annual series for these assets, calculated from the Federal Reserve "Balance
Sheets", are presented in columns 1 and 2 of Appendix table A—l. The inflation
rate for each year is computed as the January—to—January change in the personal
consumption expenditure deflator.

because of the inflation adjustment. A comparison of these two series
shows that the adjustment reduces the measure of real corporate income
by about seven percent.
Colwnn 2 presents the NFC federal corporate income tax payments as

a percentage of this adjusted real capital income. The corresponding state and

the

local corporate tax payments are shown in column 3. It is noteworthy that

state and local payments were only about five percent of the federal payment in
the 1950's but have recently risen to eighteen percent of the federal tax.
Column 4 presents the state and local property tax payments (based on the equal

effective rate assumption). The series shows a general upward trend but appears
to have peaked
three

in

the early seventies and to be in decline since then. These

taxes have been grouped together because they are all collected

directly

from the corporation. The combined tax rate for these three types of taxes
has dropped from 58.3 percent of adjusted real capital income in the first five
years of this sample1 (1953 through 1951) to 49.5 percent in the five years
ending in 1979.

The effective tax rate on dividends depends on the distribution of
dividends among different classes of investors (households, pension funds,
life insurance companies, etc.) and the average effective tax rate for each

class of investor. The present study uses the flow of Funds data on equity
ownership to distribute dividends among classes of investors for each year

precluded extension of the effective tax rate series to the years before 1953.

since 1953-. Brinrier and Brooks (1979) have calculated the tax rate on dividends received by individuals, including the state and local taxes; this rate
averaged 43.2 percent for the years 1953 through 1979 and was 49 percent for

1979.2 Individuals account for approximately 93 percent of the equity that the
Flow of Funds sector statements of assets and liabilities classify as belonging
to

"householdstt; the remaining "household" equity is owned by nonprofit organi-

zations ( foundations, universities, etc.) and trusts.3 We make the conservative assumption that the dividends received by these "other household
institutions" are untaxed. For the remaining dividend recipients, we follow the
procedure of Feldstein and Summers (1979) and assume that insurance companies
and banks pay a tax rate equal to fifteen percent of the corporate tax

1 This represents an improvement over Feldstein and Summers (1979) which used
the 1976 pattern of ownership to assign dividends in all years of the sample
period. This assignment assumes that equity in nonfinancial corporations is
distributed in the same way as total equity and that dividends are distributed
in proportion to total equity.
2 To compute the federal tax on dividends, Brinner and Brooks constructed a
weighted average of individual taxrates, using the fraction of dividends
received by each taxable income class each year and the corresponding statutory marginal rates. State dividend taxes are estimated by assuming that the
marginal rate on dividends is 1.5 times the average state personal tax rate,
which can be computed from NIPA aggregates. Columns 3 and 4 of Appendix table
A—i provide the separate series for the federal and state taxes, which were
kindly provided by Brinner and Brooks.
3 The 93 percent refers to 1975 and is based on a calculation in Feldstein and
Summers (1979); see Securities and Exchange Commission (1977), p. 11. Our
calculation assumes 93 percent

rate1 (i.e., 0.069 for 1919) and that pension funds, foreign equity owners,
and other miscellaneous investors pay no tax. The relevant weighted average
of these tax rates implies an overall tax rate on dividend income in 1919 of
314.9 percent.2 Since the ratio of dividends to "adjusted real capital income"
was 25.5 percent in 1979, the taxes on dividends added 8.9 percentage points
(0.3149 x 0.255 =

0.089) to the total tax as a percentage of adjusted real

capital income. The series for all years is presented in column 5 of Table 3.
The relative stability of this tax component reflects the underlying stability
of the dividend—income ratio and the effective tax rate on dividends.3
The appropriate effective rate of capital gains tax reflects the
distribution of equity ownership among different classes of investors and the

fact that the capital gains tax is payable only when the asset is sold. The
distribution of equity ownership has already been described in the previous

paragraph. For the sample years before 1969, individual capital gains were
taxed at half the individual's statutory rate on dividends, but subject to an

"alternative" maximum rate of 25 percent. However, gains are taxed only if
realized and the effective tax rate is reduced by the postponement of

85 percent of the dividends received from other corporations.

and 19614 but the difference is quite small.

realization.1

For the period between 1969 and

1918,

the effective tax rate

on capital gains was raised in a number of ways: the use of the alternative
tax was limited, the value of the loss offset was reduced, the "untaxed"
portion of capital gains was subject to a minimum tax, and the amount of income

qualifying for the maximum tax on personal services income was reduced. There
is no way to provide an accurate evaluation of the weighted average capital

gains tax rate for each year in our series. Instead, we shall make what we
regard as the quite conservative assumption that households paid an effective
rate of tax of only 5 percent on accruing capital gains except during the years

1969 through 1918 when the rate was 1.5 percent. Insurance companies and banks
are taxed at a 30 percent statutory rate on capital gains realizations. We
assume an effective rate of 15 percent on accruing gains because of the effect

of deferral. Finally, we assume that pensions, foreign shareholders, and other
"miscellaneous" investors pay no tax on capital gains. The overall effective
tax rate on capital gains implied by these values was .0147 in 1979 and .066 in

1978 (before the tax change).2
The capital gains tax rate must be applied to two kinds of capital

gains: the rise in the real value that results from retained earnings and the

asset is bequeathed since the new owner is permitted to "step us" his

rise in the nominal value that results from the general increase in the
price level. The national income account. estimate of retained earnings is
deficient because it ignores the real gain that the equity owners make at the

expense of the creditors. For example at the beginning of 1919 the net debt
of nonfinancial corporations3- was $738.2 billion. The 9.9 percent rise in the

personal consumption expenditure deflator implied a gain to the equity owners of

$73.1 and an equal loss to the creditors.2 The gain on outstanding debt must be
added to real retained earnings3 for each year to calculate the real increase in
equity value.4 I1ultiplying this real increase in equity values by the capital
gains tax rate and dividing the product by adjusted real capital income gives

the additional tax component shown in column 6 of Table 3. This source of tax
is responsible for only between one percentage point and two percentage points
of the total effective tax rate.
An additional

increase in

capital gains tax liability results from the nominal

the value of corporate assets that accompanies a general rise in

the price level. We abstract from the year—to year stock market fluctuations

1 Computed from the Flow of Funds tables published by the Federal Reserve Board.
2 Of course, the equity owners "paid for" some of this gain in the form of
higher interest rates and, to that extent, national income account profits
are lower. The issue here is clarifying the real allocation of the income
between debt and equity and identifying the way in which this extra component
of real income is taxed.
3 The real retained earnings are, of course, after the inventory valuation
and capital consumption allowance adjustments.
This real increase in equity value is presented in column 7 of Appendix table
A—i. We assume that an extra dollar of real retained earnings raises the
market value of equities by one dollar. This abstracts from year—to—year

during the year.1 Multiplying this nominal increase in equity values

by the capital gains tax rate and dividing the product by the adjusted real
capital income gives the additional tax component shown in column 7

of

Table

3. This source of tax was responsible for less than 1.5 percentage points of
effective tax rate until the late 1960's but the rise in inflation since then

has made this a more significant factor. In the five years ending in 1979, the
accrued capital gains tax on this nominal increase was equivalent to an average
tax on total income of 4•1 percent.
The final component of'

the

total effective tax rate is the tax

borne by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporations. Although there are
federal,

state, and in some cases, local taxes on interest income, we follow

the very conservative procedure of including only the federal tax.2 Feldstein
and Swnmers (1979) used the flow—of—Funds accounts for 1976

to

estimate the

distribution of the net liabilities of nonfinancial corporations among households, pensions, commercial banks, savings banks, life insurance companies,

government accounts, and a number of smaller categories. We use the relative

1 The GNP deflator is too broad an index while the fixed nonresidential
investment deflator is too narrow (because it excludes inventories and land);
however both indices rose almost exactly the same amount over the 27 year
period and behaved quite similarly from year to year. Note that the equity
owners receive the nominal gain on the entire capital stock and not just on
the equity fraction. The value of the beginning—of—year capital stock for
each year, found in the "Balance Sheets" document, is presented in column 8
of Appendix table A—l. The calculation abstracts from the depressing effect on
share prices of unanticipated changes in inflation; see Feldstein (1980) and

the other research cited therein.

2 We do this because of the difficulty of calculating the state and local
taxes in interest income, especially the taxes paid by financial corporations.

—20--

weights implied by this analysis and also follow Feldstein—Sumraers in setting

the household tax rate on this interest income at 35 percent, the mutual savings
bank rate at 21 percent, and the rate for private pensions, government accounts,

and "miscellaneous" creditors at zero. Life insurance companies are taxed
under a special set of tax rules that make their effective rate depend
essentially on the yield on their portfolio as well as the statutory corporate

tax rate. We apply these rules to calculate a different tax rate for every year
based on the prevailing Baa bond rate.1 For commercial banks, nonliI'e insurance
companies, and finance companies, we make the conservative assumption that one—
third of their interest income is completely sheltered from all corporate

taxes.2 The combined tax rate on interest income3 multiplied by the annual
interest payments of nonfinancial corporations and the product divided by their
adjusted real capital income gives the interest component of the total effective

tax rate that is presented in column 8 of Table 3. This component contributed
less than two percentage points to the total effective tax rate until 1966
but the rising interest rates since then raised this component to more than
seven percentage points in 1919.

The combined total effective tax rate on the capital income of the

1 These rules (known as the tvlenge formula) imply that there is one marginal
tax rate on the increase in income that occurs when interest rates rise and a
different and lower marginal tax rate on the increase in income from an increase in the size of the portfolio. Because of their focus on the effect
of inflation, Feldstein and Summers calculated the former; we calculate the
latter.

2 This is equivalent to assuming that a larger portion is converted to capital
gains or just postponed. The untaxed income is, of course, subject to
further tax as the dividends and retained earnings of these financial
corporations. We assume the same dividend—payout ratio, .1461, as Feldstein
and Summers.

i.e.,

the sum of federal, state, and local

taxes on capital and capital income divided by the adjusted real capital
income —

is

shown

in

column 9. This tax rate reached 714.5 percent in 1919;

taxes took nearly three—fourths of the total pretax income. Since 1973, the
rate has exceeded 65 percent every year. By comparison, the rate was as low as
55percent in the mid—1960's. The effective tax rates in the period from 1975 to
1979 were back to the same high level that prevailed in the early 1950's before

accelerated depreciation, the investment tax credit, rate reductions, etc. This
increase in effective tax rates occurred because of the interaction of inflation with existing tax rules

and

despite several statutory changes that, in

themselves, would reduce the effective tax rate.1
Table 14 compares alternative effective tax rates and the implied net

rate of return. Column 1 represents the combined effective tax rate from
column 9 of Table 3. The real net rate of return on nonfinancial corporate
capital is equal

to

the product of the pretax rate of return on capital

(presented in column 4 of Table 2) and one minus the effective tax rate. This
return is shown in column 2 of Table 14. The real net rate of return for 1979

was only 2.3 percent. For the most recent five years, it averaged only 2.7 percent. The contrast with the ntid—1960's is striking; in the five years from 1963

through 1961, the real net return averaged 5.9 percent. Columns 3 and 4 show
the effective tax rates corresponding to the two alternative assumptions about

state and local property taxes.2 If the property of nonfinancial corporations

discussed in Feldstein (1979) and Feldstein and Summers (1979).

tax rate rises by about two percentage points. Conversely, if nonfinancial

corporations are taxed more lightly than other property (column ), the
effective tax rate falls by about one and one—half percentage points.1

1919, the rate averaged 61 percent —

This

The first is the amount of state and local taxes levied on the capital or

corporations. The principal estimate showed

these taxes now represent about sixteen percent of the total before tax

returns

to capital of nonfinancial corporations and that this percentage has

been generally increasing over the past 30 years.
Adding an estimate of the state and local property taxes paid by nonfinancial corporations to the national income account estimates of corporate
interest payments and real corporate profits before income taxes provides a

assumption about the effective property tax rate.

measure of the total return to capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector.
Since 19)48, the total return has averaged ii.)4 percent of the real capital stock

of these nonfinancial corporations (including land and inventories as well
as plant and equipment).
The effective tax rate on nonfinancial corporate capital is the ratio
of the total taxes —
and creditors —

to

federal,

state and local paid by corporations, shareholders

the total real pretax income of capital. For the period from

1953 through 1919, this effective tax rate averaged 61.1 percent. In the five
years ending in 1979, the rate was an unusually high 71.1 percent, primarily a
reflection of the impact of inflation with existing tax rules.
Finally, the effective tax rate and the pretax real return can be
combined to obtain a real after—tax return on the capital of nonfinancial

corporations. This is the total real net return earned by the providers of
capital, both creditors and shareholders, and including retained earnings

as well as dividends. This total real net return averaged 3.3 percent for
the period from 1953 through 1959, )4.9 percent from 1960 through 1969, and

only 2.7 percent from 1970 through 1979.
