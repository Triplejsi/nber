A MODEL OF FIRMS' DECISIONS
TO EXPORT OR PRODUCE ABROAD

This paper is a theoretical analysis of production location by a

multinational corporation (MNC). It starts with a simple model of

take account of the production of intermediate as well as final prod-

ucts, the existence of scale economies and finally the effects of transport cost and of factors affecting the cost of production.
Among the several analytical approaches to economic inultinationalism

summarized by Fatemi et al (1976), this paper belongs to the oligopolistic
approach that has been introduced and elaborated by Vernon (1966, 1971),

Caves (1971) and others. Empirical studies of foreign investment such
as those summarized by Iiufbauer (1975) and the later study by Swedenborg

(1979) show that heavy foreign investors are characterized by attributes
such as product differentiation, large size, high profits, and high levels

of advertising or research orientation. These characteristics are often
associated

related

with oligopolistic industrial organization. Most of them are

to the possible existence of scale economies. Product differentia-

tion is assumed to be a necessary condition for "horizontal" investments,
that

is, investments in the industry

of the parent.

A Model of Production Location

production decisions if the market is taken to be the consumption in each

in that country. For some purposes, it

decisions for export separately from those for host—country

and Final Products

Intermediate
The

relation of foreign production and investments to exports and

therefore to domestic production and employment, and more specifically,
whether foreign investments and production reduce home—country exports

and employment, has troubled policy makers, legislators, labor unions,
and of course economists. An intuitive answer is that outflows of capital

create jobs abroad at the expense of potential domestic jobs. This seems
to have been the logic underlying the Burke—Nartke Bill that was supported
by the AFL—CIO. One way of examining this issue theoretically is by
incorporating intermediate goods into the analysis.
u' to this point, we have assumed that a firm
prothcts

produces only final

for sale. Yet much of the trade between paret firms and their

affiliates takes place in intermediate products, typically exported by the
parent in the home country to the affiliate in the host country.

host—country production by bringing down the cost of production of the
input product. Using the same logic it Is easy to think of a case where
foreign production stimulates the total exports of the parent firm when
these exports include both the intermediate product and the final good.

To sum

up,

when there is product differentiation and

host—country

production is not a perfect substitute for home—country production, a

level of foreign production can be associated with a higher level

higher

of exports.
There is empirical evidence of such relationships. Bergsten, Horst,
and Moran (1978) concluded from a cross—section
.a

modest amount of foreign investing is highly complementary to U.S.

exporting
or

of industries that

but that higher levels of foreign investment have no strong

consistent impact on U.S. exports." Swedenborg (1979) found that

Swedish

multinationals there was "a highly significant and positive effect

on exports of goods which are complementary

firms...." but also '.. .a negative effect on exports which are non—

complementary to foreign manufacturing...."
opposing

with

". . .The net effect of these

influences... .a very small positive effect on the firm's exports

to countries where they have manufacturing affiliates." Lipsey and Weiss
(1976a and 1976b) found that affiliates' production in foreign countries
was positively associated with home—country exports to these countries.
In addition

they found that in the pharmaceutical industry the promotion

— 11 —

of

exports by affiliates was mainly of bulk pharmaceutical at the expense

of packaged products. In other words, exports of intermediate goods were
stimulated by the production and activity of foreign subsidiaries.

Scale Economies

So far we have mentioned scale economies only in passing and have not

integrated them into the analysis. Aside from the pure cost analysis with
which

we began, we have not specified anything about the nature of the cost

function.

Economies of scale, in the absence of transfer costs, imply con-

centration of production in one location. Our problem, as with the earlier
analysis of the factor cost model, is to justify the existence and explain
the distribution of production in more than one market.

We can begin again with the case in which a firm considers producing
a single product in

two locations.

Isorevenue curves can be plotted in

the plane X., X, as in Figure 1.

The 1sorenue curve will be of the type of Ro, convex to'ard the

By combining the isocost and the isorevenue curves on the same diagram,

one can see the way in which a multinational corporation maximizes its
profits. A firm

that enjoys scale economies and some morropolistic power

(isorevcnue curve is R) could maximize its profits by

This condition will represent maximum income only if the isorevenue

In this case, the returns to scale are small compared to the

revenue losses froni concentrating l1 production in either market.

On the other hand, if the firm has no monopolistic power or if X. and

X. are perfect substitutes the isorevenue curve is linear (Rc in Figure 3).
In this case, point E would represent a point of minimum revenue subject to

the cost, hence a solution of maximum loss. The optimal solution in this
case would be a corner solution such as point F, where the firm produced in

only one location. The larger the scale economies (the convexity of the
isocost curve) the more likely that the firm will concentrate its production

in one location. The choice of the location will depend on the production
cost conditions, the transfer cost, the degree of monopolistic power of the
producer and the deoree of substitutability between X. and X..
33

The

degree of convexity of the above curves can be measured by their

elasticities of substitution. This measure can be formulated for each of

We

will now explore the impacts of changes in some of the above variables

on the allocation of production between the home and the host country. This
test will provide some insight into the decision of a firm in its choice of
location for its foreign production.

The

Effect of Transport Cost
The transfer cost, denoted above by T., is composed of several variables,

such ascustons duties in country j, transportation cost, and possibly also
the money value of some other trade barri.ers.

According to our formulation, T. is a part of the cost of selling, in
country j, good h that is produced in country i.. A change in T. generates
a change in both the slope and the convexity of the isocost curve.

The slope of the isocost curve is given by equation (11) above.

Higher

transport cost implies a slope (negative) that is lower in absolute value,
though

higher in algebraic value.

— 18 —

The elasticity of substitution along the isocost curve, which reflects

its convexity,is given by expression (17). Since

An increase in the transfer. cost T. will decrease the optimal ratio
and

thus

tend to increase foreign production and decrease exports.

Given the change of the elasticity of substitution, if the firm had no host-

h
country production and was only exporting before the change of

the

chances that it will combine exports with foreign production are now greater.
If the firm was both exporting and producing in country j before the change,

after the change of T. the chances of concentrating production in country j
and stopping exporting become greater. In Figure 4 a change such as the one
described above is presented.

might be a corner solution here he will be producing in country j only.

Transfer cost interacts with th.e size of the host country when production

involves scale economies. For example, even if a market involves very high
cost of transfer for the home-country producer, the firm will not produce

there if the market is too small. This might occur when the sufficient condition for production in broth country I an(couñtry j is not met. The second order

The decision to -start

depend on the combination of these two variables. Horst (1971) discusses

"Foreign competition comes both fron imports and local production by

owned subsidiaries. A high tariff policy may encourage subsidiary production
and increase the competition from

abroad". This conclusion is here extended to the

case in which there are scale economies. In this case,
the above mentioned competition is stronger the larger is the size of
domestic market.

The Impact of Cost of Production

The impact of different levels of the cost of production in different

has two aspects: (a) the possible existence of scale economies and

economies

their relation to the size of production in different countries; (b)factor
prices

in different economies in conjunction with factor intensities in

production.

(a) The degree of scale economies in production can be measured as the

smaller the chance that production will take place in more than one location.

The higher the degree of scale economies the greater the probability that a

producer wIll concentrate his production in one location. If production costs,

transfer cost, and the degree of differentiation between X. and XL. do not

production abroad, the producer will produce only in the home country

and export to other countries. If these conditions favor production in a
host country, the firm will tend to concentrate its production other than for
the home market in the host country, and its output there will be larger the
greater the degree of scale economies.

Factor price differentials can obviously influence the location

of production. If we assume

that prices of capital are,

more or less, uniform across countries •within firms, wage differences will
determine the location and size of foreign production.

Marginal cost is positively related to the wage rate, and for given
wage differentials between countries i and j, the differences (both absolute

and relative) between MC. and

be greater the more labor-intensive

the commodity. Thus, for a given differential between host-country (low)

and home-country (high) wage rates, the relative cost of producing abroad

relative to producing at home and exporting (MC' /MC.+T.) will be lower

and the ratio of production abroad to production at home (X/X.) will be
higher, the more labor intensive is the good, h. When we take scale economies
into consideration, we see that OTC/OR is smaller the greater the difference

between the wage rates. This is due to the fact that d1c/dw <

be met. The producer will then tend

concentrate his output in the host country j and produce there as much as

possible. This is one more possible interaction between the degree of scale
economies and another (exogenous) variable, in this case, the wage differentials:

To conclude, one can say that the impact of wage differentials on international productiQn is stronger (1) the greater the labor intensity in produc-

tion

(2) the higher the degree of scale economies. This chain of effects re-

lates wage

differentials to the size of the potential host country; thus, the

impact of low wages on production in the foreign country is stronger, the larger
the size of the host country.

Implications

The location and magnitude of the international production of a firm de-

pend on two groups of variables: the endogenous variables of the firm (industrial characteristics) and exogenous variables for which the firm adjusts

its behavior (national characteristics). The latter include T. --

the

transfer

cost, w. and w. -- home and foreign wages, and demand conditions in
foreign

countriesj3 On the other hand, factors such as the degree of scale
economies,
the factor intensities, the possible production of allied goods (inputs and/or
final goods), are endogcnous to the firm.

The impact of national characteristics on the location and the size of production of a firm will depend on industrial

characteristics. In theory we know

the signs of the effects of the various national characteristics on the size

of foreign production and on the ratio of foreign production in a given location
to total output of the firm.

In general we would expect the following

relationships:

The higher transport costs are, the larger foreign output is relative to

the home output and total output of the firm.

These two derivatives are positively affected by the labor intensity in the pro-

If we assume that a firm might improve its market share in a country by
producing there, or that the location of production involves marketing
advantages, then the demand conditions facing the firm are not perfectly
exogenous.

4. The size of the natural market in country j can be larger than the size
of its national market. For example, production in Belgium can be designated
to supply the whole EEC, or a part of it.
