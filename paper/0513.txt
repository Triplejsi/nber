Market Wages, Reservation Wages, and
Retirement Decisions
ABSTRACT

The paper is an empirical cross-section of the retirement decisions
of American white men between the ages of 58 and 67, predicated on the
theoretical notion that an individual retires when his reservation wage
exceeds his market wage.

Reservation wages are derived from an explicit

utility function in which the most critical taste parameter is assumed
to vary both systematically and randomly across individuals.

Market

wages are derived from a standard wage equation adjusted to the special
circumstances of older workers.
The two equations are estimated jointly by maximum likelihood, which
takes into account the potential selectivity bias inherent in the model
(low-wage individuals tend to retire and cease reporting their market
wage).

The model is reasonably successful in predicting retirement decisions

and casts serious doubt on previous claims that the social security system
induces many workers to retire earlier than they otherwise would.

The normal

effects of aging (on both market and reservation wages) and the incentives
set up by private pension plans are estimated to be major causes of retirement.

Introduction and preview
Why do people retire?

This question is now attracting

. increasing attention because of recent and proposed changes
in the minimum age of mandatory retirement and because of the
likelihood that the social security system will be in need of
major structural overhaul in the coming years.

It is clear that

labor force participation rates among older men are declining
quite rapidly.

The reasons behind this trend are less clear.

We can enumerate five basic classes of reasons why older
people retire from the labor force.

First, failing health in

old age may make work much more difficult, or less remunerative
if wages decline as a result of ill health.

Second, advancing

Fourth, private pension arrangements

may offer similar financial incentives for retirement.

Fifth,

as people age their preferences may shift in favor of leisure
and against work.

Our purpose in this paper is to estimate the

relative importance of each of these competing hypotheses-health, wages, social security, private pensions, and tastes-in explaining retirement decisions, and to see which (if any)

for their age.

can explain the trend toward earlier retirement.
Healhh=

It is by now well documented that, when retirees

are asked to explain their actions, ill health is the most common
explanation of retirement. 3

Our estimates find a substantia 1,

though not overwhelming, effect of ill health.

However, effects

of health on retirement age will not explain the trend in
retirement age since health improvements over time would imply
an increase, not a decrease, in retirement ages.
Wages.

When or if an individual chooses to retire depends

critically on the life-cycle pattern of wages. 4

this has happened, too.
Social Security.

The net wage late in life can decline

either because the q~ wage falls (as just suggested) or
because the tax-and-transfer wedge between gross and net wages
increases.

Many people have thought that the social security

system--and particularly the earnings test--causes such an effect
by placing a heavy tax on work effort late in life.

We doubt

that this explanation of retirement makes sense, and have designed
our research program accordingly.

The reasons for our skepticism

merit some explanation.'
Many observers have pointed out that the social security
law creates a complex multi-armed budget constraint for eligible
individuals. 6

Though labor supply decisions are distorted by

social security, perhaps substantially, it is most unlikely that
social security sets up strong incentives to

reti~--that

is, to

reduce hours of work to zero--because:
1.

a small amount of earnings (currently %3,000 per year)

is allowed before the earnings test is applied.

Hence, in the

neighborhood of zero hours of work, the marginal tax rate
<

implicit in the social security system is zero.
2.

current earnings have a potentially important effect on

future social

securi~y

benefits.

We have shown elsewhere that

under plausible circumstances this effect can amount to approximately a 50% wage subs idy and might well discourage people
from retiring ..(Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980a»
3.

individuals who opt not to begin collecting social security

benefits at age 62 earn an upward adjustment in their potential
benefits at age 65 that often provides more than actuarially fair
compensation.

(Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980a ) •.')

Consequently, we decided to concentrate our initial efforts
on

decisions, not labor

assumes that social security is irrelevant to retirement decisions.
As a check on this, however, we append a few variables designed
to "pick up" any social_ security effects that may have been
overlooked.

In general, these variables achieve statistical

significance, but are of little empirical importance.
It hardly needs pointing out that if social security has
little effect on retirement decisions, the growth of the social

frequent claims to the contrary notwithstanding.
Private Pensions.

The story is rather different, however,

when we consider private pensions.

8

First of all, many private

pension plans include a provision for mandatory retirement at
a prescribed age [Skolnik (1976)].

In such cases, the incentive

to refire is fairly obvious: -a compulsory change in jobs may
occasion a loss of wages so severe that the worker prefers to
retire rather than take a job at a much reduced wage.

One goal

of our model is to estimate this wage loss, and we find it to
be very substantial.
The effect of private pensions in the absence of mandatory
retirement is more subtle, but may be quite powerful nonetheless.
Once the age of eligibility for the pension arrives,.a worker
who continues to work reduces the discounted present value of
his pension benefits if he remains on the job because his future

at

Furthermore, many

private pension plans create a bonus for early retirement by
failing to adjust the annual pension benefit downward by the full
actuarial amount if the worker elects to retire early.9

Our

estimates suggest a 'very strong effect of a private pension on
the retirement decision.

aging process, and also due to changes in health.

Similarly,

the market wage changes over time because of age, experience,
and 6tner reasons.

At some point for some people there comes

an age (the age of retirement) at which the highest indifference
curve is reached at a corner solution with zero hours of work,
as depicted in Figure 1.

the budget line far away from zero hours of work probably has

are not retired.
Ilsee, for example, Boskin

(1977) or Reimers (1977).

12 There is one important exception to this.
If the budget
set is extremely convex--for example because current earnings
have a large positive effect on future social security benefits-the shape of the budget line at high hours of work could influence
the retirement decisions of some people. This effect would
induce these people to stay in the labor force, not to retire.
For more on this, see Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980 a ).

Thus, in addition to providing an empirical model

of the retirement decision, the model we estimate here offers
the side benefit of providing estimates of a standard wage
equation like (1) that are not afflicted by selectivity bias.
Selectivity bias corrections turn out to be sizeable in some
cases.

3.

Data and Method of Estimation
The data used to estimate the model were drawn from the

first three waves (1969, 1971, and 1973) of the Longitudinal
Retirement History Survey (LRHS).

This survey conducted

extraordinarily detailed interviews of 11,153 individuals aged
58-63 in 1969, and repeated the interviews at two-year intervals
for those individuals who survived and could be located.

In

each survey year, individuals were asked a variety of questions
(wage rate, typical hours, ,eligibility for pension, etc.) about
their current job, if they had one.

In addition, the 1969

interview included questions about their previous job--which
would have been their last job if they were already retired,
and about a number of socioeconomic variables that would not
change through time (e.g., family background, education).
From these data we extracted a sample of white males who
were not self employed and who worked for pay at least some

time in their lives as our basic sampling frame.
exclusions were forced upon us by the data.

certain other

For example, since

a principal focus of the wage equation was to estimate separately
the returns to

prio~

experience and tenure on the current job,

a respondent who did not report his job tenure, and for whom
this information could not be deduced, 18 was dropped from the
sample.

Secondly,

~espondents

were free to report wages for

any time period they chose (e.g., hourly, weekly, monthly).

We

converted each response into an hourly wage and expressed each
in 1969 dollars.

However, whenever the reported information was

inadequate to construct the hourly wage rate, or was clearly
erroneous,19 the observation was dropped from the sample.

in the case of managers and professional workers) or below one
third of the average wage rate in manufacturing (which was ~1.06
in 1969)" were considered erroneous.
20There were a few case~ in which there was not adequate
information on the lifetime pattern of job holdings to construct
the measure of "full income" needed for equation (9). In a few
other cases, the reported data implied what to us was an
implausibly long hiatus between the end of schooling (or, more
accurately, years of education plus 6) and the start of the
first full time job. When this gap was greater than 15 years,
we dropped the observation from the sample.

The Market Wage Equation
Our market wage equation:

is rather complicated, and can best be understood if its
objectives are made clear at the outset.
(1)

They were:

To examine in some detail the effects of aging on

wages, seeking to untangle the interrelated effects of age,
vintage, and experience, since each of these might be relevant
to retirement decisions.
(2)

To investigate the effects of pensions and pension-

related job provisions (such as mandatory retirement) on wages.
As mentioned in the introduction, job transitions late in life
induced either by mandatory retirement or by pensions may imply
a substantial loss of earning power if job tenure (henceforth, j')
is more valuable than previous experience on other jobs (henceforth,
x).

A sharp drop in wages, in turn, might induce retirement.
(3)

To measure the loss in market wages from job transitions

late in life that stem from reasons other than pensions (e.g.,
from a desire to reduce hours of work).

This requires us not

only to separate out the effects of job tenure from those of
previous

exper~ence,

but also to disaggregate by occupation

group since there is every reason to believe that the cost of
a job transition varies by

occupat~on.

The choice of occupational groupings was meant to balance
our desire to obtain disaggregated information against our fear
of letting an already awesome computational problem become entirely
unmanageable.

Since each occupational group leads to three new

parameters, as can be seen in (13), we decided to limit ourselves
to the following four occupational groupings:
Occupation Group 1:

Professionals and technical workers;

Managers, Officials, and proprietors.
22 The construction of p was quite complicated, owing to
certain shortcomings in the data. Details are available on
request.

20.

Occupation Group 2:

Salesmen: Clerical workers.

Occupation Group ;:

Craftsmen, Operatives, Private

household workers, Service workers.
Occupation Group 4:

Nonfarm laborers, Farm managers, Farm

laborers, Occupation unknown.
The occupation groups were chosen for their inherent similarity
and can be loosely thought of as "high class" white collar,
"low class" white collar, skilled blue collar, and unskilled
blue collar.
Estimates of the parameters just discussed appear in the
top portion of Table 1, which reports estimates of all the

Marginal returns to an additional

workers.
The tremendous effect that having a pension has on the job
tenure profile is of particular interest because of its importance
for retirement decisions.

As can be seen in (16), we allowed

the existence of a pension to affect both the intercept and the
slope of the wage-tenure profile.

Specifically, for jObs

without pensions equation (13) becomes:
log w

=

while for jobs with pensions it becomes:

Given our parameter estimates, wages are systematically higher
on jobs with pensions, though the amount by which they are
higher varies both by occupation and according to the mix of
job tenure and prior experience.

jobs with and without pensions is greatest when

An important question to ask, given our interest in retirement decisions, is:

what does it cost an older worker to change

jobs late in his career (perhaps because he wants to step down
to a job with shorter hours)?

To answer this, we assume first

that he has no pension on either job, so the issue is merely
one of swapping· j

for

x.

Table 2 displays the effect on

wages of giving up a job on which the worker has either 45,
20, or 10 years of experience in order to take a new job (with
j = 0,

x = 45).

The losses are typically quite substantial.

23 For example, the different~al is 82 '70 when j =0 and
x=45, fa Ils to between 35 '10 and 54 '10 (depending on occupation)
when j=15 and x=45, and to
20% - 33 10 when j=30 and x=15.
24 0ur data did not tell us which individuals were union
members, and it is well known that pensions are more common
in the unionized sector.

In addition, our rough approximation to

error.

This bias may be aggravated further by potential endogeneity

ofp(i.e., a positive correlation of

p

with €).

Age Variables
As noted earlier, the pure effect of aging on wage rates
is of some importance for explaining why people retire. Furthermore,
there is some controversy in the human capital literature over
..( footnote 27 continued)
PP = dummy equal to 1 for a prIvate job with a pension,
whose benefits are unknown.
The
rationale is as follows.
Consider the lefthand side of
(13) as a function of ~. Expanding it to find the Taylor
series approximation around ~ = 0 gives:
log(w+~p) ::: logw + 12. P- •
w

For people with unknown p, we set p=O on the lefthand side of
(13) and entered instead a dummy variable on the righthand side
whose ,coefficient is to be interpreted (with sign reversed)
as an estimate of the ratio of p-pJw in these jobs. Since we
know that this ratio is typically much greater in government
jobs than in private-sector jobs, we
entered the two
dummy variables defined above.

29·

whether there is such an effect, once schooling and experience
are controlled for.

If there is a direct'effect of age on wages,

it seems most likely to show up among older workers.

We tested

for it by including ,the following two variables:
AGE - 61

= age minus 61 if positive
o otherwise

AGEBC

= age 'minus 58 for blue collar workers (groups
3 and h. above)

o

for white collar workers

The parameter estimates in Table 1 do indeed suggest an
effect of age

~~~

on wages.

Specifically, we estimate a

typical decline in real wages of about 2.6 percent per year
starting at age 61 for white collar workers, and a decline of
about 1.7 percent per year between ages 58 and 61 rising to about
h..3 percent per year after age 61 for blue collar workers.

Since

these numbers are much larger than the estimated returns to job
tenure at these ages, real wages typically will be falling after
age 61, and this wiIl provide some inducement to retire.
One further aging variable was included to try to gain some
understanding of the mandatory retirement phenomenon.

It seemed

to us that the existence of mandatory retirement must imply
that--for somereason--wages diverge from marginal productivity
late in life, and that firms have a need to terminate this

For workers on'jobswith mandatory retirement, this variable

for manda.toryretirement.
Though thElestimated coefficient is positive, and its

The estimated coefficients of· these variables merit some
comments.

A health limitation on the ability to work seems to

31.

account for about a 10 percent drop in wages whether it was
acquired recently or long ago.

However, the estimated coefficient

of "left last job for health reasons" is huge--toohuge, in
fact, to be believed.

The data show vividly that almost all

individuals who reported leaving their last job for health
reasons are now retired.

Very few, therefore, report a wage

rate that can be used to infer the negative effect of this
variable on market wages.

The role of the coeffiQient of HJ

in the equation;is to ensure that persons with HJ =1 have an
expected wage so low that they are virtually certain to be retired.
Frankly, we wonder if some people who wanted to retire for other
reasons simply found "left last job for health reasons" to be
a socially acceptable rationale for retirement.
Vintaqe-LBirth Cohort)
As noted in the introduction, one possible explanation for
the trend in retirement is that older workers did not share
equally in the overall productivity growth of the economy.

We

were able to test this hypothesis for the 1969-1973 period
since our longitudinal sample made it possible to separate the
effects of age and experience from those of vintage, which we
defined as:
VINTAGE

=

age in 1969, minus 57.

This variable ran from 1 for the youngest cohort (those born in

1911) to 6 for the oldest (born in 1906).
The coefficient of the vintage variable turned out to be
almost zero--far short of the economy-wide average rate of

32.

increase of real wages between 1969 and 1973, tVhich was 1.6~o
per annum.

Thus it seems that product':i.v:itygrowth during this

short time span was not neutral across vintages ,and

in fact

shifted the age-wage profile in a way that was unfavorable to
older workers.

data set consisting only of the 9,879 workers..

(Some of the

parameters are not directly comparable because the nonlinear
aspects of our wage equation were approximated linearly.2 9 )
The main coefficients of interest are those pertaining to aging,
since this is a principal determinant of labor force
participation.

It can be seen that the age coefficients in

ordinary least squares suggested no direct effect of aging on
wages for white collar workers, and a very small negative effect
for blue collar workers.

By contrast, our corrected estimates

show wages falling significantly with age.

3 TO avoid an obvious simUltaneity problem, in constructing Y
we used a least squares estimate of each individual's lifetime
earnings, rather than his actual earnings. This estimate was
based on ~ linear wage equation similar to that in Table 1, which
was used to forecast and backcast wages.
(For more details on
the procedure, see Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980b).)
According to the tpeoretical derivation in Section 2, Y
ought to include only potential earnings in past years if the
individual will be retired in "the future," but should include
future potential earnings as well if he will not be retired. As
an empirical compromise between these two notions, we assumed
full-time work (2,000 hours per year) until· age 67, and complete
retirement thereafter.

from the same maximum likelihood estimation problem as those

a rise of 1.0 represents a huge increase in lifetime income,
and yet increases

w

R

by only about 10 percent.

This low coefficient has two principle implications.
First, since the estimated income effects on labor supply are
so weak, it seems unlikely that rising average income levels
have been a major cause of the trend toward earlier retirement.
Second, since the estimated indifference curves between labor
and leisure are so flat, the implied labor supply function should
be highly elastic to wage rates.

This implication is not as

It implies, in essence, that the

typical worker will work full time

inelastically

until he nears retirement, then a brief period of extreme
sensitivity will ensue, followed by complete withdrawal from the
work force.

In fact, this is what the data seem to show.

In

1973, when our sample ranged in "age from 62 to 67, 60io worked
zero hours while 34'10 worked 35 hours per week or more ..
Note finally that, in conjunction with our earli.er finding
of substantial wage loss from job transitions late in life,
these flat indifference curves suggest that few workers will
make such transitions.
~e

They will opt for retirement instead.

Effects
We entered age in a piecewise linear: form with changes in

slope at ages 62 and 65 and a finite jump at age 65, an age
chosen to reflect eligibility for full social security benefits.3~
3 2 The effect of age on logwR includes both the effect of
age on the taste for leisure (~i) and the difference between the
rates of interest and time discount.

For reasons explained in Section 1, we did not expect any
particular effect of social security on retirement.

Despite

this, a finding that there is either a jump in the reservation
wage at age 65 or a sharp increase in slope at age 62 might be
grounds to suspect that social security really matters after
all--perhaps only because of a demonstration effect.
The estimated age effects on logwR
and in the anticipated direction:
with age.

proved to be substantial,

the reservation wage rises

More specifically, the reservation wage grows at

roughly 4 percent per year from age 58 to 65, makes a finite
jump of about 6 percent at age 65, and then grows at about 6
percent per year after age 65.

There are several interesting

observations to be made about this set of coefficients.
'First, while we allowed for it, there is no apparent break
in the reservation wage trend at age 62, the age of eligibility
for partial social security benefits.

This is as we expected.

Second, there is however a noticeable (though small) jump at
age 65, the age of full eligibility.

This provides some weak

evidence (the standard error is almost half as large as the
coefficient) that social security may be having some effects.
Third, the rate of increase of the reservation wage with
age

(4-6

percent per year) is moderately higher than the rate

of decrease of the market wage (about 2.6 percent after age 61)-indicating that increasing tastes for leisure are somewhat more
important than falling wages in explaining retirement behavior.

37.

More on Social Security
To test further for possible effects of social security on
retirement decisions,

~e

added to our equation the ratio of

potential social security wealth (i.e., the discounted present
value of potential social security benefits) to full income
called SSW/Yo
The rationale for a variable like this one is as follows.
It could be that many older workers want to retire, but are
deterred because a substantial fraction of their wealth is
tied up in a highly illiquid form--social security wealth.

When

they reach age 62, it becomes possible for them to draw on this
wealth, and they consequently retire. 33

If this scenario is

empirically important, the ratio of SSw/y should enter the
reservation wage equation strongly and positively after age 62,
but should get a negative sign before age 62.

Consequently,

we interacted SSw/y with a dummy variable for those 62 and older,
and entered the two variables indicated in Table

4.

To construct ,SSW/Y, it was necessary to supplement our
data source with information from each individual's social
security file--information that was available from ~he 1975 wave
of the LRHS.

However, because of potential endogeneity problems,

we did not use the actual ssw of each person, but rather an

33 This hypothesis was suggested to us by several readers
of the earlier draft of this paper.

38.

instrument constructed by assuming a fixed age-hours profile. 34
This made each individual's SSwjy ratio independent of his
particular labor-leisure choices.
Qualitatively, the results gave little indication that
the illiquidity of social security wealth influences retirement
decisions very much.

Prior to age 62, social security wealth

is totally insignificant (and incorrectly signed).

After age

62, its coefficient is significantly positive, but economically
unimportant.

A typical value for SSwjY is about

most people clustered in a range from

.05

to .12.

.07,

with

An increase

of .01 in this variable thus represents a substantial boost in
social security benefits.

Yet it adds only 0.3%

to the

reservation wage according to the estimate.

Since blue collar work has an element of physical arduousness
that is mostly absent from white collar work, it seemed a
plausible conjecture that reservation wages rise more steeply
for blue collar workers than for white collar workers.

To test

34Inparticular, we normally took the age profile of the
fitted wage rates used in constructing Y (full income), multiplied
by 2000 hours per year, assumed retirement at age 65, and calculated
the implied actuarial present value of social security benefits in
1969 using the 1969 law and information about the ages of the
spouse and children (if any). However, if the individual had
insufficient quarters of coverage to receive benefits according
to his social security record, we set SSW=O.
In addition, if
the reported earnings on the social security record in any year
the individual worked were below 40% of our forecasted earnings,
we assumed that the individual's main job in that year was not
covered by social security, and set that year's earnings to
zero when calculating SSW.

39.

for this, both the intercept and slope of the reservation wageage profile were allowed to differ between blue and white collar
employment by entering the following two variables:
DBC

=a

AGEBC

dummy equal to 1 for blue collar workers (occupation
groups 3 and 4)

=

the same age/blue collar interaction used in the
market wage equation.

The estimates contradicted our expectations.

Apparently,

,blue-collar workers have lower, and more slowly growing,
reservation wages than white-collar workers.

Indeed, for blue-

collar workers, reservation wages seem to rise at about 2-4·10
. per year (versus 4-6%

for white-collar workers).

Health
From among the several possible health variables, we
selected only:
HCO = health is worse than others of same age.
According to the estimates, having bad health compared to others
adds about 7 '10 to the reservation wage. 35

It has been suggested, e.g., by Mincer (1974), that people
who acquire more schooling remain in the labor force longer in

which is highly significant, has the opposite sign from that

other things (especially their market

wages) held equal, more educated people are more prone to retire,
not less.
Vintage
Another plausible taste variqble is vintage, the supposition
being that older cohorts have a stronger work ethic and hence a
lower reservation wage.

We thus expect a negative coefficient

for the variable VINTAGE defined earlier, which is precisely
what the estimate shows.

How~y~r,

it should be noted that

VINTAGE will also pick up any systematic (linear) effects of
calend~r

time, so the interpretation of the coefficient is not

entirely clear.

While the variables mentioned to this point can legitimately
be considered as potential determinants of tastes, a further set
of variables pertaining to pensions was included for rather
different reasons.

The estimation technique that we used requires

that any taste differences that are impounded in the error term
vi (i.e., not controlled for by inclusion in
orthogonal to the variables included in

Xi.

1.

must be

Now, since there

are many jobs with and without pension plans, it seems likely
that workers with an unobservable "taste for retirement" around

65 will

~rt

themselves into jobs with pensions.

Thus the

following two variables could be highly correlated with whatever
omitted taste variables lead to a high reservation wage:

41.

DP

=

DP65

dummy equal to 1 if the job has a pension

=

dummy equal to1 if the job has a pension Sond
the worker is 65 or older.

(The latter variable allows the effect of pensions on the
reservation wage to jump at age 65--the age typically prescribed
for retirement.)

Consequently, for purely econometric reasons,

we decided to include both of these variables in

Z.

Only about half of all workers with pensions know what
those pensions are worth in future benefits.

It is possible

that not knowing the value of one's pension (late in life) is
an indication that one does not plan to make use of it, i.e., an
indication of a low reservation wage.

So we entered a variable

defined as:
GP + PP

=

a dummy equal to 1 if the worker has a pension,
but does not know its amount.

In the same spirit, a change from one's longest occupation
might conceivably be a signal of a desire to remain in the labor
force rather than retire.

So we included the variable:

DO = a dummy equal to 1 if the current occupation differs
from the occupation of longest job.
The pension variables seem quite successful at "picking
up" a propensity to retire.

According to the estimates,

individuals with pensions have a log reservation wage some .25
above that for individuals without pensions up to age 65, and
a log reservation wage about .46 higher after 65.

The dummy

for not knowing the amount of pension benefits has the expected

42.

sign, but a very small magnitude.

The dummy variable for a

change in occupation has the anticipated effect on

wR : and it

is substantial--roughly a 15 percent reduction in the reservation
wage. 36

the error terms in the market wage and reservation wage equations:

both the market wage and lifetime income in the same direction.

It is worth stressing, however, that if

our model erred by underestimating the incentives to retire
provided by the social security system, we would expect it to
"retire" too few workers over 65.

In fact, it retires too many.

the reservation wage.

Not surprisingly, retirement probabilities

increase by miniscule amounts.
The vintage effect on retirement is moderate (see row

4).

As compared with men born in 1911 (the base case), men born in
1906 are 2-8 percent less likely to be retired, depending on age.
Differences among occupation groups are also very small.
In fact, retirement

probabi~ities

among farmers and unskilled

blue-collar workers (group 4) are virtually identical to those
of sales and clerical workers (group 2).

Professional workers

and managers have the lowest retirement probabilities, and
skilled blue-collar workers have the next lowest.
As can be seen in row 8, workers with pens ions are no more
likely to retire than workers without pensions up to age 64.
However, at age 65, when the retirement probability for workers
witliout pensiqn s jumps by .15, that for workers with pensions
ju~ps

by .35.

The retirement pattern for workers with pension

plans ~nd mandatory retirement (at age 65) is qualitatively
similar to this, but quantitatively different.

The jump in

the retirement probability at age 65 is .41.
Finally, lines 10 and 11 show the extreme sensitivity of
retirement decisions to wage rates.

In line 10, the log wage

is increased by 50 percent (which adds 40.5%
wage).

to the market

This makes retirement extremely unlikely up to age 63

or 64, and leaves the probability as low as .28 even at ,age 67.
In line 11, the log wage is reduced by 50 percent (this lowers
the market wage by 69 «to), which ra ises retirement probabilities
very dramatically, especially at younger ages.

51.

Lines 12 and 13 show two rather different types of retirement" profiles.

Holding age constant at 62, line 12 indicates

how the probability of being retired varies with years of
education. 43

It can be seen that the probability rises slowly

up to 10 years of schooling, and then falls.

College graduates

are only half as likely to be retired at age 62 as are high
school graduates.

In line 13 we seethe effect that exchanging

previous experience for job tenure has on the market wage:
as

j

rises and

x

falls, the probability of retirement drops.

Workers with long job tenure are therefore much less likely to
retire than those with short job tenure.

20

Conclusion
This has been a long paper, and many interesting results

have been pointed out along the way.

Rather than try to catalog

these, let us close by addressing the questions posed at the
mtset of the paper:
First; why do people retire1

1) It is clear that age has a dramatic effect, both because
age affects wages and because age affects labor-leisure tastes
(reservation wages).

In our base case,the probability of

retirement increases from below 10 percent at age 61 to above

43 In this experiment x and j both adjust to the change
in years of education, with the difference j-x held constant.

52.

60 percent by age 67.
2)

If we put aside people who say they left their last

job for health reasons _(w~o may be using this to rationalize a
decision made on other grounds), poor health seems to be a
moderately important cause of retirement.
})

Pension plans--with or without associated mandatory

retirement provisions--provide powerful incentives to retire
at the age of eligibility for the pension (normally 65).

Social

security, however, has a much weaker effect (if any) on retirement
decisions.

4)
wages.

Retirement decisions are highly sensitive to market

\

For this reason, few people will voluntarily change

jobs late in life if that job transition implies a substantial
reduct-ion in wages (as it normally does).

Similarly, individua ls

forced to leave their main j9bs because of mandatory retirement
normally will retire rather than take a new job at a lower wage.
While one must exercise extreme caution in drawing time
series inferences from cross-sectional data, the following
tentative explanation for the trend toward retirement is suggested.
1.

Wages late in life may have declined relative to wages

earlier in life, thus inducing more men to retire.
2.

Private pensions have expanded rapidly.

These plans

typically provide strong incentives to leave the job, often even
mandating it.

The resulting

drop~in

market wages normally is

severe enough to induce complete withdrawal fJ:.om

·~the

labor force.

53.

3.

Younger cohorts seem to have a stronger taste for

leisure, perhaps due to growth in the economy, causing them to
retire earlier.

4.

It seems unlikely that the growth of the social

security system, as impressive as it has been, has contributed
much to the trend toward retirement.
