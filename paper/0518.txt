Anticipated Inflation, the Frequency of Transactions
and the Slope of the Phillips Curve

ABSTRACT

This

paper examines the effects of expected inflation on the responsiveness

of output to nominal disturbances in the framework of a localized markets model.
The mechanism described in the theoretical part of the paper is that expected
inflation has a positive effect on the transaction frequency, which in turn

increases the flow of price information across markets. More information implies
less misperception of monetary shocks as relative shifts in excess demand,
resulting in lower sensitivity of real output to these socks.

The empirical implication of this proposition — namely, that expected
inflation reduces the coefficient of nominal shocks in an output equation —

is

tested first using data across countries, and then with time series data

from the United States. The first test uses Lucas's and Alberro's estimates
of Phillips Curve coefficients from different countries and the corresponding

average inflation rates. The second test involves data from the post — World
War II period. It uses nominal rates of return on Treasury Bills and corporate
bonds as measures of anticipated inflation and Barro's estimates of unanticipated
money. In general, results in both tests provide support (stronger than expected)
for the implication of the theory.

This paper was motivated by two independent hypotheses in the macro-

economic literature. The first is Lucas's hypothesis on the slope of the
Phillips Curve. Lucas's (1973) study indicated a negative correlation
between the variance of the nominal disturbances and the responsiveness of

real output to these disturbances. The idea advanced by Lucas is that the
higher this variance, the more likely are agents to attribute locally observed
price movements to general inflation rather than relative shifts in excess

demand. Therefore, as the variance of nominal shocks increases, supply becomes
less responsive to the general price movements generated by these disturbances.

The second hypothesis is from the literature on the inventory approach
to the demand for money (e.g. Baumol (1952), Tobin (1956), Barro (1970),
Feige and Parkin (1971) and Grossman and Policano (1975)).

It can be summarized

as the existence of a positive effect of expected inflation, or the nominal
interest rate, on the frequency at which cash receipts are exchanged for commodities or earning assets.
In Lucas's model, the nonnueutral effect of nominal shocks occurs because

of the lack of complete current information. Agents estimate the unobserved
price level using an information set that contains lagged values of the nominal

aggregates. Now, if expected inflation affects the frequency of transactions,
it must also affect the frequency

at which other prices are observed. Thus,

the structure of the information set--and hence the responsiveness of
output to

nominal shocks--will depend also on the expected or systematic rate of
inflation.

This paper was also motivated by the empirical observation that highly
volatile aggregate demand countries are also those with high average inflation

rates. Therefore, Lucas's finding that the Phillips Curve is more vertical
in those countries is also consistent
velocity of transactions.

—2—

The theoretical part of this paper discusses the proposition that expected

inflation affects the slope of the Phillips Curve in two separate sections. The
first deals with the relationship between the rate of inflation and the frequency

of transactions in a deterministic framework. The model presented in Section I
summarizes previous results related to the frequency of transactions, especially

from Barro (1970) and Grossman and Policano (1975). The purpose of this Section
is to discuss these results in a general equilibrium framewDrk in which individuals

maximize utility from consumption and leisure, given a production function, trans-

action costs and government spending financed by money issue. Agents decide how
much to produce and sell, and for how long to accumulate the resulting inflow of

cash until a shopping trip is made. In this framework, the inflation
rate determines the relative price relevant for production, which is the
current price relative to the price level at the time of the next shopping

trip. The inflation rate also affects the decision about the frequency
of the visits to the other markets. This section also derives aggregate
demand and supply and characterizes the general equilibrium.
The second section is a version of Lucas's and 3arro's (1976) localized

market models with partial information. The agents are assumed here to behave
similarily as in the deterministic model; they face a current price which is
deflated by a future (expected) price of the consumption bundle, and accumulate

cash until these goods are purchased0 In this section however, the frequency of
transactions is treated as exogenais. It is viewed as determined in a similar way

as discussed in the previous section. The focus here is on the informational
implications of the frequency of transactions and its relationship with the
responsiveness of real output to nominal shocks.

-2 a-

Section III reports empirical tests of the hypothesis that expected

inflation diminishes the effect of nominal shocks on output. A first test
uses Lucas's and Alberro's (1980) estimates of Phillips Curve coefficients

for different countries and the corresponding average inflation rates. A
second test involves times series data from the United States after World War II,

using nominal rates of return on Treasury Bills and corporate bonds as measures
of anticipated inflation and Barro's (1980) estimates of unanticipated money.
In general, the results in both tests indicate a fairly substantial
negative correlation between anticipated inflation and the coefficients
relating output to nominal shocks.

Section I.

Inflation and the Frequency of Transactions

Consider an agent producing and selling a good,or a service, whose rate of

production is a function of the input of labor. With the continuous stream
of supply, the agent accumulates cash that depreciates until it is exchanged

for consumption goods. A key assumption is that this exchange, or shopping,"
involves a cost. These transaction costs--assumed to be independent
of the amount purchased--can be viewed as the time or direct expenses involved
in traveling to other markets.

Given these costs and the rate of depreciation

of the currency, there is a tradeoff between economizing on shopping trips and
minimizing the effects of the depreciation of the currency received.
The individuals, who have infinite lives and zero rate of time preference,
maximize utility from consumption and leisure:

U =

U(C,L)

U, U1 > 0,

U, U11 <

0

C and L are the uniform, instantaneous flows of consumption and leisure respec-

tively. C can be viewed as a composite good whose components have constant
relative prices resulting from a steady state equilibrium.

The production function that expresses the relationship between the input of
labor and the rate of production and sale——which occur simultaneously--of good S is

S

(1/a) (H - L)

where a is a positive constant and H is the ceiling to the flow of labor. At
time t the individual sells S at the price P(t), which grows at the instantaneous
rate ii.

The purchasing power of the cash accumulated between two shopping

trips is

P(T+T) is the general price level at the end of the period of length T

Utility is niaximized with respect to the shopping period

and the

supply level S. The constraint that supply has a uniform level over time
is a somewhat restrictive assumption made for simplicity. In a more general
setup, the higher real return on supplying closer to the purchasing time would

induce an increasing pattern of supply between two shopping points. A corner
solution of selling only just before buying can be ruled out if it is assumed
that the marginal utility of leisure becomes extremely large as leisure approachesr
zero, and that it becomes extremely small as leisure approaches H. These

assumptions would insure a positive supply at all times, producing the same
type of tradeoff between the costs of transacting and that of holding cash.
Therefore, given the focus of the analysis here, nothing essential is lost
by adopting a uniformity constraint on S.

An additional restrictive assumption is that production and sale take

place simultaneously. With respect to services, this is no constraint. Regarding commodities one could argue that under inflationary conditions, agents
can do better by producing during the period and selling only at its end.
However, this plan would not be optimal if the act of selling also

requires the input of labor. Then, if the marginal utility from leisure
behaves as mentioned above, sales will have some dispersion over the period.
Sales close to production could be rationalized also on the basis of unincluded factors like storage costs or risk of damage, spoiling etc.'

Equation (5) means that, given S, the stream of consumption is maximized
by equalizing the marginal benefit from enlarging the shopping period,--which
reduces the transaction costs--with the marginal depreciation costs. Equation (6)
expresses the standard optimal labor supply condition that the utility from
the additional consumption obtainable by a marginal increase in labor supply

equals the marginal disutilityfrOm reducing leisure.

Since the denominators are positive from (1.9),

the signs of dT/d and dS/du

depend on the expressions in the numerators. Except for U

all the cross

derivatives are unambiguously negative. Consider first dt/dii.

If the income

effect on labor supply is stronger than the substitution effect--U5 < O-dT/di

is unambiguously negative. In this case, an increase in inflation induces
more supply, which means more cash accumulation. The depreciation costs increase and therefore agents transact sooner. This effect reinforces the

standard one expressed by Ut. Also when U

=

is unambiguously

negative. However, if the substitution effect is stronger than the income
effect--U

< 0--, the sign

of

dt/dT becomes ambiguous. It will be assumed

that in the "normal" case dT/dT is negative.

Consider now dS/dn. If U

< 0, the partial effect of iT on S is negative,

as seen before. However, dS/sii includes the offsetting term U U which
ST TIT

comes from the negative partial effect of inflation on t; when T

declines,

the relative price increases inducing more supply.2
If U

and U

are sufficiently negative, both d/d7r and d-r/dn can also

be negative. In this case, the depreciation costs have a stronger effect on
the frequency of transactions than the reduced flow of supply, and the substitution effect on supply is stronger than both the income effect and the offsetting shortening of the shopping period.

Aggregate Demand, Supply and Equilibrium.
This part of the section deals with the equilibrium of an economy composed

by individuals who behave as seen above. Given the setup used here, general
and market equilibrium conditions are the same. This discussion provides some

—9-

foundations for the specification of commodity demand adopted
in the next section.

The demand side of the commodity market is composed by those agents who
are currently in their shopping trips, and the government--which finances its

purchases by issuingnewmoney. Government services are assumed not to
affect the utility of the public. These can be seen as police or defense
services that are designed to neutralize negative effects on utility from
crime, foreign threats, etc.

The private nominal demand at time t, denoted by M(t, T), is determined

by the cash accumulated for a period of length T times the number of individuals
currently purchasing

which is a quantity theory type of equation.

Since conunoditiesandmoney are the only two goods in the model, commodity
market clearing implies equality of demand and supply of money, and vice versa.

between the frequency of transactions and the velocity of money circulation.

Section II. The frequency of transactions and the Phillips Curve
On the basis of the analysis in Section I, which dealt with expected
inflation and the frequency of transactions, this section focuses on the
informational implications of the transaction frecuency and its relationship with the effects of money movements on real output in a stochastic

environment. The framework of this discussion is a multimarket model with
partial current information of the type used by Lucas (1973) and Barro (1976)

arid incoorates the basic features of the economy discussed in section I.

In this framework, the future price level is not known with certainty

money stock. The (log of the) relative price on which supply decisions are

the last time they visited the other markets.
The importance of the trade period in this context relies primarily on

its informational implications. The more often agents visit other markets,
the more recent and relevant is the information on which they base their
expectations.

are currently in their shopping trips observe all prices. ki the other hand,
suppliers observe only the local price; their information set is the following

The most recent observation on the price level is P

which

cor-

responds to the last shopping trip. Additionally, information on all previous
prices are also obtained at that time.5 Finally, the current and past local
prices are known.
It is assumed that the trade periods of agents located in one market are

synchronized.

This assumption simplifies a great deal the computation of the

conditional expectations and the solution of the model, but it presents some

problems that are discussed later. The trade periods of producers of different commodities will in general not coincide. At each point in time
during a period of length T a different population of agents will be visiting

other markets. Thus, according to the timing of their shopping trips agents
can be classified into T groups. These groups may be seen as having the same
size because arbitrage of different real prices of the consumption bundle will
generate a uniform flow of demand.

The pattern of the coefficients of the money shocks is declining with the

length of the lag. This declining effect of money on output mirrors the
opposite effect on the price level.

Turn now to the main point in this section, which is to discuss the
effects of a change in i

on the stochastic behavior of output. Consider an

exogenous increase in the frequency of transactions from one every r periods
to

one every T-l periods. In the new equilibrium, the resulting coefficients

A formal argument to show that these inequalities hold is made in appendix B.

A general interpretation of this result is that the shorter the trade
period, agents possess--onaverage-_more recent information about the price
level and thus, they can estimate the current value of the money stock

more accurately. Hence, misperception of nominal shocks for relative
shifts is reduced, producing a more neutral effect of monetary disturbances.7
This implies a weaker correlation between money shocks and real output in
equation (22), which can be seen as an inverse Phillips Curve type of relationship.

Aggregation of Ouptut and Money Growth Over Time.
One can define also a single coefficient as the slope of the inverse

Phillips Curve by aggregating (22) over a longer period. Since i is the
length of a production and purchase of consumption goods cycle, one can
imagine the magnitude of the time unit--indexed by t--as short relative

to the basic periods empirically used to investigate output fluctuations

(e.g. a quarter or a year). Thus, it seems meaningful to define a period
of length T (T > T) and to consider the deviations of the output flow during

this longer period relative to its normal level. In percentage units, this
deviation is approximately equal to

Data across countries.

A first test of the proposition that higher inflation rates reduce the
sensitivity of output to aggregate shocks can be carried out using Lucas's
(1973, tables 1 and 2) and Alberro's (1980, table 1 and table 2--second column)
estimates of an inverted Phillips Curve coefficients and data on average infla-

tion rates and variances of nominal income across countries. First, their
results on the Lucas hypothesis can be summarized by regressing 1—-the estimate

of the Phillips Curve slope coefficients in country i--on o--the variance
of the change in nominal income in country i. Using Lucas's coefficients for
eighteen countries in the period 1952-1967 the resulting correlation is

Alberro estimated the n. coefficients for 49 countries--including the 18 in

these data is almost identical to that reported in (26)
One can test now the correlation between the estimates of the Phillips

Curve slopes and DP.--the average inflation rate in country i. Given the
Lucas hypothesis, in order to isolate a partial correlation between inflation
and the slope coefficients, the variances must be held constant. An exercise

of this type can be carried out by regressing . on both DP and

A second test of the proposition presented in this paper uses annual ti;ic

in the following: the output equation obtained by Barro (1980) is reestimated

the inflation rate anticipated at time t, and u. is a random term.

The hypothesis to be tested is whether the b coefficient is positive

and whether a1 and a2 remain positive. The

form of (27) is a linear

approximation expressing the hypothesis that the higher the expected inflation
rate, the lower the effect of the DMR-s--because they are sooner perceived

as money. To preview the results of this test, the statistical significance
of the coefficient b turns out to be very sensitive to the starting year
of the sample.

The estimation was carried out using the 3-month Treasury Bill and the
Aaa corporate bonds nominal rates of return as measures of expected inflation.
If the movements in these interest rates are caused mainly by changes in
inflationary expectations, the Treasury Bill rate represents the short term
expected inflation (Fama (1975)) and the bonds rate reflects expectations

over the more distant future. Which of these variables is more adequate
in this context may be related to the existence and importance of costs of

a short-term rate is more adequate.

If these costs are relatively high,

the transaction frequency would be affected mainly by expectations of

prolonged periods of inflation. Given no a-priori presumptiot about these
adjustment costs, the equation was estimated separately

using each one of

these interest rates. The variable used in the equations referred to in the
paper is the Treasury Bill rate, RTt,

which--from the point of view of the

theory being tested--fits somewhat better.

Assuming normally-distributed errors, the equation is estimated using
a non-linear maximum likelihood criterion. First, when the sample used
the 1946-1978 period, b turns out to be insignificantly different from

zero (see table 1, line 1). Speculating that pegging of the Treasury Bill
rates until the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of 1951 may be affecting
the validity of the interest rates as measures of expected inflation, the

equation was reestimated over the sample 1953-1978. The resulting equation

where the numbers in parenthesis are asymptotic standard errors. The coefficient
b appears herewith the expected sign and with a relatively small standard
error (t-ratio of 2.9).10
However, a closer examination indicates that the poor results obtained
in the entire 1946-1978 sample may be due mainly to the observations of 1951

and 1952, which correspond to the Korean War. If only these two observations
are deleted, the estimated b coefficient is 8.2 with a standard error of

4.1 (see table 1, line (2)). According to this result, it seems that the
pegging of the interest rate may not be the main problem that affects the
estimate of b in the 1946-1978 sample, but the Korean War years, which

correspond to a high level of government spending. Presently, I do not have

an explanation of this observation. It could be related to a misspecification

-

equation that generated the DMR-s. In any event, in the period beginning
in 1953, the negative correlation between RT and the effect of the DMR-s
on output is fairly substantial.

I also found interesting to examine whether this correlation has anything
to do with the oil price shock, which is accompanied by the highest RT value
in the sample-- .079 in 1974. To do that, equation (28) was reestimated over
the sample interrupted in 1973, and then again deleting only the observations

of 1974 and 1975. Both equations--reported in table 1, lines (4) and (5)-show an even stronger negative effect of RT on the coefficients of the money

shocks than that appearing in equation (28). This suggests that the effect
showing in equation (28) is not related to the oil price shock but, on the
contrary, is somewhat obscured by

it.

—31-

Concluding Remarks

This paper examined the effects of expected inflation on the reponsivefleSS

of output to nominal disturbances. The mechanism

described in sections I and II

is that expected inflation has a positive effect on the transaction frequency,

which in turn increases the flow of price information across markets. More
information implies less misperception of monetary

shocks as relative shifts in

excess demand, resulting in lower sensitivity of real output to these shocks.
The empirical implication of this proposition__namely,

that expected infla-

tion reduces the coefficient of nominal shocks in an output equation--was tested
first using data across countries, and then with time series data for the United

States. Overall the results in both tests provide support for this hrnlica-

tion of the theory. The interpretation of these results as supporting the
specific mechanism described in the first two sections is related to two

critical assumptions First, as in the equilibrium business cycles litcrature,
to which this analysis is an extension, the model involves the assumption that
agents cannot observe the current value of the money stock. If its value is
contemporaneously known, the frequency of price observations--and the money

shocks--does not have any effect on output. Secondly, the analysis excluded
earning assets. Anticipated inflation does not have to affect the transaction
frequency in the commodity markets if there are assets whose return is associated

with anticipated inflation. However, this effect may still exist if financial
transactions costs preclude agents from using these assets between shopping trips,
or if the nominal return on the available assets is, for some reason, sluggish to

shifts in the inflation rates.

Summarizing, the theoretical mechanism described in the paper seems
consistent with the empirical results, which indicate a substantial negative
correlation between anticipated or average inflation rates and the effect of
nominal disturbances on output.

1Storing costs would affect also the behavior of the individual as a

consumer. The higher these costs the lower the optimal stock of consumption
goods, implying a shorter transactions period.

2Thjs effect involves only substitution because at the maximum
aC/aT = 0

3The discussion abstracts from the effects of differential cash flows
accruing to different agents on their trade cycles.
4This assumption may be seen as unrealistic in the present context, since

the length of the time unit is short. However, I do not believe that the
results would be affected by introducing serial correlation in m.
5lmagine each current price posted above the crossed price of last
period.

is assumed that production in these agents' markets continues at

that time. Imagine a shopper-spouse visiting other markets while the

producer-spouse continues producing in the local market.
7At this point it is appropriate to return and discuss the assumption
made earlier, that all agents in one market follow symchronized transaction

cycles. This specification has the undesired implication that individual
prices do not follow a smooth pattern--as the average price level does. At
the time of the shopping trip, the local price jumps due to the change in

the relevant price deflator from Pt to t+T A more appropriate specification
would be to allow producers in one location to shop at scattered dates. I do
not believe, however, that the results for the aggregate economy in this case

would differ qualitatively from those obtained here. With scattered shopping
trips, agents can learn from the local price something about the price obser-

vations of others. However, given the unobserved relative shock c(z), they

still have the problem of estimating the relative and nominal shocks

affecting the local price. The confusion between nominal and real shocks
in this case will also diminish when the transaction frequency increases
because agents will be able to infer more about the money shocks0
8For Uruguay the period is 1958-1972.
9As in Alberro's calculations, Indonesia was excluded from the sample.

If Indonesia is included, the coefficient of DP. remains positive and

significant--with a higher t-ratio--but the coefficient of .still positive,
becomes statistically significant.

Using actual inflation, b turns out to be insignificantly

different from zero.
