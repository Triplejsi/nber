The Role of Money Supply Shocks in the
Short-Run Demand for Money
ABSTRACT

Previous models of the demand for money are either inconsistent with
contemporaneous adjustment of the price level to expected changes in the
nominal money supply or imply implausible fluctuations in interest rates

in response to unexpected changes in the nominal money supply. This paper
proposes a shock-absorber model of money demand in which money supply
shocks affect the synchronization of purchases and sales of assets and so
engender a temporary desire to hold more or less money than would other-

wise be the case. Expected changes in nominal money do not cause fluctuations in real money inventories. The model is simultaneously estimated for
the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
and the Netherlands using the postwar quarterly data set and instruments

used in the Mark III International Transmission Model. The shock-absorber
variables significantly improve the estimated short-run money demand functions in every case.

Existing models of the demand for money are either inconsistent with

nominal money supply or imply implausible

fluctuations in interest rates in

superior empirically for the

eight industrial countries used in our tests.

Alternative Adjustment Models

Partial adjustment models are almost universally adopted in analysis
of money demand applied to quarterly data. This is so because the effect
of changes in real income and interest rates appear to be much smaller in

the first quarter than in the long-run)
The usual approach was proposed by Chow (1966) who argued that a change
in the determinants of the long-run demand for money would lead to a change
in real money balances in the current quarter which is a fraction of the
difference real long-run money demand and lagged real money balances.

In

logarithmic form this is:

mt-mti=A(mt-mti)

(1)

where mt is the logarithm of real money balances in period t and m is the
logarithm of the long—run desired quantity in period t.2 The short-run demand for money is therefore

mt=Xm+(1_X)mti

(2)

That is, short-run money demand is a (geometric) average of the long-run
desired quantity and lagged real money.

Although conceived for analysis of changes in the long-run desired
quantity of real money, the model also works well for expected changes in

the nominal money supply. A number of recent articles3 have demonstrated
that expected changes in the nominal money supply are neutral in the sense
that the price level and other nominal variables move proportionately while

real variables are unaffected.4 Thus neither m nor mt_i will change due
to an expected change in the nominal money supply, and real money will be
unchanged since
mtEF.lt_Pt

(3)

3

where Mt and

are the logarithms of the nominal money supply and price

level, respectively, and Mt and Pt increase equally. Thus the Chow model
is consistent with contemporaneous changes in expected nominal money and
the price level.

The Chow model does not seem to work so well in the case of nominal

money supply shocks.5 If M is the expected logarithm of the nominal money
supply, the money supply shock or innovation is defined as

MtMt_M*t
Money supply shocks do not have the neutral properties of expected changes.
Recent empirical research can be summarized as showing that a money supply

shock will have relatively little contemporaneous effect on the price level
but will instead increase real income and reduce interest rates via the

liquidity effect. But if the impact effect on

of

0.1, then the impact effect on m must be at least

is no more than say

That is an unex-

pected increase (decrease) in the nominal money supply of 1 percent would
be associated with an increase (decrease) in real money of at least 0.9 per-

cent. To stay on the short-run money demand function (2), long-run desired
balances must increase by 0.9/A percent, and estimated values of A rarely

exceed 0.1 for quarterly data. To achieve even a 9 percent change in
requires implausible changes in real income and interest rates.

We can illustrate this by reference to a simple Cagan (1956) long-run
money demand function:
mta0+ct1 ,t+a2 Rt

where

(5)

is the logarithm of real income, and Rt the nominal interest rate.

Using a short-term interest rate for Rt estimates of

An 80 percent decrease in the interest rate in response to a 1 percent unexpected increase in money strikes us as an implausibly large first quarter
liquidity effect.9
In summary, the Chow model works well with respect to chançies in the deter-

minants of long-run money demand or expected changes in the nominal money
supply.

It is unsatisfactory as an explanation of short-run money demand in

quarters in which money supply shocks occur.

Further the Goldfeld form has a peculiar nonneutrality with respect to ex-

pected changes in the nominal money supply: Equation (7) can be solved as

mt=Xm+(1X)mt,(1A)(Pt-Pt1)

(9)

5

Thus the Goldfeld model is identical to the Chow formulation except for the

addition of the term -(l-x)(Pt_Pti). This deduction of —(1—A) times the quar-

terly
rate

inflation rate is in addition to any effects operating via the interest

and implies that people will never catch on to an expected inflation

when it comes to adjusting their cash holdings. Thus the Goldfelcl approach
seems less satisfactory than the Chow approach on two counts.

6

II. The Shock-Absorber Model
One of the authors (Darby, 1972) has previously proposed that money balances serve as a shock absorber or buffer stock which temporarily absorbs
unexpected variations in income (transitory income) until the portfolio of

securities and consumers' durable goods can be conveniently adjusted. A
similar response would seem reasonable for the portfolio shock engendered by

unexpected changes in the nominal money supply. If the Fed increases the
nominal money supply by an open market operation, the initial impact on the
price of Treasury bills will quickly spread to the prices of other securities.
In the process, individual investors will find that they cannot obtain their
expected yield from their planned portfolio and will take some time to choose

an alternative portfolio, incidentally holding larger average balances. Others
will find that they sell assets --

stocks,

houses, cars --

quicker

than ex-

pected at their reservation price and have larger average balances. Credit
availability will be greater also, and loans will be approved more quickly and

more frequently with temporary increases in money balances. Of course for
each individual the temporary increases may be brief, but as the changes are

quite general the aggregate effect can be large. The process can be reversed
for unexpected decreases in the nominal money supply, with unexpectedly low
asset prices, slow sales, and restricted credit availability causing individuals to temporarily dip into their cash reserves.

In summary, money supply shocks will affect the synchronization of purchases
and sales of assets and so engender a temporary desire to hold more or less
money than would otherwise be the case.12 This indeed is one of the basic functions of money, much discussed in undergraduate classes, but not previously

7

included in aggregate demand functions. Whether this effect is important is
an empirical question to be examined in Section III.
Our discussion suggests two modifications to the basic Chow mechanism:

(1) addition of a transitory income term and (2) addition of a money supply

shock term. The shock-absorber version of the Chow mechanism is thus:
(10)

where y is logarithmic transitory income (y1

'-

y where y is the

logarithm of real permanent income).'3 Our preferred long-run money demand
function is

(11)

Combining (10) and (11) we get the estimating equation
(12)

The reduced form differs from that of equations (2) and (5) only in allowing
for different effects of the permanent and transitory components of real in-

come and in the addition of the money supply shock term.
Under the Chow model, f=O while under our alternative hypothesis

If

equation (11) is the true long-run money demand function, then 1=0 under the

Chow hypothesis and >0under the shock absorber model. But in fact the true
long-run money demand function might weight transitory income anywhere between

O [equation (li)j and the weight of permanent income [equation (5)]. So the

Chow hypothesis is 0<zxy. and the shock absorber hypothesis is 0<. A
which falls in the overlapping region O<<Ay1 does not distinguish between the
two hypotheses.

Before going on to the empirical estimates, we should note another, possibly complementary reason why money supply shocks might enter the short-run

money demand function. Suppose, following Barro and Santomero (1972) and

8

Klein (1974), that the long-run money demand function should include both the

short-term interest rate Rt and the implicit yield on the bank deposit portion

of money, R1. Because banks pay interest on deposits in hidden ways for legal
reasons, R' is not observable. However there is anecdotal evidence that the
implicit rate is sticky in the sense of being slow to adjust to changes in

If we consider R as an omitted variable and apply standard specification analysis,15 the coefficient of Mt would have an expectedvalue equal to its own
value plus the product of the coefficient of R1 and the coefficient of it in

the auxiliary regression of R on the variables included in the estimated money
demand function. Now if a positive money shock causes Rt to drop relative to
R, the auxiliary-regression coefficient will be positive as is the coefficient

of R. So positive weight may be given to

as a proxy for R in addition to

any effect due to a pure shock-absorber effect.

9

III. Empirical Tests
In this section we estimate the shock-absorber money demand equation
(12) and test (a) whether the coefficient of transitory income differs significantly from both 0 and the coefficient of permanent income and especially
(b) whether the coefficient of the money supply shock is significantly greater

than zero. This raises two major econometric difficulties: simultaneity bias
and estimation of the money supply shock M.

Simultaneity bias arises because y, R, y, and

are all determined

simultaneously with mt and so are likely correlated with the stochastic disturbance in (12).

In particular, to the extent that the monetary authority

is passive in its monetary policy a positive value of the real money demand
disturbance will induce an unexpected increase in the nominal money supply.
This would induce a positive bias in the coefficient of Mt if equation (12)

were estimated by ordinary least squares. Similarly transitory income may
be affected by the stochastic disturbance in (12) as well as by the money

shock which could result in additional bias to both coefficients. To avoid
this sort of bias, we must use a simultaneous equation method in the context
of a model in which the simultaneously determined variables are endogenous.
The Mark III International Transmission Model developed as part of the NBERNSF Project on the International Transmission of Inflation fits the bill

nicely and permits us to test the equation for eight major countries.6
In the Mark III model ,

the

expected logarithm of the nominal money supply

(that is, M) is based on a univariate ARIMA process. This definition was
found to work better (in terms of fit, coefficients, and autocorrelation of
residuals) in the behavioral equations of the model than alternative formulations based on transfer functions including all lagged variables in the central

bank's money supply reaction function. A rationalization of this apparent

limitation

on the information set would involve costs of acquiring and proces-

sing information.17 We did check that the results do not change substantially

10

from those reported below when the transfer function definition of M is
used

18

David Laidler (1979) used Barro's definition of M in a new compara-

tive study of money demand functions also with similar results.'9

Table 1 presents instrumental variable estimates of equation (12) for
the eight countries in the Mark III model (the United States, United Kingdom,

Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands). All estimates
are for the entire period 19571-19761V for which all required variables are

available in the NBER International Transmission Data Bank. Permanent income
is estimated using the method in Darby (1974) with a current quarter weight

of 0.025.20 The instruments used are the (approximately 25) principal components for each country which span the predetermined domestic variables

and fitted foreign variables in the country's submodel. For comparison,
Table 2 presents OLS estimates of the equations which are virtually identical
except that the estimated coefficients of

do appear to be biased upward to

an extent in the OLS estimates.

Examining the results in Table 1, we see that the money shock variable
enters consistently as predicted by the shock absorber model with a coeffi-

cient between 0.6 and 1.2. The coefficient of transitory income is not very
precisely estimated and exceeds that of permanent income in only three
cases --

significantly

so only for the United States. Perhaps this

reflects the greater movements in U.S. transitory income in the sample

period. Alternatively, the Darby (1972) estimates of a very strong transitory income effect on money demand may have been due to spurious correlation

with the there-omitted money supply shock. As a whole these results are
consistent with the shock-absorber model of equation (12), particularly as

to the importance of including the money-supply shock term. Figure 1 compares
the actual values of mt with the fitted values based on the Table 1 regressions
for benefit of eyeball econometricians.

11

A problem with these results, as with most if not all applications of
the Chow model, is that positive autocorrelation in the residuals biases

the estimated value of A toward zero. Using Durbin's h to test for such
autocorrelation in the presence of a lagged dependent variable, we find
significant and positive autocorrelation for all countries except the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Canada (which is nearly sionificantly neqative).
We would like to correct for this autocorrelation to confirm that this does
not affect the results.

In principle, a generalization of Fair's (1970)

method for first-order autocorrelation in simultaneous equation systems

could be used. But the TROLL system uses an inconsistent method of combining
instrumental variables and generalized least squares (GLS) methods which
apparently heightens the bias of A toward 0 without any appreciable effect

on the estimates or t-values of the Mt coefficient. Table 3 reports instead
straight GLS estimates for which there is some upward bias on the Mt coefficients.

The estimated coefficients of

are little chanqed. Apparently

the near-orthogonality of the money-shock variable to the other explanatory
variables makes it little affected by bias due to autocorrelation of the
residuals.

We note that we have only an imperfect measure of the division of

nominal money into its anticipated and unanticipated components. Thus, our
Mt variable is measured with error and this would generally2' bias downward

its estimated coefficient. Whether this bias is greater or less than the
upward simultaneous—equation bias which we detected is impossible to say.

12

IV.

Sumary

and Conclusions

We have argued that money supply shocks cause unexpected variations in
yields, asset prices, and credit availability which induce a temporary sympa-

thetic movement in the short-run demand for money. Failure to allow for such
movement requires very large movement in prices, real income, and interest

rates as compared to typical reduced form estimates. We find that a simple
amendment to the popular Chow short-run money demand function produces a shock
absorber model which works well in explaining short-run money demand for eight

industrial countries. We believe that inclusion of such a variable in the
money demand equation of a modern macroeconometric model is necessary to
obtain reasonable price level behavior.

22

A policy implication of our shock-absorber model is that money-supply
shocks will induce smaller interest rate fluctuations than implied by the
Fed's model so that policymakers need have less concern over interest rate
implications of a monetary policy couched in terms of monetary aggregates.

FOOTNOTES

*The authors wish to acknowledge helpful comments from Phillip Cagan,
Edgar Feige, Michael Hamburger, Benjamin Klein, David Laidler, Richard Roll,
Ernest Tanner, Alan Walters, an anonymous referee, and participants in money

workshops at the Ohio State University and UCLA. Michael T. Melvin and
Andrew A. Vogel provided able research assistance. Darby's research was
supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation, Scaife
Family Trusts, Alex C. Walker Foundation and Reim Foundation., This is not
an official report of the National Bureau of Economic Research.
1An alternative explanation would attribute this phenomenon to money demand being a function of permanent income and permanent interest rates; see

Feige (1967) and Laidler (1977, pp. 142-48). However lagged adjustment still
appears to be present when permanent income is used as an income variable.
2lhere should also be a term for normal planned growth, but this is de
facto captured in empirical estimates by the constant in the function explain-

ing m.
3Most notably Lucas (1973), Sargent and Wallace (1975), and Barro (1977,
1978).

4We are abstracting here from possible effects on interest rates from

changes in the expected growth rate of the nominal money supply. See Darby
(1979, pp. 134-138, 207-213) for a discussion of real effects in the nonsuperneutral case.

5As early as 1967, Alan Walters observed that the aggregate nominal
money supply was fixed by the central bank and that the Chow model could be
interpreted as a model of price adjustment to nominal money supply changes.

22

Artis arid Lewis (1976), Lewis (1978), and Jonson (1976) also considered

money demand functions in the context of adjustment to changes in the

aggregate nominal money supply. Quite understandably, these authors did
not see the importance of distinguishing between expected money supply
changes and money supply shocks.

6Barro's (1978) equation (9) indicates an impact effect of

on Pt of

0.26, but this is for annual data. Estimates of the first-quarter effect are
much smaller.

7The estimated values of A, a1, and a2Rt do vary somewhat in the literature,

but this is much less true for

culated below depends. For example, a high estimate of A will be offset

liquidity effect.

'3in Darby (1972), transitory income was measured as real dollars per

annum rather than as a fraction of permanent income as here. The earlier
measure was more natural for the shock-absorber effect but required a linear

money demand function and iterative estimation techniques. The present version should serve nearly as well but the coefficients should be divided by
the mean income velocity for comparison with the 1972 estimates.
14See for example Barro and Santomero's discussion (1972, p. 399) of
the infrequency of change in service charge remission rates.
'5See Theil (1971, pp. 549-550).
'6See Darby and Stockman (1979).
17See Darby (1976) and Feige and Pearce (1976).

18These results are available from the authors on request.
'9We may perhaps be forgiven for noting that our formulation won Laidler's
race hands down.

amounts to a real interest rate of 10 percent per annum, compounded
quarterly.

21But not necessarily in a multiple regression context.

Barro (1978, pp. 568-571) relied instead on the transitory income aspect
of the shock-absorber model to obtain consistent price level behavior. But
we saw that this is relatively unimportant compared to the money shock effect.
