The Relation of Stock Prices to Corporate Earnings
Adjusted for Inflation

ABSTRACT

The effects of inflation adjustments of corporate earnings on market prices
were tested by cross section regressions of 485 manufacturing companies for the

period 1966—76 and subperiods. The basic data were company reports and stock
prices.

For the full period, market prices reflected the inventory valuation adjustment and the decline in real value of net financial liabilities fairly completely,
but they relfected the adjustment for the understatement of depreciation to only

a small extent. The surprisingly low effect of the depreciation adjustment could
only be partly attributed to measurement error, but not entirely.
The estimated effect of capital gains on stock prices was either in the
wrong direction or negligible.
The implication of the results is that market investors use a range of
adjustments for the effects of inflation which differs from the estimates used
in this study, though how and why they differ is not clear.
The adjustments were much lower in the later period 1972—76 than in the

earlier period 1966—71. This seemed inconsistent with the higher inflation
rates in the later period. The explanation for the difference is not clear,
but it may reflect the difficulties of judging the size of the adjustments
in a period of rapid inflation.

The Relation of Stock Prices to
Corporate Earnings Adjusted for Inflation
Phillip Cagan*

Outline of the Study
The continuing and rising rates of inflation since the mid-1960s have created an increasing discrepancy between corporate earnings as they are reported and as they would be reported if adjusted for inflation. Numerous studies
have pointed to such discrepancies, and various accounting changes to elimin-

ate them have been discussed and proposed. Some changes have already occurred.

Many

firms

have switched to lifo inventory accounting which avoids the mislead-

ing profits of the fifo method. To cornply.with new SEC regulations, many firms

beginning

with 1976 have reported the replacement cost of capital. Some are re-

porting the decline in real value of debt. In general, however, the published
adjustments for the effects of inflation on corporate earnings are far from
complete.
Rough adjustments for the effects of inflation on corporate earnings can
be made from reported figures. Insofar as investors make use of available information to assess corporate earnings adjusted for inflation, stock prices
would tend to reflect these 'true" earnings as distinct from the reported earnings. This study tests the extent of such market adjustments. The test is made
by

ing

regressing

changes in the market value of a cross section of 485 manufactur-

companies on

their

reported earnings and the various adjustments for infla-

tion that investors could make from published reports. The period covered is
1966 to 1976. Company data were taken from the Compustat tapes and stock prices
from the University of Chicago CRISP tapes. The adjustments were for changes in
the general purchasing power of the dollar based on the implicit price index of
gross domestic product from the national income and product accounts. A supplementary adjustment based on

specific

price in-

—2-

dexes for individual products was made only for inventories

Inflation Adjustments

The adjustments for inflation were the following:
1) Depreciation adjustment. Conventional accounting practices based on
historical costs understate the current value of capital and, as a consequence,

current depreciation charges are too low and lead to an overstatement of net
earnings. (Although accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, permitted partly
as a consequence of inflation, may offset the overstatement or even lead to an
understatement of net earnings at times, it is generally not used in reporting
earnings to stockholders and the public.) The appropriate adjustment requires

revaluation of the capital stock. The revaluation in this study, as noted, is
made according to an index of general prices rather than the specific current
value of capital goods. The revalued (net) stock is multiplied by an annual depreciation rate to give the depreciation cost. The rate used is the average ratio
of depreciation to net plant and equipment reported by each company. (A depreciation rate of one-eighteenth, based on an average life of capital of 18 years

used in the national income and product acconts of the BEA and on straight-line
depreciation charges, was also tried and proved less successful.) The difference
between our estimate of depreciation and the reported amount is the depreciation

adjustment, representing an extra cost per year because the reported figure is
understated by inflation. This cost is a deduction from reported earnings and
implies a lower market value of the firm.

2) Inventory valuation adjustment. Production costs can be understated when
materials used, which were purchased at an earlier time, are valued at original
costs that are below replacement costs. The degree of understatement depends on
the accounting method followed. By fifo and the average cost methods, inventory
profits due to inflation can be substantial whereas by- the lifo method they are

zero as long as inventory stocks are rising. Under lifo special calculations have

-3-

to be made when inventories are declining. The inventory valuation adjustment
is an estimate of the amount by which reported earnings are overstated by the
inventory accounting method used. Such a deduction from reported earnings implies
a lower market value of the firm.

3) Decline in real value of net financial liabilities. Inflation depreciates the real value of claims fixed in dollar terms. Corporations gain a real
return insofar as they are net debtors, as most nonfinancial corporations are.
Their liabilities fixed in dollar terms generally exceed the comparable assets
in the form of cash and receivables. To the extent that interest payments are
higher in recognition of the inflationary depreciation of debt, the deduction of
interest payments from earnings gives rise to a misleading understatement of
earnings if the corresponding gain is not recognized and allowed for in the
calculation of earnings. Even if a company has not had to borrow at the higher
interest rates brought about by inflation, and although the corporation receives
no cash inflow year by year from the decline in real value of debt, the decline
is an implicit addition year by year to its earnings.

When market interest rates rise as a result of higher infJation or any
other reason, outstanding bonds decline in dollar market value. This change in
market value of bonds is an additional adjustment of the current-dollar value
of net worth, beyond the decline in real value of the face value of the bonds.
It is not specifically an inflation adjustment, however, and has been omitted
in this study. Changes in market value are ordinarily reversed in subsequent
years as the bonds return to their par value at maturity.
4) Capital gain. Inflation increases the dollar value of capital equipment
and inventories. The dollar capital gain is calculated as the change in market
value of fixed capital and inventories over the period. The capital gain is not
realized (unless the equipment is sold), but it adds to net worth,
since

usable capital and inventories are worth more in current market value

than was paid for them.
For inventories the capital gain applies to the unused stock, while the

-4-

inventory valuation adjustment pertains to the stock used up in production.
The two are correlated, but not highly.

For fixed capital,

however, there is a high correlation. Consider a simple example of capital purchased at the beginning of the year for $100 and 5 percent inflation (ignoring
capital purchased during the year). If the depreciation rate is 10 percent,

historical-cost depreciation for the year is $10. The revalued capital stQck

at the end of the year is $105 and current-value depreciation is l0.S0. The
depreciation adjustment is $0.50. The capital gain is the rise in value of
the end-of-year capital, that is, 5 percent of $90 or S4.50. The two adtustments
are proportional to the inflation rate and the capital stock. The proportions
will not move similarly from year to year, of course, because the depreciation
adjustment reflects the cumulative effect of past inflation, while the capital
gain depends on the current inflation rate. But they tend to be highly correlaamong companies.
ted! Statistical problems due to this multicollinearity are noted later.
Appendix A gives details of the derivation of these adjustments.

Framework of the Statistical Analysis

The main criterion for the form of the regression equations is that the
inflation adjustments appear as independent variables and be arithmetically additive to reported earnings. The form chosen relates the change in market value
of net worth to components of the change in net worth. The current-value of net
worth is increased by issues of equity, capital gain, and retained earnings after
adjusting for the understatement of depreciation and inventory costs and the omission of decline in real debt.

The variables are measured as follows: The dependent variable of the regressions is the change in market value minus equity issues; it represents changes
in the market's valuation of the equity owners' share in the company. Equity

issues (El) are the reported change in the book value of common equity excluding total retained earnings during the period.

The change in market

-5-

value of the common stock is the price per share times the number of shares
outstanding at the end of the period (Mt) minus the value at the beginning of
the period (Mt_i). Retained earnings are reported earnings during the period
minus dividends. (Extraordinary income items have been excluded; they are usually small, and the exclusion has little effect on the results.) The inflation
adjustments to the reported changes in net worth from retained earnings are
as described previously.

Note that the regression equation relates changes in the markets valuation of the company between years t-n and t to the cumulated flow of adjusted
retained earnings during the intervening n years, rather than the level of the
market value to earnings. If the variation in price-earnings ratios among companies
reflects differences in expected future earnings, changes in prices will reflect
(largely random) changes in expectations and increases in capital which generate future earnings. If the first of these effects on prices is more variable
among companies than is the second, as seems plausible to me, the relation between changes in market value and in net worth will be more comparable among
companies than price-earnings ratios are.

All the above variables are expressed as percentages of the initial market value of the firm to allow for size differences among companies. Various
other variables were added to the regressions to test for particular influences,
as discussed later.

The basic regression equation may be written as follows:

where the dependent variable was defined above, RE is reported retained ordinary

and
DRD decline in real debt,/CG capital gain (or loss). The a's are regression coefficients, assumed constant across companies. Eighteen dummy variables were added
to the regressions to allow for differences in the constant term among industries.

-6-

They were generally not significant and did not materially alter the results.

Dummy variables for industry differences in the regression coefficients, which
would reflect differences in the expected rate of return on capital, were not
used. (The distribution of the sample by industries is shown in Appendix Table A.)
The contribution of retained earnings to net worth is dollar for dollar;

hence, if the change in market value were strictly based on the current change in
net worth, a1 would be unity. In most of the statistical results it is greater
than unity. This can be explained by companies in which unexpected increases in
earnings raise the market valuation of net worth. For these companies the earnings produce a more than proportional increase in market value. We can partially
nullify this effect by dividing the variables by average market value during the
period, as is .done later, instead of by the initial market value.

The ratios of the other coefficients to a1 show how completely the market
value of the common stock reflects the various inflation adjustments of earnings.

When a1 is greater than unity, we may expect the other coefficients to be proportionately higher on the argument that a magnified market valuation of net worth
reflects unexpected changes in ?Itrueu

rather

than reported earnings (though for

capital gain the argument is less clear). On any other interpretation, many of
the estimated adjustments, which turn out to be greater than unity though less
than a1, would be inconsistent with their hypothesized effects. A ratio to a1
of plus or minus unity would be a theoretically complete adjustr.rtt,

no adjustment. As the variables are defined, a2 and

and zero

should be negative (IVA

is measured as a positive quantity), and a4 and a5 positive.
Statistical Results

The full period 1966-76
Table 1 presents regression results for 1966-76, the full period for which
the data were compiled. The dependent variable is the change in market value
(excluding new equity issues) from the beginning to the end of the period,1 and

the independent variables are the cumulated sum of earnings and adjustments
during the period. The period for each company is dated by the end of its fiscal

year, so the beginning and ending dates of the period differ among companies.2
In equations 1 and 2 of Table 1, reported earnings are highly significant,

and the three adjustments of reported earnings are significant in the expected
direction. (The value of t at the .05 level of significance for a one-tail test
is 1.67.) The addition of industry dummy variables reduces the size and signi-

ficance of the depreciation adjustment and leaves the other coefficients essentially the same. The constant term gives the average percentage change in market
value after allowing for the adjusted change in earnings. The regressions explain
about half of the variation in the change in market value among the companies.
Reported retained earnings have a coefficient greater than unity, which
overstates their contribution to current net worth. As suggested above, a coefficient above unity can be attributed to the effect of unexpected changes in
earnings on the market value of net worth. Compared with the coefficient for reported earnings, the other coefficients are smaller, which implies that the ad-

justments of earnings for inflation are incomplete. In equations 1 and 2 the
market's recognition of the depreciation adjustment is only about a tenth to
a fifth of being complete,3 that of IVA is about a half, and of the decline in
real debt is about a third. The implication is that part of the market does not
make these adjustments or discounts their importance. Certainly such adjustments
are subject to considerable measurement error, and investors know it.

The coefficient of capital gain in equations 3 and 4 is statistically sig-

nificant but has a negative sign, which makes no sense because capital gain
should increase the dollar net worth of the companies. Its inclusion affects
the

the other coefficients as well, reducing that of/depreciation adjustment practically to zero and doubling that of the decline in real debt. There is considerable multicollinearity between capital gain and these variables (see Appendix
Table D).

It is not inconceivable that the market ignores capital gain in valutng
company equity, but that does not explain a negative coeffici:ënt. Capital gain

appears to be proxying for other extraneous influences. Other variables were
added to the regressions to capture these influences and are reported later.

None was_successful in reducing the significance of the negative coefficient
of

capital gain for the full period. As shown below, however, capital gain is

insignificant in

regressions excluding lifo companies and for the earlier and

-9-

later subperiods (Table 2, below). This is consistent with a possible explanation
suggested to me by William Brainard. The increase in the rate of inflation from
the earlier to the later years produced a rising capital gain and also indicated
a rising level of corporate taxes, not all of which yet affected current-period
retained earnings. Hence capital gain may have correlated inversely with a depressing effect of the rising level of taxes (and perhaps other inflation effects) on
market value. Since most of the effect of inflation on corporate taxes probably
became fully evident by the beginning of the later subperiod, the negative effect
of capital gain could have been significant between the subperiods, yet could have
been cancelled by its positive effect on net worth and therefore insignificant
within the subperiods.4
However capital gain should be interpreted, its questionable role in these
regressions and its multicollinearity with the other variables suggest that
the effects of the latter should be judged from the regressions omitting capital
gain.

In equations 5-7 the companies that used the lifo accounting method for
inventories in any year (for which the IVA is zero by definition except when

inventories are declining) have been omitted. The cofficient of capital gain
becomes insignificant and, with the industry dummies, practically zero. The
coefficients of IVA and decline in real debt are larger for the non-lifo sample
and are comparable in size to the coefficient for reported earnings, indicating
a more or less complete adjustment in the market to these two effects of inflation. The enhanced effect of IVA in these regressions seems to suggest that the
market viewed the lifo IVA of zero as too small (error in the IVA variable could

have reduced the estimated coefficient). This is possible, because many companies using lifo as principal accounting method did not apply it to all inventories, though it was assumed here that they did. But the large number of companies excluded (almost half the full sample) may also affect the results, so

that less confidence can be placed in the estimates for the non-lifo comDanies
compared with those for the full sample.

-10-

In summary, so far as the results in Table 1 for the full period are con-

cerned, the adjustments for IVA and decline in real debt are large and that for
the depreciation adjustment is small. Capital gain does not show the hypothesized
positive effect on market value, and it may be proxying for other influences.
Subperiods

The two subperiods in Table 2 present surprising differences.

The results for the earlier period 1966-71 are consistent with those for
the full period in Table 1 and even closer to what might be expected. In particular, the coefficient of the depreciation adjustment is significant in all
the equations and that of capital gain, though of the wràng sign, is uniformly
insignificant. Relative to the size of the coefficient for reported earnings,
the adjustment for depreciation is a quarter, and those for IVA and decline in
real debt are a half, of being complete.

The results for the later period 1972-76, in which we might expect the
effects of adjustments for inflation to be stronger, are practically the opposite; most of the coefficients have the wrong sign and are insignificant. The

coefficient for the depredation adjustment is practTcally zero, that for IVA
is (incorrectly) positive though insignificant, and that for decline in real
debt is (incorrectly) negative yet significant. The coefficient for capital
gain, though (correctly) positive, is practically zero. Based on these results,
the adjustments did not occur in the later period 1972-76.

Multicollinearity among the independent variables does not explain the different results for the two subperiods. As shown in Table 3, the intercorrelations
for the two periods are very similar. In particular, the high positive correlation
between capital gain and the depreciation and debt variables occurs in both subperiods.

It was noted above that unexpected changes in earnings could correlate positively with market revaluations of net worth to give a coefficient greater than

for retained earnings. A related problem is that the market reportedly

paid more attention to the dangers of large debt outstanding in the later period.
If so, a negative correlation could be created between. the decline in real debt

and the change in market value, reversing the positive effect of the decline in
real debt as an inflation adjustment. In this case, given the high intercorrela-

tion between the adjustment for real debt decline and those for depreciation
and IVA, the latters' coefficients could be affected by a major change in the
coefficient for real debt decline.

Table 4 presents evidence that this indeed is the explanation for the
sign reversals in the later .period and part of the explanation for a1 being

greater than unity. In Table 4 the variables are all divided by the average
market value during the period instead of the initial value, as in the other

tables. The rationale for using average market value is that it will include
changes that reflect unexpected developments after the period begins, which are
then partly or fully cancelled out of the dependent variable. The dependent

variable thus tends to reflect mainly continuing changes over the period (such
as retained earnings produce) and less once-and-for-all changes (such as unexpected developments produce).

In Table 4 the coefficient of retained earnings is essentially unity for
the full period and closer to unity though still above in the earlier period
(significantly) and below in the later period (not significantly). Coeffici:ënt

signs in the later period (as well as earlier) are correct as inflation adjustments except for capital gain.

Based on the regressions omitting capital gain, the market's recognition
of IVA is complete in the earlier period and half complete in the later period,
of decline in real debt is two-thirds complete in the earlier period and half
in the later, and of depreciation adjustment is two-thirds complete in the earlier period but only one-seventh in the later. Table 4 gives the most sensible

results obtained in this study, and they show (as do the other regressions) in-

complete and weaker effects for the inflation adjustments in the later period.
An interpretation of these results is presented in the final section.

Reported replacement cost data for 1976
Further evidence on the depreciation adjustment is provided by the replacement cost data separately reported by many companies for the first time
for 1976 in accordance with new SEC regulations. About half the companies in
our sample reported such data for net plant and equipment and its depreciation.
For these companies we can compare the reported depreciation on a replacement
cost basis with our estimates of depreciation based on current-value net capital stock according to a general price index and multiplied by the reported
depreciation rate (that is, the ratio of historical cost depreciation to net
plant and equipment).

The correlations are shown in Table 5. The correlation is high, but the

regression coefficients and constant terms indicate considerable difference
in magnitudes. For depreciation the constant term is negligible so that market
value in the denominator on both sides of the equation cancels, implying that
our estimates are on average 21 percent greater than the company estimates.
For capital stock, multiplying through the equation by market value, our estimates of capital are 119 percent of company estimates plus 70 percent of market
value. This points to nonlinearity in the relationship. The differences are presumably attributable to the fact that the companies reported the current cost

of the same capacity output, allowing for the benefit of quality improvements
in equipment and technology. Such current-value costs of the same capacity •are

notoriously subject to inaccuracies. It is not clear which estimates of real
depreciation the market relies on. Since estimates based on a general price index are not a bad proxy for the reported replacement cost depreciation as indicated by the correlation coefficient, but may be high as indicated by the regression coefficient, this would suggest that our estimates of the depreciation

adjustment are too low.

A comparison of the effect of the two estimates for 1976 is given in
Table 6. Capital gain here is

based on

our estimate of the capital stock,

since most companies did not report a replacement cost figure for 1975 on which
we

could

derive the capital gain. Equations 1 and 2 show that both depreciation

adjustments have an incorrect positive coefficient. Icith capital gain included

in equations 3 and 4, howeVer, the adjustment based on company estimates has
the correct negative coefficient, .

though it is not significant, whereas the

adjustment based on our estimates is essentially zero. Also, in equation 4
capital gain has a large positive and significant coefficient. Consequently,
the company estimates of depreciation can be said to give slightly more rea-

sonable results for 1976. (Although the coefficient of decline in real debt
is about twice that for reported earnings, which is unreasonable, this is
true for both sets of these regressions in 1976 and is unrelated to the depreciation adjustment.) Data for subsequent years will help to clarify the
effect of company depreciation estimates. In particular, no account was taken

If we accept the company estimates as correct, they imply a downward

(not shown in table).
for 1976, compared with 20 percent for our estimates! If this comparison applied to all years, the depreciation coefficient should be over twice as large.
For the full period in Table 4, for example, it would be two-thirds of a1,
falling between the values for IVA and decline in real debt.
IVA based on specific price indexes

To check whether the IVA would be more accurate if calculated with specific commodity prices rather than a general price index, a second IVA was calculated by the same method but with a set of price indexes specific to each industry that had been compiled for another purpose. In an earlier study5 I constructed input and output price indexes for 54 manufacturing industries from
seven-digit BLS wholesale product prices, weighting each index according to
industry data on the commodity composition of inputs and outputs. These series
covered 1967-74. They were used for the present study by

assigning

each company

to one of the 54 industries.

It was assumed that raw materials were best approximated by the input price
index, and finished products by the output price index. The Compustat tape pro-

19-

vides data on inventories classified into raw materials, goods in process, and
finished products. The dollar amount of goods in process was apportioned between
the other two inventories according to their reported dollar magnitudes. When the
Compustat inventory data were missing for earlier years, the proportions of the
latest year available were used.

Regressions comparing the two estimates of IVA are presented in Table 7.

In general, the IVA coefficient for the specific price indexes is smaller and
less significant. This seems to confirm that such specific adjustments are
fraught with inaccuracy and to suggest that they are generally not used by the

market to adjust for inflation. An alternative interpretation is that, while the
market uses such specific price indexes, the adjustment of market values is in
fact incomplete (the regression coefficient is low only in part because of bias due
figures)
to errors in these I'VA I and the statistical significance of the variable is

lower only because our estimate of the specific-price IVA is an inaccurate re-

flection of the one used by the market. No doubt the truth is somewhere inbetween.
Other variables added to the regressions
Several other variables were tried to see whether the results would be
materially affected. By and large they were not, either for the full period
(see Appendix Table C) or for the two subperiods (not shown).
Equity ratio is the ratio of common equity to total invested capital.

It is a measure of leverage and allows for risk to the common stock. It has a
positive effect on the increase in market value, but is not significant except

in combination with capital gain. It increases the coefficient of the decline
in real debt, when accompanied by capital gain, and increases the magnitude
of the negative constant term. In the later subperiod, when equity ratio might
be expected to have been more important, it had virtually no effect (not shown).
Age of the capital stock is the average age of the current-value capital
stock in 'ears multiplied by the capital stock as a percentage of initial market
value. It is a measure of capital obsolescence to supplement the adjusted depre-

ciation. The derivation of the latter assumed that capital lost no value until

retired Age of capital has the expected negative coefficient, is significant
when included in regressions without capital gain, and raises the coefficient
of the decline in real debt. It is highly correlated with capital gain (R =

.93),

however, and is insignificant when the latter is included.

Dividend payout ratio is the ratio of dividends to total ordinary earnings.
It tests the hypothesis that paid-out earnings may be of more value to stockholders than retained earnings are. It is insignificant and has virtually no
effect on the -inflation adjustments.

Change in earnings is the change in reported retained ordinary earnings,
as in the first column, from the earlier subperiod 1966-71 to the later subperiod 1972-76, expressed as a percentage of initial market value. It is intended as a proxy for prospective changes during the period in future net
worth to account for a coefficient of earnings a1 greater than unity. (Ideally

for

this purpose, the change in earnings should take the difference between

periods before and after 1966 rather than 1971, but the pre-1966 data were not
compi•1ed. )

It

is positive and significant, and the estimate Qf a1

is reduced part of the way toward unity. The estimate of a1

neverthe-

less remains significantly above unity; its tendency to incorporate prospective
increases in future net worth is not fully reflected in the change in earnings.

Another proxy that was tried in an attempt to capture this tendency was the
change in sales (not shown), which gave similar though less significant results.

Interpretation and Concluding Remarks

Taking the statistical results as a whole, we find that market prices reflect a
major adjustment of reported earnings for IVA and decline in real debt. The regressions in Table 4 using average market value as a divisor and excluding cap-

in Thie 4,
ital gaifi seem the most reliable. For the full period/the adjustment for IVA

is 100 percent complete and for decline in real debt is half complete. The

-

22-

adjustment for the understatement of depreciation, on the other hand, is weaker -a third of being complete. This is certainly surprising, because the recent dis-

cussions of reforming accounting practices focus on the understatement of depreciation and view the decline in real debt as somewhat hypothetical and as less
important, perhaps to be disregarded. Our results suggest that the decline in
real debt cannot be viewed as unimportant in affecting the market value of
manufacturing companies.

The partial effect of the depreciation adjustment is puzzling and may be
due to mismeasurement. Although it is highly correlated with capital gain, the
effect of the depreciation adjustment is still small when capital gain is omitted from the regressions. Our adjustment of depreciation may be too high. Comparison with the replacement cost depreciation reported by 243 companies for
1976 suggests a 21 percent overestimate. In terms of the depreciation adjustment,
would be
our estimate ,P
over twice as high. This implies a doubling of the regression

coefficient of the adjustment, which is more plausible but still far from complete. The uneasy implication here of disequilibrium and market inefficiency may
elicit the contrary conjecture that investors did make complete adjustments but
used different estimates. It is not clear whether this conjecture is justified.
The capital gain variable has a negative coefficient inconsistent with
its hypothesized effect, and appears to beproxying for extraneous influences of
high inflation rates. Because of high multicollinearity it also interferes
with estimates of the other adjustments.

All the inflation adjustments of earnings are considerably weaker for the

later period 1972-76 than the earlier period 1966-71. Based on Table 4 with capital gain omitted, the adjustment for IVA is 100 percent complete in the earlier
period and less than 60 percent in the later period, that for decline in real debt
two-thirds in the earlier and half in the later, and that for depreciation twothirds in the earlier and only 15 percent in the later. The latter would be 30
percent if we applied the correction noted above to the later period. We might have

-23—

expected the adjustments to be stronger, however, n the period of higher
inflation.

Possibly the later period did experience stronger effects which were obscured in our statistical results because of greater inaccuracies of measurement under high inflation rates. But if, as our results suggest, the adjustments are in fact weaker for periods of high inflation, the implication is
that adjustments become more difficult to make or that more noise is introduced into the data. In response to less accurate information, the market
tends either to pay less attention to the adjustments or, more likely, to
produce a wider range of estimates of the adjustments. It remains to be seen
whether the publication of replacement cost data will alter this effect of
high inflation rates.

Appendix A
Notes on the Data and Derivation of
the Inflation Adjustments
1. Companies excluded

The Compustat tape for fiscal year 1976 covers the history of about

2500 companies for up to 20 years. In the present study this sample was reduced to

485

manufacturing companies because of certain incompara-

abilities or, primarily, because of incomplete data. Nonmanufacturing companies were too disparate to deal with on a cormnon basis and were not covered.

Manufacturing companies were excluded for the following reasons:
(1) Foreign charters. (U.S. corporations with foreign subsidiaries,
however, were not for that reason excluded.)
(ii) Substantial holdings of natural resources which present special

problems of valuation. The exclusions were mining companies (SIC classes be-V
low 20), paper companies owning timberlands, and integrated oil companies
owning petroleum reserves (nonintegrated companies producing oil and gas from
wells are classified as mining companies and hence were excluded already).
Other companies with subsidiaries owning natural resources were not excluded.
(iii) Major mergers or changes in accounting practices, as indicated by
the Compustat "special treatment" list (its Appendix E of published material
in several cases
for the tape file), or other peculiarities which/resulted in a negative value
for the capital stock after adjustment.

(iv) Unavailability of data for fiscal year 1964 or any later year. (Data
for earlier years back to 1957 were used to the extent available in deriving
the real capital stock.)

(v) Substantial acquisitions of capital other than through capital ex-

penditures. The cutoff was based on mergers or advances to, or purchases of,
other companies, less sales of capital, that averaged (without regard to sign)

-25-

10 percent or more of gross property, plant, and equipment for the period
1965-76. This removed companies not excluded by item (iii) above.

2. General purchasing power of the dollar
all

The price index used for/the inflation adjustments was the implicit
deflator for gross domestic product: annual index 1940 to 1946, quarterly in-

dex 1947 to 1957, and fixed-weight quarterly index from 1958 to 1976. The
quarterly index was interpolated to a monthly series.
indexes
Industry-specific price/ were used for a supplementary calculation of
IVA as described in the text.

3. Derivation of current-dollar value of tangible capital, depreciation, and
capital gain
The current value of the capital stock was derived by revaluing the exis-

ting stock each year by the increase in agenera1 price index and adding annual
capital expenditures and acquisitions net of retirements and sales. The starting point was the earliest year between 1957 and 1964 for which net plant and
equipment was reported on the tape. (The stock includes land used in operations,
which cannot be treated separately.) No attempt was made to link up with ear-

her years from other sources, which would be a very difficult task. Consequently, the initial capital stock was assumed to have been accumulated evenly
over an 18-year period and was revalued by the increase in prices over the preceding 9 years.

Retirement of capital at historical cost is reported on the tape for most
.'ompanies beginning in the early 1970s and was used when available. (Retirements

include sales. Sales are reported separately but at current-dollar receipts;

this item was revalued to historical cost before being deducted from retirements
including sales.) For earlier years, all retirements were assumed to occur at
the end of 18 years, the average life of capital used in the national income

estimate of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This was accomplished by keeping

-26-

track of the age of each year's addition to capital. The initial capital stock
for the first reported year of data was assigned an age distribution based on
annual net investment of the private nonfarm sector. For each year net acquisitions as derived below were assumed to occur at the beginning of the year and
retirements at the end of the year.

Net acquisitions of capital through purchases of companies or mergers
were derived from the identity (all items valued at historical cost):
net acquisitions (purchases net of sales) = change in gross capital
-

capital

expenditures +

retirements.

To incorporate these acquisitions into the age distribution of the existing
capital stock, purchases and sales of capital were assumed to have the same
age distribution as the existing stock in the company.6 (As noted in Section 1,

companies for which the average absolute value of the annual ratio of derived
net acquisitions and advances to other companies to beginning-of-year reported
gross property, plant, and equipment for the period 1965-76 was 10 percent or
more were excluded from the sample.)

When gross property, plant, and equipment was not reported on the tape,
the figure was taken from Moody's Industrial Manual or, if not available there,
was interpolated from adjacent years (straight-line between log values). When
capital expenditures for any year were missing, they were estimated by the change
in gross capital (thus including net acquisitions which cannot be treated separately in this case and were assumed to be all new capital).
The annual rate of depreciation of

-

capital

was the reported annual ratio

of depreciation to net plant and equipment for each company. The depreciation adjustment is therefore the product of this ratio and the difference between our

estimate of the curent value of capital and the reported figure for net plant
and equipment. The use of the reported depreciation ratio here could produce some
error. For example, if companies followed straight-line depreciation and net capital
declined, the ratio would rise, whereas the "true" rate of depreciation might be
constant. No attempt was made to refine these estimates.

Capital gain was the rise over the year in the current-dollar value of the
capital stock at the beginning of the year net of retirements during the year

-27-

and of capital expenditures (assumed to be acquired as of midyear) over the
second half of the year. If any reporting period did not cover 12 months, the
capital gain was adjusted to a 12-month year. The adjustment was based on the
assumption that capital gain in the 12-month period bore the same proportion to
the gain in the observed period as the comparable proportion for the price index.

4. Derivation of inventory adjustment and capital gain on inventory
The standard inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) for a given period is
based on the accounting identity:
cost of goods sold =

inputs purchased + goods

removed from inventory

(or, - goods added).

Since the value of goods in inventory can depart from current values, the
change in inventory requires adjustment. The adjustment derives the change in
inventory in constant dollars, revalues it in dollars of the middle of the
accounting period, and subtracts the reported dollar change in inventory. This

difference is IVA. When prices are rising, the reported change is never less
than the revalued change, and the resulting IVA of zero or a negative amount
eliminate
serves as a reduction of reported profits to
any "inventory profits"
ed

owing to inflation. If any reporting period differ! from 12 months, the IVA
was converted to a 12—month year, by the same procedure as used for the capital
gain on capital.

In the regressions, IVA was treated as a positive number, so that the
theoretically correct sign of its coefficient is negative.
The deflation of the reported inventory to constant dollars requires the
identification of thee valuation method by which goods in inventory are carried

•on a company's books. Three methods were allowed for here: fifo, lifo, and
average cost. The Compustat tape indicates all the methods used by each cornpany in each year.

It was not feasible to identify the different inventories

that were carried on the books by different methods; consequently,the entire
inventory was assumed to be carried by the primary method indicated for each

-28-

company in each year. (Where the accounting method was not indicated, the method for the subsequent year was assumed to apply. Where not indicated for any
years, the method was assumed to be fifo.) No distinction was made for raw,
working, or finished inventories, except as indicated in the text for the
supplementary calculation using industry price data.

The adjustments of the reported values of inventory were made as follows:

Fifo. In this accounting method goods are valued at purchase price when
they enter the inventory stock and are removed in order of entry. That is,
goods removed for use are al.ways those with the earliest date of purchase.

The reported value of the inventory at any time can be approximated by the
purchase price of goods which have moved half way through the inventory. For
example, if the inventory turns over completely in 3 months (the ratio of inventory to average monthly sales is 3),

the average age of the inventory is

months. The inventory is then deflated by the price index of 1½ months

1½

earlier. Turnover periods were assigned for each year according to the ratio
of inventory to sales of each four-digit SIC manufac1uring industry from the
Annual Survey of Manufactures. The IVA for inventories valued by fifo is substantial in a period of rapidly rising prices.

Lifo. In this accounting method goods are valued at purchase price when

they enter the inventory stock and are removed in reverse order of entry. That
is, goods removed for use are the most recent additions. Consequently, the reported value of goods removed from inventory for use are current prices, and
IVA is generally zero.

-29-

Complications arise under lifo when the inventory is depleted and goods
are removed that were purchased in earlier periods. Since the goods are removed in the reverse order of entry, the inventory is built up in layers. Depletion of the inventory peels away the layers; goods are removed which were
purchased in successively earlier periods. It is necessary to keep track of the
successive layers and to revalue each one appropriately. The computer program
written for IVA allowed up to four annual layers of inventory to be removed
(that is, inventory reductions could reach goods purchased from one up to four
years earlier); cases in which inventory depletions went beyond four layers
were calculated by hand.

Average Cost. In this accounting method goods are valued at purchase price
when they enter the inventory stock, and goods removed are priced at the average value of the goods in the inventory at the time of removal. The current
value of the inventory can be derived by a continual update; each month the value of goods added, as based on the turnover rate, is averaged with the average

value of the goods remaining. This method is a cross between fifo and lifo,
since the value of the goods removed is in effect an average of the earliest
and latest additions to the inventory.

The capital gain of the inventory is the change in current-dollar value
of the beginning-of-period stock over the year and of the stock added or de-

pleted (assumed evenly) during the year. It wasadjusted to a 12-month year if
any reporting period did not cover 12 months, by the same procedure as used
for the capital gain on capital.

5. Derivation of decline in real value of net financial liabilities
The' gain or loss in real terms from changes in the purchasing power of

claims fixed in dollar terms is the product of monetary liabilities minus mone-

-30--

tary assets and the rate of change in prices. The rate of change of prices is
based on monthly interpolations of the deflator for gross domestic product used
above. Net monetary liabilities are

This figure was interpolated to the middle of the accounting period and mul-

tiplied

by the price change;for 12 months preceding the end

of the accounting

period.
5. Market value
Market value is the nurnber of shares outstanding times the

market

price per share. The Cornpustat tapes provide market prices for end-of-calendar

years only, and it was desirable to collect monthly market prices. These prices
were derived largely from the University of Chicago CRISP tapes and in certain
cases from newspaper files. For some companies the tapes available to me provided
monthly rates of return including dividends, from which prices could be derived
from a starting point after dividends were deducted. The dividend data used were
for fiscal years on the Compustat tape, and it was assumed that the payments were
made in equal quarterly installments. This assumption introduced some inaccuracy
into the calculation of some of the prices..
Prices in the dependent variable of the regressions is an average of the
three end-of-month prices preceding the end of the fiscal year. Price averages of

the six months surrounding the end of the fiscal year, three months after, and
the twelve months preceding were also derived arid tried in the regressions (see
footnote 1).

The number of shares outstanding from the Compustat tape is available only
for the end of the calendar year, which differs in dating from the price data

for non-December fiscal years. The error in measuring market value will not be
major, however, unless a large change in shares outstanding occurred in the in-

terim. No adjustment was made for such cases.

Notes to Table C
aEquity ratio is an average for the years covered of the book value of
common equity divided by total capital invested. A positive regression coefficient indicates that companies with a higher ratio (lower leverage) tended to
increase more in market value.
bAge of capital is an average for years covered of the average age of the
capital stock multiplied by the ratio of the capital stock to the initial market value. A negative regression coefficient indicates that companies with an
older capital stock tended to increase less in market value.
cpayout ratio is an average for the years covered of dividends divided by
total ordinary earnings. A negative regression coefficient indicates that cornpanies which pay out a higher fraction of earnings tended to increase less in
market value.
dChange in earnings is the change in retained earnings as in the first
column from 1966-71 to 1972-76, as a percentage of initial 1965 market value.

*1 am indebted to Robert F. Lipsey for advice at all stages of the study and
to Susan Tebbetts for research assistance. Helpful comnents were received during the presentation of preliminary results in seminars at Cambridge, Stanford,

and New York divisions of NBER, the Federal Reserve Board, and Columbia University
Business School. I

particularly

want to acknowledge the use of specific sugges-

tions made by William Brainard and Peter Lloyd-Davies.

1/ Prices per share in the derivation of market value

three

are an average of the

end-of-month market prices preceding the beginning and the end of the

period. Other regressions were run using an average of the three end-of-month
prices following these dates, an average of the twelve months preceding, and

the single end-of-month price The alternatives gave similar though slightly
less significant fits

2/ The earnings data and adjustment variables are for twelve month fiscal
years. If the ending month of fiscal years changes during the period, the annual
data have a gap or overlap in the year of change. No allowance was made for this

in cumulating the earnings and the adjustments over the period To check the
importance of this source of error, the regressions were rerun for a sample
excluding 25 companies with a change in the ending month of one or more fiscal

years (see Appendix Table A for industry distribution) These reruns, presented
in Appendix Table B, give similar results.

-37-

3/ Historical depreciation costs can be accelerated for tax purposes, but as
noted the amounts reported to stockholders and used here are generally not.

Therefore, acceleration for tax purposes is no reason for the depreciation
coefficient to be biased downwards.

4/ To measure this effect, the change in the depreciation adjustment in the last
two years of the periods covered was added to the regressions, as an indication
of future increases. The result (not shown) did not affect the coefficient of
capital gain. While this was not a conclusive test of the importance of this

effect, no other test with he data available appeared feasible.

5/ Phillip Cagan, "Imported Inflation 1973-74 and the Accommodation Issue,"
Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, February 1980.

6/ There is a problem if capital expenditures are reported net of retirements.
See James B. Thies and Lawrence Revsine, "Capital Expenditures Data for Inflation Accounting Studies," The Accounting Review vol. LII, No. 1 (January 1977),
216-221. This problem is largely avoided by using Compustat item 128 which is
gross capital expenditures rather than item 30 which is sometimes reported net.
When item 128 was not reported, item 30 was used but,in that case in our sample
of companies, was seldom reported net of retirements.
