The Optimal Weighting of Indicators for a Crawling Peg

ABSTRACT

This paper derives optimal weights for current—account and reserve

indicators for adjusting the exchange rate (a "crawling peg"). Keven (1975)

showed that use of a current account indicator alone would not stabi1ie
reserves, while a reserve indicator results itt unstable fluctuations in the

exchange rate. This paper begins by analyzing the problem in the framework
of Phillips (1954), in which the current account indicator is "proportional"

and the reserve indicator is "integral." We then analyze the problem in a
deterministic optimal control framework, and finally as a problem in stochastic

control. In all cases the optimal combination is a weighted average, which
we call the Keven—Phillips formula. With a fairly low variance of the
current account, its weight falls in the range 0.47 —

0.65.

Rising variance

reduces its weight in the optimal formula.

I. Introduction
The problem of choosing indicators for exchange—rate adjustment

will be relevant for some time to come. Most countries do not permit their
exchange rates to float freely, and others must choose some rule, implicit

or explicit, for adjusting the rate. In any program of exchange—rate
surveillance, the IMF staff will have to take a view on the appropriate

indicators. Indeed, in the early seventies, sore work was done at the
Fund along these lines, namely by Underwood (1973) and Williamson (l937b)
and the problem was discussed by the Committee of Twenty (1974).

To our knowledge, the definitive study of the problem to date

Is Kenen's(l975). He did an extensive simulation study of ni.erous
alternative schemes and found that a reserve change or basic balance
indicatQr would not stabiljze reserves whilst a reserye indicator resulted

in large fluctuations in the current ccQunt. He also noted that this
reflected the problem of smp1e proportional or integral stabilization rules
ana1yzed by Phillips (1954), but did not pursue a Phillips' analysis.

Even though the importance of Phillips's early contribution has
been more widely noted in the macro literature, perhaps because the title
of his paper refers to a "closed economy", the open economy Implications

are pointed out. Thus, it is said that "a country which attempts to regulate
its current balance of payments, whether by means of Internal credit policy
or quantitative import restrictions, and in doing so responds mainly to the
size of its foreign reserves (i.e., to the time integral of its current
balance of payments), is applying an integral correction policy which is
likely to cause cyclical fluctuations similar to those illustrated (in this paper).

2

The short cycles that have occurred in the balance of payments of. a number

of countries since the war may be in part the result of such action".
Phillips also notes that "The general principles of stabilization C...)

could equally well be used, for example, in investigating the stability of
adjustment in international trade or the problems involved in commodity
price stabilization schemes."

In this paper we generalize Kenen's results and relate them

to an optimal control approach to the problem. Kenen studied arbitrarily
specified adjustment mechanisms; we wish to derive an optimal specification

explicitly. In section II we generalize Kenen's results analytically,
and derive weights for the current account and reserve target that yield

monotonically stable adjustment. We see that a current account (or, in
general, flow) indicator is stable but randomizes reserves, while a reserve

indicator yields a limit cycle. Conditions for a Kenen—Phillips formula
weighting the two to give stable results are presented and illustrated.
In section III we derive an optimal control solution for adjustment

to a given current account disturbance. Since this formula is a linear control
rule, it can be derived as the solution of the minimization of a quadratic

minimum energy loss function subject to a linear equation of motion. Thus
optimal weights for the current account and reserve target are derived for
various values of the derivative of the current account with respect to the

exchange rate (B), and the weights of the output variables in the social
loss function a.

Finally in section IV we derive the adjustment equation in a

respectively. The importance of this work is emphasized in the first paragraph
of Turnovsky (1973) and in the preface of Aoki (1976), for example.

stochastic framework with Continuous current account and exchange rate

multiplier shocks. The separation theorem of stochastic control, known in
economics as the principle of certainty equivalence, implies that the linear
control rule renains applicable, given the expectation on the state variables

conditional on the path of the output variables. If the two are Uncorrelated,
we therefore have an expression in the Kenen—Phillips form of section II.
The values of the optimal weights for various values of the

parameters of this problem are compared with those obtained for the deter-

minIstic case. It is found that the weight of the current account in the
optimal control rule is generally higher than the welfare weight, and also higher

than the lower bound of Section II. When the variance of the effect of the
exchange rate on the current account increases, however, the optimal weight
approaches the lower bound and becomes smaller than the welfare weight, as

was to be expected from the static analysis in Brainard (1967). The results
are summarized and conclusions are drawn in Section V, which includes the
summary Tables. 6 and 7.

II. Flow vs. Stock Indicators
The purpose of this section of the paper is to expose the analytical problem of the choice of indicators as clearly as possible,
setting the stage for the optimizing approaches of the following sections.
Therefore we begin witi-. the simplest model that illustrates the problem.

Assume that the monetary authority in a given small open economy has al-

ready decided not to permit its exchange rate to float freely. This is
necessary for the question of choice of indicators to arise. Further,
assume zero capital mobility so that the current account balance B in
foreign currency Is the rate of accumulation of reserves,
(1) R =

B.

4

These two assumptions are consistent; with no stabilizing speculation

on capital account, a foreign exchange market based on trade flows alone
might well be unstable.

The current account balance is an increasing function of the
exchange rate e (units of home currency per unit of foreign exchange):
(2) B =

B(e)

;

B ) 0.
e

The sign of the derivative Be reflects the Marshall—Lerner condition. 2

By appropriate choice of units equilibrium imports and the equilibrium
exchange rate are set to one,

that B = d

+ d — 1,

where d and d

are the absolute values of the export and import price elasticities of demand.

We assume that domestic absorption is manipulated by aggregate demand policy
so that we can focus on the dependence of B on e alone.

The model could be amended to include capital flows as a function
of uncovered interest rate differentials

In that case, given interest rates,

argument.

is achieved by regressive or weakly extrapolative expectations. Adding
capital

movements in this "old" way would reduce analytical clarity without

adding anything to the results.
A position of external balance is defined by attainment of

a

given target level of reserves R*, with a zero balance on current account.1
The latter condition defines a target value for the exchange rate:

objective indicators is to choose a rule for adjusting e, following observations on B or R, that converges to external balance.

One candidate suggested by Cooper (1970) would be to key
adjustment

of

e to reserve changes, which, given (1), amount to the

current account balance:
-

(4) = —XB(e).

This is a proportional stabilizer, in Phillips' terms. As Kenen

says,

"It matches a flow control to a flow target."2 Given our assumption

that Be > 0, it is stable around e.- Linearizing, we have

B < 0.

But there is no mechanism to move R to R* with

this rule. The time path of R will resemble a random walk. A current

During the adjustment period R

will change. When e reaches e and B is again zero, there will be no
further change in B....

Another candidate, proposed in 1972 by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury
would be to key adjustment of e to deviations of reserves from the target:

è=—À (R—R).

This is an integral stabilizer in Phillips' terms. As Kenen says, "The
rule marries a flow control to a stock target, a union that is always
apt to be unstable."

Indeed, it leads to a limit cycle in e (t).

To see this, differentiate

the rule in (6) with respect to time, and linearize around e

target indicator, as well as the change in reserves indicator when there
are capital flows, were derived in a complete model of the "small open
inflationary economy' by Martirena—Mantel (1976), who concludes that her
results "seem to agree' with Kenen's. Recently,particularly in connection
with the "Southern Cone problem" discussed by Diaz—Alejandro (1979), this

instability was obtained in a variety of portfolio balance nodels: see

As Be increases, less weight must be given to the current account

balance to get a given adjustment of the current account. A "reasonable"
weighting of the two targets with Be around unity would be 0.8 for the
for the current account and 0.2 for the reserve deviation.

III. Optimal Adjustment in a Deterministic Framework
Equation (10) and Table 1 give the permissible range of weights for the
stock and flow targets that yields monotonically stable adjustment to a current

account disturbance in the Kenen—Phillips framework. Stillconsideringadjustment
to a one—6hot current account disturbance, we now turn to an optimal control

analysis from the viewpoint of external balance. In this context, the problem
-

involves

minimizing the square of the difference between actual and desired

current account and level of reserves, with minimum exchange rate changes. The
desired level of the current account and the deviation of reserves from some given

level R* is taken to be zero. The quadratic minimum—energy loss function is then

9

L = - [a B(e)2

+ (l_a(R_R*)2 + (.)2]

Here a is the welfare weight for current account imbalance and

— a

weights the distance from the reserve target, both being measured relatiye to the
unit cost of exchange rate variability.

As in section II the model of the economy is given by

R = B(e)

is the state vector.

The state vector is also expressed as a difference of actual and given

desired values, so that we can treat the problem as a simple time invariant
output regulator problem.

Strictly speaking, when the desired values are not

zero we cannot assume that the minimum loss of the .time invariant
problem is finite, or that a control exists. By writing the state variables

in deviation form, however, we are able to ignore the forcing function and
therefore work with infinite horizon.

The table is consistent with the result of the previous section that the

weight on the current account increases as Be decreases, but by less. In the
case of Be = 1, weighting equally the two targets implies that the optimal

current account weight is .66, rather than .8 from Table 1. Note, however,
that the change in the exchange rate is 2.09 as large as was the case before.
For the same change, the lower bound at the current account weight is .38

(see Table 6 below). The optimal value is thus substantially higher than the

13

lower bound, confirming the need to supplement the instability analysis of
section II by an optimizing approach.

however closer to those of Table 2 for lower values of B. As expected,
discounting reduces the sensitivity of the rate of crawl to the indicators
but this reduction is more than offset by a large value of the Marshall—

than .50 as in Table 2.

IV Optimal Adjustment in a Stochastic Framework
To analyze the problem within a stochastic framework, we will modify

the model given by equations (1) and (2) above. While we still assume that
the exchange rate can be controlled exactly, we introduce an additive current

account disturbance w2. We also introduce uncertainty regarding the effect

of the exchange rate on the current account. This "statedependent noise"
is modelled as an additive disturbance

WV If we assume further that

and

to Be possibly correlated with
are Brownian motion with

dt

and adt as variances of their respective increments, the change in reserves
can be approximated around equilitrium by a linear stochastic differential
equation of the form

Eliminating k11, we find that the first and third equations define

2 The similarity between state dependent noise and a "negative discount' has
the difference in this model
been pointed out by Turnovsky (1.973). Note however
between (32) and (50) and the difference in the magnitudes of the parameters
discussed below in the text.

Thus, as expected from the separation theorem, the rule is the same as in
the deterministic case when the two disturbances are uncorrelated, so that the

forcing term k' is zero. Using (53) we can express the rule in terms of the
k12 and k22 coefficients, or in the 8, y notation of (24) as:

l—y =

Some values of 0 and y for the usual values of B and
e

and three values

of a1,are shown in Table 5. The optimal rate of crawl depends, in addition, on
the covariance term a12. If the additive and state dependent disturbances are
negatively correlated, the optimal rate of crawl is less than if they are

uncorrelated. However, in (54), loss only depends on a and the square of the
correlation coefficient, so that the sign of the covariance has no effect on
loss.

Aside from the effect of the covariance, which is not included in Table 5,

the interpretation Is similar to Tables 2 and 4 above. In fact, we notice
that the offsetting of the overall sensitivity 0 by the size of B, which was
pointed out in connection with Table 4, holds for the stochastic case. The
strong effect of the variance term of the state noise is also evident from the

table. Indeed, when the standard deviation of the state—dependent noise is 2,
the optimum weight on the current account is 0.2 for virtually all of the values

of a and Be that have been used. The exception is the combination of a pure
reserve target and "infinite" elasticities (a = 1 and Be =
-

the

100).

In that case

table shows a drop in the weight on the current account from 0.2 to 0.11.

In the case of a pure flow target (ci = 0) we find that, just as in Tables 2 and

4, the optimum current account weight does not .depend on Be• The weight is not

24

unity, however, as in the deterministic case. Also, the sensitivity parameter

6 declines with increases in B whereas it increased with B in the discount case
e
e
of Table 4. Thus, the current account weight can be as low as 0.2 when variance

is large, and is only 9l when variance is 0.L
In the equal weight case (a =

.5),

low variance yields optimal weights

that are very close to the ones obtained in the deterministic analysis. For
large Be in fact, these weights are close to the no discount case of Table 2.
For example, when Be = 10, y = .53 in Table 2 and y = .47 in Table 4. When Be
= 100 y remains unchanged in the discount case and it is equal to 0.5 in the

no discount and low variance stochastic cases.

When variance is unity, however, the current account weight drops
substantially and the range is reduced from .82 — .50 to .51 —

.39.

As mentioned,

the uniform value for a variance of 4 is 0.2. As y varies less, the range of the
sensitivity parameter 0 increases substantially with the variance. Thus, when
2 =

.1

0 has a range of the same order of magnitude as in Table 2.

(5.35 to

1.45 vs. 4.54 to 1.43) whilst in the high variance case the range is 400 to 4.

It should be pointed out that the effects of state—dependent noise on the
Kenen—Phillips formula might be less drastic when control—dependent noise is
incorporated in the analysis, particularly if it is inversely correlated with
state—dependent noise.

V. .Summary and Conclusions
The numerical findings are from section II —

IV are summarized in tables

6 and 7 where the values of the current account weight y, the sensitivity
coefficient 0, and the coefficient of the current account in the optimal

rule (y0) are listed a =

.5

and for Be = 1 and Be = 100 respectively. The

implied lower bound is obtained by dividing .8 by 0 and permits comparison of the
weights for a given change in the exchange rate, this is subject to the proviso

that, in the stochastic case, the change in the exchange rate would be larger

or smaller depending on whether the state dependent noise is positively or

negatively correlated with the additive disturbance. If the variances are
equal, in fact, this might mean a difference as high as

4 multiplying the

coefficient on B in the tables.
The tables bring out the results that have been emphasized earlier.
They can be summarized as four points.

First, low variance (.1 in the tables) and discounting bracket rather

tightly the deterministic no discount case. For Be = 1 the range is 0.65 to
0.67 (no discount y =
discount y =

.50).

the range is 0.47 to 0.50 (no

The ranges of the implied lower bound are, respectively,

0.36 to 0.38 and 0.124 to 0.133. Second, as mentioned above, the effect of
discounting in reducing the sensitivity of the rate of crawl to the indicators

is more than offset by large values of B, so that in Table 6 y with discount
is higher than y no discount and y low variance and in Table 7 y with discount

is lower than the other two. Third, the finding discussed above that the implied
lower bound in the deterministic as discount case of section III is less than
half the lower bound of section II, the same holding for the low variance and
discounting cases, as shown in Table 6, is eliminated by a large B , as evident
e

from Table 7. There the values are 0.18 for the lower bound of section II and
.13 for the deterministic no discount case. Fourth, and perhaps most important,
both tables show again that the effect of a large variance —

are quite strong. When

= 1 or larger —

= 4 the lower bound goes to .02 in Table 6 and to

.05 in Table 7, while 0 increases to 40 and 4 respectively.
This paper has shown that the Kenen—Phillips formula for the optimal

weighting of indicators in a crawling peg is obtained in the various situations
of sections II —

In all cases the optimal formula is a weighted combination of targets

with

an additional parameter for the desired speed of adjustment. With a low

variance a reasonable range for the current account weight seems to be 0.65 to
