Policy

Decentralization and Exchange Rate

Management in Interdependent Economies
ABSTRACT

The paper provides a theoretical framework for analysing
policy formation among independent authorities operating in an
interdependent environment. This is then applied to the analysis
of optimal monetary policy in a stochastic two—country model with
rational expectations. The main conclusions are 1) OptImal

monetary policy requires a finite response of the money supply to
the exchange rate (which is the only contemporaneously observed
variable.) Neither a fixed nor a freely floating exchange rate is

likely

to be optImal. 2) Output stabilizing monetary policy may
well require 'leaning with the wind' in the foreign exchange
market, expanding the money supply when the home currency depreciates,
thus increasing the volatility of the exchange rate. 3) The ability
of the monetary authorities to influence real variables is due to
the assumption that the private sector does not make exchange rate—
contingent forward contracts.4) There are likely to be gains from
policy co—ordination.

Introduction
The demise of Eretton Woods ahd of the short-lived Smithsonian

agreement has raised questions about exchange rate management by monetary

authorities

acting in isolation from one another.

For instance, will individual

monetary authorities have an incentive to stabilise the exchange rate?
extent will monetary actions abroad disrupt domestic monetary policy?

To what
What are

the gains from co—ordinating monetary policy?

The problems that arise when different agents pursue independent policies
in interdependent economies have been explored by a number of authors.

Aoki

(1976), Cooper (1969), Hamada (1976), Allen and icenen (1980), McFadden (1967),
Patrick (1973) ,

Kydland (1976) and Pindyck (1976), among others, have made

significant contributions.

Different authors have focused on different aspects

of decentralized policy formation.

One purpose of this paper is to provide a

general discussion of decentralization.

In part 2 we provide a

theoretical framework for analysing policy formation among independent authorities
operating in an interdependent environment.

We distinguish three dimensions of

the problem and discuss, by way of example, the Mundell (1962)

in terms of our typology.

assignment problem

We show that instability in Mundell's context does

not arise because different authorities are assigned different and inappropriate
targets, but because they fail to formulate strategies in a co—operative way.
A second purpose of this paper

is to analyse the optimal design of monetary

in interdependent economies.

Previous analytic discussion of policy
decentralization has been based on deterministic models. Furthermore, with the
policy

exception of Hamada

(1976),who considers the problem in a classical, full—

employment

context, these models incorporate the traditional neo—Keynesian

assumption

of fixed prices.

Studies incorporating stochastic elements have also

used a neQ—Keynesian framework and rely solely on simulation analysis
(1976) and Kydland (1976)).

(Pindyck

None of the studies incorporates recent contributions

to the theory of aggregate supply and expectations formation associated with the

"New Classical Macroeconomics".

We consider

two monetary authori ties pursuing domestic targets in two

economies connected both by trade in real goods and in national monies.
The model is presented in section 3.

Each economy is characterised by

a supply function of the Lucas type in which deviations of output from
its natural level occur only because of deviations of the domestic price
level from the value that was anticipated in the previous period.
natural level is itself stochastic.

by holding domestic or foreign money.
stochastic.

We assume that money demands are also

The two economies are linked by a stochastic purchasing power

parity relationship between the two price levels and the exchange rate.

Throughout, we assume that the only contemporaneous variable observed
by the two monetary authorities and the private sectors is the exchange rate.
Incomes and price levels are observed only with a one—period lag.

Each

monetary authority's problem, then, is to infer from the observed current
exchange rate the type of shocks affecting the economy and to set the current
money supply to offset these shocks, taking into account the response of the
foreign monetary authority to its actions.

In

we assume that each country's monetary authority pursu& the

of stabilizing output around the average Or 'OX ante", natural

level

In section 5 we modify the objective to one of stabilizing income

the actual but unobserved natural rate.

This second objective is

equivalent to niinimising price forecast errors and is more likely to lead to

a policy of exchange rate stabilization.

In section 6, we introduce exchange

rate stabilization as an additional, independent goal.

—3—
Throughout, we derive the policy rules which obtain when the monetary
authorities pursue distinct targets independently.

In sections 4 and S the

optimal policy rules are not affected if, instead, authorities pursue a
common objective cooperatively.

This result does not extend to more general

models such as the one considered in section 6.

A main purpose of the model we develop in sections 3 through 6 is to
provide insight into the design of optimal policies for dirty floating.
Models in which current policy can only respond to past information must
implicitly assume that either the exchange rate or the money supply is fixed

within

the period: exchange rates are either fixed ox the float is clean

within the period [see Buiter l979a3.

Our model,

however, allows for a

contemporaneous money supply response to the current exchange rate

Setting the money supply to fix the exchange rate or ignoring the exchange
rate

in setting the money supply constitute special cases of our model.

Indeed,

we find that optimal monetary policy can involve

The objective of policy is to stabilize Y and B; that

In general, the government can achieve the same

objective by responding only currently to current information (e) that it can
achieve by responding to this information at later dates. It is interesting to
note that even if the government were to have inferior information to the private

sector in the sense that they learn e at a later date, they can achieve their
objectives equally well.

In a currency substitution framework they can be viewed as the

exchange rate speculation elasticities of home and foreign currency respectively.

The first terms of (4.27) or (4.271) and (4.28) or (4.28') therefore

suggest that monetary policy accommodates changes in the demand for

money due to unanticipated changes in the exchange rate, thereby neutralising
the effect of unanticipated exchange rate changes on the price level.

This

policy insulates the economy from real effects of unanticipated exchange rate
changes.

Remember that since et!tl =

0, a monetary rule contingent on e

is a monetary rule contingent on the deviation of the actual exchange rate
in period t from the exchange rate for period t anticipated in period t—1.

As all disturbances are ii.d and there are no other sources of inertia in the
model (specifically mtjt l 0), rational expectations are regressive.L"

To the extent that monetary policy does accommodate swings in speculative
demand, monetary authorities "lean with the wind", in the foreign exchange
market, i.e. expand the money supply when the price of domestic currency is
*

lower than had been expected and conversely, i.e. a > 0 and a < 0.

Such a

policy will exacerbate movements in the exchange rate, as can be seen from
equation (4.29), the reduced form expression for the exchange rate.

The denominator of the second term on the right—hand side of (4.27') and
(4.28') is positive.

Thus an increase in the variability of the demand for

money (02) will reduce the degree to which the authorities lean with

the wind and may even reverse this policy.

An expected increase in the demand

for domestic money will be associated with an unanticipated appreciation of
the home currency.

Rather than contracting the money supply as would be optimal

if the main sources of uncertainty were foreign, optimal monetary policy will at
least in part accommodate the unexpected increase in the demand for money by

— 22 —

expanding the money supply.
The variability of foreign money demand has no effect on optimal domestic
monetary policy, however.

This result may seem surprising since, from (4.7)

and (4.), foreign monetary shocks do affect domestic income and, from (4.9) and
(4.10), domestic monetary policy, given foreign monetary policy, does respond
to perceived shocks in the demand for foreign money.

If foreign monetary

authorities pursue an optimal monetary policy, however, they minimize the effect
of their own monetary disturbances.

Domestic monetary policy can then ignore

such disturbances.

An increase in the variance of domestic income shocks raises the optimal
degree to which monetary authorities should lean with the wind.

A positive income

shock raises the demand for money and appreciates the exchange rate.

To offset

the effect of a positive income shock authorities should contract the money supply.
Hence when exchange rate variation is caused in large part by instability in the
supply of domestic output, monetary authorities should act to augment exchange rate
changes.

The variability of foreign output shocks, unlike the variability of foreign
monetary shocks, does affect the optimal intervention policy.

A positive foreign

output shock will tend to depreciate the exchange rate and engender a foreign
monetary action which further depreciates the exchange rate.

(In contrast, a

foreign monetary disturbance engenders an offsetting foreign monetary action)

Foreign output shocks thus create exchange rate variability which is unrelated to
domestic disturbances.

Any response designed to offset the effects of domestic

shocks, as perceived through exchange rate variation, on domestic targets will be
diminished.

As a

y
offsetting speculative behaviour.

— 23 —

For the same reason increased variability in shocks to the purchasing power
parity relationship also reduce the extent to which monetary policy can offset

As a

rises, then policy should

increasingly isolate the domestic price level from the effects of exchange rate

It is interesting to consider monetary policy in four special cases of the
model.

(a) No domestic shocks

The only shocks it faces are exchange rate disturbances

resulting either from the stochastic nature of the purchasing power parity

the exchange rate depreciates unexpectedly, the money supply expands.

When
in the

absence of changes in the money supply a depreciation of the exchange rate

creates expectations of appreciation (since e+i, =

0).

These expectations increase

the speculative demand for home country money which would lower the home country
price level and therefore income.

To offset this, the monetary authority

acts so as to accommodate exactly the higher money demand with a higher supply.

Therefore, a country lacing shocks largely from abroad through the exchange

rate will adopt a monetary rule that exacerbates the exchange rate changes
in order to stabilise real income.

— 24 —

(b)

No domestic shocks ard no currency substitution

If there are no domestic shocks and

if

the demand for domestic currency

is inelastic with respect to exchange rate changes (i.e. if a

2

u'

a

2 =

urn

then the optimal money supply is independent of the exchange rate (a = 0)

Thus,

-

except in the improbable event that the various components of (4.27') cancel

exactly, a policy of free floating is optimal if and mly if (1) the demand for
money is interest inelastic and (2) there are no domestic disturbances.

Even

if the demand for money does not depend on the expected change of the exchange rate
(i.e. if 1= 0) exchange rate changes signal in part domestic shocks to which the money
supply should respond.

This result is analogous to Poole's (1970) finding that in

the closed economy IS—LM model the optimal money supply is invariant to the interest
rate if and only if (1) the demand for money is interest inelastic and (2) the
economy is not subject to a variable demand for money

(b)

No real or purchasing power parity shocks

When the only source of uncertainty is in the demand for either currency

(i.e. when 0y2 =

elastic.

a2 = a2

= 0)

then policy makes the supply of money perfectly

The exchange rate is pegged.

This result is analogous to Poole's

finding that for a closed economy a policy of fixing the interest rate is optimal
when the only source of disturbances is in the demand for money.

Thte that if

pegging the exchange rate is the optimal policy for one country, it is so for both.
Unless the two countries peg at the same level, however, the model become
inconsistent.

(d) Infinitely elastic currency substitution

o and a policy of pegging minimizes income variability even if the economy

is subject to real disturbances.

If the authorities fail to peg the exchange rate,

exchange rate changes will subject both economies to wide swings in the demand for

These will create large price changes which will in turn destabilize

Supply uncertainty now contributes toward the optimality of a policy of exchange rate stabilisation (leaning against the wind in the exchange market)
rather than the opposite.

The reason is that an unanticipated increase in

To eliminate the unanticioated nrice decline

expansion is now appropriate, dampening the exchange rate change.

The variability of foreign

or real

shocks, regardless of whether they are monetary

in origin, has no effect on optimal domestic monetary policy.

The

domestic effects of foreign shocks of either type are minimized by optimal foreign
monetary policy.

Each monetary authority, in other words, acts to offset the

effects of local shocks on both itself and the other country.

Regardless of the variability of money demand or output supply shocks in either
economy, if the purchasing power relationship is non—stochastic a policy of pegging
the exchange rate is optimal.

In this case if the exchange rate is fixed then so

are prices.

6.

The Cooperative Pareto—Optimal Solution
So far we have assumed that each monetary authority acts independently

to attain a domestic policy objective, taking the monetary policy of the
other country as given.

In this section we compare such policies with those

that would arise if the two monetary authorities were to cooperate in setting
monetary policy to attain a mutual objective.

To derive the set of Pareto—

optimal policies we assume that policy makers jointly set monetary policy in
period t to minimise an objective of the form

In our

In such a context there are no gains from policy coordination.
