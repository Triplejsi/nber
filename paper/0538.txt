ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF THE OCTOBER 1979 CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY
ON THE 1980

ECO~OMY

by
Ray C. Fair

On October 6, 1979, the Federal Reserve announced what most people

interpreted as a change in monetary policy.

The purpose of this paper

is to estimate the effects of this change on the 1980-1981 economy.

The

effects of the change are estimated from simulations with my model of
the U.S. economy (1976, 1980b).

One of the equations in'this model, which

is difcussed in detail in my (1978b) paper, is an equation explaining
the behavior of the Federal Reserve.

In this equation the Fed is esti-

mated to "lean against the wind," Le.,·to allow short term interest rates
to rise (fall) in response to an increase (decrease) in real economic
activity, in the rate of inflation, and in the past growth rate of the
money supply.

The change in monetary policy is estimated by adding three

dummy variables to this equation:

one each for 1979IV, 19801, and 198011.

The estimated coefficients of these variables are taken to be the estimated effects of the monetary policy change on short term interest rates.
To estimate the effects of the policy change on the economy, two
dynamic simulations were run for the 1979IV-198lIV period:

a "base" run

that included the Fed behavioral equation with the dummy variables, and

2

a second run that· included the equation without the dummy variables.
The difference between the predicted values from these two runs for each
endogenous

varia~le

and each quarter is an estimate of the effect of the

policy change on the variable in the quarter.

Standard errors of the

effects have also been estimated, and these are presented below.

The

standard errors were estimated by means of a stochastic simulation procedure that I have recently proposed (1980a).

A description of the data and the precise

3

definitions of the variables are contained in (1976, 1980b).
Equation (1) states that the current bill rate is a positive function of the lagged rate of inflation, of the current degree of labor
market tightness, of the current and lagged rates of growth ·of real GNP,
and of the lagged rate of growth of the money supply.

Lagged values of

these variables also have an effect on the current bill rate because of
the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable in the equation.

The esti-

mated effects of the policy change on the bill rate in the three quarters
are 1.58, 1.59, and -2.22.

In other words, the Fed is estimated to have

allowed the bill rate to be higher in 19791V and 19801 (by 1.58 and 1.59
percentage points, respectively) and lower in 198011 (by 2.22 percentage
points) than it would have had it been following its old policy rule.
It is important to note in interpreting these effects that they
are conditional on the lagged value of the bill rate.

In 1979111, for

example, the bill rate was 9.63, and given this value and the values of
the other explanatory variables in equation (1) for 19791V, the Fed is
estimated to have allowed the bill rate to be 1.58 percentage points higher
in 19791V than it would have under the old rule.

In 19791V the bill rate

was 11.80, and given this value and the other values for 19801, the estimated effect on the bill rate in 19801 is 1.59 percentage points.

Finally,

in 19801 the bill rate was 13.46 and given this value and the other values
for 198011, the Fed is estimated to have allowed the bill rate to be 2.22
percentage points lower in 198011 than it would have under the old rule.
(The bill rate in 198011 was 10.05.)
For purposes of the simulation work below it is assumed that the
Fed has gone back to its old policy rule starting in 1980111.
change is thus assumed to have lasted only three quarters.

The policy

When more

4

data are available, this assumption can be tested by adding further dummy
variables to equation (1) and seeing if their coefficient estimates are
significant.

Some of the statements of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve

in July 1980 are consistent with this assumption, in particular his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on July' 22, 1980.

The Model
The model is described elsewhere (1976, 1980b), and so it will

only be briefly discussed here.

This matrix, which is of dimension
Included among the 183 coefficients are

the three dummy variable coefficients in equation (1).
The model has two important properties that should be kept in
mind in interpreting the following results.

First, interest rates have,

other things being equal, a positive effect on prices.

In the theoretical

version of the model, which is based on the premise that firms set prices
(along with other decision variables) by solving multiperiod maximization
problems, the interest rate and other cost of capital variables have a positive
effect on the price that the firm sets. This feature is also part of the econometric

5

model:

included among the explanatory variables in the price equation

are two cost of capital variables, a bond rate and an investment tax
credit variable.

The second property is that prices are not very sensi-

tive to demand changes except in periods of high economic activity.

In

other words, the tradeoff between output and inflation is very poor in
periods of low to moderate economic activity.

This feature, which appears

to be common to many other econometric models as well, is discussed in
detail in my (1978a) paper.
It should also be noted that interest rates have a strong negative effect on demand and output in the model.
channels for this effect.

There are a number of

The two long term interest rates in the model,

a bond rate and a mortgage rate, are linked to the bill rate through standard
term structure equations.

Both the bill rate and the mortgage rate appear

directly as explanatory variables in the consumption equations, with
negative coefficient estimates.

Because of this, the household savings

rate is, other things being equal, a positive function of interest rates.
The bond rate affects prices, as mentioned above, and prices have, other
things being equal, a negative effect on demand.

(Prices appear as ex-

planatory variables in the consumption equations, with negative coefficient
estimates.)

There is also a loan-constraint variable in the model.

This

variable is a function of the level of interest rates and has a negative
effect on consumption in periods of tight money.

Interest rates also

have a negative effect on wealth in the model, through a negative effect
on stock prices, and wealth has a positive effect on consumption.

Demand

affects output in the model, which in turn affects investment and employment; and so interest rates, by affecting demand, indirectly affect output,
investment, and employment.

The Estimated Effects
The results for eighb endogenous variables in the model are pre-

sented in Table 1.

The values in the

a

rows for each variable are

actual values for 19791V-198011 and predicted values thereafter.

The

actual values for 198011 are preliminary (they are values available as
of August 1, 1980).

The predicted values are from an ex ante forecast

that I made on August 7, 1980, with the model.
The values in the

rows are the estimated effects of the policy

It will be easiest to describe how these values

would have been obtained had deterministic simulations been used and then
to explain the modifications needed for the stochastic simulations.

First,

estimated residuals are available for the first three quarters (19791V198011), and these residuals were added to the estimated equations and
treated as exogenous.

This means that a perfect tracking solution is

obtained for these quarters when the actual values of the exogenous variab1es (including the dummy variables in equation (1»

are used.

Since

the predicted values beyond 198011 are based on actual values for 198011,
this also means that a simulation run from 19791V through the end of the
forecast period (19811V) will duplicate the predicted values for 1980111
and beyond, provided that the actual values of the exogenous variables are
used for the first three quarters and that the exogenous-variable values
used for the ex ante forecast are used

there~fter.

Call this simulation

the "base" simulation.
A second simulation can then be run that is identical to the base
simulation except that the values of the dummy variables in equation (1)
are set equal to zero.

This run is an estimate of what the economy would

have been like had the monetary policy change for the three quarters not

The modifications for the stochastic simulations

will now be described.
The differences between the values from the above two runs are
uncertain because they are based on estimated values of the coefficients
rather than the (unknown) actual values.

In a recent study (1980a) I

have proposed a stochastic simulation procedure that can be used to estimate
this uncertainty.

The procedure in the present case consists of drawing

sets of coefficient values from an estimate of the distribution of the
coefficient estimates and for each set running the above two simulations.
If, say, 100 draws are made, then one has 100 estimates of each difference.
These 100 estimates can then be used to compute the mean and standard
error of each difference.

For the results in Table 1, 150 draws were

made, using the above mentioned covariance matrix of the coefficient
estimates for the draws.

The b-row values are the estimated means (over

the 150 values for each variable and each quarter) of the differences,
and the c-row values are the estimated standard errors of the differences.
The a-row values are subj ect to change in the future.

Many of the

"actuall l values for the first three quarters will be revised, and the
predicted values for the remaining quarters are not likely to be exactly
right (even using my model).

Fortunately, the b- and c-row values are

not likely to be sensitive to the a-row values, and more confidence can
be placed on them than on the a-row values.

(i.e., of the initial conditions, the exogenous-variable values, and
the realizations of the error terms), but for most macroeconometric models
the effects of the a-row values on the b-row values are small relative
to the size of the b-row values.
Given the above discussion of the properties of the model, the
b-row results in Table 1 should be as expected, namely that the policy
change affected output negatively but had little effect on the rate of
inflation.

According to the demand pressure variables in the model ,

the policy change was not made in a period of high economic activity.
The unemployment rate in 1979111 was 5.8 percent, and real GNP growth
during the previous four quarters (19781V through 1979111) had been only
1.8 percent.

(The growth rate in 1979111 was 3.2 percent at an annual

The estimated effect on real GNP in 198011 is -10.3 billion dollars,

and the cumulative effect over the 9 quarters is -58.8 billion dollars.
The estimated effect on the percentage change in the GNP deflator is -0.34
percentage points in 198011 and -0.03 percentage points by the end of
the period.

The rate of inflation is actually higher in the first two

quarters (and in 1980111 and 19801V), which is due to the positive
interest-rate effect on inflation outweighing the negative demand-pressure
effect.

All the b-row values for inflation are, however, very small,

and the main conclusion from them is that the policy change had very
little effect on inflation in either direction.
As a consequence of the fall in output, about 400 thousand jobs
are lost by the end of 1980, and the unemployment rate is about 0.3 percentage points higher.

fall in corporate profits over
The money supply grows less

in the first two quarters and then slightly more for the rest of the

10

period.

Although not shown in the table, the cumulative fall in the

money supply over the 9 quarters is 17.2 billion dollars (with a standard
error of 13.7 billion dollars).
The standard errors in the

c

rows give one a rough idea of how

much confidence to place on the b-row values.

For the first two or three

quarters the standard errors are generally less than half of the estimated
effects.

By the end of the period they are generally greater than the

estimated effects.
The standard errors in Table 1 are based on the implicit assumption that the model is correctly specified:

the estimated uncertainty

of the multipliers is due only to the uncertainty of the coefficient
estimates.

In the present case there are at least two reasons for be-

lieving that the uncertainty of the multipliers is greater than the
estimates in the table.

First, the model may not have captured adequately

the effects of the credit controls that were imposed during part of the
9 month period.

There is a loan-constraint variable in the model, and

in principle this variable should have captured these effects.
be, however, that the effects were underestimated.

It may

The decline in real

GNP in 198011 (of 8.7 percent, preliminary estimate), for example, was
considerably underestimated by the model.

The model predicted (ex post)

a fall of only 1.4 percent for the one-quarter-ahead forecast and 1.2
percent for the three-quarter-ahead forecast (i.e., the forecast beginning
in 1979IV).

Some of this error may have been due to a failure to capture

all the effects of the controls.

If so, this means that the output

effects in Table 1 should be larger (i.e., more negative).

The inflation

effects, however, are not likely to be affected very much, given that
output has little effect on inflation in this period.

(The ex post

11

forecasts of inflation are fairly accurate.
by 9.93 percent in 198011.

The GNP deflator increased

The one-quarter-ahead forecast was 11.38

percent, and the three-quarter-ahead forecast was 10.53 percent.)
The other reason for questioning the uncertainty estimates in
Table 1 concerns the foreign sector in the model.

In the current version

exports and import prices are exogenous, and so foreign repercussions
of the monetary policy change are not accounted for.

It may be, for

example, that an increase in the short term U.S. interest rate results
in an appreciation of the dollar (depending on how the monetary authorities of other countries respond to the increase in the U.S. rate).

This

will likely result in a fall in U.S. import prices and then over time
to a fall in U.S. domestic prices.

If this effect is in operation, it

means that the effects on inflation of the policy change have been underestimated by the model.
i~g

Some preliminary work that I have done construct-

a multicountry econometric model indicate that this effect is probably

small, in part because other countries' short term interest rates respond
to the U.S. rate.

IV.

Conclusion
The main result of the simulations is easy to summarize.

The change

in monetary policy is estimated to have reduced real growth,without having
much effect on the rate of inflation.

Real growth was reduced because

interest rates have a negative effect on demand and output.

Inflation

was not affected very much because the tradeoff between output and inflation is very poor in periods of low to moderate economic actiVity.

There

is also an offset to the negative demand-pressure effect on inflation
in this case, namely a positive interest-rate effect.

The possible

12

misspecification of the model is likely to affect the output multipliers
more than the inflation multipliers.

In particular, because of the

credit controls, the policy change may have had a larger effect on output than is estimated in Table 1.
