The Economics of Tenure Choice, 1955-79

ABSTRACT
The aggregate homeownership rate in the United States has continued
to rise throughout the 1970s despite rising inflation and the rapid growth
of young and primary individual households with relatively low homeownership

rates. This appears to be a result of a decline in the cost of homeownership
relative to renting. The post 1965 decline in the real after-tax interest
rate has acted to reduce the costs of both types of housing. However,
inflation, and legislation induced increases in taxation of rental housing

have largely offset the decline in the net real financing rate. Depreciation
is based on historic cost and nominal capital gains are taxed. Moreover,
this taxation was increased in 1969 and 1976 with the introduction and
expansion of the minimum tax, the increased recapture of accelerated depreciation, and the amortization, rather than expensing, of construction
period interest and property taxes.
The decline in the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to rental
housing is estimated to have sharply increased hoineownership. In the
absence of this decline 1-- to 5 million fewer households would have been

homeowners at the end of 1978. That is, the homeownership rate would
have been 60 percent, rather than 6 percent.

declined. That is, the mortgage rate, after allowing for its deductibility
in computing one's taxable income, has risen by less than the expected rate

of appreciation in the purchased house. While the real after-tax financing
rate for rental housing has declined by even more because landlords tend to
be in higher tax brackets than homeowners, the taxation of rental housing is
less favorable than that of owner-occupied housing in inflationary periods.
More specifically, nominal capital gains are taxed at the point of sale at
both the capital gains and minimum (after 1969) tax rates, and tax depre-

ciation is based on historic, rather than replacement, cost. Because of these
factors, real rents have been roughly constant over the last quarter century.

Thus homeownership has become relatively nre attractive.
The present paper is structured in the following manner. In Section I,
a framework is constructed for computing the real user cost of capital for
owner-occupied housing, and data are employed to calculate this user cost

quarterly over the 1955 to 1979 period. Section II does the same for rental

housing. Differences and changes in tax treatment are highlighted. The
relationship between the homeownership rate, adjusted for demographic changes,
and the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to rental housing is demon-

strated in Section III. A summary concludes the paper and an appendix lists
the real user costs and the data underlying their calculation.

Owner-Occupied Housing

A. The General Framework
As Is well-known, the decision to invest depends on whether the present
value of the expected future cash flows generated by the investment exceeds

the value of the initial equity investment and in equilibrium the two will

be equal. For partially debt-financed owner-occupied housing, the gross
revenues (positive cash flows) consist of an implicit flow of net rental
services over time and a lump sum at the selling date (asset price net of

selling costs and the outstanding mortgage on that date). The costs
(negative cash flows) include mortgage and property tax payments, after

allowance for their income tax deductibility..4 Assume that

(i) inflation Is expected to generate increases in net revenues
at the quarterly rate p and housing prices at rate q,
(ii) the house, and thus the implicit rent, deteriorate at the
quarterly rate d,
(iii) the fraction, a', of the purchase price is financed with a
mortgage at rate 1.

(Iv) the house is expected to be sold after N periods, at which
point a percentage realtor's fee, ,

criticism if our primary concern were with the choice of location of housing.
Indeed, in areas where property taxes are higher, counity services are
better, other things being equal. On the other hand, our main concern is
the cost of one more square foot of space when a house is being built (or
remodeled). The additional property tax paid on this cquare foot is unlikely
to render additional community services and thus is appropriately viewed as

The rather complicated expression on the right-hand side of equation
(1.3) is the hurdle rate that the real imputed rent from additional housing

equilibrium real imputed rent or user cost, then, can be computed from the
depreciation and expected inflation rates (d, p, and q), the structure-value

The right side of (1.14) is a simple real user cost of capital expression that

reflects the current tax treatment of housing (no taxation of implicit rents
but deduction of property taxes and mortgage interest and no deductibility

of depreciation expense) and of interest income (taxation at rate ¶y)• As
can be seen, the higher the tax rate, the lower is the cost of capital.
Further, insofar as the mortgage rate does not rise by a multiple of increases
in expected inflation, the reduction in the cost of capital owing to taxation
is greater the higher is the expected inflation rate.

B. The Data
There are two housing prices series in the model: the price of implicit
rents (the rent component of the consumer price index) and the price of houses
(the NIA deflator for residential structures before 1963 and the Bureau of
Census constant 197)4 quality price thereafter). The price of other goods is

represented by the consumer price index net of shelter. These price series
are listed in the appendix. All indices are set equal to unity in the fourth
quarter of 196)4; thus the real imputed rent equals the gross marginal product

Lastly, annual depreciation and property tax rates are assumed to be
0.017 and 0.018, respectively, the structure-to-value ratio is set at 0.83,
realtor's fees (B) at 6 percent of the value of the house, and the expected

holding period is 8 years. Calculations are made for households in the
0.15, 0.3 and 0.115 tax brackets.

Figure 2 plots the real user costs for households in the three tax brackets

(the series are also listed in Table B in the appendix). The user costs all
rise in the second half of the 1950s, plateau in the early 1960s, and then
trend downward into early 1979. The user costs are lower in 19611 for those
in higher tax brackets, owing to the greater tax savings on their property
taxes and interest payments, and the decline since then is greater because

their tax saving on interest payments is larger. The real user cost for those
in high tax brackets was, in fact, roughly zero in late 1978 and early 1979,
implying that optimal behavior of these households consisted of owning marginal
unused rooms.

II. Rental Housing
The user cost of capital for rental housing differs from the user cost

of capital expression for owner-occupied housing in many respects. Rents
received from rental housing are subject to tax whereas the imputed rents

from owner-occupied housing are not, and depreciation is tax deductible for
rental housing while it Is not tax deductible for owner-occupied housing.
In addition, the calculation of the user cost is complicated by the longer
construction
interest

period and

the changing tax treatment of construction period

and property taxes, tax preference items and capital gains induced

by tax legislation in 1969, 1976, and 1978. All of these factors are accounted
for and discussed

below.

in some detail below.
The real user cost is obtained by solving (2.1) for R and dividing by P.

'de Leeuw and Ozanne (1979) obtained the profit-maximizing holding period by
calculating the present value of assumed cash flows associated with a typical
investment in real estate for many different holding periods and choosing the
one with the highest demand price (they assume a value for R/Ph and calculate
rather than R/Ph). They found that the optimum holding period was equal to 13
years and varied only slightly as conditions changed. In future research we
propose to expand on this problem of determining an optimum holding by explicitly
taking into account returns on alternative investments to rental real estate.
Detailed attention will be given to the taxation of rental housing and its
effects on the optimum holding period and on the calculation of rental user
costs of capital.

rate plus 0.005, 'r =

0.5

and e =

0.71 + 0.03.

The latter implies that the

after-tax opportunity cost of equity financing for high tax-bracket investors
is the tax-exempt rate plus 3

percentage points. Thus rental housing is

assumed to be a more risky investment than

owner-occupied housing. Finally

the weights given general inflation and housing-specific inflation in calculating the expected housing inflation rate are 2/3 and 1/3, respectively.
The general inflation rate is given a larger weight than for owner-occupied

housing because the expected holding period, 13 years, is longer. The longer
the holding period, the more likely are all Inflation rates to converge to a
common value.

B. Special Tax Considerations for Rental Housing
Tax Depreciation
Since 19514 tax depreciation of new rental housing

maybe based on appli-

cation of the double-declining balance method to the initial cost of the

structure. According to this method, investors are allowed initially to
deduct the fraction 2/n of the undepreciated balance of the structure, where
n is the allowable annual tax life, and to switch to the straight line method

whenever doing so would give higher depreciation charges on the undepreciated

balance over the remaining tax life. The straight-line method in this case
is simply the remaining undepreciated balance divided by the remaining tax

methods. Thus accelerated depreciation (ACC) in period t is

sale. Thus

Before

1963, no recapture provisions existed, i.e., PER =

The Tax Reform

Act of 1962 required that for new rental property held less than 20 months
all accumulated acceleration depreciation or the amount of the capital gain

at point of sale, whichever was less, had to be treated as ordinary income)Pi
For each month in excess of 20 months the property was held, the percentage
of excess depreciation treated as ordinary income declined by one percent.
So, if property were held for 10 years, then none of the gain was ordinary

income. Beginning in 1970, the number of months property had to be held

before

complete recapture occurred was increased from 20 to 100. If the

property were held for a full 200 months (16 2/3 years), then no recapture

occurred. The Tax Reform Act of 1976

mandated

full recapture regardless of

the holding period.

C. Rental User Costs
The real user cost of capital for rental housing is the solid schedule

plotted in Figure 3 (and is listed in Table B th the appendix). As can
be seen, the user cost has no discernable trend
over the past 25 years, although there is a slight bulge in the early 1960s.
The failure of the user cost to decline sharply between 1964 and late 1978
in the face of a 5 percentage point fall in the real after-tax mortgage rate,

(1-r)i-q., follows from two factors: the tax reform legislation of 1969 and
1976 and the acceleration of actual, and thus expected, inflation. The
reform legislation created a minimum

tax,

1979 when the taxation of capital gains was reduced.
An increase in expected inflation affects the rental user cost adversely

relative to the owner-occupied user cost in two ways.1?' First, an increase
in expected inflation creates expected capital gains that will be subject

to taxation. Second, the increase intensifies the expected understatement
of true economic depreciation owing to the use of historic cost accounting.
A rental user cost that eliminates these effects is obtained by adjusting

equation (2.1) in the following ways: (1) setting the coefficient on CGAIN
equal to zero, (2) redefining tax depreciation as

=

and (3) recomputing accelerated depreciation as

ACCt =

rdX - (l÷q_y$d)t_Sq3P.

1The user costs for investments by other businesses are also adversely
affected.

The "inflation-adjusted" rental user cost is the hatched series in Figure 3.

Comparison of the actual and "inflation-adjusted" rental user costs
reveals that the adjusted cost was less than 1 percentage point lower
throughout the 1960-65 period when expected housing inflation was less than
13- percent. As expected housing inflation changes over time so does this

difference. The acceleration of expected inflation and reform legislation
in the second half of the 1970's continually decreased the "inflation-

adjusted" user cost relative to the actual user cost through 1978. By mid
1978, when expected housing inflation equalled 8

percent,

the difference

between actual and adjusted was about 5 percentage points. In late 1978
and 1979 the difference falls back to 33- percentage points even though

expected inflation rises slightly because taxation of capital gains had
decreased (the capital gains tax rate was cut in 784 and the minimum tax
was no longer applied to capital gains beginning in 791) and thus the
impact of inflation was less.

III. The Homeownership Rate
As Jaffee and Rosen (1979) have emphasized, households with different

demographic characteristics have sharply different homeownership rates. For
example, in 1970 only one-quarter of families with a head under age 25 owned,
while over hali' with a head in the 25 to 31 age group and three-quarters of

those with even older heads did. Also, primary individual households, especially younger ones, had far lower ownership rates than family households with

heads in the same age span. Demographic specific ownership rates will vary over
time with the economic attractiveness of ownership relative to renting.
However, the aggregate economy-wide homeownership rate will vary with changes
in the demographics of the population, as well as with changes in the economic

variables. While demographics undoubtedly respond to economic variables, the
response is likely to be limited, at least in the short run. Thus it would
appear to be useful to isolate the impact of demographic variables prior to

attempting to identify the effect of economic variables. This is the purpose
of the Jaffee-Rosen calculation of the adjusted homeowrAership rate.

The adjusted (for demographic changes) level of homeowners in period t
is defined as

8
=

1=1
where

the total number of households in period t, hit is the proportion

of total households in class i in period t and o is the homeownership rate

for class i in a given base period (1970 for Jaffee and Rosen). The variation
over time in the ratio HJ.t/1IHt depends solely on changes in the portion of

households in the different demographic classes. The homeownership rate
can be defined as

HOWN - HOWN HADJ
HH
HADJ HFL

23

If we take HADJ/HH as predetermined by demographic factors, then the determination of the adjusted homeownership rate, HOWN/HADJ, provides a complete
explanation of the homeownership rate.
The adjusted homeownership rate should depend largely on the attractive-

ness of homeownership relative to renting. The measurement of this attractiveness is complicated by the determination of expected inflation, transaction
costs, estimates of a probable holding period, and. the effects of existing

and potential federal tax policy. At least for homeownership, it appears
reasonable to assume that the user cost of owning is the appropriate price
to be considered in determining the overall attractiveness of owning.
However, even this measurement is not totally satisfactory because of the
time horizon for which the decision to own is being made.

tions of interest rates, inflation, etcetera beyond the assumed 8 year
holding period are likely not dissimilar to those over the 8 years, the
calculated user cost is probably a quite adequate measure of the relevant
expected cost of owning.

For the cost of renting, investigators e.g., Rosen and Rosen (1980)]
generally employ an observed rental index such as the CPI rent component.
The above discussion suggests that the relevant rental cost is that expected

to prevail over a generally lengthy time horizon. Thus it appears to us
that the above calculated rental user cost, the value to which actual rents

will adjust over time, is a better measure. In fact, a possible criticism

that the measure fails to take into account anticipated changes in the

is

tax law (implicitly no changes are anticipated).
The ratio of the above-calculated user costs for owner-occupied

and

rental housing is employed as the measure of the attractiveness of homeowner-

ship relative to renting. An increase in the ratio of user costs should
lead to a reduction in the adjusted rate, with an uncertain lag, while a

fall in the ratio should lead to an increase in the adjusted rate. We test
the user costs for households in both the 15 and 30 tax brackets, denoting
the ratio of the former to the rental user cost by CO15CR and the ratio of
the

real

latter to the rental by CO3OCR. The other variable tested is "permanent"
disposable income per household where permanent is approximated by an

average of current and observed income during the previous 11 quarters. This
variable, denoted by YDA/HH, could capture increases in either taste for or

"affordability" of homeownership as real income rises. Tastes could, of
course, move in the opposite direction.
The adjusted homeownership rate rose aiinost monotonically from 0.9l5 in

the second quarter of 1960 to 1.077 at the end of 1978) Our user cost ratios
trend downward from 0.8 in 1959 to 0.5 in 1978 for the 15 percent bracket, and

0.7 to 0.2 for the 30 percent bracket. Thus the general movement in the ratios
is broadly consistent with the behavior of the adjusted homeownership rate.
The movement in the real income, too, is broadly consistent; real permanent
income per household rose from 9

It

is reasonable to expect a substantial lag in the adjustment of the

homeownership rate to changes in the user cost ratio. An increase in the
economic attractiveness of homeownership must be perceived by the household,
a decision must be made regarding the explicit form and location of the house,
and the house must be constructed (Or

but the full response to a significant decline in the cost of home-

In the estimation the distributed lag weights were assumed to lie along
a third degree polynomial (with no end point constraints) and the length of
the lag was extended as long as the expected negative relationship held.
Because initial estimates over the 1960-2 through 197'8-14 period

-'These equations still appear to suffer from substantial autocorrelation, but
this is deceiving. Examination of the residuals from equations (3.1) and
(3.2) reveals a distinct a.nnual clustering, i.e., the residuals for 1960-2
through 1961-i are similar, a jump occurs in 1961-2, and the pattern is
repeated.
(This phenomenon follows from the construction of the data.
Only annual data are available for both the number of homeowners and the
adjusted homeowners; this ratio is calculated for the second quarter of the
year and interpolated linearly between second quarters.) We have averaged
the residuals for each of the 18 annual clusters and computed Durbin-Watson
based upon these. The result is statistics of 2.3 and 2.8.

equation only; the user cost variables perform as expected in both equations.
The weights on the lagged user cost ratios in equations (3.1) and (3.2)

are summarized by year in Table 2. The average t-ratios for the quarters in
the year are also listed, Both the humped weight pattern and the nearly 5
year period for complete adjustment are generally consistent with our expec-

tations. The estimated response to CO15CR is somewhat more rapid with 26
percent occurring within two years rather than the

percent response to

CO3OCR.

The magnitude of the user-cost coefficients in equations (3.1) and (3.2)
indicate large and similar effects from observed changes in the user cost

ratios. The estimated impact of the observed decline in CO15CR accounts for

66 percent of the observed increase in the adjusted homeownership rate between

These results are roughly comparable to those of Harvey and Kenneth

Rosen (1980). The Rosens related the homeownership rate annually over the

greatest difference in our results relates to demographic variables.
Through construction of the adjusted homeownership ratio, demographic
factors are "forced" in our analysis to cause a reduction in the unadjusted

ratio from 0.62 in 1960 to 0.58 in 19711. The Rosens, in contrast, find no

impact for such factors. They do find income to be a significant determinant

DATA APPENDIX
The first three variables listed in Table A are the commodity-specific
expected inflation rates for the rent, house price, and general price indexes.
These expectations were constructed as 16 quarter distributed lags on
the current and past rates of inflation of the indexes listed in the next three

columns, respectively. The weights, going from the current period to the
lagged 15 period, are 0.]A7, 0.131, 0.117, 0.103, 0.091, 0.079, 0.068, 0.058,
0.011.9, 0.1iOLi, 0.033, 0.026, 0.020, 0.OlLi., 0.010, 0.006. [The estimation of

these weights is described in Hendershott and Hu (1980).] Column

is the

rent component of the consumer price index; column 5 is the price of houses
(see page 6 in the text); and column 6 is the rate of change in the deflator
for nonfood business product, net of energy and the impact of price controls

for the 1971-75 period. Column 7 lists the price of other goods, F, and
equals the consumer price index net of the shelter component. Finally,
the last two columns give the mortgage interest rate variable (RN) and the
interest rate on commercial paper (RCP).
The underlying expected housing and rent inflation rates were constructed
as weighted averages of the expected general inflation rate [column (3)] and

the good-specific expected inflation rates [column (1) or (2)]. The weights
employed were .5/.5 for owner-occupied housing and .67/.33 for rental housing.
Table B lists the real user costs of capital for owner-occupied housing

and rental housing. The first three columns give the user costs for owneroccupied housing based upon marginal income tax rates of .15, .30, and .145,

respectively. Column 14 is the real user cost of capital for rental housing.
