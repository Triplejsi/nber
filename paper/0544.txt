Gold Monetization and Gold Discipline

ABSTRACT

The paper is a study of the price level and relative price effects
of a policy to monetize gold and fix its price at a given future time and

at the then prevailing nominal price. Price movements are analyzed both
during the transition to the gold standard and during the post—monetization

period. The paper also explores the adjustments to fiat money which are
necessary to ensure that this type of gold monetization is non—inflationary.
Finally, some conditions which produce a run on the government's gold
stock leading to the collapse of the gold standard and the timing of such
a run are examined.

"Money"

the

is a theoretical concept whose imperfect realization has assumed

form of a sequence of particular physical objects. Since the supply

process for each particular physical object is unique, an object which is
"money" in one epoch may he supplanted in another epoch by an object whose

supply process is (perhaps temporarily) superior. While there exists a flow
of objects through the category called "money", the sequence of "money"
objects in modern times has been so limited that it can readily be characterized
as a "gold-fiat-gold" cycle.

Given the recurrent use of gold as a monetary standard, economic agents
will believe that gold may be restored by a government as a money, even in an

epoch in which gold is demonetized. Fluctuations in the intensity of such
beliefs must then be reflected in gold price fluctuations.
Recently, large movements in the price of gold have initiated two lines

of thought concerning government gold market policy. First, Salant and
Henderson 1978 (S-H hereafter), have developed a partial equilibrium gold
market model to analyze the interaction between rapid gold price rises and

government gold auctions. Second, Laffer (1979) has advocated a return
to the monetary gold standard.' Simultaneously, Barro (1979) has constructed
a model to study money and price dynamics under a gold standard. The present
paper integrates these approaches, together with a method recently devised by
Krugman (1979) to study exchange crises, to construct a framework for simul-

taneously analyzing government gold and monetary policy. The model which we
develop is suitable both for the study of historical gold standards and for
the analysis of a future gold standard.

Specifically, we wish to study three questions which arise in the context
of transition to and from a monetary gold standard:
(i)

What is the inflationary effect of a policy to monetize gold at
some future date?

(ii)

Given that a gold standard will be adopted, which monetary policy is consistent

2

with price

stability and minimum disruption of the

gold

market during

the transition to monetization?

(iii) If a monetary authority implements a gold standard but does not
adhere to the "discipline" of the standard, what is the anatomy of
the

gold

standard's collapse?

Th& World Without Monetary Gold

We will first analyze a world in which gold has no monetary u.se. Such
a world is very similar to that studied by S—H, except there will be no

government auctions. Throughout the paper we employ a continuous time model
in which agents have perfect foresight. To minimize technical complexity,
we present our ideas in the context of a specific, linearized example.

We divide our economy into two sectors, a gold sector and a monetary
sector.

Both the output of

III) Inflation and the Gold Standard

In this section we analyze the inflationary effects of the gold monetization policy proposed in section II.

In addition we consider the monetary

policy which must accompany gold monetization in order to prevent price level
movements.

To begin, we note in Figure I that the pre-announcement price, P(c);

/(1-ar), the horizontal intercept of the P=0 schedule. The line ss is the
system's saddlepoint path after gold monetization; therefore, it indicatcs
the path for G(t), P(t.) for t>w.

With these facts we can readily establish that P(w)>P(). Since P(w)
is on ss and ss lies entirely to the right of P(c) it follows that P(w)>P(c).

IV)

Anatomy of a Crisis (Demonetization.) in the Cold Market
Tn previous sections we did not account for government gold reserves

since, except fo.r fixing the price of gold, the government was passive; merely

its willingness to intervene was sufficient to produce the derived results.

however, if the government adopts additional policies which potentially
conflict with the maintenance of a gold standard, we may no longer treat
gold market intervention as implicit; rather, we must directly consider the
government's role in the gold market.
In this section we introduce government gold reserves, R, and initially
assume

that the government ss;cs

down of the gold stmdard.2° In addition, it is possible for the gold
standard to break down even if money is decreasing, providing that prior to
the inception of the gold standard there was "too much" money in cxi stence.

is strictly golddiscijlined. One such method, presented in the appendix,

consists of solving directly for z, the time of the collapse. If a finite
solution

for z exists, then the monetary policy can be classified as a z-year

gold-disciplined policy; if z is infinite, then the monetary policy is strictly
gold-disciplined.

V) Conclusion and Extensions

A government may announce the fixing of the nominal price of gold in a
number
fiat

of

of

different environments. Gold may currently circulate along with

money as part of the money supply with

gold.

a freely floating nominal price

Alternatively, gold may have no monetary role until the fixing

of its nominal price. In this paper we have analyzed the movement of the
price of gold in the latter case.

Tn the context of our model we have shown

that only a very Special money supply process will prevent inflation when
gold is monetized.

In addition we have devised a method for determining the

timing of a gold standard's collapse and produced a formal definition of
"the discipline of the gold standard."
'I'he model employed may be developed in a number of ways. The model

specifies a fairly simple demand and supply behavior for money and gold rather

than invoking explicit maximizing behavior. Also, agents are assumed to
have perfect foresight. We think that it is worthwhile to place our model
of a gold standard's collapse in a stochastic environment. Given such a
framework it

is possible to investigate the collapse of the

standard to determine if it was vial)le when it was formed.

More genera Ely, we could begin the analysis at time c, the moment that
the future monetization of gold .i s announced. Agents at time would real i ze
that the gold standard to be implemented at w will not be permanently viable.

They will

prepare for the expected demonetization so that at time w the nominal
and relative prices of goods and gold and the quantity of consumption gold
holdings will be different from the results of section TI.
Still more generally, the government may hold secondary and tertiary
gold reserves in preparation for new gold standards to be established at some
time after the collapse of the current standard; i.e. to defend the
standard in the crisis, it will only expend a known part of its totalcurrent
reserve.
'lit I s rhythm i c wi thdrawal from and return to the gold standard wi 11 reflect
itself in yet different paths for the price level and gold consumption from
those which we have examined thus far.
22

A possible (though very conjectural) application of this analysis is to
study of the reestablishment and cot Iajse of the inter-war gold standard.
The U.S. continuously used a gold standard until 1933, but other major
countries, i.e,. Germany (1924), Great Britain (1925), France (1927), fixed
their currencies to gold in the 1920's. It is often suggested that the gold
parities which were established were "inappropriate". here we can interpret
"I nappropri ate" to mean that there was too much currency outstanding in the
the

world to

maintain the viability of the gold standard.

Probabilities over Monetization

In this section, we generalize, the model of section IT, to the case in

which agents have a probability density function over the timing of monetization.
Fortunately, most of the required drudgery has already been done in section II
because the solution for the time c relative price of gold falls easily out

of

equation (22). This case is similar in form to the various policies studied

by Salant and Henderson when agents are uncertain about the timing of policy

implementation. The results which we derive here can be employed in an alternative interpretation of the relative gold price movements described in the
first

pages of Salant and Ilehderson.

We will assume that our gold speculators arc risk neutral

V — Analysis with an Alternative D*

In the text we assumed that the target va1e of D is

6/q.

D* =

This simple form was chosen because of its tractability. In this

appendix we demonstrate that none of the conclusions we reach in the text
would be altered by changing our assumption about D* to conform with that

assumed by Barro. In our notation, one functional form which has the
2+63 (q/q)

qualitative properties assumed by Barro (1979, pg. 15) is D* =

q

where y is real output, assumed constant in our paper, and the linearization
is appropriate only over ranges where [62+tS3q/q] >

0.

We differ from Barro in

that he assumed unit income elasticity, but this does not seem substantive for
