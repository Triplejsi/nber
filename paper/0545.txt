Staggered Wage Setting Without Money Illusion:
Variations on a Theme of Taylor
ABSTRACT
Taylor's model of staggered wage setting is reformulated in terms of
anticipated relative real wages rather than

re1at~ve

money wages.

The relative

real wage (RRW) model exhibits more nominal inertia thim.the relative money
wage (RMW) model in the' following sense.

With N-period contracts the RRW

model yields a 2N-2 order stochastic difference equation in the contract wage
while Taylor's RMW model yields an N-1 equation.
coefficients need not all have a common sign.

Unlike the RMW model the lag

It is a1sa shown that Taylor's

money wage model with relative wage effects is observationally equivalent to
a real wage model without relative wage effects.

Taylor's conclusion that

rational expectations combined with nominal inertia (due e.g., to overlapping,
staggered, non-contingent money wage contracts) leave scope for known contingent
monetary policy rules to influence such real variables as the variance of real
output is not affected.

INTRODUCTION

In a number of influential recent papers

Taylor (1979a, bi 1980a,b) has

analysed the behaviour of an economy characterized by staggered overlapping
wage contracts and rational expectations.

His model has

"Keynesian" features.

In particular, the distribution function of real output is not invariant under
alternative deterministic (and known) monetary policy rules.

A sufficient

reason for this is the inertia in the money wage process induced by the
staggered contracts.

One of the aims of our paper is to demonstrate that this

is sufficient by removing what may be considered a form of money illusion
Taylor's model.

from

In that model, wage bargainers are influenced by relative

money wages rather than relative real wages.

Money wage contracts are negotiated

without reference to past, current and expected future prices.

Our paper

modifies Taylor's model to render it immune to the money illusion criticism.
The suggested modification does not eliminate the
model.

Keynesian qualities of the

It does, however, have interesting implications for the empirical

estimation of models with staggered wage contracts (see especially Taylor, 1980b).

Section 2 presents our general N-period overlapping staggered real wage
model or relative real wage model (RRW) and contrasts it with Taylor's relative
money wage model (RMW).

Section 3 contains some explicit numerical solutions of

the RRW model which are then compared with the solutions of the corresponding
RMW models.

One can distinguish three influences on the contract wage.

These are

the average price level expected to prevail over the contract, demand effects

and the response of bargainers to relative (real or nominal) wages.

Taylor's

model contains the demand effect and the relative nominal wage effect.

Section 4

analyses staggered real and money wage contracts without relative wage effects.

- 2 -

One conclusion is that Taylor's RMW model is observationally equivalent to a
staggered real wage model without relative wage effects.

Section 5 considers

some empirical implications of the RRW model.

In Taylor's own words, the two key assumptions of the

model are

H(l) wage contracts are staggered, that is, not all wage decisions in the
economy are made at the same time, and (2) when making wage decisions, firms
(and unions) look at the wage rates which are set at other firms and which
will be in effect during their contract period." [Taylor, (1980a, p. 2)J.

It is important to note that the second assumption refers to current multiperiod money wage contract decisions that are made with reference to all other
money wage contracts what will be in effect during the periods covered by the
current contract.

While currently contracting firms and unions may well be

interested in their wages relative to those of firms and unions contracting
at earlier and later dates, rational behaviour would seem to require that the
relative real values of these contracts and not the relative money wages per se
should be the proper focus of concern.

It can therefore be argued.that Taylor's

RMW model does not isolate the implications of having multi-period non-contingent
(i.e. open-loop) money wage contracts

- 4 -

The RRW model modifies the wage setting process in the following way.
The contract money wage of firms and unions settling in period t, x , is
t

set to achieve a given expected (target) real wage over the duration of
contract.

~~e

This expected target real wage depends on expected average excess

demand during the contract interval and on the real wages that are expected
to be achieved by other firms and unions whose contracts overlap with the
period t contract.

With N-period contracts, the current contract money wage

is therefore directly dependent on current expectations of the price level
during the current and the following N-l periods.

Indirectly, because of

the dependence of the current contract wage on the expected real value of

~~e

contract wages with which it overlaps, the current contract wage will depend
on current expectations of the price level during the next 2N-2 periods.

In general there are three kinds of arguments in the structural equation
for the current contract wage.

First, the price expectation effect, which

reflects the influence of the average price level expected over the life of
the contract.

This effect is absent in the RMW model.

Second, the relative

wage effect, which can be in terms of either real or money wages.

Finally,

the demand effect which represents the influence of the average level of
excess demand in the labour market expected over the life of the contract.

Formally, the RRW model retains equations (2) -

Taylor argues that firms and unions negotiating the current contract wage
look at the contract wages which are set at other firms and will be in effect
during their contract period.

If overlapping contract wages matter because of

what they imply for the real standards of living achieved by other workers and
the real wage costs paid by other firms, the RRW model is clearly the appropriate
one.

The solution method for the RRW model is similar to that for the RlviW model
(see Taylor [1980a]), although the algebra is somewhat more involved.

It is instructive to compare the behaviour of our RRW model with that of
Taylor's

~M

model, for identical values of all parameters, including contract

length.

This will serve to bring out the separate contributions of money

illusion and "nominal inertia" due to overlapping, staggered non-contingent
money wage contracts.

Otherwise the two models are observationally

equivalent.
It has already been shown (Phelps and Taylor [1977], Fischer [1977]) that
in order to obtain the conclusion that

kno~TI

monetary policy rules affect real

output, it is sufficient to have multi-period non-contingent money wage (or
price) contracts.

It is neither essential to have relative wage effects nor

for contracts to be staggered.

Different policy rules will have different

effects whenever the money stock can be made to respond to new information before all
private agents can revise wage contracts.

To include such features as relative

wage effects and staggered contracts may of course be desirable for its
because it captures an essential feature of reality.

The RRW model and the ill1W model have some directly testable implications
even if the contract wage cannot be observed.

The price equation for the ill1W model with N = 3 is also an ARIHA (2, 2) process

Given a priori knowledge of N, we can test the RRW hypothesis that the
price data follow an ARIMA (2N-2, 2N-2) process against the ill1W hypothesis test
that the price data follow an ARlMA (N-l, N-l) process.

It is much less

straightforward to include in these tests the inequality constraints on the a

Conclusions
The RRW model we developed as an alternative to Taylor's

from the latter in one important respect.

~~~

Taylor's RHH model vie"\vs the money

wage decision of firms and unions contracting in a given period as influenced
by the money "\vage rates set (or expecLed to be set) by other firms and unions
that will be in effect during their

contract period.

The RR\{ model views

current wage bargainers as attempting to achieve a real wage target over the
life of their contract that is influenced by the real wages achieved or expected
to be achieved by those other wage bargainers with whose contract periods there
is some degree of overlap.

Quite significant differences in behaviour are exhibited in otherwise
identical RRW and RN'i\' models.

With N-period contracts, the RRh' model yields a

2N-2 order stochastic difference equation for the contract wage and an
(2~-2, 2~-2)

It was also shown that Taylor's

model is

observationally equivalent to a real wage model without relative wage effects.

What is perhaps the major qualitative conclusion of Taylor's RlM model is
not affected, however.

This is that rational expectations combined with nominal

inertia due, e.g. to overlapping, staggered,non-contingent money wage contracts
leaves scope for known contingent monetary policy rules to influence such real
variables as the variance of output.
