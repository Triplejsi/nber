The Timing of Monetary and Price Changes
the International Transmission of Inflation

ABSTRACT

This paper presents a theoretical and empirical investigation into
timing relationships between variables within and across industrialized
countries. In the analysis we highlight the two polar cases of completely
closed and open economies and draw sone implications for timing between
monetary expansion and inflation, inter—country comparisons of inflation

rates and interest rates, and comparisons of central bank behavior. The
Granger-causality test is applied in a bivariate fashion to these groups
of variables.

The main empirical results of our analysis are: (1) Domestic monetary

expansion

appears to lead inflation in the sense that money Granger-causes
prices without feedback, contradicting an implication of the monetary
approach to the balance of payments. (2) 1{ardly any significant timing
relationship exists between domestic and foreign rates of inflation during

the fixed exchange rate period, providing no evidence for a generalized
"law of one price." (3) Some sterilization of official reserve inflows
was successfully performed by the non—reserve central banks, except for
Canada. (4) U.s. interest rates Granger—cause foreign rates, providing
evidence of some international transmission via asset markets.

I. INTRODUCTION

Our object in this paper is to present evidence on the inflation process
in the United States and seven other industrial countries during the period

from the late l950s until the end of 1976. To do so we focus on two issues:
the

channels through which international factors operated to transmit infla—

tion

and the relative contributions to inflation

is the Granger—causality test. For each country, we apply these tests to a

other studies have tended to adopt one or the other of two simple monetary

models which can be characterized by an extreme degree of international integra-

tion or total lack thereof. In one case, what has come to be viewed as the
traditional quantity theoretic model, an economy is treated as if it were com-

pletely closed. The domestic monetary authorities determine the nominal stock
of money supplied and, given a stable demand function for money, ultimately
control the price level.

the opposite polar case, the assumption is that a non—reserve currency
(small) economy is fully open and subject to a fixed exchange rate convertible

into the reserve currency or a commodity such as gold. Differences between
one country's

price level and the price level in the rest of the world are

eliminated by arbitrage. The nominal quantity
via the

of money supplied merely adjusts,

balance—of—payments, to meet a stable demand for real cash balances. 1

—2—
In the closed economy model, the direction of causation is from domestic

money to domestic prices. In the open economy model both are endogenous and
the ultimate causative variable is the rest of the world's money or alterna-

tively the reserve currency. In its most extreme form, the open economy model
presumes price level differences are instantaneously resolved and the money
supply passively adjusts to the real level of cash balances mandated by the

rest of the world. Thus, the direction of causation appears to be from domestic
prices to domestic money.

A number of problems arise in applying these models in the context of the
postwar period, however, because many

appear to fit neither a fully

open nor a fully closed mold. Exchange rates in a number of important instances
during the Bretton Woods era underwent substantial changes. The domestic monetary authorities in some cases seemed to pursue policies consistently at variance

is to estimate slightly more general models that relax some of the limiting

assumptions of the polar cases. For the most part, though, the empirical application of such models has been limited. Much of the empirical work is subject
to the objection that the emphasis is upon one, or at most a few, of a considerably larger number of potential avenues for the international transmission of
inflation.2
The merit in our approach is that it attacks the problem of structuring
the model in terms of the interrelationships among variables without a priori

limiting the range of investigation. Indeed, the tests we apply are intended
to provide evidence which will permit us to rule out some previous model—

identifying restrictions as being inconsistent with the data. Our method of

therefore, not only serves as a convenient point of departure for

models

and estimating more general models hit

provides a way of checking

that have been already estimated.3 A drawback of our approach, however,

is that the simple bivariate relationships underlying our tests may themselves
be subject to specification bias along the lines of a generalized omitted
variable error.

II.

THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS

To begin our discussion, we review the model underlying the monetary

approach to the balance of payments (MABP).4 We derive expressions

for the

rates of inflation and of monetary growth in the small open economy and point

out the model's implications for the time paths of both. In so doing, we point
out what we believe is one of the popular misconceptions surrounding the MABP:

the belief on the part of at least some, if not many, researchers that in the
most basic model prices will lead rather than lag money. We end by relaxing
some of the simplifying assumptions of the model and state the
implications

for our study of timing.

Monetary Approach Model

The simplest expositions of the monetary approach to the balance of payments

start with two behavioral equations and an equilibrium condition. The first
equation is a money demand function of the standard form, which, if we ignore

interest rates, we can write as
(1)

log (Md/P) k log

where M is the nominal stock of domestic money, P the domestic price level,

y permanent income, and k the income elasticity of demand. The second is a
simple purchasing power parity, or if the exchange rate is assumed perfectly

rigid, price arbitrage relationship

—4-.
(2)

P=ltP

where P' is the rest—of--world price level and it

the (constant) exchange rate.

The third is an equilibrium condition relating the nominal stock of money
supplied to the nominal stock demanded,

Taking logarithms of (2) and (3), differencing the results along with equation

This framework avoids focusing on the importance of the role

in velocity. In much of the literature, however, these dynamic relationships
are thought to do more: to have implications also for the time path of the

MABP model have put it, "there Is a clear presumption to (the] existence and

An Extension of the Basic Model
The following is a typical example of the mechanics of the basic model.

Consider a position of dynamic equilibrium in which the reserve—currency
coufltrys money stock and prices and the domestic money stock and prices
-

are growing at constant rates, for simplicity all assumed to be equal.
Now let monetary growth in the reserve—currency country increase. Its rate of

inflation will eventually follow suit. The increase in inflation will, via
arbitrage, be transmitted as an instantaneous and equal increase in inflation

in non—reserve currency countries. The new rate of inflation, in turn, will
mean that domestic real cash balances are now

more slowly than desired.

Therefore, after the fact, so will the rate of growth of the domestic money

from the model. In the model everything takes place within a single

period. For the reserve inflow to lag price equalization, actual and desired
nominal stocks of money would have to differ. That can be effected within the
model fairly simply but It requires replacing equation (3) with some form of
stock adjustment relationship like

demand for money studies suggest that lags in the adjustment of

actual to desired money balances exist for periods of at least one quarter
and perhaps a good deal longer. In a similar vein, other studies cast serious
doubt on an instantaneous equalization of price levels or their rates of change.
For a more elaborate model, why then should we postulate instantaneous agreement

of domestic and world inflation? Furthermore, for the sake of empirical realism,
more general rationales for divergence between actual and desired money balances

could also be incorporated such as departures from full employment. To derive
testable models to answer the questions of how inflation was transmitted internationally and to what extent it was a domestic phenomenon one might want to
relax these strong assumptions also.

First let us consider the question of price arbitrage. Here the empirical
evidence to date is inconsistent with convergence of overall rates of inflation
within a quarter and perhaps even within the period of several years.5 One
reason may be the existence of sizeable non—tradeable goods sectors. In this
instance, even if traded goods prices adjust quickly those of non—tradeable
goods may adjust only with a substantial lag.

And if that is the case, then

the domestic inflation equation, (4), and the domestic money growth equation,
(5)

would

both have to be rewritten to take account of the differences

speeds of adjustment of prices between tradeable and non—tradeable goods

across countries.6 The end

result

is that the timing relationship between

domestic monetary growth and overall inflation becomes less easy to determine.
Given a sufficiently slow adjustment of prices of non—tradeable goods, domestic
inflation might not be observed to lead domestic monetary growth.

—7—
The next logical step would be to relax the implicit assumption that

prices, in the reserve currency country, adjust fullyand instantaneously
to monetary changes. For example, consider the monetary transmission

mechanism Friedman and Schwartz (1963] outline for a closed economy. The
key element in their view Is the series of portfolio adjustments that an unanticipated change in monetary growth engenders.7

For example, suppose monetary growth suddenly increases. Initially,
market yields on financial assets and equities, and then a whole host of

The final equilibrium position is one in which monetary growth, inflation

If the asset approach is a reasonable expression of the adjustment mechanism,
then we have a further reason to suppose that domestic monetary changes in a
small open economy would not lag price changes.

We could also relax the implicit assumption in the MABP of full employment,
then the transmission mechanism operating through portfolio adjustment provides
a further rationale for domestic money actually leading prices. For examp].e,

the bulk of the increase in the nominal

economy would be reflected in output. Only after some time

elapsed would the effect be manifest upon prices alone.
In conclusion, the lead or lag of money over prices, in

what appears to

an open economy, is an uncertain guide to settling questions of causation

and more importantly the international transmission of inflation. We would view
a lead of prices over money and to a lesser extent a coincidence in movements
as prima fade evidence of the importance of foreign influences. But a lag of
prices behind money is consistent with either domestic or foreign monetary forces
being

the causative factor.

—9—

Other Implications of the Alternative Models

Fortunately these modifications of the explanation of the international
transmission of inflation have other empirical implications that can help
us differentiate among the alternative models. One testable hypothesis, of
course, is derived from the presumed operation of price arbitrage. For a small
open economy, if arbitrage were not instantaneous we would expect prices in
the rest of the world to lead domestic prices.

imilarly, if assets markets provide another linkage among countries we
would expect there to be a relationship among interest rates in one country
and those in the rest of the world during periods of fixed exchange rates.

Again, assuming that the effects are not instantaneously felt, we would expect
interest rates in the rest of the world, or in the reserve currency country,

to lead those in a small open economy. But the possibility that rates of inflation or interest rates are equated across boundaries does not preclude the
possibility that those rates are simultaneously determined along with movements

in reserves. That is, the rate of inflation and/or interest rate may not be

with respect to the balance of payments.

and domestic assets (domestic

components themselves, may also help to clear up some of the ambiguities that
surround the timing relationship between money and prices. Let us consider
three cases: the reserve currency country, a completely open small economy
and an intermediate case.

In the reserve currency country, e.g. the U.S., the increase in monetary
expansion underlying an increase in its inflation and ultimately that of the rest
of the world is the result of domestic credit expansion by the reserve country's

central bank. Accordingly, domestic assets will be positively related to, and

cause of variations in the growth of high—powered money. High—powered money,
therefore, will be negatively related to, and either lead or be coincident with
the balance of payments.

In a completely open small economy, movements in domestic assets are unim-

portant as an effective source of monetary change. An overexpansion of domestic
assets of the central bank ultimately will be nullified by reserve outflows;

underexpansion by reserve inflows. Changes in foreign reserve holdings of

The intermediate case is the most difficult to handle. Domestic assets and

Testing Timing Relationships

Timing relationships, for example between money and prices, are a
crucial element of a ful'l discussion of the structure of an economic model.

We have already described two classes of models, i.e., open— and closed—
economy models, which postulate fundamentally different timing relationships
for some group of variables, and which imply (cross—model) differences in

behavioral relationships among other variables. Here we define a timing
relationship as a relationship among a group of variables which demonstrates

the temporal precedence of one (or more) variable(s) over another. In this
paper, we concentrate on bivariate timing relationships.
To examine timing relationships, we use an incremental prediction
criterion introduced by Granger (1969) and developed by Sims
testing

(1972)

for

the temporal precedence of the money supply over nominal income

explicit in some monetarist models. Granger defines a causal relationship,
e.g., between X and Y, on the basis of the usefulness of information on

and D(L) are polynomials in the lag operator, L. The first theorem Sims
proves is that a necessary and sufficient condition for Y not causing X is

that either c(L) or D(L) be identically zero. For example, Y would not cause
X if, and only if, equation (9) could be written as

X = D(L)c.

The second theorem states that the failure of Y to

The

of a particular representation between two variables (or, more accurately,
that we cannot refute its existence) there is good reason to treat one variable
as exogenous. Of course, one

variable, which may be exogenous with respect to

another

variable in the framework of a bivariate system, may be endogenous with

respect

to a third variable. Nevertheless, the treatment of certain variables

as exogenous lends structure to our economic models. The implied structure
permits us to choose a better model from among classes of models each of which
has a structure with a particular set of exogenous variables.

to accepting the null

actually exists. In defense of the methodology, we should point out that
this bias can also be a blessing. The simple fact of the matter is that in
most industrial countries inflation and monetary growth over our sample period

rose dramatically and at much the same time. Analyzing innovations in the
tire

series may be the only way to separate the influence of one

factor from

another.

In almost all instances we transform the data for the purpose of rendering

the series stationary. In general, we use

natural

logs of the levels which

mollify the heteroscedastic character inherent in most

aggregate economic

time series. We then difference the log levels usually once but we also

eliminate the trend in the mean of a series which is typically encountered

in aggregate economic time series. This procedure has the advantage of simply
and symmetrically "pre—whitening" the data without the substantial time costs
and lost degrees of freedom one typically incurs when applying Box—Jenkins

techniques. Moreover, our procedure is not subject to the criticism that too
much has been removed since nearly all aggregate economic time series regression
analysis must consider the transformation we apply in order to come to terms

with the estimation—efficiency question. The one exception to the general
transformation

procedure was the (net) domestic asset versus (net) foreign

asset relationships for certain of the countries for which the net positions
took on a negative value. In these exceptional instances, we used arithmetic

Domestic Money and Prices

We summarize the money—price results in Tables 1 and 2. There we report

the F statistics for the Cranger tests of the relationships between three monetary aggregates, high—powered money, Ml and M2 and two measures of prices, the
GNP or GDP deflator (Table 1) and the consumer or other similar retail price
index

One

problem with the results is that in several of the countries the

Britain is the prime example. Using the GDP deflator, we find no influence

The data, therefore, establish a pattern that on the whole is consistent

with monetary explanations of the inflation process. They fail, however, to
corroborate the popular interpretation of the NABP, in which prices adjust

instantaneously but money supply adjusts only with a lag. Either domestic
monetary forces by themselves or international forces operating via some
combination of a reserve—flow mechanism and central bank reaction function
or perhaps both domestic and international forces were important.

the fact that the Japanese government exercised substantial direct control over
interest rates.

In

all of the foreign countries, therefore, some type of central bank

reaction function seems to have, existed over the sample period. The monetary
authorities in countries other than Canada apparently tried to offset the
effects of balance of payments movements on their domestic money stocks.
-.

The Bank of Canada, in contrast, seems to have done the opposite. Desirous,
perhaps, of maintaining a stable exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, the
Canadians

appear to have reacted to balance of payments inflows by engaging

in some monetary expansion of their own.
The Federal Reserve's actions ——

the results are hardly at variance
with what one would expect for the central bank of a reserve—currency country ——
appears

and

to have paid little attention to the balance of payments in conducting

policy. That policy, however, seems to have been the source of the sometime
sizeable U.S. balance of payments deficits during this period.
Sources

of Monetary Change

We ran two other series

of regressions and

performed the associated

tests to analyze the sources of monetary growth in the seven foreign
countries in the sample from two slightly different perspectives.15 In one
Granger

we compared movements in

the three domestic monetary aggregates in each of

the countries —— with the movements of their counterparts in the U.S. In

the other, we compared the movements in each of the domestic aggregates with
movements in foreign and domestic assets o that country's monetary authorities.

The first set of results was not terribly satisfactory. Only in the
Canadian and the German regressions were there significant positive relationships between the lagged U.S.

In

aggregate and the comparable domestic aggregate.

both countries, moreover, there were somewhat implausible significant reverse

influences

in several instances.

— 20

—

The foreign asset and domestic asset versus domestic monetary aggregate
tests were slightly better. For all the non—reserve currency countries
except the U.K., movements in lagged foreign assets made a statistically
significant contribution to the explanation of movements in at least one

of the monetary aggregates. Domestic assets, however, were a mixed lot.
For three of the countries —— Canada, Italy and the U.K. ——

domestic assets

•had no perceptible influence on any of the three monetary aggregates. For
the others ——

France, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands —— domestic assets

had a statistically significant, but negative, effect.

These latter results make nosense as relationships that explain central
bank behavior. Presumably they arise because of spurious correlation, which,
in turn, raises questions about the more acceptable results obtained with
foreign assets.

Our

SUMMARY

AND CONCLUSIONS

purpose in this paper has been to investigate the channels through

which inflation has been transmitted internationally. To do so we have focused
upon five areas that featured prominently in our theoretical discussion: the
relationship between domestic money and prices, the influence of foreign
prices on domestic prices, the influence of foreign interest rates on domestic
interest rates, the behavior of the central bank, and the relationships between
the components of high—powered money and the monetary aggregates.

The results we have obtained have several major implications. One stems
from the money—price relationship. In all countries, our tests showed a significant effect of lagged domestic money on domestic prices, which appears to be

fairly robust across the specifications we tried. The strength of these rela—
tionships suggests that one—shot and t•ransltory phenomena, e.g., money demand

shifts and fluctuations in velocity, are not likely to be the major causative

— 21 —

factors

of the inflation experienced by these countries. That is, such short—

term movements have not dominated the fundamental long—run equilibrium rela—

tionship between money and prices. Similarly, given the absence of a con—
sistent reverse relationship, i.e., from prices to money, for most countries,
an explanation of inflation that attributes it primarily to wage-push accommodated

domestic monetary growth appears doubtful for most if not all of the countries
in the sample.

by

The second set of results, the domestic versus foreign price comparisons,
has more negative than positive implications. They provide no evidence of a
strong

price arbitrage relationship and thus do not suggest

that domestic money

was purely passive or that foreign central banks were purely silent partners
to the U.S. monetary authorities. In this sense, the second set of results do
not contradict our other findings. They imply that the potential existed for a
nunber of the non—reserve currency countries to operate an independent monetary
policy, at least in the short run.

The way in which the actual transmission process worked was through asset

markets. In all countries but Japan, some evidence of interest arbitrage was
uncovered. Additionally, in all but the U.K., changes in foreign reserves had

a

statistically significant effect on at least one of the three monetary aggre-

gates. Furthermore, in Canada and Germany -— the countries that both had very

similar price experiences to that of the U.S. in the period prior to 1972 ——
U.S.

monetary variables had a significant effect on the domstic monetary

variables. Thus, when we combine the price comparison results with the interest
arbitrage, and the foreign reserve—domestic monetary aggregate results, we obtain
a picture of the operation of a self—regulating mechanism preventing long—run
monetary

control.

independence but allowing some scope for short—term domestic monetary

— 22 —

Another set of implications stems from what we have learned from analyses
of changes in the asset components of the central banks' portfolios and of

their relationships with changes in high—powered money and the two broader

monetary aggregates. These are, however somewhat tenuous. In a number of
countries ——

France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and to some extent Italy

and the U.K. —— we find evidence of some sterilization of reserve inflows.
For Canada, we found a significant positive effect of reserve inflows on
domestic assets.

On the whole, these are a priori appealing results that appear to explain

some of the differences among countries: low and moderate inflation countries
trying to avoid importing inflation from the U.S. and being at least partially
successful; Canada seeking to stabilize its price level and exchange rate
vis—a—vis the U.S. dollar; and Italy and the U.K. ——
countries ——

the

higher inflation

acquiescing in the face of reserve inflows and perhaps, though

the data are mostly moot on this point, going the U.S. one step better in the
way of monetary expansion.'6

two somewhat different approaches to this problem. The authors of

first paper estimate a reduced form price—equation under the assumption

that the eight countries are largely closed. They then go on to "open" the
model up, introducing foreign money and price shocks into the equations. The
authors of the second paper initially adopt a more open framework, developing

an internationally integrated simultaneous equations model with a variety of
inter—country

linkages. They retain the possibility, however, of the model

becoming

more "closed" by allowing for neutralization of reserve inflows by

domestic

central banks.

of the monetary approach.
