Wages, Nonwage Job Characteristics And Labor Mobility

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of a set of nonwage job charac-

teristics on the quit decisions of young and middle—aged men. The
empirical analysis shows that young men are less likely to quit
"physical" jobs or jobs with bad working conditions but are more

likely to quit repetitive jobs. Older men, however, are more likely
to quit jobs with physical requirements or bad physical conditions but

are less likely to quit repetitious jobs. After they quit, young men
experience an increase in the physical components of the job and a
decline in repetitiveness while exactly the opposite holds for the

older men. It was shown that the age differences in the impacts of
the nonwage attributes could be explained by the fact that young men
place greater weight on wage growth opportunities in the job and in the
physically demanding jobs there are good opportunities for wage growth,

while in the repetitive jobs, wage growth is slow. The finding that
young workers want to move into jobs that are simultaneously perceived
by older workers to be undesirable indicates how opportunities for
mobility can improve an economy's productivity.

WAGES, NONWAGE JOB CHARACTERISTICS AND LABOR MOBILITY
Ann P. Bartel

*

Since the timeof Adam Smith, the theory of equalizing differences
--

that

individuals are induced to accept less attractive jobs by

receiving compensating increases in their wages -- has been used by

economists as an explanation of the existence of wage differences in

the labor market. By definition, the theory has important implications
for understanding the mobility of labor since an individual's decision
to change jobs is based on all the characteristics of a job -— the wage

rate, fringe benefits and the nonpecunfary job attributes. Reynolds
(1951) explicitly recognized this in his case study of labor mobility

in a New England factory city in the years l9G-1948. While the,
analytical studies of labor mobility, that appeared after the Reynolds

study made important contributions to our understanding of the determi
nants of individual turnover behavior, they ignored the nonpecuniary
motives for turnover because of the lack of data on nonpecuniary' job

attributes.' The only study that examined the relationship between

worker quitting and nonpecuniary attributes was that of Viscusi (1979)
but his work was limited to an examination of the impact of the
industry injury rate on worker quit behavior.

In this paper, the analysis of individual turnover behavior is
expanded to consider the role of a set of nonwage job attributes.

In

particular, the relative importance of nonpecuniary returns at dif-

ferent stages in an individual's life cycle is explored. Data on the
nonwage attributes of an individual's job are obtained by merging the
Dictionary of Occupational Titles data set and fringe benefit data
from the Bureau of Economic Analysis with the National Longitudinal

Surveys of Young and Mature Men. In Part I, a framework for incorporating nonwage job characteristics into the job change decision is

presented. Part II discusses the manner in which the data set was
created. The empirical results are presented in Parts III, IV and V
and conclusions are given in Part VI.

I.

Framework

In a world characterized by imperfect information and/or changing
conditions or tastes, labor turnover is the means by which workers and
firms correct their errors.

If the match between a worker and a firm

is determined to be unsatisfactory, this can be rectified by a

separation. A worker compares his real income stream in the current

job, Y, with his real income stream in the alternative job, Y.

If Y — Y

a .c

is greater than the costs associated with mobility, the

individual will change jobs and thereby improve his economic position.

—3—

The important point to recognize here is that the real ircome
stream is composed of both monetary (wages and fringes) and non-

monetary forms of compensation. The latter should have a distinct
role in the turnover process for the following reasons. First, it is
usually more difficult to obtain information about nonpecuniary job

attributes unless some time is spent on the job. Therefore much job
turnover may take place as a way of learning about the characteristics

of various types of jobs. This would be true especially in the case of
young individuals. Second, as an individual ages, his preferences for
nonmonetary as opposed to monetary forms of compensation may change.
This could be due, for example, to changes in health status and family

responsibilities. To the extent that the relative mix between monetary
and nonmonetary returns could not be changed on a given job, a separa-

tionwould occur. For both of these reasocs, an analysis that ignored
the role of rionpecuniary job characteristics in the turnover process

would be unable to explain much of observed turnover behavior.2
The effect of nonpecuniary job characteristics on the individual's
job change decision can be obtained by estimating the following equation:

time period, W. is his money wage in the current job (before the quit),

nonpecuniary forms of compensation if the two were perfectly correlated.

attributes,

ence turnover behavior even though the wage is held constant (e.g.
education, experience, health, unionization),3 C1 is a vector of variables that measure the costs of mobility (e.g. wife's labor force

T. is job tenure and T.2 is the quadratic of job

participation),4

is

the residual. Since the decision to change jobs

is based on the difference between real income streams in the current
and alternative jobs (holding costs of mobility constant), the coefficients on W.,, F. and desirable NP. should be negative; the lower W, F1 or
desirable NP., ceteris paribus, the greater the probability of quitting
since the individual's skills are likely to be rewarded at a higher
rate in other firms.

II. Data
In order to compare the effect of nonpecuniary job attributes on
turnover at different stages in the life cycle, the quit equation is
estimated for the NLS Young Men's sample and the NLS Mature Men's
sample. The young men were between the ages of 124 and 24 in 1966 while
the mature men were betweeh 245 and 59 in that year. Since both samples

3These variables have been used in previous studies of job mobility. See Bartel and Borjas (1977) and Jovanovic and Mincer (1979).
41n the case of local mobility, a working wife should lc.,er the
cost of mobility since her earnings provide a cushion against the risk
associated with a job change.

5Jovanovic and Mincer (1979) show that the tenure-turnover profile
is nonlinear because specific capital accumulation in the firm is
eventually completed. Even if returns to specific capital do not decelerate with tenure, the qrowth of acceptance waqes guarantees a nonlinear tenure-turnover profile because of the dccl ining upper tail of the
wage offer distribution.

—5-

survey individuals over several years, a quit is defined to occur if
the individual quit the job he was holding in the base year over a

subsequent two-year perod. The two-year periods analyzed are 1967-69
and 1969-71.

In order to be in the sample, the individual had to be

employed both at the beginning and at the end of the relevant two—year

period. In addition, the young men were required to not be enrolled
in school while the mature men could not be retired from their regular

jobs. These restrictions insure that the sample is composed of primary
workers fully committed to the labor force and also guarantees that a
quit does not occur in order to leave the labor force.6
While the NLS data sets provide information on turnover, wages,
and personal characteristics, they do not provide information on fringe
benefits nor do they describe the nonpecuniary characteristics of the

job. An estimate of the fringe benefits that an individual is receiving in his current job can be obtained by using data collected by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis on the total expenditures for labor conpen—
sation, divided into wage and nonwage ccx'nponents, for 2-digit SIC

industries and similar data reported in the Annual Survey of Manufac-

turers for 3—digit SIC manufacturing industries. Brown (1980) has used
these data to create the ratio of nonwage compensation/wages for industries classified according to the 3—digit Census system and his data

set is used here for merging with the NLS samples. The use of this

6Given these restrictions, I am not examining all turnover incidents experienced by the men in the sample but have focused very
specifically on jOb chancies experienced by regular full-time workers.

-6-

ratio enables us to consider whether the wage and the nonwage forms
of compensation have equal impacts on the quitting decision.
Given the form in which the fringe data are available, we need
to express the quit equation differently than it is shown in equa-

tion (1). Define total monetary compensation received by the

+ F.

employee as M =
=

Then write the quit equation as:

+ ctln

M. +

a3NP.

+

....

(2)

This can be rewritten as:

Q. =

+ c&1lnW. +

a1ln(l

+

F./J)

+

+
cx3NP.

...

(2a)

or under the assumption that F/W is small,

cz + a1lnW. + a1 F./W. -

ciNP.

+

...

(2b)

Equation (2b) enables us to test whether wages and fringes have equal
impacts on quitting by using the logarithm of the wage and the absolute
ratio of fringes to wages (as calculated by Brown) as independent
variables and testing to see if the coefficients on these two variables are equal.

The second component of nonwage job attributes is the nonpecun—

iary characteristics of the job, or the working conditions. An
important source of data on job characteristics is the Dictionary of

Occupational Titles (DOT) file. Originally, each of over 13,000 DOT
occupations was assigned a dummy variable for each of about twenty joh

characteristics. These 13,000 occupations were then aggregated into
the nearly 300 3—digit Census occupations using a conversion matrix

-7-

based on the October 1966 Current Population Survey. Thus the "score"
for each occupation represents the probability that a randomly
selected individual in that 3—digit occupation has the given job

characteristic. For those individuals in occupation categories 775
(operatives, not elsewhere classified) or 985 (laborers, not elsewhere
classified), the job characteristic data are further classified by the
3-digit Census industry code.

Since the NLS data provide information on the individual's 3-digit
Census occupation and industry categories, the NLS files and the DOT

file can be merged. The DOT file has been similarly merged by
researchers who were studying other topics. For example, Lucas (1977)
merged it with the Survey of Economic Opportunity file in order to
examine the extent to which wages adjust in the market in response to

the existence of positive and negative job attributes. Brown (1980)
merged the DOT file with the NLS Young Men's sample to expand on Lucas's
work in order to account for the correlation between job characteristics

and unobservable variables that affect the wage. Finally, Quinn (1977)
merged it with the Retirement History Study in order to estimate the
impact of job characteristics on the retirement decision.

For the study on the relationship between turnover and job characteristics, six characteristics from the DOT file were selected for merging with the NLS data.7

7The excluded characteristics were those describing the educational
training and aptitude requirementsof the job as well as variables such
as "job involves interpretation of feelings in terms of personal viewpoint," "job involves evaluation of information against judgmental
criteria.''

-8Cl)

The job requires performing repetitive functions

(REP)

(2) The job involves a variety of duties or the direction, planning and control of an entire activity
or the activity of others

(Wi-IVAR)

(3)

The job requires working under stress

(1,)

The job requires physical strength

(5)

The job has other physical requirements such as

(STRESS)

(REQST)

climbing, balancing, stooping, crawling, reaching,
handling, talking, hearing or seeing

(PHYS)

(6) The job involves bad working conditions(extremes
of cold or heat, humidity, noise, toxic conditions,
or hazards) (BADWC)

Reall that in the only previous study of quits and nonpecuniary
job attributes, i.e. the work by Viscusi, the industry injury rate was

used as a measure of nonpecuniary characteristics. The DOT data are
far superior to this measure for two reasons. First, they provide
information on several nonpecuniary attributes. Second, the data are
specific to the individual's occupation and therefore avoid the problem
faced by Viscusi, namely that all occupations within an industry are not
•

likely to come into contact with the job hazard (e.g. clerical and sales
management jobs); in other words, an industry injury rate is not a

proper estimate of the hazards faced by individuals in specific ocupa
tions.

-9Table 1 presents the mean values of the wages and nonwage job
characteristics of the two samples. The mature men earn significantly higher wages than the young men and also have a significantly

higher ratio of fringes to wages. In the case of the DOT characteristics, the young men are significantly more likely to be in jobs
with bad working conditions (BADWC), jobs that have physical require-

ments (PHYS) and jobs that are repetitive (REP). The older men are
significantly more likely than the young men to be in jobs that are
stressful (STR) and jobs that involve a variety of duties (WHVAR).
The only inconsistent finding here is the greater likelihood of older
men being in jobs that require physical strength (REQST).

III. Quit Equations
In this section the results of estimating equation (2b) on the

merged data files are presented. Since the results for the two time
intervals, 1967-69 and 1969-71, were quite similar, the time periods

were pooled. Two dependent variables were used: QUIT, which equals
one if the individual quit his job during the relevant time period
and JOBREL, which equals one if the individual quit his job for
job-related reasons such as wages, working conditions, disliking

fellow employees, etc.8 Since the dependent variable is dichotomous,

8The alternative is to quit for personal reasons such as health or
family problems. 70 percent of the mature men's quits and 81 percent
of the young men's, quits were for job-related reasons.

the maximum-likelihood probit technique was used for estimation.

Table 2 presents the results for the yourg men while Table 3 shows

the results for the mature men. Only the coefficients on the wage,
the fringe benefit variable and the nonpecuniary job attributes are

shown. The other variables included in the quit regressions are
education, experience, the square of experience, tenure, the square
of tenure, marital status, health status, size of local labor market,
a vector of industry dummy variables and a dummy distinguishing the
two time periods.

The results show that money wages have a negative and significant
effect on the probability of quitting for both young and older men.
Fringe benefits also have a negative effect for both samples but the
effect is not significant for young men.

It is interesting to con-

sider whether the coefficients on LWAGE and FRINGE are significantly

different from one another for either sample. The results of the
likelihood-ratio test show that only in the case of job—related quits

by the older men do fringes have a larger impact than wages. In all
other cases the wage and fringe coefficients are not significantly

different. These results are important since they indicate that the
relative values placed on the two forms of monetary compensation

change as an indvidual ages. This may be in response to changing

tastes,

family responsibilities or health conditions.9

9The test is performed by calculating the ratio of the restricted
and unrestricted likelihood functions. Minus two times the logarithm
of this ratio is distributed chi—square.

—1

1}

The effects of the nonpecuniary job attributes are shi;n in
Tables 2 and 3 in three ways.

In Columns (1) and (tt) the six variables

are used together. In Columns (2) and (5) the variables are used
separately in the equation so that these columns in effect report

results from six different equations. Finally, in Columns (3) and (6),
the six variables are collapsed into three factors that resulted from

a factor analysts of the variables. They are: BRP which is composed of BADWC, REQST and PHYS and therefore measure the uphysicalu
components of the job, RWH which equals REP minus WHVAR and therefore
measures the repetitiveness or lack of variety in the job, and STRESS

which measures whether the job requires working under stress. These
different specifications of equation (2b) were used because of the
high degree of correlation among many of the nonpecuniary variables.
The results show that for the young men, bad working conditions
and physical requirements do not have a significant impact on quitting
while strength requirements actually lower the probability of quitting

for a job—related reason (in column (5)). The factor that is composed
of these three variables, BRP, has a negative effect which is close to

significance for job-related quits. Repetitiveness, variety of duties
on the job and control over an entire activity have important effects

on the probability of quitting for young men. REP is positive and
significant in Columns (2) and (5) while WHVAR is negative and sign ifi-

cant in Columns (1), (2), (4) and (5). Further, the factor that
combines these two variables, RWH, is positive and significant for all

quits and for job—related quits. The stress variable is negative and
almost significant in

Coiumn (1).

In sum, young men are more likely

- 1 5-

to stay on jobs that are "physical," jobs that are stressful, or
jobs that are non-repetitive and involve the control over an
entire activity.

The results for the older men are quite different. In Table 3
we see that the presence of bad working conditions increases the
probability of quitting and this is significant for job—related quits.
Further, the factor that measures all of the "physical" components of
the job is positive and again, this is significant for job—related

quits. In addition, older men are less likely to quit jobs that
involve repetitive tasks as shown by the coefficients on REP and RWH.
In sum, the results in Tables 2 and 3 confirm the roles played
by wages, fringe benefits and nonpecuniary job attributes in the turn-

over decision. An important finding is the existence of differences
in the impacts of the nonpecuniary characteristics across age groups.

Young men are less likely to quit "physical" jobs or jobs with bad
working conditions and are more likely to quit repetitive jobs while
older men are more likely to quit jobs with bad physical conditions or

physical requirements and are less likely to quit repetitive jobs. A
possible reason for these age differences is explored in Part V.

IV. Changes in Wages and Non-Wage Job Characteristics
The analysis in Part I I

showed that, holding other things

constant (e.g. the wage arid fringes), young men quit "repetitive"

jobs while older men quit "physical" jobs. An interesting issue is
to consider what happens to these men after they quit. Do the young
quitters move into jobs that are less repetitive and do the older

-16-

quitters take jobs that are less physical? The results in Tables 2

and 3 do not necessarily provide answers to thesequestions. Given
the longitudinal nature of the data, however, the questions can be
answered by examining changes in wages and nonwage job charac-

teristics over thetwo—year period under study. This is done by
estimating an equation in which the dependent variable is the change in
the job characteristic and the independent variables are a set of
personal characteristcs and a set of dummy variables indicating the

individuals mobility status over the relevant two year period. The
coefficients on the mobility variables show how the job characteristic
changed relative to the change experienced by the stayers.
This type of analysis is also valuable because it provides a method

of coping with potential problems due to population heterogeneity. It
is possible that in the quit equations estimated above the job characteristics proxy unobserved personal characteristics which measure the

propensity for turnover. For example, unstabl&' young men may tend to
be in repetitive jobs. By examining changes in job characteristics, this
bias is avoided because unobserved personal characterics are likely to

be constant over time. The change in a given individuals status can
be directly observed.

Tables L and 5 present the coefficients on the mobility variables

from the "change equations. Mobility status is indicated by JOBREL
-- a

job-related quit took place, PERS— a personal reason quit took

place, and LAYOFF - a layoff took place. The coefficients in Table !+

show that young men who quit for job-related reasons experience larger
wage increases than stayers but the ratio of fringes to wages remains

-17-

the same. For these quitters the physical components of the job (as
summed up by BRP). increase and repetitiveness Cas measured by RWH)

declines. Both of these changes are close to significance. The
change in physical requirements (PRYS) is significant at the 5 percent

level. These results are consistent with the findings from Table 2
indicating that the heterogeneity bias was not dominating those results.
The coefficients in Table 5 show that older men who quit for job—related
reasons, like their younger counterparts, experience a significant

increase in wages relative to stayers while the fringe benefit/wage

ratio remains the same. As anticipated, for these men the physical
components of the job (BADWc, PHYS, BaR) decline while repetitiveness
increases and variety of duties decreases (the sum of these effects is

demonstrated by RWH). These results are close to significance; the
strongest result is a decline in BADWC. Again, these findings are consistent with the earlier findings in Table 3b.

The results in Tables 4 and 5 show that quitters obtain increased

compensation in their new jobs. The interesting finding is that both
monetary and nonmonetary forms of compensation increase. For young
workers, an increase in nonmonetary compensation means a decrease in the
repetitiveness of the job while for older men it means a decrease in the
job's physical requirements.

V.

Explaining the Observed Age Differences
One of the major findings of the analyses presented ici Parts I II

and IV is that there are distinct age differences in the roles played by

various nonpecuniary characteristics in the mobility decision. Young

people tend to quit jobs that are repetitive in nature while older
people tend to quit jobs that have physical requirements or bad working

conditions. A possible explanation for this age difference is that
older people are more likely to experience health problems that may

force them to 1eave physically demanding jobs)0 This hypothesis can
be tested by creating interaction terms between the nonpecuniary characteristics and the health variable and adding these terms to the older

men quit equations. The argument would be that, among the older men,
those with health problems are more likely to quit jobs that are

physically demanding or have bad working conditions. The results,
not reported here, do not support this hypothesis; the interaction term
between HLTH and BRP was never significant.

A second hypothesis that could explain the age differences relates
to the opportunities for investment and wage growth on the job.

It is

possible that those jobs that are physically demanding or have bad working conditions are also the types of jobs on which the individual can

experience rapid wage growth. Since young men would place greater weight
on these growth opportunities than the older men (in view of their longer
time horizon) we would then expect to observe young men being less likely

to quit the physically demanding jobs. This hypothesis was tested by
estimating wage growth equations for a sample of young men who did not

change jobs over the relevant two-year time period. In addition to a
vector of personal characteristics, the nonpecuniary variables Cthose

the NLS samples, 11 percent of the young men and 22 percent of
the older men reported that they had health problems that limited the
kind or amount of work they could do.

—21-

produced by the factor analysts described in Part Iii) were used as

independent variables in these equations. The coefficients on the
nonpecuniary variables are shown in Panel A of Table 6. The results
show that young men in jobs that are physically demanding or have bad
working conditions (BRP) have significantly larger wage growth in both

dollar and percentage terms. Further, young men in jobs that are
repetitive in nature (RWH) have significantly smaller wage growth in

both dollar and percentage terms. Since these equations are restricted
to individuals who did not change jobs over the two-year period, it is

possible that a selection bias exists in Panel A. An alternative test
that avoids this bias is shown in Panel B where a wage equation is
estimated on the full sample and the variables BRP, RWH and STRESS,
their interactions with tenure, and a vector of personal characteristics

are included. The results show that the tenure interaction with BRP is
positive and close to significance while the tenure interaction with RWH

is negative and significant. Recall from Part III that young men were
less likely to quit the physical jobs but more likely to quit the

repetitive jobs. The results in Table 6 provide an explanation for
these findings, namely, that young men quit in order to improve their
opportunities for wage growth.'1

The opportunities for wage growth that exist in the physical
jobs do not appear to be due to formal company training programs. Even
when a variable indicating the acquisition of such training was included
n the wage growth equations, the positive ard significant effect of BRP
remained. Growth opportunities on these jobs are obviously due to
informal methods of training and skill acquisition.

VI. Summary
This paper examines the impact of

set of nonwage job

character-

istics on the quit decisions of young and middle-aged men. The data
set ws constructed by merging the data in the National Longitudinal
Surveys of Young and Mature Men with data from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles File and the Bureau of Economic Analysis file on fringe

benefits. The empirical analysis showed that many of the nonwage job
attributes had significant impacts on worker quit behavior and there
were differences in the effect! of the nonwage characteristics across

age groups. Young men were less likely to quit "physical" jobs or
jobs with bad working conditions but were more likely to quit repeti-

tive jobs. Older men, however, were more likely to quit jobs with
physical requirements or bad physical conditions but were less likely
to quit repetitive jobs.

These age differences were further demonstrated in an analysis
that examined changes in the nonwage components of the individual 's

job after the quit took place. This exercise also avoided the hetero-

geneity bias that may have plagued the quit equations. The findings
here were that young quitters experience an increase in the physical
components of the job and a decline in repetitiveness after the quit
while exactly the opposite holds for the older men who quit.
In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated that the quit decision
is multi—faceted and a thorough analysis requires information on the

various attributes of the individual's job. The observed age differ—
ences have important implications for the role that labor mobility

plays in allocating human resources withn the economy. The finding

-24-

that young individuals want

to

move into jobs that are simultan-

eously perceived by older workers to be undesirable indicates
how

opportunities

for mobility can improve an economy's productiv-

ity. Similarly, seniority rights, often viewed as constraints on
optimizing behavior, can be seen in this context as beneficial; they
enable senior workers to choose the jobs they prefer thereby creating
vacancies in jobs that young workers desire.
