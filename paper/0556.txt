Trade Adjustment Assistance Under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974:
An Analytical Examination and Worker Survey

ABSTRACT

The goals of trade adjustment assistance (TAA) are to ease transition,
compensate injury, and bleed political pressure for protectionism. Section
I of the paper outlines the economic principles underlying these goals, arid
their shifting historical importance in the U.S. Sections II and III of
the paper discuss the personal characteristics of a representative sample
of worker recipients of TAA in 1976, and their labor market success in
several subsequent years. Their experience is compared to that of a matched
sample of workers receiving standard unemployment insurance (UI). Coinpari—
Sons in Section II focus on differences in mean characteristics and
between the TAA and UI samples, controlling only for whether workersexperience
returned
eventually to the firm from which they were initially separated.
Comparisons
in Section III focus on differences between the TAA and UI samples in their
ability to recover lost employment and income, using a regression approach
that in principle controls for all relevant variables, and not for just one.
The most important conclusions of the research are the following.
(1) The majority of TAA recipients in 1976 were not permanently displaced,
but returned eventually to their former employers. A far greater proportion
of UI recipients suffered permanent displacement. (2) Workers receiving TAA
had higher incomes on average than their counterparts who received only UI.

INTRODUCrION AD OVERVIEU

Since

1962 in the United States, workers and firms suffering

transitional injury due to international trade have been able to benefit
from a U.S. program of "adjustment assistance." The goals of trade
adjustment assistance (TAA) have been to ease transition, compensate

injury, and bleed political pressure for protectionism.

these

goals, and their shifting historical importance. Sections II and

I. HISTORICAL AND ECONOMIC UNDPINNINGS OF
U.S. TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE1

1This section is an expansion of parts of my contribution to Corson
et al. (1979).

Economic Underpinnings
U.S. trade adjustment assistance (TAA) can be historically explained
as alleviating three problems that relate to international trade liberalization.
The first is a problem of distributional equity, reflected in protectionist
political pressure, and the second, of al].ocative efficiency, reflected in

much economic commentary. Political economy plays an important role in its
most recent justification ——

it

is now frequently defended as a bribe

necessary to avoid disastrous de—liberalizing trade wars.

(1) Distributional Equity. Except in ideal worlds, there are always

gainers and losers from trade liberalization. To design and carry out practical mechanisms whereby every loser was fully compensated (and more) would
require a mammoth diversion of any nation's resources from wealth—producing

to wealth-transferring activity. Yet in the absence of much mechanisms,
there may be instances in which trade liberalization is rejected or reversed

because it undermines a society's sense of equity, or because its rejection
creates an implicit contractual claim to comparable protection (insurance)

in similar circumstances by those who sacrifice their gains from trade
liberalization voluntarily (in order to inherit such insurance).2 Once one

grants either such altruism or such implicit social contracting, there

exists the possibility of a social consensus that the moderately increased satisfaction of the many from trade liberalization could be judged
insignificant compared to the dramatic uuhappiness imposed on the few.3

public opinion survey summarized in Laudicina (1973, pp. 51—57)
reveals that the most persuasive reason for opposing free trade was that
"free trade would put some American laborers Out of work because their jobs
can be done by foreign labor at much lower cost." 34 percent of the sample
said. they would "basically oppose" free trade. But only 15 percent would
continue to "basically oppose" it "if American workers who lost their jobs
because of free trade did not suffer any personal financial loss and were
retrained in jobs equal to or better than their old ones." The survey is
also summarized in Frank (1973, Appendix B).

Partial compensation is of course one compromise position between no

compehsation and maintenance of the status quo. It seems reasonable to
insist that government policies like trade liberalization, undertaken in
the name of the whole society, should not burden any one part of it
excessively.

(2) Allocative Efficiency. Furthermore, the kind of losses that trade
liberalization can cause are in part social losses. In the face of contractually—determined, downwardly rigid rates of increase4 in wages, rents,

41n an inflationary environment, not only factor prices themselves, but
their rates of increase over time may be temporarily rigid. Rigid rates
of increase that are embodied in existing contracts presumably hover on
average near the sum of expected rates of inflation and productivity growth.
borrowing costs, and dividends, trade liberalization that discourages domestic demand for import substitutes may cause temporary layoffs and idling

of productive land and equipment. Dislocated labor and resources are made

—5—

involuntarily unproductive until they can be re—absorbed.5 And even then,

5Characterizing dislocation as "involuntaryt' is controversial, as are
therefore the "social" costs that rest on that characterization. The economics of optimal contracts suggests that. labor and other factor suppliers
may be influenced by uncertainty and subjective attitudes toward risk to
choose (optimally from their viewpoint) rigid—price or rigid—rate—of—change
contracts and (optimally again) to accept the consequent quantity adjustments
to their employment and utilization rates. For similar reasons, producers
may choose to contract for product price rigidity, and may find the offer of
fixed—schedule contracts for factor prices more supportive of their goals in
the face of uncertainty than flexible—price contracts. When rigid factor
and product prices are optimally chosen in this fashioit, it is not clear that
there is any social cost to the resulting periodic unemployment and excess
capacity. In this case then, the principal defense of TAA must be on grounds
of distributional equity.

their productivity may remain temporarily below par if labor must be retrained, and if resources must be retooled, refurbished, and relocated ——

often

by labor and resources that are themselves diverted from other pro-

ductive activity. The national efficiency cost of this adjustment process
is measured by the value of goods which could have been produced, but were
not, because of temporary unemployment, underutilization, and diversion of

resources.6 (And there may also be very real subjective and psychic costs

6Ef forts to calculate these costs empirically have been made by Magee
(1972), Cline et al. (1978), and Baldwin et al. (1980).

to those unemployed that affect their future productivity unfavorably and
permanently).

Both of these concerns can be seen underlying the U.S. political!

economic/philosophical concept of "injury" that was prominently stressed
in the Trade Agreements program of 1934. The belief is that trade

and its reference to TM.

merits could "escape" from trade concessions that caused undue injury by
restoring, their previous trade barriers or acceptable substitutes.

The

domestic income distribution would presumably return toward the desired

status quo. And wasteful unemployment of labor and resources would be
discouraged.

Invoking the escape clause, however, appeared to many commentators to

be a costly way to avoid undesirable dislocation, it essentially surrendered
all resource—reallocation and standard—of—living gains that had come from
the trade concession in the name of avoiding inequity and dislocation ——

thereby throwing out the baby with the bath water. Furthermore, under the
rules of the CATT, recourse to the escape clause allowed trading partners

to be compensated8 through retaliation —— which could sometimes impose

8Two "needs" for compensation invariably arise in trade policy: the
need for domestic losers to be compensated by domestic gainers, and the need
for foreign losers to be likewise compensated. In both cases, once the merit
of compensation is granted, the key problem is finding the most efficient
(or least inefficient) scheme for carrying it out. See Cordes and Weisbrod
(1979).

unexpectedly severe injury on the U.S. export.ables sector. Finally the U.S.

escape clause made other nations less willing to embark on significant multilateral liberalization, since they could not be certain of just how permanent
U.S. concessions would be (Metzger (1971,

p.

324)).

In practice, the escape clause was simply infeasible as a tool for
avoiding inequity and dislocation while pursuing expanded national pur—

—7—

chasing power through trade. Between 1947 and 1962, the U.S. Tariff
Conznission found injury in 33 escape—clause cases brought before it, and

split evenly in 8 more. Of the 41, the President invoked the escape clause
in 15, and refused to do so in 26, presumably with an eye to foreign re-

action and retaliation. In the 15, at least some beneficial trade liberalization was abandoned. In the 26, at least some undesirable injury was left
unrequited.

To several comniissions and commentators in the 1950's, this Hobson's

choice was neither intrinsic nor inevitable.9 Most explored and recommended

9Frank and Levinson (1978, pp. 2—3) cite a number of examples, including:
an influential article by Clair Wilcox (1950); the "Bell Report" (U.S. Public
Advisory Board for Mutual Security (1953)); and the well—publicized 1954 ideas
of David McDonald, president of the United Steelworkers of America in the
"Randall Report" (U.S. Commission on Foreign Economic Policy (1954)). For
eight years following McDonald's proposal Congressional bills were introduced
that codified the idea of trade adjustment assistance. But no hearings were
ever held, even during consideration of the 1955 and 1958 extensions of the
Trade Agreements Act (Metzger (1971, p. 323)).

alternative ideas that later became embodied in trade adjustment assistance:
(1) directly targetted financial support to compensate both dislocated labor
and firms; and (2) encouragement to both labor and firms to re—orient quickly
their skills, resources, and enterprise toward expanding buoyant industries
(such as exportables) where their productivity would be enhanced in the long

run. It was hoped that the former aspect would ease distributional inequities
from trade liberalization, and thereby remove political obstacles to it. It
was hoped that the latter aspect would reduce the duration of inefficient,
involuntary unproductivity for resources moving among sectors, and thereby
reduce the economic cost. of trade liberalization. Neither aspect, of course,

-8-

would force the U.S. to forego beneficial trade concessions. And neither
would provoke foreign anger, retaliation, or reluctance to bargain.

Adniin—

istrative resource costs of each kind of compensation would probably have
seemed

comparable

—— some government agency would have to investigate and

recommend in each case, and the executive branch would have o approve or
deny the recoitiniendation. For all dimensions taken together, therefore, trade

adjustment assistance seemed in principle to dominate escape—clause relief.

(3) Bribes. In recent years, the issue underlying trade adjustment

assistance has changed from T0 much trade liberalization?" to "how much
protection?". As a result, TAA is frequently defended from a new point of
view that springs from political economy. It is argued that if TAA were
not available, the political forces for increased protection would dominate,
imposing large social costs through inefficiencies that would increase

exponentially as trade barriers rise. TM still assists and adjusts ex post.
But now it also bribes ex ante those coalitions of losers from trade that

would destroy a socially beneficial status quo in the absence of TM. In
its new role, then, TAA has additional distributive

and allocative effects:

compensating groups with credible threats to do social harm, and avoiding
the allocative inefficiencies that are the instruments of that potential harm.

the preferable way of relieving any U.S. injury. A cautious Congress incorporated a carefully circumscribed program1° into the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

10Congressional caution was due largely to the unprecedented nature of
the program. The early 1960's also marks the beginning of a similar program
to assist Americans dislocated by military base closings, and to help them
adjust. These years also saw passage of labor "adjustment" legislation such
as the Manpower Development and Training Act (1962) and the Economic
Opportunity Act (1964). On these parallel programs to TM, see 1'rank and
Levinson (1978, Chapters 6 and 7). Trade adjustment assist3nce was also a
temporary feature of the Canadian—American Auto Agreement, and is summarized
briefly by Fooks (1971, p. 352) and Jonish (1970).
The most important distributional assistance provisions of this early TAA
program were:

——

for

labor: supplements to unemployment insurance (UI)

payments to replace 65 percent of normal income for up to one
year,11 and up to a year and a half for workers who were over

11One might argue that normal unemployment insurance would have been
sufficient. But that would give no weight to the social—choice motivation
for compensating this injury. Workers dislocated because of trade liberalization are paying a personal price for a policy deemed socially profitable.
On the other hand, workers dislocated because of similar socially profitable
policies such as deregulation, environmental control, and occupational safety
and health standards receive no compensation beyond UI.

the maximum income—support level of 65 percent of the average
weekly manufacturing wage;

The most important provisions that were designed to reduce inefficiency by
speeding adjustment included:

forecasts.

In practice, trade adjustment assistance under this legislation was

initially non—existent. The support of organized labor for the US. program
quickly dried up as seven years went by with significant import growth but

eligibility, and strict interpretation of the criteria by the Tariff Coinmis—

New England shoeworkers. Other studies of worker and firm experience
under the initial U.S. TAA program include McCarthy (1975b, l975c), Neumann
(1978), and Neumann et al. (1976). Studies of worker experience under the

that many firms and labor groups simply were unwilling to apply. Even

approval would have been unprofitable. For them, adjustment assistance might
just as well not have been available.
The Nixon Administration brought a shift toward less strict interpretations in the early 1970's, and revived U.S. adjustment assistance.

Both applications and approvals accelerated. Legislative revision of the
adjustment—assistance program under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 made an even

more dramatic impact, as revealed in Table 1. Most dramatic of all is the

—12--

increase in petitions and projected outlays brought on by the auto—centered

recession of 1979—80. These are not reflected in the table but have been
estimated to require an extra $1 billion of outlays in fiscal 1980 and

$0.4 billion in fiscal l9l (Washington star, April 3, 1980). 859 petitions
fo.r TAA were filed during the first three months of 1980 alone (Rosep
(1980, p. 2))!

The Program Under the Trade Act of 1974
Under the Trade Act of 1974, the number of wbrkers certified eligible
for TAA benefits quickly rose to. more than 10 times its annual average under

even the liberal administration of the former prcgram. And budget outlays
mushroomed comparably.
Statutory changes that made adjustment assistance more attractive

included: (1) raising labor's potential income support with TAA supplements
to 70 percent of normal income, as long as this did not exceed 100 percent
(raised from 65 percent) of the average weekly manufacturin.g wage; (2)

requiring that labor cases be determined in two, not eight, months, by the
Secretary of Labor, and not by the slow—moving, quasi—judicial International

Trade
out

Commission (ne the Tariff Commission); (3)

providing separate funds

of tariff revenues for retraining trade—displaced workers;

and (4)

allowing reimbursement for a portion of job—search expenses.
But by far the most important statutory changes related to eligibility.
First, adjustment assistance was made potentially available to firms and
labor injured by imports f or

reason, whether because of government

trade concessions or not. And second, imports needed only to contribute
importantly to the injury, not be its major cause.

While

the

second change is laudable from the point of view of equity

(and perhaps efficiency), the first raises awkward questions regarding
a distributional defense of TAA ——

that

policy for the national interest

not impose excessive burdens on any citizen. Why, for example, should
workers be compensated at higher than UI levels for market—determined injury

just because the markets are international? Is it economically defensible
that the U.S. compensate domestic producers who are in an extreme case lazy
or slow to adopt technological advances, thereby losing competitiveness to

foreigners? Compensation for such injury is possible under the new adjust-

ment—assistance program. The increasingly familiar answer is that "political
reality" dictates such compensation as a super—normal bribe to mollify

protectionists. But the potential conflict between this rationale and a
society's distributional goals is apparent. Such bribes may create
inequities rather than curing them. And they clearly distort market signals
and incentives.13

13Alan Deardorff has argued that one should not overemphasize the
severing of TM's link to trade concessions under the 1974 Act. TAA is
still linked to government trade policy to the extent that if it were not
there, then increasingly protectionist trade barriers would substitute for
it. One can view the U.S. government thus as using TAA in the familiar
historical way to facilitate "concessions" on potential trade barriers
(that is, to reject recourse to them).

A second answer might begin with the observation that most foreign
governments are committed to aiding industries that suffer structural dis-

location and adjustment problems from any source, including the market)4

14Recent summaries of foreign adjustment assistance programs, some
trade—related and some not, exist in Frank and Levinson (1978, Chapter 9),
Weisz (1978, Part III and Appendices B and C), and U.S. General Accounting
Office (1979). Baldwin and Bale (1980) contains a useful summary of Canadian
adjustment assistance programs, and on these, see also Jenkins et al.
(1978).

assistance (equity) provisions have been considerably more successful than

its adjustment (efficiency) provisions. And success

Insufficient attention has

been drawn to the intrinsic incompatibility of "assistance" and "adjustment"

programs as presently structured: one of the surest ways to bring about
adjustment would be to provide no assistance, and assistance that compensated
for every burden would leave no incentive to adjust.

One of the surprising

conclusions of the worker survey reported on in subsequent

sections was the

large number of TAA—supported workers who returned not only to their former
industry, but to their former firm (roughly 3 out of every 5), and even to
their former job.15 Generous TAA benefits niay even

a worker is certified eligible for TAA benefits, that eligibility is automatically activated for all layoffs covered by the petition in the subsequent
two

years.
Based on the survey of 1976 recipients that is described below, adjust-

ment aspects of the 1974 program ——

training,

counseling, job—search, and re-

location allowances —— were neglected about as much under the 1974 program

as earlier. Less than 10 percent of TAA recipients took advantage of
available employment services, and published figures on cumulated experience

are even more discouraging (U.S. Department of Labor (1980)). Only 1 Out of
every 30 TAA recipients from 1975 through 1979 (November) entered training;
only 1 out of roughly 200 received a job—search allowance; and only 1 out

of roughly 350 received a relocation allowance.17

17Use of these adjustment services has increased markedly among recent
TAA recipients, however. See footnote 2 of Aho (1980).

Distributional goals and realizations are by contrast much more con-

sistent. Combined UI and TAA payments replaced 76 percent of after—tax
income on average for as long as the eligibility of workers surveyed lasted.

Nevertheless, the survey reveals that workers who are permanently displaced
by trade seem to suffer a large income sacrifice even three or four years
after displacement (10 percent lower incomes for ten than in their former
job, compared to 20 percent higher incomes for comparable UI recipients;
5 percent lower for women, compared to 16 percent higher).

And it seems

there still remained substantial unpredictability and unduly long delays in the
process of petition, certification, and delivery of benefits. Despite the

II. TAA EXPERIENCE UNDER THE TRADE ACT O 1974: MEANS AND
CROSS—TABULATIONS FROM A COMPARATIVE SURVEY OF WORKERS

Describing the beneficiaries of the program, including the stability,
level, and growth of their income, is more important for TAA than for many
other government programs because of its distributional and political jus-

tifications. Sensible assessments of the program must identify whether those
who are aided are in fact "deserving" by some measure of equity or political

muscle. And such assessments should attempt to measure the extent to which
program benefits offset injury.19 How the "deserving" are defined —— whether

19As described below, this aspect of any assessment is methodologically
difficult. In principle, TAA benefits are paid whenever trade—related injury
is documented, and are not paid when no injury is present. Thus in principle,
one can observe instances only of simultaneous injury and benefit or of the
absence of both. That is, one can detect only the net influence of injury
and benefits. Short of social experimentation in which some economic agents
experienced either the injury or the benefits, but not both, there seem to
be only very subtle, uncertain ways of quantitatively assessing the scope of
injury alone, the impact of benefits alone, or the "extent to which program
benefits offset injury." A careful attempt is Jacobson (1979).

as poor, old, ambitious, productive, politically powerful, or some combination will not concern us here.

We will characterize workers receiving TAA, and not firms. In this
section we do so by comparing them one—dimensionally and two—dimensionally
to a sample of peers, focussing on unconditional mean differences or else

controlling for one other variable via cross—tabulations. In the next section
we compare TAA recipients to their peers multi—dimensionally, controlling
when feasible for all variables that are alleged to cause different worker
experience via regression analysis.

A Recent Survey

The most recent survey of worker recipients of TAA was commissioned by
the U.S. Department of Labor, and is

summarized in Corson et aL (]979)20

20Previous surveys are referenced in note 12 above.

Sample design and survey methods are described at length in Appendixes A and
B of that report.

Interviews were carried out from November 1978 through February 1979,
virtually all of them in person, under the supervision of Mathernatica Policy

Research, Inc. (Princeton, New Jersey). Interviewees had received first
TAA payments in 1976, and the survey sample was designed to represent the

population of 1976 TAA recipients. 84 percent of those interviewed were
separated from their employer in late 1974 or 1975; 16 percent were

separated in 1976. For comparison purposes, a smaller sample of UI recipients (not receiving TAA) was selected from the same state unemployment offices

that administered benefits to TAA recipients.21 The interview form was pre—

21For reasons described in Corson et al. (1979, pp. 195—198), the UI
sample was not matched precisely to the TAA sample with respect to either
industry (see below) or time of separation. Only 65 percent of the UI sample
left their jobs in late 1974 or 1975. Several comparison groups other than
comparably located UI recipients were considered, yet seemed like inferior
choices for reasons described in Corson et al. (1979, pp. 191—96).

tested and modified accordingly. Interviewers were trained and continually
supervised. Interview data were cross—checked through subsequent calls and
visits by supervisors. The response rate among TAA recipients was 70 percent,

—21—

and among UI recipients 54 percent. A few known characteristics of non—
respondents (from state unemployment office records) were compared to char-

acteristics of respondents. These suggested little non—response bias, and
no particular reason for believing that biases which remained affected one

group unduly compared to the other. The ultimate survey sample consisted f
—— 963 TAA recipients ——
—— 538

UI recipients ——

The TAA sample was stratified by industry, represented in the same proportions that characterized the industry source of 1976 TM payments. Columns
(1) and (2) of Table 2 describe the inter—industry manufacturing distribution
of workers in the survey (only one worker interviewed was in a non—manufacturing
industry) and in the corresponding national population of TAA recipients.

Column (3) suggests that the distribution has some claim to generality, having

not changed significantly during the first five years of the new program. In
late 1979 and early 1980 however, the auto industry's share of TM certif 1—

cations mushroomed. Column (4) describes the matched UI sample in the survey.
Interviews were conducted in 7 states, 3 chosen for the high proportion
of TAA payments being made there (Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York), and 4
chosen randomly (California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Virginia) from a set
of 4 industry groupings, with the probability of selection being proportional

to the number of TM payments in each state. 65 percent of the national population of TAA recipients resided in those 7 states. Equal numbers of interviews were conducted at each of 10 locations within each state. The locations
were chosen from a random sample of TM petitions classified by industry and
weighted by the number of workers each petition covered. The locations ultimately selected reflected a significant variety of labor—market conditions.

Characterizing

TM Recipients

The most important information in evaluating the TM program concerns

the characteristics and experience of workers receiving TM. Some of these
characteristics and experiences in our sample confirmed widespread impressions;

many did not. Some are well—known from previous surveys; others have received
little notice.

—24—

It is known, for example, but undermphasized, that almost all recipients of TAA work in manufacturing industries. Hence, their peers are
most accurately. other manufacturing workers, not U.S. labor at large. It
is also well known that TAA recipients are more concentrated than their

peers in footwear and apparel, as Table 2 reveals. It is less well known
that the auto industry is the source of a much higher proportion of TAA
recipients than of their peers —— even as eaxiy as 1976. These industry
differences between the TAA and UI samples can be argued to be
the sole source of differences between beneficiaries of TAA and others,

without any reference to international trade. But this observation begs
the question of what caused the industry differences ——

to

which a sensible

answer is international trade.
Among the most important findings of this survey is that TAA recipients
were much more likely than UI recipients to experience temporary unemployment

or reduced hours, as revealed in Table 3. They were only barely more likely
than UI recipients to have worked for a company that closed down, and much
less likely to have changed their industry or occupation between separation

and the interview, roughly three years later. For TAA recipients, worker
experience differed significantly among those on permanent layoff, those on

temporary layoff, and those on reduced hours. Workers on temporary layoff
made up the majority of the TAA caseload. Since most previous commentary on
TAA has focused on permanently displaced workers, it is useful here to
describe the connection between temporary worker displacements, international
trade, and the TAA program.

Temporarily displaced workers have both unique advantages arid unique

problems when compared to the permanently displaced workers usually visu-

alized as being primary recipients of TAA. Relative to permanently displaced
workers, the duration of trade—related dislocations for those temporarily

displaced is likely to be short, and their income loss only moderate. But
if

such short spells of unemployment occur more frequently because of trade,

workers who are prone to temporary dIsplacement may still suffer dispropor-

tionately

from

unpredictable and uncertain

income streams.22 Compensation

22Thjs possibility rests on the assumption that wages and other provisions of contracts do not vary to offset the unpredictable and uncertain
income streams. If contract terms do take account of this uncertainty, then
there would seem to be no reason to believe that the uncertainty produces
suffering over the long run, and no case for compensation. See note 5 above.
This possibility notwithstanding, uncertainty is precisely the reason why
many policyniakers subscribe to the need to compensate nations (analogously
to workers) for volatile export earnings through the IMP's Compensatory Financing Facility and the EC's STA3EX. These are self—financing loan programs,
however, which raises the question of whether the TAA program should include
concessionary (but repayable) loans for certain purposes.

for

such volatile incomes and job prospects might be art important justifica-

tion for paying temporarily displaced workers. No clear adjustment (efficiency)
motive exists for TAA in this case because it is not obvious that the workers
should

leave

the industry on economic grounds.

But why should trade increase the volatility of worker incomes in import—

competing industries? There seem to be a number of reasons. First, in
industries such as steel, dumping is widespread and unpredictable, causing U.S.
business to sag notably some years (even quarters) and rebound itt others.

Second, speculative import purchases may take place when dollar depreciation

nature of a worker's dislocation inhibits job search and if TAA keeps workers
affiliated with a declining industry when more productive positions are
available elsewhere.

Similar questions arise with respect to the availability of TAn for

workers placed on reduced hours by their employers. Presumably employers use

workers to a declining industry arid discouraging their job search. 'rom

an

efficiency perspective, it is clearly better to have half as many workers
full—time (with the remainder in other jobs) than the historical work force
all working half—time.

Some findings from the present survey confirm common beliefs about TAA

recipients,

whether permanently, temporarily, or partially dislocated. Table

4 reveals that they are somewhat older, less educated, more stable in their
employment history, and more likely to be union members, female, minority
status, married, and the head of a household than the average unemployed
worker.

24

24l comparisons are to unemployed manufacturing, workers who receive UI
payments. Such comparisons must be treated with caution, however, because of
their one—dimensional nature. Pro—TAA commentary, for example, tempts one
to think of recipients as especially "deserving" because they are both older
and less educated. It is probably more accurate to think of them as less
educated because they are older. Similarly, age may explain marital status,
and both explain stability. Industry mix may explain minority status. Structural expansions of the regression analysis outlined in the next section of
the paper could in principle control for such internal causality.

But they are not likely to be poorer. Fewer fall below the poverty line.
And their pre—dislocation incomes (principally for men) exceed the incomes of

their peers, as do household incomes. This finding seems to preclude any

The duration of their initial unemployment spell is longer than for UI
recipients, and the incidence of recurrent separations is slightly more

frequent. Those TM recipients never recalled to their previous job

Some of these findings are surprising in light of previous surveys of

—32--

TAA

recipients

(note 12 above). Part of the explanation can be found in

the rapidly shifting industrial incidence of injury from trade in the early

1970's. The relative importance of the footwear industry and the electronics
industry declined in successful TM petitions; the relative importance of
appare1 autos, and steel increased (apparel has since declined and footwear
has risen again, according to Table 2). This altered worker characteristics
among TM recipients because skill mix, ethnic concentration, job stability,

and average wages differ substantially from industry to industry. And it was
to be expected to the extent that cumulative and ongoing competitive pressures
(many from newly industrializing countries) reduce the industrial importance
of declining U.S. industries such as footwear and textiles by causing marginal
firms to fail.

The Sample as a Reflection of the Effects of Both Trade and AA
It would have been valuable to be able to measure separately the effects

of import competition on workers and the effects of the TM program itself
(see note 19 above). No continuous measure of the former was employed
besides the certainty that trade had been an "important" cause of dislocation,

as prescribed by the legislation embodying certification requirements.2

25The same problem exists for Jacobson (1979) and is discussed by him.
The technical counterpart to this staterrient is that the variable TAA (1 for
TM recipients, 0 for UI recipients), which underlies all the tabulations
and regressions in this paper measures the influence on workers of both
injury from trade and TM itself. Tabular information on TM recipients and
regression coefficients, therefore, reflect the frequently offsetting influences of injury and its policy relief.

It was impossible to know just how important trade alone had been in altering

wages and working conditions before and after TM receipt.

to offset the impact of trade on U.S.

it seenis likely that the survey and the analysis below understate

the (presumably unfavorable) effects of import competition on some U.S.

workers and the (presumably favorable) effects of TM. They do, however,
probably reflect the net effect of both forces with considerably more

accuracy. One test of the success of TM in achieving its distributional
goals would be that these net effects are small.
Measuring the impact of trade alone on workers is a difficult task.
Yet it is done subjectively every day in administrative determination of

certification. A valuable complement to surveys like the one summarized
would be research on the certification process itself. What economic and
other variables underlie decisions to approve or disapprove a TM petition?
Can one determine a set of variables and the weights attached to them that

predict the yes/no decision on the petition with some accuracy?26 If so,

See Baldwin (1976) for an attempt to do this with Congressional
voting patterns on commercial policy.

one could use those same variables and weights to measure the severity of work-

ers' injury from trade. One might also be able to explore the budgetary and
performance implications of changing the weights attached to the criteria
underlying certification, as is implicitly proposed whenever TM is legis—
latively reconsidered.

More precise descriptions of independent variables than provided in
Tables 6 and 7 are available from the author.

Employment and income recovery were selected for emphasis

in

this

section because they are thought to be the most important ways in which
trade—displaced workers would suffer compared with others in the absence

of the TM program. The upper left entry in each table suggests
that even with the TM program, though, trade—displaced workers have less

favorable experience than others. A TM recipient who was identical to a
UI recipient in age, experience, industry, socioeconomic status, etc. —

and even in the proportion of pre—separation income replaced by UI/TM
payments —— would nevertheless have worked 4.56 percent fewer weeks over
the three—year period, and be earning almost 1 percent (0.831) less per
week, than the otherwise comparable UI recipient.
The direction of these differences squares well with intuition,

although it is not clear what variables that are excluded from the

regression might account for it. But neither the direction nor quantitative size of these differences squares with the one— and two—dimensional

comparisons of Table 5 —— an anomaly that reveals the advantage of a
regression—based approach that holds all other things comparable (ceteris

paribus). The left—hand regressions of Tables 6 and 7 suggest that the

comparative employment recovery of TM recipients was less favorable than
suggested by Table 5, and that t1ir comparative income recovery was much
less unfavorable.

(4) TM recipients in the auto industry had much more favorable

(5) Rather than being a liability, the combination of greater age
and labor-force experience was favorable to employment recovery. Compared
to an otherwise identical 40 year old TM recipient with 20 years of labor

weeks per year more between separation and interview, and a 30 year old

with 10 years of participation worked 7 weeks per year less.
