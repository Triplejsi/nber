Tests of Equilibrium Macroeconomics
Using Contemporaneous Monetary Data

ABSTRACT

This paper uses contemporaneous monetary data to carry out econometric
tests of the "equilibrium" approach to modelling the relation between monetary

disturbances and macroeconomic fluctuations. The theoretical analysis introduces into an equilibrium macroeconomic model the availability of preliminary
data on current monetary aggregates and the process of accumulation of revised

monetary data. The econometric analysis tests two hypotheses derived from
this extended model. One hypothesis concerns the neutrality of perceived

monetary policy. The other hypothesis concerns the nonneutrality of errors
in preliminary monetary data. The econometric results imply rejection of

both of these hypotheses. These tests provide strong evidence against the
reality of the equilibrium approach.

This paper uses contemporaneous monetary data to carry out
econometric tests of the "equilibrium" approach to modelling
the relation between monetary disturbances and macroeconomic

fluctuations. The adjective "equilibrium," in our terminology,
denotes the class of macroeconomic models that assume that
expectaticns are rational, in the sense that private agents
behave as if they know the economy's relevant stochastic structure,
and that markets clear, in the sense that transactions realize
all perceived gains from trade, and that focus on incomplete
information about monetary disturbances as the main explanation
for the association of fluctuations in real
macroeconomic variables with monetary disturbances.
The essence of incomplete information about monetary disturbances in equilibrium models is that private agents cannot
perfectly anticipate the behavior of monetary aggregates and,
also, do not observe contemporaneously either the actual
values of monetary aggregates or the values of other macroeconomic variables such as average prices and aggregate
output.

With regard to direct monetary information, the classic
equilibrium models--for example, Lucas (1972; 1973) and
Barro (1976)--assume, specifically, that monetary policy is
partly stochastic and that available data provide no
informatiori on current monetary policy, but provide full
and accurate information on past monetary policy. The
starting point of the present paper is the observation that
this specification of monetary information is unsatisfactory
for at least two reasons.
First, it is an unrealistic abstraction that seems
contrary to the strategy of equilibrium modelling. Since the
early 1950's, the Federal Reserve Board has issued preliminary
monetary data with a lag of no more than one or two months.

Since 1965, this lag has been only eight days. Revisions of
this data, however, appear over a period of many months or
years. These revisions result from such factors as computational

—2—
corrections, benchmark changes reflecting fuller reporting, and
conceptual changes reflecting financial innovations. The
classic equilibrium models abstract from both the ex3bence of
contemporaneous preliminary monetary data and the process of
gradual accumulation of revised monetary data. The neglect of
contemporaneous data implies that private agents act as if
they ignore readily available and apparently relevant information, an implication that seems inconsistent with the idea of
rational expectations. The neglect of the process of data
revision implies, in contrast, that private agents act as if
they have an unrealistically large amount of information.
Second, abstracting from information about current
monetary policy causes the analysis to focus on the predict-

ability of monetary policy. Specifically, the main testable
hypothesis that emerges from the classic equilibrium models
is that only unanticipated monetary policy affects real
variables. Although some existing econometric results suggest
that the evidence is consistent with this hypothesis--see,
and Barro and Rush (1980)-—the
for example, Barro (1977)
hypothesis itself does not provide a strong test of
equilibrium models. Specifically, as some authors, such as
Barro and Hercowitz (1980) and Fischer (1980) , have
recognized, this hypothesis does not discriminate between
equilibrium models and an alternative class of models that
also assume rational expectations, but allow markets to
fail to clear.
The theoretical analysis in the present paper introduces
into an equilibrium macroeconomic model both the availability
of preliminary data on current monetary aggregates and the
process of accumulation of revised monetary data. This
generalization permits the derivation of a set of readily testable hypotheses that are specifically associated with the

equilibrium approach to macroeconomic modelling. The
econometric analysis in the present paper tests two of these
hypotheses.

—3—
One hypothesis concerns the neutrality of perceived monetary
policy. Specifically, the model implies that the innovation
in aggregate output and employment is uncorreLted both with
the contemporaneous measure of money growth implied by the
difference between the currently available estimates of current
and past money stocks and with lagged values of this measure.
The econometric results imply rejection of this hypothesis.
The other hypothesis concerns the nonneutrality of errors

in preliminary monetary data. Specifically, the model implies
that the innovation in aggregate output and employment is positively correlated either with the revision in the current
measure of money growth implied by the difference between the
preliminary contemporaneous measure and the finally reported
measure or with such revisions in past measures of money growth.
The econometric results fail to reject the contrary of this
hypothesis. Each of these two tests provides strong evidence
against the reality of the equilibrium approach to moaelling
macroeconomic fluctuations.

The theoretical analysis underlying these tests builds on
earlier work reported in King (1981) and Boschen and Grossman
(1980) .

Our models, like King's model, include a contemporaneous

estimate of the money stock, but instead of King's assumption
that this estimate is corrected in the next period, we assume

that developing the finally reported value of the current money
stock involves more than one revision and takes more than one
period. The present model extends our earlier work by allowing
for positive correlation in the subsequent revisions of current
estimates of current and past money stocks. This correlation
provides a source of persistence in the effects of monetary
disturbances on real variables, because it enables private
agents to use information about past monetary policy to draw

inferences about current monetary policy. Random factors in
past monetary policy influence this inference process and,
consequently, affect current real variables.
Our models also extend King's model by allowing explicitly for

—4—
systematic monetary policy in the form of a target monetary
growth rate that responds to the past behavior of aggregate output.
The present model introduces as well a production technology that
includes a direct effect of past levels of aggregate output on
the current level of aggregate output. This extension sharpens
the analysis by focusing attention or the relation between
contemporaneous measures of money growth and the innovation in
aggregate output, rather than, as in earlier work, on
aggregate output itself. Taken together, the effect of past
output on current output through the production technology
and the effect of past output on current monetary policy can
create a spurious correlation between aggregate output and
contemporaneous monetary data.

In what follows, Sections 1—3 set up the theoretical model,
solve the model, and interpret the solution. Section 4 derives
the two hypotheses to be tested.
Section 5 sets up and
reports the results of the econometric tests of these hypotheses.
Section 6 discusses general conclusions.
1.

Setup of the Model

In the existing literature, the development of equilibrium
macroeconomic models has involved various, but mutually

consistent, stories about information. The following setup
is based on the story told by Friedman [1968] in which the
representative producer infrequently purchases many of the items
that he consumes and, hence, infrequently observes their prices.
Consequently, he does not know precisely the extent to which a
change in the nominal value of his product involves a change
His
in his terms of trade between leisure and consumption.
subjective belief about consumption prices and, hence, about
the relevant real value of his productive services is the

critical expectational variable in the model. The assumption of
rational expectations means that this subjective belief is equal
to a true mathematical expectation conditional on available
information.
The structural equations of the model describe

—5—
the supply and demand for a representative good, the marketclearing condition that determines the output and price of this
good, the behavioral pattern of the monetary authority, the
nature of available monetary data, and the formation of rational
expectations about average prices.

The production technology for representative good z
makes current output of the good an increasing function of
productive services currently provided by producers of this
good. The current supply of these productive services depends
on the subjective belief of the representative producer
about the current relative price of this good and, because of
adjustment costs, on past levels of employment of these

productive services. Specifically, we assume the log—linear
form
(1)

where

y(z) =

+

a(L)y1(z)

y(z) is the log of the current supply of good z,

The current demand for good z depends on the value of

disturbances to aggregate demand and to the relative demands
for the various goods. Specifically, we assume the log-linear

Currently available monetary data include a series of preliminary
and revised estimates of finally reported values of monetary aggregates.
These estimates are obtained by sampling from the balance sheets of
the Federal Reserve Banks and of other financial institutions. We
assume log—linear estimating relations. For the current money stock,
we have the preliminary estimate,
(4.1)

tMt = Mt +

where tMt is the estimate of Mt reported in period t and
is a random variable distributed according to
—

N(O,cy).

For the last period's money stock, we have one revised estimate,

this last assumption in the implementation of the econometric
tests of the model.

Monetary policy involves a target monetary growth rate,
which reflects a systematic response to past aggregate output,

Within the context of equation (5), the random variable,
has at least two possible interpretations, corresponding

to different monetary policy processes. One possible process is
that Mt results from adding the term, bCL)yt_i, and a rndojn

The assumed rationality of expectations prescribes that
the subjective belief, Et(z)pt, is equal to the true mathe-

where I(z) is the assumed information set. This set contains
useful knowledge about the structure of the economy that
includes the form of the structural equations (1) - (6), the
values of relevant parameters, and the joint distribution of

the stochastic variables. The information set also contains
useful data that includes the current price of good z, the
past levels of average prices and aggregate output, and
the available monetary data. The potentially useful information

that is not in It(z) includes the current average of prices,

— 10 —

the

current level of aggregate output, the finally reported
values of current and recent past money stocks, and the realizations of current and past stochastic variables.

Solution of the Model

The explicit derivation of testable hypotheses from
the model specified by equations (1) — (6) requires a,
solution for aggregate output that satisfies the market-

clearing condition, given by equation (3), subject to
the assumption of rational expectations, given by equation (6).
We employ the method of undetermined coefficients to
calculate this solution. The first step is to combine
equations (.1), (.2), and (3) to obtain useful expressions for

pt(z) and y. Equating supply to actual output of good z
gives
=

[pt(z)

—

Et(z)pt)

+

a(L)yti(z).

Equating demand to actual output of good z gives
yt(z) = Mt -

pt(z)

+

v.

+

c(.z).

Equating these two expressions for y(z) and solving for pt(z)
gives
=

(a+l)

cLEt(z)pt + Mt +

v + c(z)

—

a(L)yti(z)].

Aggregating the equation of demand and output across all goods
gives
(8)

yt=Mt_pt+vt.
The second step is to conjecture a solution for pt(z)

that is a linear combination of a constant term, which allows
for known variables, and each of the relevant stochastic
disturbances. Taken together, equations (.4.1), (5), and (7)

imply that pt(z) is related to Et(z)pt, other known

— 11 —

variables,

and the unknown stochastic disturbances,

v, 6'

and e(z). The rational expectation, Et(z)pt, in turn should
involve joint inferences about the values of these stochastic
variables. These joint inferences, as shown below, depend
partly on known linear combinations of these variables. In
addition, because
is correlated with the unknown stochastic
variable, r these joint inferences are related to an
inference about

This inference, as also shown below,

depends, jointly with inferences about the unknown stochastic
variables,
and vi, on known linear combinations of

As indicated above, in calculating an

vt_i, and

explicit solution of the model, we ignore possible correlations
between
or
and errors in estimates of the money stocks

of period t-2 and earlier. A fully general solution would
have to include these erro'rs as well as other stochastic
disturbances in period t—2 and earlier.
The above discussion suggests that an appropriate form
for the conjectured solution is
pt(z) = nt0 +

where

Averaging equation (9) across all goods, given
yields a solution for the average price in the form,
(10)

Pt = II

The assumed rationality of expectations means that the
subjective belief, Et(z)pt, is equal to the true mathematical expectation of equation (10) conditional on

where the terms of on the right—hand side are true mathematical
expectations of the respective stochastic disturbances conditional on It(z).
The third step is to organize the information that is
relevant for inferring these expectations. This process
involves combining equations (7) and (8), derived from the
market—clearing conditions, with the known structural
equations describing monetary information and monetary policy.
Starting with the current period, substituting equations (4.1)
and (5) separately into equation (7) to eliminate Mt, after
rearranging, yields two equations between linear combinations
of
and ct(z) and linear combinations of known
v.,
variables,

Equations

(12) and (13) indicate that producers of good z
know the values of the sums, —& + Vt + ct(z) and

+ v. + c(z).
Turning to last period, substituting equations (4.2)
and (4.3) and equation (5), applied to period t—l, separately
into equation (8), applied to period t-l, to eliminate Mt_1,

after rearranging, yields three equations between linear
combinations of

Appendix A lists the calculated elements of the matrix, [R).
The fifth step is to determine the coefficients, U, ...,

The procedure is to substitute into equation (11) for Et(z)pt
the values of the expectations given by equation (17). Then,
substitute into equation (7) for pt(z) the value of Et(z)pt
given by equation (11) and the value of

given

by equation (5).

(An alternative would be to use equation (4.1) to eliminate Mt.)

Equation (7) then gives an expression for pt(z) that is a
linear conibination of the predetermined and exogenous variables,
where the weights involve the undetermined coefficients,
II, ...,
, and the variances of the stochastic variables.

Equating each of these weights to the corresponding coefficient
in the trial solution given by equation (9) yields a system
of eight simultaneous equations that we can solve for II, ...,

Interpretation of the Solution

Equation (18) indicates that current aggregate output
equals a linear combination of past levels of aggregate
output, ct(L)yt_i, and the realizations of the exogenous random
variables that represent the unanticipated part of current
the current disturbance to aggregate
monetary policy,

demand, v, the currently unperceived part of current monetary
policy, S, the unanticipated part of past monetary policy,
the past disturbance to aggregate demand, v_1, and
the currently unperceived part of past monetary policy, n.e.

The coefficients of these random variables are functions of
their variances and covariances and the variance of the random
disturbance to relative demands.

The interpretation of the coefficients of

v, and

is familiar from the discussions in King (1981) and Boschen

and Grossman (i980). Current aggregate output is positively
and to vt because producers of good z mistake
related to

some of the increase in the price of good z that results
or v. to be an increase in. the
from positive values of
relative price of good z. Current aggregate output is negabecause a high preliminary estimate of
tively related to
the current money stock causes the expectation of producers of
good z about average prices to be too high and their expectations about the relative price of good z to be correspondingly
too low.

The solutions for the coefficients,
indicate that, if the covariance,

between the errors in

the current estimates of current and past money stocks were
equal to zero, equation (18) would reduce to the same expression
for y. derived in King (1981) and Boschen and Grossman (1980).

Most importantly, in this case, the coefficients of 1' v1,
and

would be zero.

This result brings out the point that,

as suggested above,

and, hence, the known

combinations, -n.e + v_1 and
v_1, convey

Current aggregate output is
positively related to
because a current estimate of the
linear

past

money stock that is high relative to the known past values of

aggregate output and average prices causes producers of good z
to raise their expectations about ó and, hence, to lower their
expectation about current average prices. Current aggregate
output is positively related to
and negatively related to

v_1 because a high value of

or a low value of v_1 causes

the expectations of producers of good z about

to be too

high.

The presence of the term,

in equation (18) means

that unanticipatQd monetary policy affects aggregate output over
more than one period. This channel of persistence, which
results from the structure of monetary information, operates in

addition to the separate persistence effect that results from
the production technology and causes the term, a(L)y_i to

appear in equation (18). As discussed above, a more general
version of the present model would allow for additional
correlations of the errors in monetary data. For example,
the plausible assumption that
is correlated with errors in
estimates of the money stocks of period t—2 and -earlier
would imply a solution for current aggregate output that
includes these errors as well as unanticipated monetary policy

and aggregate demand disturbances from period t—2 and earlier.
The dependence of aggregate output on both monetary policy
and aggregate demand disturbances described by equation (18)
requires that producers of good z be unable to distinguish
these aggregate factors from disturbances to relative demands. To

see this conclusion, suppose that ct(z) were a deterministic

Consequently, y. would simply equal a(L)y_1.
Of more immediate interest is the crucial role played by
incomplete monetary information in determining the relation

between monetary policy and aggregate output. Consider how
equation (18) would change if 6 and n were deterministic
and, hence, known variables, rather than unknown random variables.

This

result indicates that aggregate output depends on monetary
policy if and only if monetary policy is at least partly
unperceived. This observation underlies the testable hypotheses
that are explicitly derived in the next section.

Derivation of Testable Hypotheses

The first hypothesis to be tested involves the neutrality of
perceived monetary policy. The innovation in the output of
representative good z arid, hence, the innovation in aggregate
output depend only on the subjective belief of the representative
producer about the current relative price of good z. The model
implies that this belief is uncorrelated both with the contemporaneous
measure of money growth implied by the difference between the
currently available estimates of current and past money stocks and

with lagged values of this measure. This implication is not

— 19 —

trivial,
tnt'

because, as we have seen, these monetary data——
t_iMt_2, etc.—-play a critical role in the

t-t—l'

model as part of the relevant infcrmation on which producer
decisions are based. An essential result of the assumptions of
market clearing and rational expectations, however, is that the
behavioral response of producers to this information neutralizes
its effect on beliefs about relative prices and, hence, on

aggregate output. The general principle involved is that these
assumptions imply neutrality for the known part of any disturbance
that would be neutral under complete information.

It is worth recalling that the models in King (1981) and
Boschen and Grossman (1980) imply the stronger hypotheses that
aggregate output, rather than the innovation in aggregate output,
is uncorrelated with the contemporaneous measures of money growth.
To obtain this stronger hypothesis, it is necessary to assume

that either b(L) or a(L) are equal to zero. Otherwise, y. and
are correlated through the covariance of a(L)y_1
with b(L)y1. The essential point is that, withput a control
for the persistence effect on aggregate output that results from
the production technology, the effect of past aggregate output on
current monetary policy can create a spurious correlation between

aggregate output and contemporaneous monetary data.
The second hypothesis to be tested involves the effects of
errors in preliminary monetary data. The model implies that
the innovation in aggregate output is positively correlated either

— 21 —

with

the revisions in the current measure of money growth implied

by the differences between the preliminary contemporaneous measure
and the finally reported measure or with such revisicns in past
measures of money growth. The essential idea is that these revisions
measure
the extent to which monetary policy is unperceived.

These two hypotheses do not exhaust the possible ways to
use contemporaneous monetary data to test thá equilibrium
approach to macroeconomics. However, given the nature of the
econometric results discussed below, explicit derivation
and examination of additional testable hypotheses does not seem
worthwhile.

Econometric Analysis

To test Hypothesis I econometrically, we estimate

on lagged values of y, to control
regression equations of

the contemporaneous measire of money growth__M —

contained in

Hypothesis I implies that the covariances of y with the vari-

etc., are equal to the respective
ables, a(L)y_i,
covariances of a(L)yti with these same variables.
Consequently, as we can readily confirm by computing the

population regression coefficients, Hypothesis I implies that
the estimated coefficients of m, me_i, etc., in the calculated
regression equations should be zero.

The data are for the United States foi' 1953 through
1978. As measures of
we use both the log of the Federal
Reserve Board's industrial production index, denoted I' and
the log of the ratio of employment to population, denoted Nt.
In both cases, we take four seasonally unadjusted observations——
for the months of February, Nay, August, and November--for each
year.

The contemporaneous measure of money growth, '' corresponding to

of the money stock, Ml, published prior to the month of the observation
of
and the revised seasonally unadjusted estimate available at
the same time of Ml three months earlier. The construction of this
time series involves three different procedures because of three

different episodes in the publication of monetary data. For the
period from the middle of 1965 through 1978, the Federal Reserve
Board published in weekly statistical release H.6 preliminary monetary
data with an eight-day lag. For this period, our measure for

the last weekly average of daily estimates of Ml issued during the
months——either January, April, July, or October——prior to our
observation of y. For the period from the last quarter of 1960
until the middle of 1965, the Federal Reserve Board published in
semi-monthly statistical release J.3 preliminary monetary data with
a lag of from one to tw weeks. For this period, our measure of
tMt is the last semi—monthly average of daily estimates of Ml issued
during the month prior to our observation of
For the period
from the beginning of 1953 until the last quarter of 1960, the

For all three periods, our measure of tMt_i is the revision

of the previous estimate, t—lt-1' available contemporaneously with
Experimentation suggests that the econometric results are not
sensitive to the precise timing of the four annual observations of
the variables.
The choice of seasonally unadjusted data reflects the idea
that private agents respond to the unadjusted changes in variables
and that the use of seasonally smoothed data may distort the

measurement of these responses. In particular, seasonally unadjusted
money growth is the appropriate data for proper testing of
Hypothesis II, because seasonal adjustment factors are themselves
subject to revision and because these revisions introduce differences
between preliminary and revised seasonally adjusted monetary data
that are not related to changes in information about the money stock.

It

remains important, however, to control for possible seasonal
correlation between variables that is unrelated to business cycle
The inclusion of seasonal dummy variables and the
phenomena.
length of the dependent variable lags seem to control adequately

for the seasonal variation in the dependent variables. The
correlograms calculated from the residuals obtained from the
and Nt on their respective lagged values and
regressions of
the seasonal dummies showed the aut.ocorrelation at lag four to
be within two standard deviations of zero for both variables.
Appendix C lists the time series of monetary data. The specification of the series, Nt, is discussed below.
The main reason for not using all of the monthly observations
of the measures of aggregate output involves the problem of construct-

ing corresponding measures of money growth. Experimentation indicated
that the measurement of money growth over monthly intervals introduced severe problems of dealing with seasona-lity and of serial
correlation in the residuals. Money growth over short intervals,

moreover, might not b large enough to have the potential to produce
measuab1e effects- on aggregate output. An alternative procedure of
measuring money growth monthly over longer overlapping intervals
would create a severe problem of multicollinearity. Moreover, the
taking of only four observations annually captures the cyclical movements of aggregate output and money over the sample period and,
hence, does not seem to sacrifice any significant information about
the relation between these variables.
The reported regression equations involving industrial producinclude four lagged values of the, dependent variable,
tion,
whereas the reported regression equations involving employment, Nt,
include six lagged values of the dependent variable. The choice of
these specifications reflects experimentation with different lag
lengths. The criterion for selecting the number of dependent variable lags was a likelihood ratio test for serial independence of
the residuals. The test statistic, distributed asymptotically x2-see Geweke (1979)—-is
X(K) = n log (cY/cy.),
where

is a maximum

likelihood

estimate of the variance of the

— 25 —

residuals

or Nt on a distributed lag of

dependent variables and the seasonal dummy variables,

is the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance of
the residuals from a Kth order autoregression using the residuals
from the regression that generated ci,, and ,

n

is the number of residuals computed from the Kth order

autoregression.
The dependent variable lag length in the reported regressions is
that number of lags which, based on the likelihood ratio test,

rendered a serially independent residual series. For example,
regressing Nt on six rather than four lags of itself and the
seasonal dummies reduces the value of A(12) from 30.3 to 12.9.
The critical levels for these values of A(12) are .003 and .38
respectively. These critical levels indicate that the null
hypothesis of independent residuals can be rejected for the four
lag Nt equation but not the six lag Nt equation. The value of
A(12) for I. regressed on four lags of itself plus the seasonal
dummies was 6.67. The associated critical level of .88 indicates
we cannot reject the hypothesis of serially independent residuals.
The selection of the number of independent variable lags is
based on the results of experiments using four, six,and ten lags
of the independent variable. Since the main conclusions from the
econometric analysis did not seem to depend on the number of
lagged variables, the results using four lags of the independent
variable are shown below.

The numbers in parentheses under the coefficients are t—statistics.

The important conclusions from equation (i) for industrial
production are that the t—statistics imply rejection at the
99% confidence level of the hypothesis that the coefficients
of
and m1 are zero, and that the F—statistic implies
rejection at the 99%'confidence level of the hypothesis that
the joint effect of the variables, ''
is zero.

The important conclusions from equation (ii) for employment
are that the t—statistics imply rejection at the 96% confidence
level of the hypothesis that the coefficients of

m1i m_2,

and mt..3 are zero, and that the F—statistic again implies
rejection at the 99% confidence level of the hypothesis that
the joint effect of the variables, m
mt_4, is zero.
In sum, these regression equations indicate that current
and lagged values of the contemporaneous measure of money
growth have statistically significant effects on industrial
production and employment, a result that implies rejection
of Hypothesis I.
An appropriate inference from this finding is that the
equilibrium model from which Hypothesis I derived is not consistent
with the facts—-specifically, with the observed relations between
preliminary monetary data and industrial production and aggregate
employment. Although this conclusion that the equilibrium model
is not realistic stands independently of tests of other

— 27 —

implications

of the model, empirical analysis of Hypothesis II
brings to bear additional data--specifically, the finally
reported money stock——and, in addition, can generate inferences
about the quantitative importance of unperceived money growth
as a channel of monetary nonneutrality.
Specifically,

failure to reject the contrary of Hypothesis II both reinforces
the conclusion that the equilibrium model is not realistic
and indicates that incomplete monetary information is not a
significant source of monetary nonneutrality.

To analyze Hypothesis II econometrically, we estimate
regression equations of I. and Nt on lagged values of
the dependent variables, on current and lagged values of
revisions on the current measure of money growth-— (Mt —

on seasonal dummy variables. To simplify notation, we denote

— 28 —

as Rt etc.

Hypothesis II implies that

at least one of the estimated coefficients of the series, Rt, Rt_ii
in these regression equations should be positive.
The time series for the finally reicorted money stock, Mt, is

defined to be the log of latest reported weekly average of daily
estimates of Ml for the final weeks of January, April, July,
and August over the sample period, 1953 through 1978, as of
January 1980. Appendix C includes this time series. This
constructed time series for Mt differs from the constructed
time series for

in three ways. First, Mt reflects all of

the historical revisions in monetary data, which involve
pr•imariiy such factors as computational corrections, benchmark

changes resulting from fuller reporting, and conceptual
changes involving repecification of the components of Ml.
Computational corrections and benchmark changes clearly

represent new information. Conceptual changes, however,
represent new informaicn only to the extnt that they

incorporate previously unavailable data rather than merely
rearrange previously available data. As Barro and Hercowitz
(1980) point out, revisions in measures of money growth

are largely independent of conceptual changes,
which mainly alter the overall level
of the reported money stock. Second, Mt measures a weekly
average of daily estimates of Ml, whereas, for the period prior
to the last quarter of 1960, tMt is an estimate of Ml for a

single day. Third, Mt is a reported value of Ml for the
week indicated, whereas
is an estimate published during
the week indicated of the value of Ml for an earlier week or

day. Over the sample period this reporting lag declined
from one to two months to eight days.

The important conclusions from equations (iii) and (iv)
are that none of the t—statistics imply rejection of the
alternative hypothesis that the coefficients of the variables,
Rt, . Rt_4, are not positive, and that neither of the
F—statistics imply rejection of the alternative hypothesis
that the joint effects of these variables are zero. These
conclusions accord with the results from similar equations

reported by Barro and Hercowitz (1980). Their regression
equations used annual averages, used unemployment and GNP
as dependent variables, and did not include lagged dependent
variables. All of these results support the conclusion
that errors in preliminary monetary data do not have statistically
significant effects on real variables, and imply that we cannot
reject the contrary of Hypothesis II.

Conclusions

The basic assumptions of equilibrium macroeconomic models——
namely, market clearing and rational expectations——imply that
the known part of a monetary disturbance that would be neutral
under complete information does not influence aggregate output
and employment. In this same context, the assumption of
incomplete information about macroeconomic variables implies that
such a disturbance is nonneutral if, but only if, it is at least
Hypotheses I and II, thus, seem to be
partly unperceived.
inescapable implications of the equilibrium approach to
modelling the relation between monetary disturbances and
macroeconomic fluctuations, once the thecy takes into account
the existence of preliminary data on current monetary aggregates
and the process of accumulation of revised monetary data.
This extension of the classic equilibrium models provides a
rich framework in which current aggregate output depends on
both the unanticipated and currently unperceived parts of
current monetary policy as well as on both the unanticipated

and currently unperceived parts of past monetary policy. The
extended model, however, also generates the above econometric
tests, which are apparently fatal to the equilibrium approach.
The rejection of Hypothesis I and the failure to reject
the contrary of Hypothesis II underscore the unsatisfactory
state of the theory of macroeconomic fluctuations. The
research program associated with the equilibrium approach
has raised essential questions, but has not provided empirically
convincing answers. The assumptions of market clearing and
rational expectations seem to be compelling elements of a
unified theory of economic behavior.
Moreover, theory and
evidence from a variety of contexts suggest that these assumptions cannot be easily dismissed as unrealistic. Indeed,

thanks mainly to equilibrium theorizing, we are no longer
satisfied with explanations for the apparent short-run non-

neutrality of money that rely on biased expectations or on

— 31 —

widespread

failure of economic agents to realize perceived
gains from trade.
The results in this paper, however,
indicate that equilibrium theorizing does not provide an
alternative explanation of macroeconomic fluctuations whose
implications accord with the apparent facts. The business

cycle, consequently, seems mysterious. We do not have at present
a theory of fluctuations in aggregate output and employment
that is consistent both with maximizing behavior and with
econometric evidence.
