Alternative Tests of Rational Expectations Models:
The Case of the Term Structure

ABSTRACT

A linearized version of the rational expectations models of the term
structure is put forth in terms of a complete vector of equally spaced

observations along the yield curve. A data series on intermediate maturity
yields which meets the specifications of the model is presented. The
model is tested against a specific and easily interpreted alternative.
Earlier studies of rational expectations models, which used "volatility
tests" or "likelihood ratio tests," are discussed.

Alternative Tests of Rational Expectations Models:
The Case of the Term Structure

Robert J. Shiller*

I. Introduction
The aims of this paper are:

1. To display a linearized version of rational expectations models of the
term structure of interest rates in terms of a complete vector of equally spaced

observations along the yield curve. The linearized version is essentially the
same as that which I derived (Shiller [l979J) for, two observations along the

yield curve: the one—period rate and the perpetuity rate. The more general
vector representation enables a more complete specification of hypotheses.

2. To present a data set on U.S. government bond yields which accurately
fits the description of the data assumed in the model.

3. To present an alternative hypothesis in terms of the vector of observations
along the yield curve that represents an easily interpreted alternative to the
model, and to present a posterior odds ratio between the hypotheses.

4. To comment on a recent study by Sargent [1979] which appears to confirm
the expectations model, in contrast to my conclusion (Shiller [1979j) that long—

term Interest rates appear to be too "volatile" to accord with the model. The
data and sample period used here are closer to that of Sargent and represents
some improvement over Sargent's.

It will be shown that Sargent's procedure

did not test all of the restrictions imposed by the model. Not only did he first
difference the data, but also he omitted restrictions on the stochastic properties of
the differenced daca.

tie threw away the very restrictions used to establish the

volatility restrictions which I used.

Data

The

Set

'

.,

data set used

here

(Table In below) consists of nine semi—annual

series of yields on l½2 live year Treasu notes (series designation
BA and EO), each

to maturity,

series representing yields of bonds with a given time

from 6 months in multiples of 6 monthá up to 4.5 years. Yields

are computed ftom midpoints of

bid—asked price spreads for the end of

March and September as provided on the Rodney White Center Government
Bonds Tape maintained by the Wharton School. 'i" This

data is ideal in that:

bonds were issued each April 1 and October 1 from 1951 to 1978,
'day that the 1½2

on the same

coupons were paid on outstanding notes. The notes are not'

callable, may not be redeemed at par in payment qf estate taxes, and the
appregiation in price from original issue discount was, throughout the sample
period, taxed as income.

The sample was confined to the interval 1955—TI to 1973—I because over this
interval there were always fairly large quantities (ranging from 33 million
dollars to over a billion doliais') of bonds in each of the nine maturity

categories outstanding. We might wish for a series based on uniformly
large quantities, hut no such series which shares the other advantages of this,
series appears to be available in the'United States. liata on bonds with he
full maturity of five years were not used',.because of possible anomalies in

the pricing of new issue bonds (Shiller and Hodigliini

119791).

The data series represent a clear improvement oVer the series used by

October of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, differing sometimes by a few
32nds,of a point. After 1969, when quantities in Come maturities fell below
$100 million, the discrepancies between the two soutces are bigger and more
common, reflecting perhaps the relative 'thinness of the market when smaller
quantities of the bonds.were outstan4ing.'

and Yield Spreads. The Salomon Brothers data are "yield curve" data based upon
judgmental interpolation of yields on heterogeneous bonds. Sargent used quarterly
data on five year and three month rates from 1953—Il to l971—IV.

These are straightforward linear restrictions on the autocovariance function
of Rt. If the generalized likelihood ratio principle is used to devise a
test of these restrictions given data on the vector R. then with certain

reduces to inequality I—i in Shiller [l979h] as i approaches infinity while

/T. This inequality is violated by sample standard deviations

for low i, a.

for I > 4 but is not violated by j < 3 (Table I).* The violations of the inequality

are most strong for the highest i in our data but still less dramatic than the
violation observed with really long—term interest rate data as reported in
Shil.Ier [19791.

The violation of the inequality for 4.5 year bonds is less

dramatic than that reported by Singleton [1980] for 5 year bonds. He also
used a six—month short rate and a similar sample but with monthly data: 1959—i
to 1971—Vl .

Perhaps his more dramatic results stem from his decision to

subtract linear trends from the data, and in effect assume the trends were

known by the market in advance. Any such assumption has the effect of reducing
the uncertainty about future interest rates and thus reducing the permissible

volatility of long rates according to the expectations model. Ultimately the
inequality tests must hinge on our priors as to the reasonableness of such

assumptions. Although these results suggest that the interest rates R1),
i > 4 are too volatile to accord with the model, we shall not attempt here (as

did LeRoy and Porter [1.980] and Singleton j1980]) to derive a formal test

o the model based on variance statistics but will develop regression tests

The histograms shown give a

visual impression of the truth of the expectations hypothesis. These diagrams
are not ideal in that small values of the spread between long and short rates

why regression tests of the null hypothesis are likely to have little power.

all coefficients are 1 versus the alternative that all are zero we would need
to consider the correlation of residuals across equations.
A natural assumption to make is the uninformative prior on the (i—l)x(i—l)

covariance matrix of residuals ,

of the form f(l)ElI½ which results

from a Wishar prior on 1 as the degrees of freedom in the prior go to zero.
Zeilner [1971] shows the marginal posterior for our model which, however, does
not reduce to a generalized multivariate student t distribution.

Conclusion and_Summary

We have seen how the complicated nonlinear restrictions implied by
expectations models on the cross autocovariance functions of interest rates

shownby Sutch Ll968j, Shiller [1972], Modigliani and Shiller [19731 and

the

Sargent

[1979] are the result of omitted variables in their analysis. With

complete

vector of interest rates used here, the restrictions are of the simple

linear variety which can be tested by simple regression tests rather than the
likelihood ratio test of the nonlinear constraints used by

asymptotic

Sargent [1979]. Precisely which regressions to run depends on the alternative
hypothesis

of

interest. An alternative hypothesis was

proposed which represents

the notion that the shape of the yield curve does not give the right signals

as to the likely future path of interest rates. Although the data favored this
alternative hypothesis with the long term (over 20 year) bonds in
L1979

the

data on short to intermediate term bonds used here, Table 11,

favor the expectations

The

results thus suggest that

term interest rates but posterior odds ratios show that the evidence is very

weak. Before general conclusions are reached about short to intermediate term

—16-

interest rates and the rational expectations model, these procedures ought to be

applied to other data sets as well. In view of these results, it is perhaps
not surprising that Sargent's tests, which used similar data and sample period,

accepted the model. His procedure is, however, slightly different from that
used here and was not directed at testing against the alternative hypothesis considered here.
