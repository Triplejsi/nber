Symmetric

Substitution Matrices in Asset Demand Systems
ABSTRACT

In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions for an asset
substitution matrix to be symmetric for all distributions of rates of
return

are derived. It is found that symmetry in this context is

essentially equivalent to the proposition that the von Neumann—Morgenstern

utility function displays either constant absolute or constant relative
risk aversion, depending upon whether the substitution matrix is defined

in terms of arithmetic or geometric rates of return.

ytinetric Substitution Matrices in Asset Demand Systems*

I. Introduction
Consider the generic single-pericxl portfolio choice problem

in which an investor seeks to allocate wealth "W0,' among "k" alternative

assets so as to maximize the expected utility of end-of--period wealth.
Denoting the amount of money invested in the th asset by A1 in the absence

of transactions costs this problem may be formally written as:

Subetituting expression (2) into (1), we can in principle solve
the portfolio choice problem for the optimai asset demands A1. These

asset dands are generally of the form:

joint probability distribution of (5,... ,x).

The asset substitution matrix US" is, by definition, the Jacobian

of the systen of asset dand equations (3) with respect to the vector

of net rates of return. Thus, the typical elanent of S is:

Without prior information about either the form of the utility function

U [.] and/or the joint probability distribution of rates of return preciously
little can be said about the structure of S other than that each of its
columns sum to zero and that its diagonals are likely to be positive.1
This lack of knowledge about the structure of S is sanetirnes not well

appreciated. For example, it is traditional in the monetary econa'nics

literature to say that asset "i" is a substitute (ccinp]2xnent) to asset "j
is negative (positive)? In general, however, these
need not be the
concepts are not well defined because the sign of

same as the sign of

result that asset "i" is a substitute for asset "j" but that "j" is a
canp1nent to "i".
One situation in which the above ambiguity does not arise is when

the substitution matrix is snietric. Under s'ninetr'

implying

that the cross yield effects between two assets are equal and therefore
of the same sign.
Syrrinetry of the substitution matrix not only permits one to define

asset substitutability and canplanentarity unambiguously, it has useful
npirical implications as well. Gramlich and Kalchbrenfler (1970) were

the earliest to observe the fact that syrrrnetry of the substitution matrix

—3—

may

facilitate the estimation of systarts of asset dnaiid equations which

are linear in expected rates of return. To appreciate this fact, consider
the following sinplified vector systan of asset duand equations

substitution matrix B.W0 is syrrmetric, however, the number of independent

arid Kalchbrenner (1970), and Hendershott (1977).

Smith (1978)

has criticized this practice for apparently lacking theoretical justification4.
The purpose of the present paper is to provide a theoretical justification
for iirosing syirmetry restrictions on the substitution matrix within the

context of the portfolio choice nvdel discussed above. Specifically, in
Section II of this paper we shall derive necessary and sufficient conditions
for the substitution matrix to be synmetric for all joint probability

distributions of rates of return. Concluding rnarks are presented in
Section III.

Syninetry of the Substitution Matrix

ii. A Case 1: Discrete Ccmpounding

Roley (1977) was the first to derive necessary and sufficient condi-

tions for the substitution matrix to be syninetric in a portfolio choice
setting with uncertainty. His analysis, though, is confined to mean-variance

rcde1s of investor behavior. Nonetheless, his results are useful as a
starting point in• our investigation of the synrnetry property for general von
Neumann - Morgenstern expected utility maximizers.

Suppose that an investor has a mean-variance utility function of the
2

form u [p, a I where p and a are the mean and variance of end—of-period

wealth respectively. A measure of the investor's risk avprsion is
to be the investor's mean-variance absolute risk aversion.
-u1/u2 , defined
Roley proves that a necessary and sufficient condition for a mean-variance

investor 's substitution matrix to be exactly syrrunetric is

that

the investor

display constant mean—variance absolute risk aversion.
The
von

first new

result of this paper is to generalize Roley' s theorn to

Neumann-Morgenstern expected

Theoran 1:

utility maximizers:

Consider the portfolio choice problea (l)whose

is given in (3). Then a necessary and sufficient
condition for the substitution matrix S to be synmetric for
all joint probability distributions of rates of return
solution

is that utility display constant absolute risk aversion.5
Clearly Theorn 1 includes Roley' s result as a special case when meanvariance rreferences are derived fran an underlying von Neumann Morgenstern utility

function.

—5—

Sane care must be exercised when interpretting Theoranl. When utility

displays constant absolute risk aversion this theorEn says that the sub-

stitution matrix will be syninetric regardless of the joint probability

distribution of rates of return. It also says that only this type of utility
function generates a synmetric substitution matrix for all joint distributions

of rates of return. Theorea 1 does not claim, IxMerer, that the substitution
matrix will never be synmetric if utiltiy does not display constant absolute
risk aversion:

given an arbitrary utility function it may be possible to
find sane distribution of rates of return that will generate a syninetric
substitution matrix.

II. B Case 2: Continuous Canpounding

Constant absolute risk aversion is a very stringent assumption about
investor behavior which does not have much eapirical support. Therefore,

tpirical applicability of Theoren 1 is likely to be quite limited.
Constant relative risk aversion, on the other hand, appears to
characterize the preferences of many groups of investors reasonably well.6

In the present section we shall redefine the substitution matrix in terms

of geanetric rather than arithmetic rates of return. Having done this it
is straightforward to derive a result analogous to Theoren 1 in which
constant relative risk aversion is both necessary and sufficient for the
(redefined) substitution matrix to be syninetric.

Rather than parameterize gross rates of return R by the arithmetic
net rates of return as in (2), it is gcjne.tjines nore convenient to pararneterize
then by their geanetric analogues g defined by

Essentially,

in that the former is the net rate of return

l½nalogous to (3), the solution to the portfolio choice problen generated
by

substituting (2') into (1) can be written in the general form:

III Concluding Rnarks
Above we have derived necessary and sufficient conditions for the

substitution matrix to be synmietric, depending on whether this matrix is

defined in terms of ariti-irnetic or geanetric net rates of return. In the
former case constant absolute risk aversion is required for syrrrnetry

wliereas in the latter case it is constant relative risk aversion.'
Several thnitatioris of our analysis are apparent. First, the portfolio
choice frameworK of this study, given in (1), abstracts fran transactions

costs. As such, the substitution matrices ciiscussed above are best interpreted
as long-run or &uilibrium suostitut on matrices.
A question naturally arises about the syxtinetry of the short-run sur,stitution matrix wnen transactions costs are incorporated, into the analysis. It
is proven in Appendix 3 that when transactions costs are incorporated into the
above portfolio choice framework then the (arithmetic) short-run substitution

matrix is syxm'etric if utility displays constant absolute risk aversion regard less of the form of the transactions cost function, provided that it is
twice differentiable.
The above portfolio choice paradigm is aiso inherently static. Tfle
introduction of dynamic considerations into this framework, hcMever, renders

the probian exceedingly difficult and well beyond the intendi scope of tnis
paper.

result

obtains: that portion of the arithmetic (gearietric) substitution
matrices corresponding to just the risky assets is syninetric for all
distributions of rates of return if and only if utility displays
hyperbolic absolute risk aversion in the sense of Merton (1972). See
Jones (1979) for a proof of this result.

Hence, S is symmetric. Moreover, since the choice of which

it must be true

that S too is symmetric.

APPENDIX 3

Within the framework described above transactions
costsmay be incorporated by positing that costs c[Al,...,Ak]
are incurred if the beginning—of—period portfolio is (Al,...,Ak).

Conceptually, the scalar cost function c[] is also parameterized
by the asset holdings inherited or carried forward from the

previous period. Since these are given at the time the current
portfolio decision is made, these additional parameters will be
excluded from our notation for simplicity.

Thus, the portfolio choice problem with transactions
costs may be written
