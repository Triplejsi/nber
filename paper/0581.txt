International Effects on the U.S. Capital Market

ABSTRACT

This paper presents evidence bearing on the question of international

influences on the U.S. capital market. Both the examination of relative
magnitudes of international asset holdings and the estimation of a simple
partial—equilibrium capital market model indicate that such influences are

potentially quite important. In particular, we find that the effects on
international flows on the long—term new—issue corporate bond rate -in the U.S.

are highly significant. Since this interest rate is often seen as crucial
in domestic investment decisions, the paper provides reason to believe that
investment in the U.S. is significantly influenced by international capital
transactions.

International Effects on the U.S. Capital Market
David G. Hartman

The past decade brought dramatic changes in the U.S. economy's dependence

on events occurring abroad. Some aspects of this dependence have been studied
extensively and are now understood quite well. Changes in the functioning of
the U.S. capital market due to external influences, while a matter of serious con-

cern in policy debates, have not been examined in detail. The purpose of this
paper is to explore how significant a role is played by international capital
flows.

Much of the previous research on international capital holdings is concerned

with explaining the flows of capital themselves.1 In the case of the U.S., capital
flows have been explained by conditions in the domestic capital market, with no
attention given to a possible simultaneous effect of international capital trans-

actions on the domestic market. While an assumption that such impacts are negligible seemed quite reasonable in the past, it is now the case, as we shall see, that

international capital transactions are sizable relative to the U.S. market.2 Before
turning to a more formal analysis of the effects of international capital transactions on the U.S. capital market and, in particular, on the determination of
long—term interest rates, we will examine the nature and magnitudes of international

capital transactions. In Section II a model of the U.S. capital market is adapted
to allow examination of foreign influences. In Section III, empirical evidence
is presented which confirms the significance of international impacts on the
domestic capital market.

I. International Capital Holdings
In this section, we will describe and analyze the levels of international
asset holdings to evaluate their potential for affecting the U.S. capital

market. At the outset an important question of aggregation arises.
Since our goal is a study of macroeconomic effects, it might seem sufficient
to follow the convention, found in theoretical models of the open economy, of

considering net aggregate international capital holdings. These theoretical
models rely on a characterization of international capital flows as occurring
because of a premium in the overall return to capital in the recipient country.

Even a crude empirical investigation suggests that the explanation of

capital flows into and out of the U.S. is more complicated. Table 1 shows the
correlations among the following quarterly capital flows during the decade of

the 1970's: U.S. direct investment abroad (DI°), foreign direct investment in
the U.S. (011), U.S. purchases of foreign equity (E°), foreign purchases of
U.S. equity (E1), U.S. purchases of foreign bonds (3°), foreign purchases of U.S.
private bonds (31) and foreign purchases of U.S. governemnt bonds (GB1).
What seems remarkable in these numbers is the lack of high correlations

among the flows. In particular, inflows and outflows of the same categories
of capital fail even to exhibit the expected negative correlation in two of
three cases (or in one of three cases with data detrended); and the correlations

which are of the "correct" sign are not large. In only 9 of 21 cases (8 of 21
using detrended data) do the data confirm the expectation that capital outflows

would be positively related, capital inflows would be positively related, and
inflows would 'be negatively related to outflows.

While this evidence is far from conclusive, it does suggest that international flows of various assets have been determined over the past decade by a

variety of factors. To gain further insight into the nature of international
asset holdings, the remainder of this section will be devoted to discussions of
each asset category.

A. U.S. Government Securities
From a level of just over $10 billion at the beginning of 1970, foreign
holdings of U.S. government debt had, by the end of 1978, grown to almost

$138 billion, or approximately 20.23 percent of such bonds outstanding. This
marked increase is indicative both of the desirability of U.S. government obligations as a relatively safe store of value and of the role of the U.S. dollar as

the official reserve currency. The desire of oil—producing nations for the security and liquidity provided by U.S. government bonds has been a particularly large

influence. More recently, foreign government interventions in the foreign exchange
market have been given as an explanation for massive changes in foreign holdings.

While the reasons for these transactions are both interesting and important, a
thorough examination is outside the primary focus of this paper.

The foreign presence in the U.S. government bond market appears, from
casual observation, to be sufficiently large that the possibility of a significant

effect on the economy cannot be ruled out. Not only do foreign holdings make
up a sizable fraction of the government debt outstanding, but also the net
foreign purchases on a year—to—year basis are large and volatile enough to

drive a considerable wedge between the federal budget deficit and the domestic

deficit finance required. The pattern is shown in Table 2. In 1971, for example,
a federal deficit if $22 billion was offset by even greater U.S. government

borrowing from foreign sources.5 Also striking has been the situation in more
recent years. In contrast with 1975, when the record federal deficit of over
$70 billion was almost ninety percent fInanced at home, the $74 billion deficit

during 1977—1978 was accompanied by foreign financing of over eighty percent

of that amount. Then, during the first half of 1979, foreign governments, in
attempting to stabilize a rising dollar, sold almost $18 billion of U.S. government obligations.
Whether foreign holdings, of government securities have a significant impact

on the U.S. capital market is a question left for the more formal analysis of
Section III. However, to the extent that the domestic financing of government

deficits is believed to have important effects, the raw data point to the significance of foreign transactions in government debt as well.

B. Direct Investment
Direct investment is the transfer of capital across national boundaries for
use in an operation over which the provider of the capital has control.
Specifically, capital transfers are designated by the Commerce Department as direct

investment, rather than portfolio investment, when a firm incorporated abroad
which receives the transfer is at least ten percent owned by the parent firm

providing the capital. Direct investment abroad by U.S. firms has long represented
the most sizable U.S. long—term capital outflow. For that reason, it has raised
considerable opposition in the U.S., particularly among those who fear that transferring U.S. capital abroad harms immobile factors of production such as U.S.
labor.

Foreign firms also make direct investments in the U.S., but these capital
flows are a more recent and still much smaller phenomenon.

While U.S. firms had

invested a total of $174.5 billion abroad by the end of 1979, foreign investment in

the U.S. stood at only $46.7 billion. These figures reflect a very significant
recent growth, both in absolute terms and relative to the total shareholders'

—7—
equity in U.S. corporations. From the beginning of 1970 until the end of 1979,
U.S. direct investment abroad grew from a level of 7.0 percent as large as total

U.S. corporate equity to a level of 14.2 percent. At the same time, foreign
direct investment in the U.S. more than tripled as a percentage of total U.S.

corporate equity: from 1.3 percent to 4.2 percent.
In recent years some Americans have voiced concern about this rapid growth

in foreign control over U.S. production. Viewed in relation to U.S. capital
employed abroad, the level of foreign direct investment in the U.S. does not
seem so alarming. In addition, a close examination of the data reveals that,
while the level of foreign investment in the U.S. grew enormously in the period
1973—1974, even the rate of growth in U.S. investment abroad has not been markedly
smaller In other recent periods (see Figure 1).
The size of these capital holdings leads one to anticipate that they might

have important effects on the U.S. capital market. Also, as Figure 2 shows, the
quarterly flows of capital are quite volatile. This volatility to transactions
implies significant quarter—to—quarter changes in the total direct investment
outstanding, contributing to the effects on the U.S. market which will be explored
later in this paper.

C. Portfolio Investment in Private Securities
Foreign portfolio holdings of private U.S. securities, at a level of
$60.1 billion at the end of 1979 was only slightly exceeded by the figure

($61.7 billion) for U.S. holdings of foreign securities. However, the composi-

tion of the assets held differs markedly. Just over eighty percent of the foreign
portfolio consists of the stock of U.S. firms, while nearly eighty percent of
the U.S. holdings are foreign bonds.

1. Stocks
The dominance of foreign purchases of U.S. stocks (capital inflows)
over portfolio equity capital outflows also stands in sharp contrast, of course,

to the situation with direct investment. With portfolio and direct investment
taken together, U.S. equity investment abroad is far greater than foreign
equity investment in the U.S.

U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign equity, which stood at about $13.8
billion at the end of 1979, or a value 1.1 percent as large as U.S. firms' total
equity outstanding, had, until 1979, exhibited very little fluctuation (see

Figure 3). The average rate of growth in U.S. dollar ownership of foreign stock
since 1965 has been about five percent per year. From the data on net purchases
of foreign stock presented in Figure 4 it is clear that the long—run increase
in investment position has resulted primarily from increases in the dollar value

of foreign stocks held, since net purchases had merely fluctuated around zero
for many years prior to 1979.
From popular press reports, it would seem that U.S. investors are becoming

more interested in equity investments abroad. This interest has only recently
been reflected in the statistics on U.S. portfolios. In aggregate U.S. investors
were actually net sellers of over one—half billion dollars of foreign stocks in

1978, but unprecedented purchases occurred in 1979. For the present, at least,
U.S. holdings of foreign stocks seem inconsequential compared to the size of
the U.S. equity market.

Of apparently greater potential importance in the U.S. capital market are

foreign holdings of U.S. stocks. Such foreign holdings were in 1960 less than
nine billion dollars; they rose to $39.1 billion by 1972 and have fluctuated
considerably since, standing at about $49.9 billion at the end of 1979 (or over

four percent of total U.S. stock outstanding). Changes in stock values are a

major cause of this growth. But even when net purchases are examined in isolation
(Figure 4), large annual variations are present. For example, annual net

purchases during the period 1974—1976 were: $.539 billion, $4.667 billion,
and $2.753 billion.

The popular literature is quick to credit foreign investors with causing
major market movements, and detecting the presence of foreign buyers in the mar-

ket is a popular pastime of market analysts. One reason for believing that foreign holdings of less than five percent of the equity market could have a signi-

ficant impact is the volatility of foreign purchases and sales. Also, foreign
purchases cannot be easily compared to total transactions or holdings to determine
their impact, since a fluctuation in the foreign demand for securities, unlike
a domestic change, is likely to represent a change in overall U.S. asset demand.
It is important, therefore, that more formal empirical investigations be pursued.

2. Bonds
U.S. holdings of foreign bonds reached about $48 billion at the end of

1979, after twenty years of growth from a level of just over $3 billion. As
Figure 5 shows, this growth has been far from uniform, accelerating greatly in

the past five years. Specifically, U.S. holdings of foreign bonds grew at about
a five percent annual rate from 1965 through 1969, an eleven percent annual
rate from 1970 through 1973, and an eighteen percent annual rate from 1974
through 1979.

The most obvious explanation of the recent acceleration in U.S. purchases

is the ending of the interest equaliztion tax (lET) in early 1974. The tax
was collected as an excise on purchases of foreign securities, with the tax on
bonds ranging from about one to fifteen percent (depending on the time to matur-

ity) at the beginning of the program. The rates were changed by Executive Order

several times. The maximum rate was 18.75 percent from August 1967 to April

1969, then 11.25 percent until January 1974. The effects of the 1969 and
1974 tax changes seem very obvious from Figure 5. However, the figures on
U.S. holdings of foreign bonds partially reflect changes in the U.S. dollar

value of bonds held as well as purchases and sales. When only net purchases
are considered (Figure 6), a dramatic effect on U.S. investor behavior is
apparent only after the lET elimination.
Some idea of the potential effects of these transactions can be obtained
from comparing U.S. purchases of foreign bonds with figures on domestic bonds.
The level of U.S. holdings of foreign bonds stood, at the end of 1979, at nearly

twelve percent of the value of U.S. private domestic bonds outstanding. Net
purchases of foreign bonds are even more significant compared to net new
issues of U.S. corporate bonds, being nearly 17 percent as large in the 1976—

1979 period. In sunary, transactions in foreign bonds would seem to neither
dominate the U.S. market nor be sufficiently small that their effects could
safely be ignored.

Foreign investment in U.S. private bonds is only about a quarter as large
as either U.S. holdings of foreign private bonds or foreign holdings of U.S.

stock. Figure 6 demonstrates, however, that foreign purchases of U.S. bonds

have, in the last year, reached an unprecedented magnitude and volatility. The
major reason seems to be OPEC purchases of U.S. bonds. Total OPEC purchases of
bonds, other than U.S. Treasury issues, reached $1.61 B in 1977, from a level

of $1.18 B in 1976 and $1.57 B in 1975.6 The Commerce Department noted a growing
trend in OPEC nations' purchases toward bonds privately placed by U.S. corporations.
The recent growth in foreign transactions in private U.S. bonds has in-

creased the possibility of a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The 1977

—14—
foreign purchases of over $3.7 billion in private U.S. bonds, for example,
amounted to over ten percent of U.S. firms'

net

bond issues. Therefore, it

is difficult to argue without further evidence either that foreign purchases
dominate the U.S. market or are inconsequential.

ignored in models of the U.S. capital market. While

most casual sort, it would seem to rule out application

of both the simplest

open economy models and closed economy models. In the former,
capital flows across national boundaries
to equalize rates of return, while in
the latter, capital does not flow at all.
Instead, we recognize the
embodied in and the special

apparent overriding importance of special risks

institutional factors of importance in international

investments. Assets available in the U.S. will be viewed
as imperfect substitutes
for foreign assets, in terms of both domestic and
foreign asset demands. In
addition, because international flows
differently to market conditions, the

of different assets seem to respond very
asset categories we examined will be viewed

as indicating assets which

are imperfect substitutes. This view is consistent
with recent research on the
U.S. domestic capital market which emphasizes the
imperfect substitutability of assets.7
This previous research on closed

in specifying domestic asset demand and supply

Again following previous work, such as Friedman (1980), we write the market

(2)

where AS is a vector of asset supplies. AS includes, in a closed economy
model, zero values for inside assets, and the exogenously given values for

outside assets. That is, the asset demands are taken as net demands by the
domestic private sector.

(2) is, therefore, a complete partial equilibrium model

of asset markets. Similar systems have been subjected to empirical analysis in
a variety of ways.

The most direct method would be to estimate the parameters of each

equation in the system. In a series of papers, Friedman has explored structural
estimation of asset demand systems. From these estimates, market—clearing rates
of return can be derived for given levels of asset supplies.

Alternatively, the system can, with the standard assumptions, be written
as:

r = r(A5,
WF .?)

to emphasize the determination of rates of return.8 That is, for instance,
the long—term corporate bond yield depends on supplies of outside

assets and other demand determinants. In this initial attempt to incorporate
the effects of international capital transactions, we will emphasize the

determination of the long—term corporate bond rate which is viewed as crucial
in familiar neoclassical investment models. The other determinants, Z, consist
of inflation expectations and expectations of income (or output).9
So, ignoring international transactions, we can write the individual yield
equation of interest as:

rB = rB(GB,

where the outside assets are government bonds (GB) and money (M))°
The inclusion of foreign holdings of domestic assets in this model can

be accomplished by viewing AS as the assets available to the domestic market.

Domestic holdings of foreign assets could be included by simply expanding

the menu of assets available. However, since the returns to these assets are not
established entirely in the domestic market and since the holdings of these

assets are often restricted by government policies, it seems more reasonable
to include holdings of foreign assets as influences on domestic asset demands.
Equation (4) therefore becomes, in an open economy context:11

Of course, the foreign holdings of government bonds (GB1), private bonds
(B1), portfolio equity (E1) and direct investment capital (D1) as. well as U.S.
holdings of foreign bonds (B°), portfolio equity (E°) and direct investment

capital (DI°) are in general functions of rB. So, (6) should not be taken as a
closed form relation, but only as a particular way of writing the asset market
equilibrium condition, which is convenient because the international asset

holdings are incorporated explicitly. Similarly, ,

III. Empirical Implementation
The empirical estimation will use quarterly data from 1954 through

1979. During that period, the levels of international asset holdings have
experienced tremendous changes due to changes in government policies, fluctuations in the world's distribution of wealth, and structural changes in the world

economy. It might not be too implausible to assume these holdings exogenous in
empirical work. If so, we can estimate (6) directly, using distributed lags of

past values to represent e and e12

All variables which are levels are included as the logs of the deflated values

(deflated by the GNP deflator). In order to minimize problems of endogeneity of
the money supply, the monetary base is used here. A distributed lag is employed

—20—
both to better represent influences on the current money supply and to represent

possible effects on expectations of other asset market influences. All distributed
lags are estimated as third degree polynomials.

An attempt to expand, somewhat, the purely financial focus of the model by
incorporating a broader definition of wealth as an influence on asset demands

and supplies met with no success. As Feldstein and Chamberlain (1973) pointed
out, over a period of estimation non—financial components of wealth can vary and
should be included in the model. The inclusion of a logarithmic trend (to roughly
account for structural changes in asset markets over the twenty—six year period)

proxies for wealth sufficiently well that the several measures we tried were
highly insignificant in all cases.
In general, the results are supportive of the view that changes in international asset holdings have important impacts on the U.S. capital market.

Although predictions of coefficient signs depend on the nature of asset substitution, it was expected that capital outflows would usually tend to increase the

bond yield while capital inflows would have the opposite effect. Except for
the coefficients of bond holdings, this expectation is realized. The coefficients
of the largest private holdings, DI° and E1 are highly significant. The coefficients
of DI' and E° are nearly significant at the .05 level, while the coefficient

of the net government bond supply is nearly significant at the .1 level. The

result with respect to bond holdings is, however, disturbing. The effect of B1
should be unambiguously negative. Since foreign bonds purchased by U.S. citizens
are largely dollar—denominated and issued in the U.S.. and thus are presumably
close substitutes for domestic bonds, the effect of B° should almost certainly

be positive. This result points to the possibility of bias due to simultaneity.
Of course, it would be anticipated that simultaneity would be a particular diff i—
culty in the case of bonds.

—21—

To reduce any simultaneity bias, lagged values of asset holdings are used

as instruments in reestimating (7)13 The results of a number of experiments
(see Table 3) are indicative of reduction in simultaneity bias. U.S. holdings
of foreign bonds now obtains the correct positive sign and the coefficients of

U.S. holdings of foreign equity are greater. However, foreign holdings of U.S.
bonds (B1) continues to have insignificant coefficients with the wrong sign.
Since the simple correlation of B° with B1 equals .984, it is not surprising that

separate coefficients for B° and B1 are difficult to estimate. However, most
foreign bonds held by U.S. residents are so similar in nature to domestic bonds that
it is sensible to consider the outside supply of bonds to be the net value
B° —

B.
Equations (3.2) and (3.3) show the result of this aggregation. The

net bond holdings variable has the correct sign and is significant or nearly

significant at the .05 level. The difference between (3.2) and (3.3) is in the
treatment of government bonds. If, as we have been assuming, a decrease in
foreign holdings is exactly equivalent to an increase in the level of government

bonds outstanding, (3.3) is appropriate. Since the public's perception of government bonds as an asset is controversial and since foreign holdings of these
bonds are an actual outside obligation, treating foreign holdings separately,

as in (3.2), may be justifiable. Since the right—hand variables in each equation
are in logs, no direct test of these specifications is possible, but estimating

separate coefficients does improve the fit. The level of government bonds outstanding is insignificant, while the level of foreign holdings is significant; the
impact of a change in the level of foreign holdings is more than twice as great
as a change in the level of bonds outstanding (since foreign holdings represent

about twenty percent of the total).14 The explanatory power of each specification
is nearly identical. It appears, then, that we can be confident that changes in

foreign holdings of government bonds affect the U.S. corporate bond rate, but can
say little about the overall level of such bonds outstanding.

Other specifications were tried to determine the impact of further aggrega-

tions. For example, equation (3.5) includes international holdings only as a net
aggregate value, which fails to obtain significance in the equation.15 In fact,
the two international asset variables taken together are not significant.

The rest of the specifications have sets of international asset coefficients
significantly different from zero at the .01 level, with the equation (3.4)
coefficients barely exceeding that level of significance and the other equations'
coefficients exceeding the .01 level by wide margins.

As indicated by equation (3.6) which contains no international asset
variables, the purely domestic factors of money supply, income, and inflation pro-

vide the major explanation of the corporate bond yield.16 In addition, the inclusion
of the international asset variables does very little to change the coefficients
of the domestic variables, since the correlations between these sets of variables
tend to be rather low.

To summarize, then, U.S. holdings of foreign assets and foreign holdings

of U.S. assets have been shown to have significant effects on the U.S. corporate

bond rate. Disaggregation of these assets holdings by asset type also appears to
be quite important in isolating their effects. In particular, aggregation into
a net private asset holdings variable completely masks the important impacts these

asset holdings have on the U.S. capital market. When these holdings are disaggre—
gated, as in specification (3.2) all are individually significant at the .05 level

and have plausible signs. Capital outflows have positive impacts on the corporate
bond rate, whether the outflows result from U.S. purchases of foreign assets or
foreign sales of U.S. assets.

—24—

To put these effects in the context of historical patterns of international capital transactions, several simulations are performed, using the

estimated coefficients from equation (3.2). First, we test the effect of an
exogenous change which would have eliminated net foreign purchases of U.S.

government bonds after the end of 1977. Because this alternative eliminates
the very heavy foreign purchases through 1978, the increase in bond yields

which results (see Figure 7) is quite discernible, reaching 13 basis points by

the first quarter of 1979. Figure 8 shows the impact of keeping foreign holdings at the 1973 level in real terms. For the three years following 1973 actual
foreign holdings declined in real terms, so under the alternative, interest

rates would actually have been lower. Then, the situation is reversed and the
yield on bonds would have risen somewhat higher than the increase which

actually occurred. However, similar changes in holdings of other assets would
have more significant effects.

impact

As an example of an alternative direct investment scenario, we examine the
4
of exogenously holding direct investment at the 1975 level in real terms.

As Figure 9 shows, the yield on corporate bonds would have been as much as 98

basis points lower. Finally, Figure 10 shows the effect of not allowing net
foreign portfolio purchases of U.S. stock after the end of 1977.
These exercises must be considered as illustrative only, since they are

the product of one asset market equation from a full economic system. In particular, both government policy responses and lagged responses from the real side
of the economy are not considered.

IV. Conclusions
This paper has presented evidence bearing on the question of international
influences on the U.S. capital market. Both the examination of relative magnitudes
of international asset holdings and the estimation of a simple partial—equilibrium

capital market model indicate that such influences are quite important. In
particular, we have found that international effects on the long—term new—issue

corporate bond rate in the U.S. are highly significant. Since this interest rate
is often seen as crucial in domestic investment decisions, we have reason to be-

lieve that investment in the U.S. is significantly influenced by international
capital movements.

Further research will be required before some highly important policy

questions can be addressed. For example, knowledge of the elasticities of
international capital holdings will be needed in order to determine whether

government policies to influence savings result in changes in domestic or
foreign investment. Such information will be difficult to discern in historical
evidence, since international asset holdings have been so strongly influenced by
government policies and by the changes in the world wealth distribution engendered

by oil price increases. What the present study has hopefully done is to indicate
that these questions are worth asking.

2We are concerned here with the effects on the long—term capital market.
This author has recently provided evidence (Hartman (1979)) which suggests
that foreign events have a significant impact on U.S. money market rates.
31n the remainder of the paper this notation will be used to describe the asset
holdings which are the result of these capital flows. Thus, a superscript "ii'
win indicate foreign holdings of a U.S. asset, while "o" will be used to indicate
U.S. holdings of a foreign asset.
4All data utilized in this study are taken from the Flow of Funds Accounts of the
Federal Reserve, and are collected from various original sources by the Federal
Reserve. Stock and bond transactions are reported directly to the U.S. Treasury
by banks, brokers, and dealers, and are published monthly in the Treasury
Bulletin. The Commerce Department utilizes a survey to estimate direct investment
flows which are then reported in the Survey of Current Business.

analysis of foreign activity in the U.S. government bond market in the early
1970's can be found in Adams (1973).
6Survey of Current Business, April, 1978.
7See Friedman (1977, 1979, 1980).
8Because of the wealth constraint, only n—i of the n equations in the system are
independent. Therefore, only relative rates of return can be determined. However, if one asset return is fixed then the other returns can be determined.
Following this line of reasoning, we will consider equation (3) to be a description of how a truncated asset return vector is determined. Note that since net
financial wealth is simply the aggregated value of outside asset supplies, it
need not be included.

9The latter affects both liquidity preference and the willingness of net suppliers
to provide inside assets.
By utilizing a model of this form, we are not able to employ the restrictions im—
pliedby the underlying asset demand theory (see Friedman (1979)). However, since
our interest is in the international transactions, we choose to estimate their
impacts in the most straightforward manner.

1J.S. holdings of foreign government bonds and the international holdings of money
are not included because of empirical not theoretical considerations.
Direct investment and portfolio equity investment are somewhat different phenomena
and, hence, are treated as separate assets.
12There remains the issue of simultaneity of W, Y, and it with r3. Since rB is
usually seen as having a lagged effect on these values, and because we are not
particularly concerned about the coefficients of these variables, this problem
will be ignored.

—29—

13Such a procedure is not, of course, guaranteed to eliminate simultaneity problems,
particularly when there is some evidence of serial correlation as in (7). However,
this method should reduce the severity of the problem. Without specifying a model
of the world asset market, that is the most that can be hoped for.

similar s?ecification, in which log (GB—GB) from equation (3.3) is replaced by
log (GB—SGB ),was tried with the result that
equaled approximately 1.7. The
restriction 60 was tested, and could not be rejected with any reasonable conf 1—
dence.

15Across equations,
significance tests are not possible because aggregation is
not formally a coefficient restriction in a regression of this functional form.
However, the difference in explanatory power between (3.5) and, for example, (3.3)
is quite substantial.
(If the difference in specification could be treated as
approximately the same as four coefficient restrictions, the F—value for rejecting
those restrictions would exceed 7).

.
To be more specific, when we examine the beta coefficients
of all variables in
(3.2), we find that the major influences on rB come from the domestic variables.
The beta coefficients, including one for each component of the polynomial dis.
