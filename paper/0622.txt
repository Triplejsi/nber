The results indicate that contrary to

Fama's finding, there are significant movements in the real rate in both the
prewar and postwar period.

In particular, there is a significant negative

correlation between inflation and the real interest rate, and real rates appear
to have been unusually high during the contraction phase of the Great Depression,
while unusually low in the high inflation 1970s.

The results do not pick up

significant correlations between real interest rates and any of the real
variables tested.

However, the failure to find these correlations is likely

to be the result of small cyclical variation of real rates rather than the
absence of relationships between real variables and real rates.

INTRODUcr ION

Knowledge of how real interest rates move over time is critical to
our understanding of macroeconomics.

Movements in the real rate are cen-

tral to the discussion of the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy in
the standard ISLM paradigm as well as in modern macroeconometric models. l
Monetary policy is viewed as affecting the real rate of interest which then
affects business and consumers' investment decisions and hence aggregate
demand.

Real

intere~t

rates also play a prominent role in explanations of

business cycles and particular business cycle episodes.

For example, the

apparently unusually high real rates in the early years of the Great Depression is frequently cited as a major factor in that business cycle downturn.

2

The impact of real interest rates on savings-consumption decisions

has also been the subject of recent work.

then declines in the real

interest rate can have an adverse effect on capital formation and hence on
productivity, a serious concern of policymakers.

Clearly, the real interest

rate deserves careful study.
This paper is an empirical exploration of real interest rate movements in the United States over the last fifty years.

It focuses on

several questions which have repeatedly arisen in the literature.

How

valid is the hypothesis associated with Fama (1975) that the real rate of
interest is constant?

Does the real rate decline with increased inflation?

Are cyclical movements in real variables correlated with real rate movements?

How reliable is the Fisher (1930) effect where nominal interest

rates reflect changes in expected inflation?

What kind of variation

in real interest rates have we experienced in the last fifty years?

1

2

Have real rates turned negative in the 1970s as is commonly believed, and
were 'they unusually high in the initial stages of the Great Depression?

.

In pursuing these questions, this paper first outlines in section II
the methodology and theory used in the empirical analysis.

The empirical

results then follow in Section III, and a final section contains the coneluding remarks.

II.

THE METHODOLOGY

The real rate of interest for a one-period bond is defined from the
•
Fisher (1930) equation

where,
it

= the

nominal interest rate earned on a one-period bond

maturing at time t--i.e., it is the nominal return from
holding the one-period bond from t-l to t.
e

~t

= the

rate of inflation fromt-l to t expected by tl1e bond

market at time t-l.
rr

t

= the

one-period real rate of interest expected by the bond

market at time t-l for the bond maturing at time t.
Hence, the real interest rate, rr , is just the difference between the nominal
t
S
rate of interest and the expected rate of inflation:
it is the real return
from holding the one-period bond from t-l to t which is expected at time t-l.
Because the real rate is a return expected at the beginning of the period,
it is also frequently referred to as the ex ante real rate.

This more

3

precise terminology is used to differentiate it from what is termed the
ex post real rate:

this is the actual real return from holding the one-

~

period bond from t-l to t.

It equals the nominal interest rate minus the

actual inflation rate from t-l to t.and can be written as

This issue is de-

Note also that for expositional con-

venience, the ex ante real rate is always referred to as the real rate
throughout this paper, while the ex post real rate always refers to the
variable defined in (2).
One approach to analyzing the movements in the real rate is to calculate
them by using a survey measure of inflation expectations, such as the Livingston
data, which

is then subtracted from a nominal interest rate e

survey-based measure

The resulting

of the real rate can then be studied directly, for

example, by calculating its correlation with relevant variables.

6

The problem

\lith this approach is that it is only as good as the survey measure of inflation
expectations, and there are serious doubts as to the quality of these data. 7
As a result, a different methodology is used in the analysis here which involves

correlation and ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with the ex post real
rate.
The underlying assumption behind this analysis is the rationality of
inflation expectations in the bond market, which implies the following
condition:

4

Where,
't-l

= information

available at time t-l.

This tells us that the forecast error of inflation must be uncorrelated with
past available information.

There is a large body of evidence that supports

this rationality, or equivalently the efficiency of financial markets. 8
Furthermore, tests more specifically directed at the rationality of inflation
forecasts in the bond market also support the use of this assumption over
•

long sample periods such as are used here.

9

If the real rate determined at t-l, rr , is correlated with variables,
t
X _ , which are elements of the available information set

then we

can write,

Note that the error term, u ' is also determined at t-l. Substituting (4) into

where

Since data on the ex post real rate, eprr , are observable, in contrast with
t
data on the real rate, equation (5) can be estimated.

The question arises:"

what will be the relationship between OLS estimates from (5), with what
would be obtained from (4) if it wp.re estimable?

To answer this question,

several propositions are demonstrated for the simplest case where the Xvariables are non-stochastic.

With the appropriate assumptions,IO corresponding

5

asymptotic results can be generated for the case of stochastic XiS, but this
additional complexity is avoided here •.

.

The first proposition is that the OLS estimates of

B from

(4) and

(S) are equal in expectation for the non-stochastic X case (and with the
appropriate assumption l l they will be equal in the probability limit in the

In this case it may be very hard to discern significant

a-coefficients in the ex post real rate regressions because the statistical
tests will have so little power.

Th~s

is essentially the point made by Nelson

and Schwert in their comment on Fama (1975) .14
We can also use the estimated ex post real rate regressions to provide us with information on how the real rate has moved over time.

This estimate of the real rate has errors for two reasons.

First, some

variables or nonlinearities which explain real rate movements are likely to
have been left out of the regression model, resulting in a non-zero u

term.

Second, the a-coefficient would be estimated with some error in a finite
sample.

To see this, we just subtract equation (4) from (11) to yield the

This then is the method of analysis used in this paper.

However, the discussion above issues a warning for interpreting the results
that follow.

The absence of a variable' s significant explanatory power in an

ex post real rate regression should not be viewed as evidence that the real
rate is unrelated to this variable.

An

alternative, and equally plausible

view, is that the statistical tests here just do not have enough power to
find this relationship.

with 'this caveat, we can now turn to the actual

empirical results in the next section.

III.
THE DATA

THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS

.

The empirical analysis here uses quarterly data on the ex post real
rate for three month treasury bills.

These ex post rates are at a quarterly

rate and are calculated by subtracting the actual, continuously compounded
inflation rate (using the seasonally

~adjusted

Consumer Price Index (CPI»

from the continuously compounded nominal yield on a three month bill maturing
at the end of the quarter.

The bill rate data were obtained from the bond

file of the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the University
of Chicago.

lS

As in Fama (1975), the CPI is used to calculate inflation rates

here rather than the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) because only the CPI refleets transaction prices.

The dating convention is as follows.

The ex post

real rate for a quarter is the actual real return on a three month bill held
from the beginning to the end of that quarter.

All variables that are growth

rates, such as money growth, real GNP growth and inflation, are calculated
as the change in the log from the last month of the previous quarter to the
current quarter and are thus at quarterly rates.

The

une~ployment

rate is

for the last month in the quarter and the investment to capital ratio is
constructed comparably to this ratio in Fama and Gibbons (1980) by dividing
the investment over the quarter by the capital stock at the end of the quarter.
The variables used in the analysis here are discussed in more detail in the
Data Appendix.
Monthly data are not used in the analysis for the following reason.
It is not clear what is the appropriate dating for the CPI in a particular
month since price quotations have been collected over the entire month.

Thus

there is no accurate way of matching up the timing of the one month bills
with the dating of the CPl.

This problem is somewhat less severe when quarterly

11
data are used.
of the

quarte~

The potential timing error of using the CPI in the last month
as a match for a three month bill maturing at the end of the

quarter is smaller as a fraction of the time to maturity than would be the
case if the one month bill maturing at the end of the month is matched up,

as in Fama (1975), with the CPI in that month.

The quarterly ex post real

rates should be more accurate than the one month rates as a result.

Further-

more, Fama (1975) finds only small differences in coefficient estimates with
quarterly versus monthly data, and little additional information is contained
in the more noisy monthly series since the standard errors of the coefficients
using the monthly dat~ are only slightly smaller than those found with the
quarterly data.
The empirical analysis of this paper focuses its main attention on
the 1953-1 through 1979-4 sample period as an update to Fama (1975).

The

1979-4 quarter was the latest quarter for which the CRSP bill series was
available.

Fama started his analysis in 1953 as here because the CPI was

substantially upgraded in that year.

He ended his sample period at the second

quarter of 1971 to avoid any possible distortions that the Nixon price controls
might have had on the measurement of the CPl.

In preliminary results I ex-

eluded the price control period from 1971-3 to 1974-4 from my analysis with
little appreciable effect on the coefficient estimates or on the major
" d"~ngs. 19
f ~n

Since it is not Obvious that the Nixon price controls should

have· severely distorted the CPI, data from this period are included in the
analysis.

RESULTS:

1953-1 to 1979-4
Tests with ex post real rates in Fama (1975) could not reject the

hypothesis that the real rate was constant over the 1953-71 period.

However,

12
later work which frequently used more refined statistical tests did find
significant rejections of this hypothesis.

Included in this work is not only

that of Fama's critics, Carlson (1977), Garbade and Wachtel (1978), Hess and
Bicksler (1975), Joines (1977) and Nelson and Schwert (1977), but also that
by Fama himself, Fama (197Gb) and Fama and Gibbons (1980).

Extending Fama's

original sample period through the end of the 1970s should yield new insights
into the question of the constancy of the real rate because the 1971-3 to
1979-4 period has been one of unusual economic turbulence by postwar standards.
It contains both the worst recession in the postwar period as well as the

.

highest inflation rates.

The greater variation in the data that occurred as

a result could make statistical relationships that much more clear-cut.
The null hypothesis of the constancy of the real rate is studied here
with two types of tests which are similar to those carried out in Fama (1975).
First, we look at the serial correlation structure of the ex post real rate,
and we then turn to tests of whether other variables in the available information set,

~t-l'

are correlated with the ex post real rate.

These tests

correspond to the weak form and strong form tests discussed in the efficient
'
20
markets I ~terature.
Table 1 contains the first twelve autocorrelations of the ex post
real rate for the 1953-79 period.

These autocorrelations are positive and

large, and more than half are more than two standard errors away from zero.
The constancy of the real rate implies the null hypothesis that all the
autocorr~lations

equal zero.

It is formally tested with the adjusted Q-

statistic suggested by Ljung and Box (1978).

The Q(12) statisti.c is dis-

tributed approximately as X (12), and its marginal significance level is the
probability of getting that value of the test statistic or higher under the
null hypothesis:

i.e., a marginal significance level less than .01 indicates

Thus,

in a clear-cut rejection of the constancy of the

22

Considering the recurrent discussion of the Mundell-Tobin effect in
the literature, the inflation rate is an obvious candidate as a variable that
might be correlated with, the real rate.

23

Model 2.1 tests for this correlation

and the results do exhibit a strong, significant negative correlation of the
ex post real rate with the lagged inflation rate:

its coefficient of -.3073

has a t-statistic over six in absolute value with a very low marginal significance level.

This result rejecting the constancy of the real rate is con-

sistent with many other studies, such as Lahiri (1976), Carlson (1971), Levi
and Makin (1979) and Pearce (1979), which find a significant negative correlation between the real rate and expected inflation.
Since this significant negative relationship between inflation and the
real rate is so striking and has such important implications, it deserves

further scrutiny and testing for robustness.

One question that arises asks:

Is this result dependent on the choice of the CPI as the price index in the
empirical analysis?

The answer appears to be no.

Despite the limitations

of the WPI because it is not constructed from transaction prices, it is a
plausible alternative to the CPI as a price index for use here.

When model

2.1 is reestimated with the variables. constructed using the WPI rather than
CPI, the significant negative correlation of the ex post real rate and inflation
continues to hold up.

The coefficient on the lagged inflation rate in this

WPI regression equals -.3040 and is almost identical to the corresponding
coefficient in Table 2.

Its t-statistic is also highly significant, equaling

-4.41.
Another question of robustness wonders whether the negative relationship of the real rate and.inflation is only consistent with data from the
last half of the sample period when inflation rates were high.

This is a

particularly relevant question because Fama (1975) did not find a significant
negative correlation of the real rate and inflation using a sample period that
excluded data from the high inflation 1970s.

To pursue this question, the

sample was split in half, and model 2.1 was estimated over both sample periods.
The lagged inflation coefficient in the regression for the first half of
the sample, 1953-1 to 1966-2, is not significantly negative:
with a t-statistic of only -.05.

it equals -.0067

Note, however, that the standard error

of this coefficient is quite large, exceeding .13.

In the regression for the

last half of the sample, 1966-3 to 1979-4, the lagged inflation coefficient
is not far from the value of the corresponding coefficient in Table 2:

it

equals -.3614 and is statistically significant with a t-statistic of -4.23.

15
The discrepancy between these results could be occurring because, in the
early sample p'eriod,there just is not enough variation in the real rate to
discern an inflat:lon effect.

A Chow test for the stability

of the coefficients of model 2.1 over these two sample periods confirms
this conjecture.

The F(2,104) statistic equals 2.47 (its critical value

at the 5% level is 3.1) and does not reject the equality of the 2.1 coefficients
in the two periods.

It appears that Fama's (1975) inability to find the sig-

nificant correlation of inflation with the ex post real rate was due to the
peculiar nature of his particular sample period which, as noted by Shiller
(1980), has insuffici~nt variation in the real rate.

The results here then show

that the postwar period is more accurately characterized as displaying a
negative correlation of the real rate and inflation.
Model 2.2 of

Tabl~

2 contains a more mechanical test of the constancy

of the real rate by postulating that the real rate moves with a fourth-order
polynomial in time.

of the real rate is also strong in this case, with an extremely small marginal significance level for the null hypothesis that the coefficients on

When the trend variables are added to

model 2.1, as in model 2.3, there is a significant improvement in explanatory
power:

F(4,102)

= 4.33 while the critical F at 5% is approximately 2.5. Here,

the marginal significance level that tests the null hypothesis of the constancy of the real rate declines even further.

25

Table 3 tests whether other variables that have been cited in the
literature are correlated with the real rate.

The one and four lags of these

variables are used in models which either include or exclude the lagged

inflation variable.

The most striking finding in this table is that none of

the real variables--real GNP growth, the GNP gap which is the percentage
difference between potential GNP and real GNP, the unemployment rate and the investment to capital ratio--have significant explanatory
power for movements in the ex post real rate.

26

these regressions does not alter this finding.

Including lagged inflation in
Table 3's lack of success in

finding significant correlations should not be viewed as implying that real
factors do not affect the real rate.

More plausible is the view that the

statistical tests here do not have sufficient power to discern co-movements of
real variables and the real rate.

Since the real variables used here are

meant to capture cyclical effects on the real rate, this ndght occur because
there just is not enough cyclical variation in the real rate to be picked up
by these tests.

27

The results with the money growth variable are more interesting.

Results

with an M2 money growth measure are similar to those found for Ml in Table 3
and are thus not reported.

28

When the lagged inflation rate is excluded from

the money growth regressions, the coefficients of the lagged money growth
variables are statistically significant and have a negative sum.

29

Thus an

increase in money growth has the usual negative relationship with real rates
that we would expect from standard monetary theory.

However, the 3.2 results

indicate that the negative correlation of money growth and the real rate may
only "arise because of the positive correlation of money growth with inflation:
the money growth coefficients are no longer significant when they are added
to an ex post real rate regression that includes the lagged inflation rate.
Feldstein (1980a) has argued that an increased rate of moner growth is nonneutral because it raises inflation and lowers the real return to saving, and
this can have an adverse effect on capital formation and productivity.

The

significant negative correlation of the real rate and money growth found here

17
is in the direction that Feldstein's argument requires, but it can only be
taken as

supporting his position if we are willing to ascribe causation

.Because the money growth variables do not have significant

explanatory power in addition to lagged inflation, the evidence for a shortrun cyclical effect of monetary policy is weak.
to the low power of these statistical tests.

Again, this might be attributed

But it does point out why it

might be so difficult to sort out the issue discussed by Shiller (1980) as to
.
30
whether th e Federal Reserve System can contrel real interest rates.
To briefly summarize the results in Tables 1-3:

The real interest

rate has not been eo~stant over the 1953-79 period, and the economic variable
most highly correlated with the ex post real rate is the inflation rate.

None

of the other economic variables add significant explanatory power to the ex
post real rate regressions with lagged inflation as an explanatory variable.
However, there is something left to explain in real rate movements because
time trend variables do add significant explanatory power.
Another approach to understanding these results involves looking at
estimates of the real rate derived from fitted values of the most interesting
of the regressions.

Figure 1 contains the estimates of the real rate derived

from the fitted values of the regression with the best fit, #2.3.

The inner

band surrounding the real rate estimates delimits the region where real rates
are within two lower-bound standard errors of the estimated real rate (as
calculated from (14».

The outer band is the region where real rates are

within two upper-bound standard errors of the estimated real rate {as calculated
from (IS».

suitable caution.
Figure 1 indicates that the real'rate tended to be positive in the
first twenty years of the sample period, with a declining trend from 1953-56,
an

upward trend reaching a maximum in the boom years of the mid-1960s and

a declining trend thereafter.

Using the inner band for inference, the esti-

mated real rates were significantly p'ositive for most of this period and the
peak values of over two percent at an annual rate are more than six of the
lower-bound standard errors away from zero.

The real interest rate appears

to turn negative towards the end of 1972 and the downward trend accelerates
•
through the end of 1974, whereupon the real rate stays negative but has no
easily discernible trend.

Throughout most of the 1973-79 period, the esti-

mated real rates remain significantly negative according to the inner band
confidence region, and the most negative estimated real rates of approximately
minus two percent at an annual rate are more than five of the lower-bound
standard errors away from zero.

Thus, as casual inspection of nominal interest

rate and inflation data might have led one to suspect, there is strong evidence
that real interest rates were positive in the 1950s and 60s, but have turned
quite negative in the mid- and late 1970s.
One striking feature of these results is their similarity to those
of Garbade and Wachtel (1978) and Fama and Gibbons (1980).

They also use

ex post real rate data, but find their results with a very different statis·ticai technique involving variable-parameter regression.

Both of these

studies assume that the real rate is so highly autocorrelated that its movements over time can be approximated as a random walk.

There is somewhat

more smoothness on their result1ng real rate estimates than is the case here,
but the overall magnitudes and peaks and troughs of the series are quite

close to those 1n

The corroborating evidence from these studies

then lends further support to the results here.

19

Because time trend variables do contain additional explanatory power
over the lagged inflation rate in the ex·post real rate regressions, there
must be some other economic variables left out of the analysis here that
help explain real rate movements and are correlated with the trend variables.
This leaves us with a puzzle to figure out what these excluded variables
might be.

One clue comes from a

comp~rison

of the estimated real rates from

the model which only includes the lagged inflation rate as an explanatory variable with those from the model which also includes the time trends as additional
explanatory variables.

Figure 2 contains one series of estimated real rates

derived from the fitted values of model 2.1 while the other, which has already
appeared in Figure 1, is derived from model 2.3.

The two series have a

roughly similar pattern, but a comparison indicates that the time trend
variables make the estimated real rate higher in the 1961-70 period, lower in
the 1975-79 period and lower in the 1954-57 period.

We might search for rele-

vant economic variables missing from this analysis by noting that their effect
on the real rate should be in a similar direction.
The estimates of the real rate obtained with the approach used here
provide another piece of useful information.

Since Pearce (1979) has shown that a

similar ARIMA model forecasts inflation better than the Livingston survey
measure, it appears as though the approach outlined here will outperform the
Livingston measure as well.

Because the true expected inflation rate can

probably be characterized as rational, the better, and hence more rational,

Since this error is just the negative of the estimated real rate error, its
variance is identical to that of the real rate error in (13) and the lower and
upper bound standard errors can be calculated with the formulae in (14) and
(15).

These standard errors, especially the lower bound which is likely to

be more accurate, not only provide confidence intervals for the expected inflation rate, but also can be useful in determining how severe the errors-invariable bias would be when this expected inflation measure is used in other
empirical work.

The most striking feature of this figure is the presence of the Fisher effect.
The correlation of the estimated expected inflation rate and the nominal

Thus despite the finding here that the real rate is not

constant, the basic Fama (1975) position that tile Fisher effect is strong in

the postwar period is supported.

As would be expected from the significant

negative correlation of the ex post real 'rate and lagged inflation, the
negative correlation of the estimated expected inflation rate and the estimated real rate is substantial, equaling -.86.
Probably the most important aspect of Figure 3 from the point of view
of policy analysis is the negative coxrelation (-.67) of movements in the
nominal interest rate and the estimated real rate.
moral for policymakers in this negative correlation.

There is an important
Many economists have

long warned that increases in nominal interest rates do not necessarily mean
that money is tight because movements in the real rate might not be highly
correlated with the nominal rate.

Figure 3 indicates something even stronger.

It says that an increase in nominal interest rates is associated with a lower
real rate rather than the 'reverse.

Thus when nominal rates are high, it is

more likely that we are in a period of "easy money" with low real rates than
the contrary as has frequently been assumed.

Targeting on a nominal interest

rate can thus cause policy to err in the wrong direction.

Therefore, it is

a highly dangerous policy approach, and it hopefully has been abandoned by the
Fed in the recent revision of its policy procedures in Octobe+ 1979.

RESULTS:

1931-4 to 1952-4
There are several problems with analysis of ex post real rates in the

pre-1953 period.

Before the 1953 major revision of the CPI, this price index

was not measured that accurately.

Particularly troublesome is the fact that

prices were often sampled infrequently in constructir.g the early CPI data,
and this could induce spurious correlations with the calculated ex post real
rates.

Another problem is that for much of this period the nominal interest

rate was pegged.

From 1937 through 1941 the t-bill rate dropped essentially

22

to zero.

Since there is an alternative, readily available asset in the economy

which has a zero nominal return--i.e., currency--the bill rate could not fall
further.

Thus it was effectively pegged during this period.

After this, up

until the early part of 1951, the bill rate was then actually pegged by the
Federal Reserve System.

As Fama (1975) has noted, we might not expect Fisher

relationships to appear in data where. nominal interest rates are pegged.
We must therefore be cautious when we interpret results using these
earlier data.

However, it is worthwhile

studyin~

these results because they

might provide further evidence which corroborates the striking results obtained
from the postwar data found in Tables 1 and 2.

The sample period analyzed

here starts in the fourth quarter of 1931 when t-bil1 data first become available in the CRSP bond file.

Go1dfeld-Quandt (1965) and Glesjer (1969) tests

were again conducted to see if there was heteroscedasticity within the 1931-4
to 1952-4 sample period.

No significant heteroscedasticity was found so

Tables 4-5 correspond to Tables 1-2 and again test for the constancy
of the real rate, but now for the earlier sample period, 1931-4 to 1952-4.
As in the previous results, the ex post real rate from 1931-4 to 1952-4 does

display large positive autocorre1ations for the first four lags; whi.le the
autocorrelations at higher lags are not significantly different from zero.
The joint test for the significance of the first twelve autocorrelations in
Table 4 also corroborates the previous finding that the ex post real rate is
serially correlated.

The Q(12) statistic is over 40 with a marginal signifi-

cance level less than .0001, indicating that the real rate was not constant
in the 1931-4 to 1952-4 sample period.
Model 5.1 of Table 5 tests for whether the negative relationship
between the real rate and lagged inflation also holds up in this earlier

its value of -.4937 is even

larger than that f~und in the postwar data and its t-statistic is greater
than five in absolute value.

Because the nominal bill rate was effectively

pegged after 1937, we might wonder if this negative relationship only occurs
as a result of the pegging in the later part of the sample period.

To explore

this, the sample was split at the 1937-4 quarter, and model 5.1 was estimated
for the two periods.

The coefficient on lagged inflation in the 1931-4 to

1937-4 sample period equals -.4265 and is statistically significant with a
t-statistic of -2.17.

The coefficient on lagged inflation in the 1938-1 to

1952-4 sample period equals -.4654 with a t-statistic of -4.04.

As would be

expected from these results, a Chow test which tests for the stability of the
coefficients in 5.1 over tre two sample periods cannot reject the null hypothesis
that the coefficients are equal:

F(2,8l)

= 1.16

with the critical value of

F at 5% approximately equal to 3.1.
These results with the earlier sample period provide even more evidence
that Fama's (1975) finding that the real rate is constant and is not negatively
correlated with inflation is the exception and not the rule.

The ex post real

rate is found to be significantly negatively correlated with inflation in
every sample period except Fama's, and it appears that this is not due to a
definite absence of the negative correlation in his sample period, but rather
to the lack of variation in the data.

Indeed, not too surprisingly considering

the nature of the pre-1953 data, it appears as though the strong negative
association of real rates and inflation found in the postwar data is on the
weak side by historical standards.

A Chow test, suitably corrected for hetero-

scedasticity,36 comparing the coefficients of 2.1 and 5.1 finds that the
coefficients are not stable over the 1931-79 sample period:

the null hypothesis

24
of equal coefficients is rejected at the one percent level with F(2,189)
9.19, while

th~

=

critical F at 1% is approximately 4.7.

Model 5.2 conducts the more mechanical test of the constancy of the
real rate, assuming that the real rate moves with a second-order polynomial
in time.

A second-order polynomial is used here because additional variables

with time trends raised to a higher power did not add significant explanatory
power in both the 5.2 and 5.3 regressions.

37

The null hypothesis that the

coefficients of the time trend variables equal zero is rejected with a low
marginal significance level.

When the time trend variables are added to the

model with lagged infiation as an explanatory variable, as in 5.3, they do
contain significant, additional explanatory power:

This might be an

indication of the greater economic stability in the later period.
Some economists have challenged the Keynesian position that money
was "easy" during the contractionary phase of the Great Depression by stating
that real interest rates were probably quite high during this period although
nominal interest rates were low.

38

This view is given strong support in Figure 4.

The estimated real rates from 1931-4 to 1933-1 range from .6.2% to 10.2% at
an annual rate.

estimated real rates significantly higher than zero--sometimes by over four
standard errorp--but they also appear to be significantly higher than any
of the estimated ;eal rates for the postwar period.

By the criterion of

real rates, the evidence indicates that since 1931 money has never been
tighter than in the contraction phase of the Great Depression.
The estimated real rate begins to decline as the economy recovers after
1933-2 and bounces around zero until 1938-2.

From then on until 1952-4, the

estimated real rate is almost always negative and is significantly so (by
the criterion of the lower-bound standard errors) for

rr~st

of this period.

Indeed the estimated ~eal rate is frequently less ~~an -5% and reaches its
low point of -16.4% in 1946-4 when it is five of the lower bound standard
errors away from zero.

Thus the period where nominal interest rates were

pegged, also appears to haye been a period of negative real rates.
Figure 5 contains the estimated real rates derived from the model with
only lagged inflation as an explanatory variable versus those from the model
which also includes the time trends as explanatory variables.

Because the

trend variables do significantly help to explain the ex post real rate, as
discussed before, they can provide information on what effect left-out
economic variables might be having on the real rate.

The comparison of the

two estimated real rate series in Figure 5 indicates that the left-out
variables make the real rate higher in the 1931-37 period and lower thereafter.
Figure 6, which plots the estimated real interest rate from 5.3, its
corresponding estimated expected inflation and the nominal interest rate for
the 1931-52 period, is comparable to Figure 3.

Here we see some striking

differences between the earlier and later sample periods.

We again see the

negative correlation of eXPected inflation and real rates as we might expect,
although it is even stronger than before, equaling -.99.

However, we no

it is quite small

None of these results is particularly

surprising because as Figure 6 illustrates, there was very little movement
in nominal interest rates in this period.

With substantial variation in the

expected inflation rate, this must necessarily result in a very strong negative
correlation of the real rate and expected inflation and the absence of a
Fisher effect.
•
Figure 6 does support the important policy-oriented conclusion of

Figure 3.

Movements in nominal interest rates contain little information

about the movements in real interest rates.

In this early sample period, the

correlation of the nominal with the real interest rate is only .25.

It was

just as easy for the monetary authorities in the pre-1953 period to confuse
tight versus easy monetary policy as a result of focusing on nominal rather
than real interest rates, as it was during the more recent period.

The policy

mistakes of the Fed during the contraction phase of the Great Depression
clearly attest

RESULTS:

to this fact.

TAX EFFECTS ON THE REAL RATE

So far, the consequences of taxes on nominal interest payments have
been "ignored.

As has been emphasized by Darby (1975) and especially Feldstein

(1976, 1980a,b) this can be misleading for the postwar period.

Clearly, what

is relevant to the firm's decision to invest or the consumer's decision to
save versus consume is the real after-tax interest rate.

However, as has

been illustrated by Feldstein and Summers (1978) and Shiller (1980), the
effective tax rate on interest

payment~can vary

tremendously for different

27

individuals and firms, particularly when they are making different types of
decisions.

It,is easy to find cases where the effective tax rate on

payments ranges from zero on up to the top "marginal tax rate.

interes~

As a result,

it is extremely difficult to know what is the appropriate tax rate on interest
payments for the overall economy.

This is the primary reason why the analysis

in this paper focuses first on real interest rates ignoring the effect of
taxes.
To get a flavor of how taxes might affect the previous results, the
empirical analysis in Tables 1-3 has been redone with an after-tax ex post
real rate which has b~en calculated under the assumption that the effective
marginal tax rate is a third.

This tax rate was chosen because it is approxi-

mately in the middle of the range of several authors' estimates of the marginal

payments 1n

There is no claim

here that this tax rate is an accurate estimate of the effective tax rate on
interest, but the results using it will provide us with a reasonable idea of
how important tax effects might be to some of the conclusions reached earlier.
Tables 6-8 contain the estimated results using the after-tax ex post
real rate.

Because only a crude adjustment has been made here for taxes, these

results do not deserve a detailed discussion.

A few brief comments should be

sufficient to give us a flavor of how tax effects would affect our views.

The

tests for the constancy of the after-tax real rate in Tables 6 and 7 reject
the null hypothesis at even lower marginal significance levels than in Tables
I-and 2.

Adjusting the. ex post real rate for taxes increases the variation

in this variable and this is what leads to the even stronger positive serial
correlation found in Table 6 and the stronger rejections of the constancy of
the after-tax real rate.

Because the tax adjustment forces the after-tax real

rate to decline as the nominal interest rate rises along with the inflation

rate, the coefficient on lagged inflation becomes even more negative and
statistically. significant.

Tax adjustment of the ex post real rate thus

generates conclusions similar to and even stronger than those found when it
was not adjusted.

Clearly, use of a different tax rate would not alter the

direction of these results.
Table 8 shows that the conclusions on the correlation of real rates
with other variables do not change when a tax adjustment is made.

Feldstein

(1980a) makes the case that monetary policy will be non-neutral, because even
if it leaves the unadjusted real rate unchanged when it causes higher inflation,
the after-tax real rate will fall.

The results in Table 3 indicate that, even

without a tax adjustment, the real rate has fallen with faster money growth.
However, as the 8.r and 8.2 results show, when the real rate is adjusted for
taxes, this negative

corr~lation

is even stronger.

The estimated after-tax real rate derived from the fitted values of
7.3 along with its upper and lower bound 95% confidence intervals is plotted
in Figure 7.

In the first half of the 1953-79 period, the after-tax real

rates appear to be mostly positive, yet even the lower bound confidence
interval rarely rejects the hypothesis that the after-tax real rate is zero.
In the late 1960s the estimated after-tax real rate turns negative and from
1969 through the end of the sample period it is significantly negative
using the lower-bound standard errors.

Note that towards the end of the

period, even the upper-bound standard errors indicate that it is significantly
negative.

In the 1970s, the estimated after-tax real rate is frequently

below -4% at an annual rate and is more than six of the lower-bound standard
errors away from zero.

Figures 8 and 9 which correspond to 2 and 3 are included in the paper
for the sake of completeness.

They reveai no surprises.

As is evident from

Figure 8, the time trend variables play a similar role in altering the estimate of the after-tax real rate that they do for the estimate of the real
rate unadjusted for taxes.

Furthermore, the estimate of expected inflation

and its relationship to the nominal interest rate in Figure 9 is similar to
that found in Figure 3.

40

Figure 9 does illustrate the expected finding that

the correlations of the estimated after-tax real rate with the estimates of
expected inflation and the nominal interest rate are even more negative--the
respective correlations equal -.96 and -.80--than is the case when the real
rate is unadjusted for taxes.

The conclusion that the nominal interest rate

is a misleading guide to the tightness of monetary policy is then given even
greater support when we view the after-tax real rate as the vehicle through
which monetary policy is transmitted.

IV.

CONCLUSIONS

This paper has analyzed the movements of real interest rates over
the 1931-79 period with a statistical methodology that has the advantage of
reliability.

Despite the low statistical power of the approach used here,

many interesting findings have been gleaned from the data.

These findings

are listed below.

1.

The hypothesis that the real rate is constant is strongly
rejected both for the 1953-79 period as well as the 1931-52
period.

Fama's (1975) finding that the constancy of the

real rate could not be rejected-is the exception and not the

30
rule.

His result seems to stem from the lack of variation in

the real rate for his sample period.

.

The adjustment of the real

rate for taxes lends even stronger support to the position that
the after-tax real rate, which is probably more relevant to
economic decisions, is not constant.
2.

The real rate, whether

ad~usted

or unadjusted for taxes, is

negatively correlated with inflation.

This result is found

for both the 1953-79 and 1931-52 sample period, and again Fama's
(1975) failure to find this result appears to be due to a lack
•
of variation in the real rate data.
3.

Movements in real variables are not significantly
correlated with ex post real rates, whether adjusted or unadjusted for

t~xes.

The failure to find these correlations is

more likely the result of small cyclical variation of real rates
rather than the absence of relationships between real variables
and real rates.
4.

Increased money growth is associated with a decline in real rates.
This non-neutrality result is even stronger when the real rate
is adjusted for taxes.

Little evidence was found that money

growth affects real rates other than through its effect on inflation, but again this could be due to the low power of the
statistical tests used here.
5.

The real interest rate appears to have been positive in the
1950s and 1960s but has since turned negative in the rnid- and
late 1970s.

When the real rate is adjusted for taxes, there is

less evidence that it has been positive in the postwar period
and there is strong evidence that it has been negative since 1969.

31
6.

Real rates were extremely high during the contraction phase of
the Great Depression and have never been as high since.

From

the perspective of real interest rates, money has never been
tighter than during this period.
7.

The period where nominal interest rates were effectively pegged
from 1938-1951 has been

~

period where real interest rates have

been negative.
8.

Estimates of expected inflation rates have been derived from
models of the real rate, and these estimates have several
advantages over those obtained from surveys or Box-Jenkins'
ARlMA models.

The estimates of expected inflation confirms

Fama's (1975) view that in the postwar period there is a strong
Fisher effect-where expected inflation and nominal interest
rates move together.

However, no Fisher effect is evident in

the pre-1953 sample period.
9.

Movements in nominal interest rates are not a reliable indicator
of movements in real rates, whether adjusted for taxes or not.
This is true of both the 1931-52 and 1953-79 sample period.
The correlation of estimated real rates and nominal interest
rates is low in the 1931-52 sample period and is even negative
in the postwar period.

The most important policy implication from these results is the recommendation that policymakers, politicians and the public should not focus
on nominal interest rates as an indicator of the tightness of monetary policy.
Not only do the results here indicate that nominal interest rates contain little
information on real interest rates and hence on the tightness of monetary policy,
but they also indicate that nominal interest rates have been a highly misleading

32
indicator of monetary tightness during some crucial business cycle episodes.
For example, :t:eal interest rates appear t'o have been extremely high during

.

the Great Depression downturn, and yet, by the criterion of low nominal interest
rates, this period appears to have been one of "easy money" rather than the
reverse.

Knowledge of the true state of monetary tightness might have led the

Fed to take more appropriate policy

a~tions.

Similarly, the period of the

1970s appeared to be one of "tight money" by the nominal interest rate
criterion, yet real rates appear to have been quite low.

Knowledge of ~ow

"easy" money truly was might have encouraged a less expansionary monetary
policy, resulting in less inflation.

4Recent empirical results on this issue are quite mixed.

For example,

Boskin's (1978) study has been strongly challenged by Howrey and Hymans
(1978).

70ne obvious danger with survey data is that there may have been
very little incentive for the respondents to answer accurately.

A more

subtle point that is often unrecognized in the literature is that the behavior of market expectations need not reflect the average expectations of
participants in that market.

Market expectations are frequently believed to

be rational, but not because all, most or even the average market participant
is also believed to be rational.

Rather, rational expectations are plausible

because market expectations can be driven to the rational expectations equilibrium by the elimination of unexploited profit opportunities.

This arbitrage

view of expectations formation clearly allows the average expectations of
market participants to differ from the market's expectations.
and (198lb) discuss this point more extensively.)

(Mishkin (1978)

On theoretical grounds

alone then, we should be skeptical of using survey data to measure inflation

expectations in a market.
In addition, a recent empirical study by Pearce (1979) raises further
doubts

abo~t

·the accuracy as a measure of bond market expectations of the

survey data most frequently used in this literature, Livingston's.

Pearce

finds that over the 1959-76 period the Livingston survey data predict inflation
substantially worse than a simple (O!l,l) ARIMA model estimated only on data
available at the time of the forecast.

As Pearce notes, this result implies

that the Livingston expectations data do not fully exploit information on past
inflation rates and are thus inconsistent with rationdlity.

If the bond mar-

•
ket is believed to be efficient and hence rational--and there is evidence to
support this view--then Pearce's finding suggests that the Livingston data do
not accurately measure bond market expectations of inflation.

The X (6) statistic

Pearce also regresses

nominal interest rates on both the Livingston measure of inflation expectations
as well as the ARIMA model measure.

Not only is the Livingston measure out-

performed by the ARlMA measure in terms of goodness of fit, but also the
Livingston measure adds no significant additional explanatory power when
added to a Fisher equation using the ARlMAmeasure, while the reverse is not
true.

Given that a strong Fisher effect (positive correlation) between

expected inflation and nominal interest rates is expected in the postwar
period, this evidence is also not supportive of using the Livingston data in
the Fisher equation (1).

An even stronger statement can be made if a particular form of

Muthian expectations discussed by Sargent (1979, Chapter 10) is used to form
the ex ante real rate.

If the ex ante real rate is formed by least-squares

projection on information that includes X _ , then X'E

This

is a manifestation of the law of iterated projections discussed in Sargent
(1979, Chapter 10).
13

Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld (1980) point out that in a setup of

the type discussed here that even if the u's are serially uncorrelated as are
the E'S because of rationality, this does not rule out serial correlation in
the composite error term u - E.

This occurs because rationality does not

rule out correlation of the forecast errors with future values of variables
such as u.

This is why the fifth assumption in (8) is needed.

If serial

correlation does exist in the composite error term, correcting it with standard
techniques leads to inconsistent estimates.
(1980).

For example, see Flood and Garber

An estimator that avoids this problem is discussed in Curoby, Huizinga

and Obstfeld (1980).
14A similar argument to that here is another way to explain the
position taken by Fama (1976a) and Mishkin (1978) that when actual returns
have large variability relative to expected returns, accurate specification
of the model of market equilibrium is not critical to tests of market
efficiency.

F-4
l5Note that this formula is not invalidated if E(X'u) ~ 0 as long as
u is a linear function of X.

I.e., if u = Xo + n where n is also a linear

function of X and so on, then E(r~t - rr ) = O.

Thus consistency of thee

estimate is not a necessary condition for the validity of the 95% confidence
intervals used in the figures.

However, exclusion of relevant variables can

invalidate the formula.

laThe data used here are very similar to that used by Fama (1975).
Using his sample period

I

was able to reproduce very closely his results with

quarterly data.
19For example, excluding the 1971-3 to 1974-4 quarters from the 1953-79
sample period, the coefficient on

~(-l)

in model 1.2 dropped to -.2469 but

remained significantly negative with a t-statistic of -4.41.

20 see Fama (1970).
2lFor example, see the discussion of the Shiller (1979) results in
Mishkin (1978) and (198la).
22For example, in model 2.1 a Goldfeld-Quandt (1965) test which
excluded 16 observations yielded the F(44,44) statistic of 1.51, while the
critical F at the 5% level is approximately 1.7.

A Glesjer (1969) test

where the absolute value of the residuals in 2.1 was regressed against a
time trend yielded a t-statistic on the trend variable of only .94.

I

also

regressed the absolute value of the residuals from the Table 2 model against
lagged inflation because some recent literature has suggested that the
variability of inflation forecasting errors, £'s, might rise with inflation.
The evidence for this was weak.

For example, with the 2.1 residuals the

t-statistic on lagged inflation was only .72.

Furthermore, a heteroscedasticity

correction of the type suggested by Glesjer (1969)--i.e., weighting by the
fitted values from this regression--has only a slight effect on the results.
23A proxy for the expected inflation rate derived from an ARlMA (0,1,1)
inflation model with a seasonal MAl term was also used in estimation and the
results were very similar.

For example, in a model of the form 2.1 when the

expected inflation proxy replaced the lagged inflation rate, its coefficient
was -.3658 with a t-statistic of -7.03.

I

preferred not using this proxy

vari~le in the text because the results there clearly indicate that other

information besides past inflation rates are used in the bond market to
forecast inflation.

250ne issue not discussed in the text is the seasonality of the real
rate.

For a detailed discussion of this issue, see Fama and Schwert (1979)

and Shiller (1980).

I corroborated both of these studies' findings that

seasonality is present in the ex post real rate.

For example, a test of

whether seasonal dummies entered model 2.1 did reject the null hypothesis
that coefficients and seasonal dummies equal zero--(F(3,103)

= 5.93 with a

critical value at 5% of 2.7)--yet the results on the coefficient of lagged
inflation changed hardly at all.

t~at

an extensive treatment

of this issue is contained in the two studies mentioned above.

Second, as the

discussion in Famaand Schwert (1979) indicates, the fact that seasonality
exists in the real rate is not evidence against the constancy of the real
rate net of storage costs, and this is the more interesting hypothesis anyway.

In addition, the fixed-weight nature of the CPI may induce some

seasonality in the measured ex post real rate that is spurious.

When the

relative price of a good in the CPI consumption bundle is seasonally high-fruit during the winter is an example--we expect that there will be substitution away from this good.

Thus the seasonality in the true price index

should be less than in the measured fixed-weight index.

In the data here,

the seasonality in ex post real rates comes predominantly from the price
index.

Hence, the seasonality of the measured ex post real rate constructed

using the fixed-weight index will be overstated.

27Fama (1976b) has suggested that the variability of inflation forecast errors (as me,;.asured by the variability of the ex post real rate), as
well as the variability of expected inflation (as measured by the variability
of the change in nominal t-bill rates), might affect risk premiums and hence
real rates.

Experiments with variables similar to Fama's (1976b) did indicate

that the variability of these

However when lagged inflation was also

included in these regressions, the coefficients of these variables no longer
remained significant.
Fama and Gibbons (1980) suggest that expectations of higher returns
on investments and hence the investment-capital ratio will be positively
correlated with real rates.

As Table 3 indicates, experiments with the

investment-capital ratio did not yield significant correlations.

The failure

of this variable could have resulted because it is too loosely correlated
with expectations of investment opportunities.

One crude variable that

might reflect these expectations would be the real value of the Standard
and Poor's index of stock prices which measures one component of the valuation
of firms.

Results with this variable were somewhat, but not strongly,

encouraging.

Overall then, the evidence with

that increased money growth is non-neutral because

it lowers the real rate by raising inflation.

33This ARIMA model was identified with the Box-Jenkins (1970) procedure and was subjected to the usual diagnostic checks and found to be

Pearce (1979) also specifies inflation as an ARlMA (0,1,1) but

does not need to specify any seasonal terms since he worked with seasonally

Thus this comparison becomes

For example, in model 5.1, a Goldfeld-Quandt test which excluded

seventeen observations yielded the F(32,32) statistic of 1.21 while the
critical F at 5% is approximately 1.8.

A Glesjer test where the absolute

value of the residuals in 5.1 was regressed against a time trend variable
yielded a t-statistic on the trend variable of -1.66.

A similar test when

the absolute value of the residuals was regressed on lagged inflation
yielded a t-statistic on the lagged inflation coefficient of -.58.
36A comparison of the standard error of 2.1 and 5.1 indicates that
the variance of the error term is over fourteen times higher in the pre-1953
than in the 1953-79 sample period.

This is a very significant rejection of

the null hypothesis that there is homoscedasticity:
the critical F at 1% approximately equal to 1.7.

The Chow test mentioned

above used weighted least squares in estimation where the data for the
1931-52 observations were weighted by the standard error of 5.1 and the
1953-79 observations by the standard error of 2.1.

37In the 5.2 model three additional trend variables raised to the
third, fourth 'and fifth power did add significant explanatory power:
F(3,79)

=

3.03 with the critical F at 5% equal to 2.7.

However, in the

5.3 model these variables did not add significant explanatory power:
F(3,78)

= 1.74

with the critical F at 5% equal to 2.7.

In any case, the

same conclusions were reached using either the second-order or the fifthorder polynomial in the above analysis.
38

For example, Meltzer (1976) and Mayer (1979).

39For examp1e,'Wright (1969), Darby (1975)

~nd Tanzi (1980).

Note

that Levi and Makin (1978) also use this tax rate on interest payments for
illustrative purposes.
40ance lagged inf1~tion, which is highly correlated with the lagged
nominal interest rate, is included as an explanatory variable in a real
rate regression, the results for additional explanatory variables are
expected to be very similar, regardless of whether the real rate is adjusted
or unadjusted for taxes.

To see this, just realize that if the lagged

nominal interest rate were an explanatory variable, then a regression with
the after-tax real rate as the dependent variable is just a linear transformation of the regression with the unadjusted real rate as the dependent
variable.

In this case the results on additional explanatory variables

would be identical in either regression.

They should therefore be quite

similar if the lagged nominal interest rate is replaced by the lagged
inflation rate.

This same point explains why the estimates of expected

inflation from the after-tax versus unadjusted real rate models 2.3 and 7.3
should also be so similar.
