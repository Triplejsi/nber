Explanations of Exchange-Rate Volatility and other Empirical
Regularities in some Popular Models of
the Foreign Exchange Market

ABSTRACT

This paper is intended to accomplish two tasks.

First, exchange-rate

models of the sticky-price and flexible-price varieties respectively are
checked for their consistency with two key empirical regularities:

(1)

observed pattern of price-level vs. exchange-rate volatility, and (2)

the
the

observed pattern of spot exchange-rate vs. forward exchange-rate volatility.
Second, a widely neglected reason for exchange-rate volatility, activist
monetary policy is studied.
It is found that both sticky-price and flexible price models explain

the empirical regularities rather well.

Further, if prices are sticky it

is found that exchange-rate overshooting may be empirically non-trivial.

Introduction

The wi.desprea.d floating of exchange r'ates since 1973 has provided
the first ·.vorld-vlide data for studying flexible-rate regimes in the postWJII era.

The larg.e volatility of exch.:::.nge. rates seen in these data

created a natural scientific demand {or .:In exchange-rate theory consistent
with the ne"l evidence.

The beginnings of such a t.heory, which became

known as the Asset Market Approach to Exchange Rates, emerged in 1976 in
the \·wrk of Dornbusch (1976),
(1976~.

Frenkel

(1.976)~,

Kouri (1976), and Mussa

In particular, these authors offered explanations for why

exchange rates may be expected to be more volatile than current underlying
exchange-marke t fundamentals):/
Dornbusch (1976): suggested that goods markets adjust slowly while
asset markets (to a first approximation) adjust immediately.

Since exchange

rates are asset prices they adjust quickly compared with goods prices.
With both goods prices and exchange rates entering asset markets, exchange
rates must bear a larger immediate burden of asset market adjustment,
following a disturbance, than will be required once goods prices have begun
to adjust.

This was the celebrated overshooting result which has subsequently

been refined by Frankel (1979)1
(1977)~'.

Rogoff (1979)

Frenkel and Rodriguez (1980»)

Mussa

and Wilson (1979).'

The explanation offered by Frem:el (1976) , andMussa (1976a) was
that since current exchange rates reflect agent~ beliefs not simply about
current market fundamentals but also about the entire future of such
fundamentals, a disturbance to current fundamentals may be magnified in
its exchange-rate impact because of the disturbance's effect on beliefs

-2-

about future fundamentals.

This explanation was

effect and has been studied by Bilson (1978),

call~d

(1979)

the magnification
and Meese and

Singleton (1980a).
The explanation offered by Kouri (1976)

was that a disturbance to

current fundamentals may be magnified through its. affect on the current and
expected future distribution of world wealth.

This explanation has been

studied in linear models with rational expectations by Boyer and Hodrick
(1980) and Flood (1979b).
It is useful to think of the Kouri view as one which endogenizes
explicitly one of the elements of market fundamentals of the Frenkel-Mussa
model.

This is an interpretation pursued in the appendix.

Because of

the relative analytical difficulty of Kouri's model, magnification effects
are discussed here only for the Frenkel-Mussa model.
The present paper is intended to accomplish two tasks.

First, models

predicting overshooting and magnification respectively will be checked

fo~

their consistency with two key empirical regularities:
(1)

the observed pattern of price-level vs. exchange-rate volatility,

(ii)

the observed pattern of spot exchange-rate vs. forward exchangerate volatility.

Second, a widely neglected reason for exchange-rate volatility, activist
monetary policy, will be studied.

-3Accomplishing the first task requires that we note that two important
differences between the Dornbusch and the Frenkel-Mussa models are that
Dornbusch's has sticky goods prices while Frenkel's and Mussa's have freely
flexible prices, .and Dornbusch distinguishes between domestic goods and
other goods while Frenkel and Mussa deal only with a single aggregate
commodity.

In order to confront the pattern of exchange rates and price

levels the Frenkel-Mussa model is expanded presently to distinguish
domestic and other goods.

In the context of this expanded model it is

found that both the Dornbusch and the Frenkel-Bussa models are consistent
with observed data when the domestic share of the domestic good in consumption is greater than the foreign share of the domestic good in their
consumption, and both models are inconsistent \dth the data when the above
condition on consumption shares does not hold.
The second empirical regularity, which is that the spot exchange rate
and forward exchange rates (of all maturities) tend to move closely together
. and thus have about the same degree of volatility is a striking fact which
'.'

':"'.'

,~_.

is uot necessarily implied by either version of the mode2..~ :;£~:.iY.J... the

differences in spot and 90 day forward rate volatility are explored for
five industrial countries and the results are interpreted in terms of
both the Dornbusch and Frenkel-Mussa versions of the model.

In addition

I examine the pattern of spot and forward rate vol~tility for the U.S.Canada rates for a forward maturity of 360 days.
The results here are suggestive of a methodology which may be useful in
measuring the importance of exchange-rate overshooting.
The paper's second task is to argue that activist monetary policy
contributes to exchange-rate volatility.

In an example it is shown that

if monetary policy is actually attempting to stabilize interest rates
and if a monetary innovation is treated as uncorrexated with other
disturbances in the economy then by ignoring the covariance of monetary
innovations wit:.l other disturbances, exchange-rate volatility will be
consistently under-predicted.

-4-

TIle organization of the paper is as follows." In section II the two
versions of the model are presented and solved.

In section III both versions

of the model are called on to explain the observed pattern of prices and
exchange rates.

In section IV both versions are challenged to explain

simultaneously spot-rate volatility in excess of volatility in fundamentals
and forward-rate volatility which is approximately the same as spot-rate
volatility.

Section V contains the argument that activist monetary policy

exacerbates exchange-rate volatility.

Two Versions of a Two Commodity Exchange-Rate Model

large oRly in the markets for its own money and its own output.

Exchange Rates and Prices

Recent empirical work has found that exchange rates and national
price levels (consumer prices or wholesale prices) do not follow closely
~e

predictions of purchasing power parity.

The relationship of prices and

exchange rates was studied by at the macro-level by Frenkel (1980a), (1980b)
and Krugman (1978) , and was examined at a more micro-level by K4avis and
Lipsey (1978).

These studies suggest

of products, different countries' outputs

.hould be treated as different products.

This regularity has been

embedded in the two versions of the model at hand" by differentiating domestic
and foreign goods.
Another regularity concerning prices and exchange rates is that
exchange rates are more volatile than relative national price levels
(C.P.I. or W.P.I.).

This point was made by Stockman (1980),

Frenkel (1980a)

and Frenkel and Mussa (1980)>> and is docuncntcd f~r the current definition

Equation (30) states that the volatility of any expected future spot rate

To the extent that forward rates are equal to expected future spot
rates, equation (24) matches closely the regularity noted by Mussa (1979,
page 14) that flFor all maturities of forward contracts, the day-to-day (or

model at hand is special in that with purely anticipatory pricing,

the goods market is currently expected to be in equilibrium next period
and to remain in equilibrium indefinitely.

Thus, the economy is expected

to attain its long-run or benchmark path after a single period's adjustment.
This differs from sticky-price models with adjustments to lagged disequilibrium
because in such

model~

the economy approaches the long-run path assymtotically.

However, if the present model exhibited typical price adjustment to past
disequilibrium then it would converge

to the same path achieved in one

period by the present sticky-price version.
Consider the nature of the difference in response patterns of current
and expected future spot rates for purely anticipatory pricing vs. lagged
disequilibrium pricing when the disturbance is believed to be a once-andfor all increase in the money supply (p
fi~st

= 1). With Pt predetermined, the

period money-market response is the same for both pricing rules--the

forward premium adjusts to clear the money market.

Thus, the exact same

wedge must be driven between the current and the one period expected future
spot rate irrespective of the pricing rule.

However, with purely anticipatory

pricing the induced change in the forward premium is the exact measure of
overshooting as complete adjustment is expected to be made in one period.
With pricing in response to lagged disequilibrium,

pri~e i~

B£! expected

to adjust fully by next period and thus real balances are expected to be
higher next period with lagged adjustment pricing than with purely
anticipatory pricing.

These additional real money balances require higher

money demand, which is accomplished by a second period rational forward

-21-

discount on foreign currency (i.e. tEst+2 < tES~l).

Since this discount

is rational, the spot rate must be expected to continue falling during
tile second period.

Indeed; the argument maybe extended to show that the

spot rate must be expected to continue falling in all future periods until
goods market equilibrium is attained.
The first period premium (tEst+l - St) is the sante for both rules
and both rules have the same long run, but the lagged disequilibrium rule
requires anticipated adjustments in st+j for j >'1.

Hence the lagged

disequilibrium rule must provide a larger immediate exchange-rate response
than the purely anticipatory rule.

l~is

larger response is entirely in

terms of greater overshooting.
Since the long-run response is the same for both pricing rules
but the immediate response is larger for lagged disequilibrium pricing
than for purely anticipatory pricing, it follows that (for the disturbance
considered) for maturities greater than some length the difference in spot
and forward-rate volatility must be greater under lagged disequilibrium
pricing than under purely anticipatory pricing.
This result is exactly correct for p
- 1 S pSI.

When

I pi> 1,

=1

and it will hold up for

then, irrespective of the pricing rule, for

maturities of forward contract greater than some length forward rates
would be predicted to be more volatile than spot rates.
The example presented here gave current money market .disturbances a
central role.

It may be though that money market disturbances do not enter

the money market currently and/or that disturbances to other markets are
important for exchange rate determination.

First suppose that new information.

-22-

involves future values of money market fundamentals rather than current
values.

If such in.formation is the s.ource of money market disturbances

then equation (la') indicates that since innovations in future market
fundamentals do not enter (la') through

~t

or Pt then the innovations

must have exactly equal effects on St and tEst+l as would be true with
St following a random walk.

Second, suppose that disturbances to goods

markets are an important source of exchange-rate volatility.

(This would

2 2
be true presently if YlS(JuoJf were large relative to other components of
equation (32).)

If these goods market disturbances are

uncor~elated

with

money market disturbances then St and tEst+l must be affected equally by
such disturbances as would be true if St followed a random-walk.
These last examples are not intended to suggest that exchange rates
actually must follow a random walk in response to the discussed disturbances.
They are only intended to point out that substantial co-mqvement of B and
t
tEst+l is not ruled out by the sticky-price version.
The Flexible-Price Version
To begin studying the flexible-price version it is useful to rewrite
(14) as

since

~t

To the extent that

~

a disturbance in ~t results in an unexpected increase in (tES~~l - St) then
the disturbance's effect on St will be ~a~nified in its effect on St.
this is precisely the magnification effect of Frenkel (1976)

Indeed,

and Mussa (1976) ••

For a magnification effect to take place though, tEst+lmust be more volatile
than St.

This point is illustrated in the following example.

For the flexible-price version, use equation (17) to calculate.
(35)
j

= 1,

2, 3, ... (36)

By inspecting the values of Al2 and All listed in Table I we find
that the expressions in (35) and (36) are exactly the same only when g = 1.
If - 1 < p < 1 then (36) must be less than (35) for all j and if

I pi> 1

then (36) must be greater than (35) for all j.
The case ofl~1 > 1 is relevant as this is required for the magnification
effect to be present.

In this model, the magnification effect holds for

monetary disturbances when A1

2

> 1.

The magnification effect is the flexible

price counterpart to overshooting in that it too explains spot-rate volatility
. in excess of volatility in curr.ent market fundamentals.
Some Illustrative Calculations
The point of the present discussion is to relate the above formal
models to the data.

To establish such a relation (without estimating the

model) assumptions need to be made about some of the model's parameters.

-24-

In particular values of

and p will be sufficient to gain some

preliminary insights about the importance of magnification and

effects.

Monetary Policy and Exchange-Rate Volatility

The modeling of previous sections presumed money to be exogenously
generated by the simple autoregressive scheme of equation (10).
sumption is naive.

This pre-

In fact, monetary policy is dominated largely by policy-

makers' desires to control variables other than the money supply.

Such

policy is said to be activist policy, which is formalized presently by a
linear money supply rule linking money supply movements to movements in ~noth2r
variable

in the model.

In this section activist monetary policy will

replace the simple autoregression of previous sections.
The point to be made in this section is that if monetary policy is
activist, in a realistic way, and if observers try to interpret exchange-rate
volatility conditional on non-activist policy (e.g. the autoregression of
past sections) then there is a natural tendency for observers to underpredict
the extent of exchange-rate

volati~ity:

Such an underprediction, of course,

gives the appearance of exchange-rate volatility in excess of volatility
in market fundamentals.
Because the point to be made here is a point about monetary policy
and not about the market for home goods a special case of the flexible-price
version of the model will be adopted.

rate disturbance.

If (44) now governs the money

-30supply then the interest rate disturbance brings_abonc a monetary innovation
which alters excess demand for rooney in the same direction as the interest
rate disturbance alters the excess demand.

This exces's demand is balanced

and partially offset by overshooting which induces a change in the forward
premium.

The extent of overshooting however is exacerbated by the covariation

of monetary and foreign interest rate innovations.
Second, suppose that money growth responds negatively to output
innovations.

If so, then an output innovation will raise money demand and

reduce money supply requiring a larger exchange rate innovation to clear
the money market than would be needed if monetary growth were exogenous
to output disturbances.

Third, in the above it has been assumed that money

growth responds only to innovations in endogenous variables.

Since the

levels of those endogenous variables must contain their innovations the
argument would not be much altered if (44) were to depend on the level of
it relative to a target.

VI.

Some Policy Inplications

The present analysis illustrates two well known policy implications
of the asset market approach to the foreign exchange market (see e.g.
Frenkel and Mussa (1980».

First, nonstationary growth of money (relative

to income) produces magnification of the exchange-rate effects 6f monetary
disturbances and thus produces high volatility of exchange rates relative
to the volatility of monetary disturbances.

Thus; policy makers desiring

to reduce exchange-rate volatility .might well look toward stabilizing
the money supply process.

-31--

Second, exchange rates are only a portion of the set of macrovariables which concern policy makers, who opero.te using a limited set
of tools.

Concentration of policy on stabi.lizing variables other than

exchange rates can render exchange rates more volatile than they otherwise
would have been.

Thus, policy making with many "targets" but limited

"tools" requires coherent policy not a piece meal of "exchange rate
policy" and (for example) "interest rate policy."

(iii) At the outset of the Asset Harket Approach to exchange rates Mussa
(1976) pointed out the sufficiency of

~reating

the money supply as

"an arbitrarily prescribed stochastic process, a stochastic black

box'~/

when modeling agents' beliefs about the rate of change of the

exchange rate.

While this point is correct for the first

moment of the exchange-rate distribution, it is not correct for
understanding higher moments of exchange-rate distributions, ego
volatility.

The precise stochastic structure of the money supply

process can be ever:y bit as important as the structure of money
demand for understandir.g the volatility of exchange rates.
(iv)

The explanations of exchange-rate volatility studied here naturally
compete for professional priority but they are in no way mutually
exclusive.

Hence, it would be unsurprising to find all present,

in some measure, in a satisfactory explanation of exchange-rate
volatility.

FOOTNOTES

Definitions of many terms used in the introduction (eg. volatility)

are contained in later sections.

Equation (1) may be written as

The assumption a

influence of (Pt - qt) is proportional to (a

The

- 1) times the share of

foreign goods in domestic consumption, which is the product of two small

«

An equivalent simplification, followed by Dornbusch (1976),

is to deflate nominal money and nominal income by p

This empirical work is exemplified by Bilson (1980), Frenkel (1977),

Garber (1978), Hakkio (1980), Hansen and Hodrick (1979), and Meese and
Singleton (1980b).

Wyplosz (1980) has modeled a time-varying risk premiums in a maximizing

model of an open economy.

Instead of assuming domestic output to be constant it may be assumed

that output depends positively on relative price (see Flood and Marion (1980)
Appendix 5) in \vhich case 8 , in (6) , would be interpreted as an

demand elasticity.

Mussa's rule is Pt = t-1 EP t' T,1hich is the

rule used in the present sticky-price version.

Our pricing rule would

also result if output adjustment costs were zero in McCallum's (l980)

Flood (l979a) and Flood and Marion (1980a) have been critical of the

methodology of ignoring correlations among foreign variables.

P~~sently

though, accounting for such correlations adds much complication without

•

much illumination and thus they are ignored.

!/

Normally sticky-price models include at least one past price

the set of state variables.

The assumption of purely

a.mQn.~

anticipato~y

pricing is attractive analytically because past price is irrelevant to
the current pricing decision.

A conditional variance is used as the present measure of volatility

tO'accommodate a later discussion of a nonstationary money supply's
effect on the exchange rate.

Nonstationary money causes a nonstationa~y

exchange rate and the unconditional variance does not exist for a
series.

non~t3tiona~y

Previous discussions involving exchange rate volatility (e.g ••

-44-

Bilson (1978), Mussa (1976 ), Dornbusch (1976)) have assumed nonstationary
money supply processes and thus if exchange rate variances were calculated
they would have had to be conditional variances.
10/

Since the C.P.I. is an average of prices sampled during the month

and the exchange rate is sampled at a point in time there is a natural
tendency for the exchange rate to be more volatile than a C.P.I. ratio.
As a crude correction for this problem I recomputed the u.S. - Canada
entry in Table II using a monthly average spot rate instead of a point in
time spot rate.

The result was a volatility ratio of 8.5 rather than the

16.6 reported in Table II.

Since the relative volatility of 8 continued

to match the regularity reported, this approach was discarded as being
redundant.
11/

Similar results are reported by Stockman (1980).

12/

The analysis of this section is based on the empirical regularities

summarized in Table III.

It thus has a different basis than the variance

bounds work of Meese and Singleton (1980b) who derive upper bounds on
exchange rate variance using the error orthoganality property of optimal
forecasts.

In the discussion that follows,one month will be taken as

the relevant period.

Thus f + refers to a forward exchange rate quoted
t 3

at time t for execution 3 months hence.

Goldfeld found that the long run elasticity for' the interest rate

on time deposits was -.16 and that for the interest rate on commercial
paper was -.067.

Thus the combined interest elasticity is -.227

}i/ The present model assumes that money demand is semi-log linear, i.e.,
. the log of real money demand, rot - Pt' is linearly related to the level
of the interest rate, it.

Since it has a time dimension (e.g. 10 percent

per year) the semi-elasticity must also have a time dimension (e.g. years)
so that their product (alit) is units free.

Flood and Garber (1980 ) refer to this requirement as process

consistency.
