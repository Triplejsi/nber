Foreign Takeovers of Swedish Firms

ABSTRACT

The examination of foreign takeovers is a way of distinguishing between
the characteristics of firms and industries that encourage takeovers and the
effects of foreignness or of takeovers per se.

Foreigners have tended to take over Swedish firms that are of above

average size within each industry. Very few takeovers are of the smallest
groups of firms: those with fewer than 20 employees or even those with
fewer than 200. However, the firms taken over are not large compared to
Swedish companies of 200 employees or more. In fact, they are well below
average size within that group.

The firms taken over are more skill—oriented or technology—oriented

than Swedish—owned firms in the same industries. However, takeovers are
not particularly prevalent in industries in which firms in general are large

or skill—oriented or technology—oriented. Thus the selection of firms for
takeover is based on firm characteristics, not industry characteristics.

After takeover by foreigners, firms grow somewhat faster than Swedish—owned

firms in the same industries. The technological characteristics of the
firms, by the crude measurements we have been able to apply so far, do not
seem to be affected in any consistent way by takeover.

FOREIGN TAKEOVERS OF SWEDISH FIRMS
Robert E. Lipsey
Birgitta Swedenborg

Studies of direct investment often have two objectives: to explain the
motivating forces benind it and to judge its effects on host countries and

investing countries. Direct investment is generally explained as a way of
exploiting a firm-specific comparative advantage in a foreign market more
profitably than can be done by exporting the firm's products from the home
country or by selling the firm's technology or other knowledge to host—

country firms. The comparative advantage may be of several types. It may
be an industry characteristic, so that a high proportion of firms in a

particular industry will tend to invest abroad, no matter where the firms are

based. It may be associated with country of origin, so that American firms
in an industry invest abroad while British or German firms do not. It may
be peculiar to the individual firm and not associated with industry or

country of origin. It may, of course, be some combination of these.
A typical way of trying to identify the type of comparative advantage
that is involved has been to examine the characteristics of firms that invest
abroad, as compared with others in their home countries, or the characteristics of the firms in which they invest, as compared with others in the host

countries. It has often been difficult in these studies to separate the
factors encouraging foreign ownership from the effects of foreign ownership.

A possible way to distinguish these and to focus on the effects of foreign
ownership

is to single out for study the characteristics of firms

taken over by foreign purchasers and the changes in these characteristics

after takeover. We have taken a first step in this direction by examining
takeovers of Swedish firms through 1970 as part of a plan to analyze a larger
body of data on both Swedish and Canadian firms.

—2—
So far we have asked two types of questions about the Swedish firms

taken over by foreigners. One is how they compared with Swedish—owned firms
in the same industries at the time of takeover. That is, do foreign firms
pick off the smaller or less technologically oriented firms or the larger

or more technologically oriented ones? The second is whether firms taken
over by foreign owners change relative to Swedish—owned firms in their own

industries. The data on takeovers and on foreign—owned firms are from the
survey taken by the Industriens Utredningslnstitut of Stockholm for 1970

and analyzed in Samuelsson (1977). Data for all firms in Sweden are from
various issues of Industri and FBretagen, published by Statistiska
Centralbyr&n.

Selection of firms for foreign takeover

We begin to answer the first question, for a few firm characteristics,

in Table 1. We compare the 1965 characteristics of each Swedish firm taken
over in 1961—65 and the 1970 characteristics of each firm taken over in
1966—70 with those of Swedish—owned firms in the same 5—digit SNI industry

in 1965 and 1970. We must assume here that the firms did not change very
quickly after takeover and that their characteristics as much as four years
later still to some degree reflected their characteristics at the time of
takeover.

The Swedish enterprises taken over in both 1961—65 and 1966—70 were,

on the whole, considerably larger in 1965 and 1970 than the averages for
their 5—digit industries, as measured by sales value of output or by employ-

ment. The margin was particularly large in the food industry, a field in
which Sweden is not particularly strong. Even in machinery, which is an area
of Swedish comparative advantage, firms taken over were of above—average

size,

but the differences were smaller, as they were also for chemical firms

in 1965 and, by the employment measure, in 1970 also.

The other three measures in Table 1 are rough indicators of technical

or skill intensity. All of them show that the firms taken over had labor
forces that were more highly skilled than the average for their industries

and more technically oriented. Thus we find, at our first look, that the
foreign owners were absorbing relatively large and relatively skill—oriented
Swedish firms.
It

is conceivable that these differences in average skill intensity are

entirely associad with the greater average size of the firms taken over,

if size and skill intensity are

strongly and positively correlated. The

data permit a test of this point only for the average employee

compensation measure. For that one at least, as we

We can say, therefore, that the skill differences we observe between firms

taken over and their industries as a whole are probably not simply the conse—
quence of the larger average size of the takeovers.

—5—
The comparisons in Table 1 are all within 5—digit industries and give
no indication as to whether the foreign firms are also selecting industries

with large or technologically oriented Swedish firms. That question is
investigated in Table 2, in which we compare the characteristics of all Swedish
manufacturing firms, in the first column, with the characteristics that the
taken-over firms would have if in each industry they had the same characteris-

tics as Swedish firms in that industry. While the distribution of takeovers
was somewhat towards industries with larger firms than the average for all
manufacturing, the differences were far smaller than those within industries

described in Table 1. The indicators of technological orientation also
showed small differences but these were in the opposite direction from those

within industries: the foreign takeovers seemed to be more heavily weighted
towards industries of less than average technical orientation. However, the
strongest impression from Table 2 is that the industry bias in takeovers was
of little importance compared with selection within industries.

The

major difference we found within industries between foreign takeovers

and firms that remained Swedish—owned was that the takeovers were far larger

on the average. However, the fact that firms taken over were of above—average

size

for their industries does not necessarily mean that the typical takeover

the foreign takeovers are both from very skewed distributions of firm sizes.

Within that group we might expect again that takeovers were on the average

much larger than Swedish firms, if foreign buyers were concentrating on

large units. In fact, the average size was considerably smaller for the
takeovers,

as

can be seen below. Once we eliminate the very small firms

from our calculations we find that among firms

the average Swedish firm

of

759

200 employees or more

was about twice as large as the average firm taken

over by foreigners. That was true for manufacturing as a whole and also in
each of the three main industry groups with more than three takeovers. Thus
foreign buyers of Swedish firms were not taking over very small ones, but
they were not taking over particularly large ones either.

Effects of foreign takeovers
The first step we have taken to analyze the effect of foreIgn ownershIp

is to relate 1970 characteristics
the

length of time the firm had

of Swedish firms acquired by takeover to

been foreign—owned. The assumption that

underlies

this calculation is that the takeovers are drawn from the same

universe,

and that the purpose of a takeover is to change the Swedish firm:

for

example, to implant the technology of the foreign parent in the Swedish

subsidiary. If that is the case, we can interpret the coefficient of time
since takeover as representing the effect of foreign ownership in making the

parent or in enabling it to outdistance its

be

—9-.

In Table 4 we relate the period of foreign ownership to the attributes

described in Table 1. The only variable which seems to have some relation
to the period of foreign ownership is the average employment of the firm

relative to its industry, and that relationship is weak. The longer the
period since tak3over, the larger the foreign—owned firm relative to its
industry as measured by employment (but not significantly measures by sales

value of output). The relationship virtually disappears in the log equations,
which give greater weight to differences among recently taken—over firms,

as compared to the arithmetic equations which give greater importance to
the longer time periods.

A similar analysis is carried Out in Table 5 for foreign-owned Swedish
firms not acquired by takeover, presumably those newly established by the

foreign parents. A comparison of the coefficients, in the text table,

reflect

more the growth of newly established firms in their first few years

of existence. However, the positive coefficients in the arithmetic equations, and particularly those in which age is measured in decades, suggest
that there has been some long—run tendency for foreign—owned Swedish firms,
both takeovers and newly established firms, to grow more rapidly than
locally—owned firms.

Although we suspect that the interpretation of faster growth of foreign

firms is the correct one, there are other possibilities. One is that we
are observing a vintage effect: the firms taken over in earlier decades

were of a different type from those taken over recently. They may have been
larger than Swedish firms when they were taken over and remained so with no

change in relative standing. Another possibility is that the firms taken
over long before 1970 have the characteristics of old firms, while the
Swedish firms with which we are comparing them are a mixture of old and new

firms. It is a problem of trying to infer a temporal change from a cross—
section in this way that we could only eliminate if we had a sample of

aniong Swedish—owned firms as well as among the takeovers.

On the other hand, we see no evidence of
any increase In skill levels,

at least as measured by salaries and wages per employee or by the ratio of

salaried employees to total employees. For all manufacturing the ratios
declined slightly relative to the rest of their industries.

Since these

ratios were somewhat above industry levels at the time of takeover, the
changes Imply that the firms moved somewhat toward industry averages.
however, while that Is true also for machinery takeovers, the chemical firms
taken over seeni to have moved away from Industry averages toward higher

average skill levels.

By 1970, then, the firms taken over by foreigners had become even
larger relative to their industries than they were at the time of takeover.

Their skill levels, which had been above average for their industries, seem
to have drifted back a little for manufacturing

as a whole, although they

remained above the Swedish average. In machinery, by one measure, they
actually ended up below the averages for their industries.

One interpretation of these results is that the infusion of capital or
other resources from abroad enabled these firms to substantially Increase
their shares of Swedish employment and output.

However, we are not able so

far to compare these firms to Swedish companies that survived the whole
period, as these firms did, or to Swedish companies that were taken over by

other Swedish firms. The Influence of foreignness is therefore not conclusively established, and is a subject we hope to explore further.

— 17 —

Summary

We find that foreigners have tended to take over Swedish firms that

are of above average size within each industry. Very few takeovers are of

the smallest groups of firms: those with fewer than 20 employees or even
those with fewer than 200. However, the firms taken over are not large
compared to Swedish companies of 200 employees or more. In fact, they are
well below average size within that group.

The firms taken over are more skill—oriented or technology-oriented
than Swedish=owned firms in the same industries.

However, takeovers are not

particularly prevalent in industries in which firms in general are large or

skill—oriented or technology—oriented. Thus the selection of firms for
takeover is based on firm characteristics, not industry characteristics.

After takeover by foreigners, firms grow somewhat faster than Swedish—owned

firms in the same industries. The technological characteristics of the
firms, by the crude measurements rie have been able to apply so far, do not

seem to be affected in any consistent way by takeover.
