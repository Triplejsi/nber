The Relation Between Vocational Training
in High School and Economic Outcomes

ABS TRACT

This

paper examines estimated relationships between economic outcomes

and vocational training in high school. We find that these relationships
are

relatively robust with respect to variation in the way that type and

quality of vocational training is measured as well as with respect to a

number of other variations in specification. None of the evidence we have
developed supports a view that vocational training for male students in high
school produces any special skills that are valued by firms beyond those

that are produced by a general high school education. The evidence does
suggest that in the early 70's commercial—business programs taken by young

women did produce such valued skills. But the evidence pertaining to
later years is inconclusive.

This paper is concerned with analyzing empirically the labor market

effects of vocational programs inhigh schools. Such an analysis is of
interest because it is an important part of any evaluation of this major

program. It is also timely because the Vocational Education Act is to
be considered for renewal this year.

There have been a number of studies analyzing the labor market

effects of high school vocational training. Many of these studies use
data from a single labor market, but recently studies based on a national

data sample have appeared.' Notable among these are the studies by
Grasso and Shea (l979b) and Meyer and Wise (1979)

Despite the

availability of these studies, however, several important questions

remain unanswered. This paper will attempt to shed some light on two
of these questions.

First, there is the issue of the robustness of previous estimates.
Are these estimates sensitive to the way the high school program is
measured, to the sample used, to the group of control variables included
in the regressions, to the time period studied, to the particular

cohort or cohorts chosen, etc.? An awareness of the reliability of
estimates is important if empirical analyses are to be used responsibly
in evaluating vocational training in high schools.
1For surveys of this literature, see Stromsdorfer (1972) and Grasso
and Shea (l979a).

2Other such studies include Creech, et. al. (1977) and lolfi, et.
al. (1978).

2

The second issue concerns the relationship between vocational

training programs and the labor markets. If vocational programs are
large, the supply of vocational training graduates may reduce the
returns to vocational training in relation to those of non-vocational
graduates, even though the vocational education is producing useful

skills. Under such circumstances, simple comparisons between the
labor market experience of vocational program graduates and others may
provide misleading information not only as to the size, but: even as to

the existence of skills production in high school vocational programs.1
The problem with the simple comparisons is that they reflect not the
total

contribution of vocational training, but the contribution of a

marginal increment of the amount of that training.
These

issues will be addressed using data from two large national

longitudinal surveys —-

the National Longitudinal Survey conducted at

Ohio State University (the Parnes data) and the National Longitudinal

Survey of the High School Class of 1972. We will attempt to determine
whether findings gleaned from least squares multiple regression
analysis tell a consistent story about differences in outcomes for
those who terminate their education after high school, and if not,
why not.

More specifically, to determine the reliability of parameter
estimates, we estimate equations which are designed to answer the
following questions:

(1) Are similar results obtained when

the relation of market outcomes to high school program is estimated with
the Parnes data as when it is estimated with data from the Class of

'This is shown in Gustman and Steinmeier (1980).

3

1972 Survey? (2) Do the findings vary with the date of the survey, the
cohort analyzed, and the age at the time of the survey?

(3) How are

these findings affected by the inclusion or exclusion of several

variables (e.g., union membership or job tenure) which may not be
strictly exogenous with regard to labor market experience?

(4) Does

better measurement of vocational training (e.g., number of vocational
courses taken, detailed field of study, and type of high school
attended)

affect estimated parameters? (5) What is the effect of

standardizing for interarea differences in the wage level and in
youth unemployment rates?

In order to explore possible influences of
programs

on the

the size of vocational

measured returns to vocational education, we employ a

model in which the relative supplies of vocational and non—vocational

graduates influence the wage differential between them. The model we
use is described in detail in ourearlier paper. If vocational programs
do produce useful skills, this model contains implications for equations
explaining not only economic outcomes, but also enrollment rates in

the programs. These implications are tested by comparing the
predictions from the model with results obtained when reduced form
equations are estimated. We then conduct a further test by applying
a maximum likelihood estimating technique man effort to estimate the
structural supply and demand equations underlying the equations
explaining economic outcomes and enrollment patterns.

It should be noted that although we hope to shed some light on two
important issues regarding vocational education, the remaining gaps in

our knowledge about this subject are quite large. There has been very

4

little behavioral analysis and virtually no formal modeling of the role

of high school vocational training. We simply do not know how vocational
training in high school fits into a standard labor market model. One
possibility, noted in our previous paper, is that vocational training
substitutes for some type of general training that would otherwise be

provided by employers on the job and paid for by a reduction in
wages. Alternatively, vocational training may reduce the cost of
specific training on the job. We know so little about the skills
produced by high school vocational training that we cannot tell whether
the range of skills effectively augmented by the high school program is
very narrow in scope, proving useful in only a limited number of
occupations, or whether it is quite broad, improving productivity and/

or reducing training costs in a wide variety of later jobs.1 It is
possible that learning of vocational skills takes place at the expense

of learning basic skills. Thus a vocational program student may have
augmented productivity in some areas, but diminished productivity in

others

Perhaps high school vocational training provides information

about the job market that otherwise could only be gained through the
kind

of search and trial and error process that many think is

responsible formuchof youth unemployment. If this is so, one might
find that vocational program graduates make better risks for firm

investments

in specific training and that for this reason they might

exhibit both lower turnover rates and age—earnings profiles that differ

related discussion is contained in Grubb (1979).

5

from those of general program graduates) We are still a long way from
understanding fully the way in which vocational training affects labor
market outcomes, if it does at all, and for this reason some amount of
caution should still be exercised in interpreting the results of
estimates of differentials between vocational and non-vocational graduates.

I.

Robustness with Respect to Year, Cohort and Survey
The evidence gleaned from the Parnes data by Grasso and Shea (l979b)

suggests that women graduates of commercial (business and office) programs
in the high school have higher earninqs and a more favorable employment
experience than women graduates of other programs with comparable years

of schooling. However, those who attended vocational programs that are
not commercial have earnings that are no different from those of women

graduates of other educational proqrams. In the case of men, there
appears to be no discernible difference in earnings between male

qraduates of vocational and of other nroqrams. Using data for males
from the High School Class of 1972 Survey, Meyer and Wise (1979) have
found no evidence of an association between the student having taken
any job training in hiqh school, and later earnings.2

1For an analysis of the relation of job search to firm specific
training and labor turnover, see Leighton and Mincer (1979).
2tising data for October 1972, Nolfi et. al. (p. 83) found positive
but insignificant differences in earnings between females who enrolled
in vocational, as opposed to general or academic programs in high school.
For males, earnings of vocational program graduates were lower than
earnings of academic or general program graduates, but again the
difference was not statistically significant. These regressions standardized for background, ability scores, nd other characteristics.
Observations for blacks and whites were pooled and a dummy iariable for
race was included, constraining the coefficients on the indicators of
high school program to be the same for both race groups.

6

To

chngs

gain some insight about the robustness of these results to
in th year, the rohort. and the survey data employed, we

analyzed data for two different groups of individuals, both of whom were about
the same age at the time the data were collected. One group was the
Parnes cohort that was 17 years old at the time of the initial Parnes

survey. At the time of the 1972 survey, from which our data are taken,
this group would have been 21 years old. This year was chosen because
it was the year used by Grasso and Shea in deriving their results.

The other group came from the High School Class of 1972 Survey. Data
from this group was taken from 1976, four years after qraduation. For
both groups, we include only individuals who did not attain any formal
education behond high school. and who were not enrolled durinq the
year of the survey.1 The differences between the two groups which

are of interest to us are that they are in different cohorts, that
the information refers to two different calendar years, and that they
are interviewed in two different surveys.
Table 1 presents means of usual weekly earnings and weeks employed
last year according to the type of high school nrocram completed, sex,
and race for each of the two groups.2 The fiqures in parentheses

'We also eliminated from the sample all those who did not work in
the week preceding the survey, either because they chose not to participate in the labor force, or because they could not find a lob, and those
who did not report a value for usual weekly earnings or reported a zero
value. The resultinq possibility of self-selection bias is discussed
at the end of this section.
2Figures on weeks worked are not strictly comparable between the
samples of women and men in the Parnes survey or between the two surveys.
In the Class of 1972 Survey, weeks worked refers to the previous calendar
year. while in the Parnes survey this variable refers to the time since
the last survey, which may have been takei sliqhtly more or less than
an exact calendar year after the previous survey.

Table 2 presents analogous regression coefficients for the various

classifications. In these regressions, dummy variables were entered
for the various possible high school programs, and additional variables
were entered to standardize for the effects of parent's socioeconomic

status, achievement on a test score? and residence in an SMSA. In
these regressions, the dummy variable for a general high school program
is omitted, so the coefficients in Table 2 measure diffeiences relative

to general program graduates in the same sex-race classification. A
quick inspection of Tables 1 and 2 reveals that the estimated coefficients
in the regression equations of Table 2 reflect fairly closely differences
in the sample means of Table 1.

For men, the two surveys appear to tell much the same story. The
data in Table 1 indicate that for this group, vocational programs other
than business and commercial are more common than business and commercial

programs. White male graduates of vocational programs other than
business and commercial have earnings estimated in Table 2 to be around
$20 per week greater than comparable graduates of general programs,

although the difference is riot statistically significant. For black
males, the figure for graduates of programs other than commercial and
business is about $20 less than the figure for general graduates, while
business and commercial graduates of both races have a small positive

earnings advantage over general program graduates. None of these
differences are statistically significant either.

Much the same can

be said of the effect of vocational programs on work experience, as

measured by weeks employed in the previou5 year. Vocational programs

of both types influence weeks worked in a generally positive direction,
hut again none of the differences emerge as statistically significant.

Among females, the effects of vocational programs is fairly uniform
between whites and blacks, but there are sharp differences in the results

of the two surveys. For the Parnes group, vocational programs have a
general positive impact on both usual weekly earnings and for weeks

employed. The effect of business and commercial programs (the most
common

vocational

programs among women) on usual weekly earnings is

statistically significant for white females. The result matches the
findings of Grasso and Shea, who did much the same regression except
that they included several cohorts in their analysis and added an

experience variable which presumably captured the age—wage profile)
Using data from the Class of 1972, the results for women are almost

exactly reversed. For this group, vocational programs seem to depress
both usual weekly earnings and weeks employed for both white and black
women, though the only place where this effect is statistically
significant is for weeks employed by black female graduates of business

and commercial programs. The differences between the results using
the Parnes data and the Class of 1972 data cannot be attributed to

small sample sizes. For the Parnes data, business and office training
improved weekly earnings by $23, a figure which is not only statistically
significant but also represents over 25 percent of the average weekly

earnings for the sample. The Class of 1972 data failed to confirm this
result in spite of the fact that the sample size was almost six times
as large.
1

The above regression used only a single cohorc because we wanted to
have comparable regressions for the Parnes group and the Class of 1972
group, and only a single cohort is available for the latter group.

11

The discrepancy between the results for the Parnes 21—year-old
group in 1972 and the Class of 1972 group in 1976 may arise from one

of two sources. Either there was something which changed between 1972
and 1976 which caused the returns to business and commercial training
to drop between the two years, or there was something about the way in
which the two surveys were conducted which contributed to this result.
To gain some insight into which of these explanations is correct, we
tried two approaches.

One approach was to take a group from the Parnes data who were 21

years old in 1976. For a couple of reasons, this could be done only
approximately. First, the Parnes study conducted surveys in 1975 and
1977, but not in 1976. The 1975 survey was used because by 1977 the
youngest cohort in the Parnes study was 23 years old. Even in the 1975
survey, there was but one 21 year old working graduate of a commercial

and business program in the sample. To include a reasonable number of
these graduates in the regressions, the sample was extended to include
women who were either 21 or 22 years old in 1975.

The results of these regressions are reported in Table 3l By
comparing the two lines of Table 3 with the third and fourth lines of
Table 1, it is seen that the significant positive coefficient in 1972
for the effect of business and commercial programs on the weekly
earnings of white females appears to have largely vanished by 1975.
The positive, significant, estimated effect of other vocational programs
for the sample of white females reflects the earnings of the single

'An additional variable reflecting years of work experience was
added to these regressions, as was done by Grasso and Shea in their
regressions which included more than a single coiiort.

white female who enrolled in a vocational program other than office and

business. Since there is no evidence in any of the other sample of
strong, positive returns for women to vocational training outside of
the business and office program, this result should be treated with
due skepticism.

Another approach was to estimate regressions using the full data
set in the Parnes study, and to introduce dummy variables to allow for

differences in survey years and age groups. The Parnes data set includes
eight survey years from 1968 to 1977, and it uses eleven age cohorts

who were 23 to 33 years old by 1977. In these regressions, we separated
the constant into roughly 80 dummy variables for various combinations
of age and survey years for which we had observations on women who were

working high school graduates. The dummy variables for both types of
vocational education were similarly divided into separate variables for

the different age—survey year combinations. This allows the estimated
impact of both types of vocational education to vary from survey year
to survey year and among the various age groups.

Table 4 reports the estimated coefficients for the dummy variables
which represent business and commercial training in the weekly earnings

equation.1 The coefficient for 2l—year-olds in 1972 is $18.74 and is
significant. This is close to the results that we found in Table 2 for
regressions using this cohort and survey year along. Similarly, the
coefficient for 22—year-olds in 1975 is slightly negative and insignificant, corresponding well to the results for that group shown in Table 3.

The aspect of Table 4 that we are most interested in is the change in

the impact of commercial and business training over time for

people in their early 20's. The only age bracket for which we have
results in all the survey years is the 24-year—old bracket, and for this
bracket there does appear to be some evidence for a decline in the
returns to business and commercial training between the 1971—1972 period

and the later surveys. If we consider the 22—24—year—old age bracket,

we can look at the average effect during the years up tol975. These
average effects which are simply the mean of the three coefficient
estimates for these ages, are computed and shown in the bottom row of

Table 4. Again, the figures suggest that the returns to commercial
and business training declined between the early 1970's and later years,
although the evidence on the time trend of these returns cannot be

regarded as conclusive. In any case, one thing does seem clear: The
high coefficient found for 2l-year—olds in 1972 does not seem to be

typical of other ages and cohorts. Of the 74 coefficients reported in
Table 4, only three are numerically greater than the coefficient for
21—year—olds in 1972.

Why might the returns to business and commercial training have

declined for women between 1971—72 and 1975-76? The different time
periods are characterized by differences in the state of the overall

labor market. In 1972, the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent, while
in 1976 it was 7.7 percent. However, one cannot explain a decline in
the earnings differential between female vocational and female general
program graduates on the basis of cyclical variation of the skilled-

unskilled wage differential. The reason is that skill differentials

are more likely to narrow in tight labor markets as unskilled workers

ic

are upgraded into skilled jobs. On these grounds, one might have expected
smaller returns to vocational training in the tighter market of 1972,

not larger ones.'
Anotn.er possible explanation for the declining differential is

that basic supply conditions changed between the two periods. Specifically,
according to the survey of the class of 1972, and also according to data
from the latest relevant cohort obtainable from the Parnes survey
consisting of those who terminated their education after graduating from
high school in 1970-71, 36 percent of white females were graduating from

commercial—business programs.2 In contrast, for the Parnes sample of
graduates in 1968 who similarly terminated their education after high
school, only 21 percent of the white females were enrolled in business

and office programs.3 The additional supply of female business and
commercial graduates may have eroded their wage advantage, a proposition
which is discussed in more detail in Section III.

1For a general discussion of the phenomenon and an analysis of the
exception provided by the construction industry, see Gustman and Segal
(1974).

2One must be careful in comparing means for program enrollment
across surveys. The Program definitions in the Parnes survey are based
on the individual's response, while the class of 1972 data are based
on school records.

Corresponding figures for black females are 18 percent of the
1968 graduates and 36 percent of the 1970—71 graduates, but these
percentages are based on sample sizes so small as to make them of
questionable reliability.

Before closing this section, a few words are in order about our
reliance on ordinary least squares regression analysis, since the nature
of the problem might appear to present econometric difficulties

requiring more sophisticated techniques. One such difficulty is the
fact that there is self-selection into the groups of vocational and

non-vocational graduates we observe. This self-selection goes on at
two levels: First, the decision as to the kind of program in which to
enroll during high school, and then the decision about whether or not

to work after graduation. Self-selection bias occurs if people with
unobserved characteristics leading to greater wages tend to end up

preferentially in one group or the other. In a comparison between
vocational and general program graduates, however, it is not clear
a priori which direction this bias shouldtake,and attempts by Meyer
and Wise to detect this kind of problem did not yield any evidence that
it affected estimated wage equations (although it did seem to play a
role in equations explaining employment after graduation).
Another difficulty is that a model explaining the determination of
the employment experiences of vocational and non-vocational graduates
may not yield the kind of simple equations that are estimated with
ordinary least squares. More complicated specifications may, in general,

be estimated by maximum likelihood, but only at the cost of introducing

much more specific assumptions about the structure of the model. If
these assumptions are correct, parameter estimates may be improved, but
if they are not, the estimates may well deteriorate with the more

complicated technique. This is the case with the maximum likelihood
estimation of the model discussed in Section lIT of this parer, or with

1
any other attempts to estimate structural parameters underlying wage or
earnings equations.

A third difficulty pertains only to the weeks worked equation.
Weeks worked is bounded by zero from below and, more importantly, by

52 weeks from above. This suggests that this equation is more properly
estimated by the "Tobit" technique, which allows for truncated dependent

variables. Given the costs of implementing this technique, and the
lack of serious discrepancies between the stories told by usual weekly
earnings equations (which are not subject to this problem) and weeks
worked equations, we have not done so.

II. Other Aspects of Robustness
In this section we will investigate the sensitivity of coefficient
estimates to several modifications not considered in the last section.

Specifically, we will discuss the robustness of the estimates with
respect to the following changes:

(i) alternative measures of economic

outcomes, (ii) changes in the set of variables used to standardize the
regressions, (iii) inclusion of variables which are really intervening
variables in the effect of vocational training on labor market outcomes,
(iv) alternative measures of participation in vocational training

programs, and (v) inclusion of measures to standardize for interarea

differences in wage level and in unemployment rates. The general
conclusion of this section is that parameter estimates are fairly
robust with respect to these kinds of changes.

Alternative Measures of Economic Outcomes.
Two alternative measures of economic outcomes were considered in

addition to weekly earnings and weeks worked. These were the hourly wage

19

and yearly earnings from labor. Hourly wage equations analogous to the
equations presented in the last section were run for both the Parnes
groups and the Class of 1972 group, and yearly earnings equations were

run for the Parnes groups. Unfortunately, the Class of 1972 questionnaires did not contain a separate question specifically asking about

yearly earnings from labor; the closest question inquired about wages,
salaries, commissions, or net income from a business or farm" and was
in

some instances clearly contaminated by
With

cance

non—labor income.

two exceptions, the patterns of signs and levels of signifi-

of the coefficient estimates using these alternative dependent

variables closely matches the pattern with weekly earnings. One
difference is that for black females in the 1972 Parnes Survey, the

coefficient of business and commercial training in the hourly wage
equation is significant at the 90% level, whereas the analogous
coefficient in the weekly earnings equation in Table 2 was slightly

below significance, with a t—statistic of 1.60. The second difference
is that the anomolous results in Table 3 for white females in vocational
programs other than business and commercial (which we noted previously
was based on a single individual) does not carry over into the hourly

wage or yearly earnings equations. Both of these differences woui, if
anything, strengthen the general conclusion of the last section, namely,
that there was a significant impact of business and commercial training
on the labor market experience of women in 1972 that was weakened by
1975_76.I

'We note explicitly that tests of statistical significance are not
independent unless separate samples are used. e experiment here with
different specifications estimated with the same samples. Nevertheless,
if estimated coefficients or t—statistics fluctuate widely with reasonable
changes in specification, this should constitute a warning that the
estimated coefficients are of questionable reliability.

20

Modifications

of Standardizing Variables

We also experimented to see whether the results were sensitive to
changes in the variables used to standardize the regressions. These
changes included:

(i) the substitution of the "socioeconomic origins"

measure in the Parnes data set for the one used in Table 2, (ii) the
substitution of a measure of family income for the socioeconomic status
of the family for the Class of 1972 Survey, and (iii) the use of dummy
variables for measures of the individual's ability and far the socio-

economic status of the parents.1 None of these changes in specification
had any important effect on the reported coefficients and t—statistics
of the variables measuring participation in high school vocational
programs.

Inclusion

of Intervening Variables.

The set of explanatory variables included in the regression which
are

reported in Tables

youth's

2 and 3 is

designed to standardize only for the

ability, family background, and whether the youth lived in a

city. Thus, the estimated impact of vocational training includes all
differences in outcome variables which emerged over time, both those

operating through such intervening variables as job tenure and union-

ization, as well as those operating directly on the outcomes. We
estimated a variety of equations which included these intervening

variables, and in several of the equations we included additional

'Table 3 used a socioeconomic status variable constructed from the
educational levels of the father and the mother and the occupation of
the father, so that comparable variables could be constructed for both
data sets. The Parnes variable uses the two education levels, the
occupation of the father when the respondent was age 14, the education
of the oldest sibling if applicable, and an index of the availability of
reading materials at home when the individual was age 14.

21

standardizing variables as well. For example, one such set which was
estimated for women included as explanatory variables job tenure, a
measure of whether the job is full time, and a measure of collective

bargaining coverage. For men, additional explanatory variables include
past military service, southern residence, past on-the—job training,
and an indicator of collective bargaining coverage.

A comparison of the expanded regressions with those in Table 3
indicates that in most cases the impact of vocational training is not
very sensitive to the set of control variables included in the

regression equation.1 The exceptions were the regressions for black
women in the Parnes study, for which the small sample size (14 individuals) makes the results particularly sensitive to changes in
specification.

For this group, we find a significant (at the 10% level) impact
of business and office training, as do Grasso and Shea, when the

hourly wage is utilized as the dependent variable. With yearly earnings
as the dependent variable, results are very sensitive to the exact set
of independent variables used, with significant results being obtained
only with the set of independent variables (excluding years of experience)

utilized by Grasso and Shea. Additional regressions using all the cohorts in the Parnes study and including years of work experience,

providing 106 observations, continued to exhibit this sensitivity in

regressions for

yearly

earnings.2

regressions for a given sex—race group were estimated from a
constant sample so that differences between the regressions could not
arise from differential selection into the samples.
2That analogous findings are ensiti'je to soecification in Grasso
and Shea can be seen by comparing their Tables (continued on p. 22)

22

Alternative Measures of Participation in Vocational Programs.
In this part, we consider the effects of using detailed measures of
type, intensity and quality of vocational training to determine whether

findings are changed by better measurement. These measures are only
available for the Class of 1972 survey.

One refinement of the variable measuring vocational
education is to separate it into several variables representing the
detailed area of specialization within a vocational course of study.
These were estimated only for the samples of white males and females

and are reported in Table 5. For black males and females, there were
empty cells in a number of subfields. The areas of specialization
distinguished are agriculture, business, distributive education, health,
home economics and trade.

While there is some hint in the estimates of a positive earnings
difference for white males who took a program in trade, as compared
to general program graduates, and negative earnings differences for
white females who took a program in home economics, neither relation is

statistically significant. The only significant finding is that white
females included in the sample who enrolled in distributive courses
work an average of nine fewer weeks than included white females who
were in a general course of study.

A second refinement is to measure the intensity of vocational

training. One measure of intensity of vocational training is the number

2(Continued from page 21)
A4.20 and A4.21.
They find that a relation between business and
office training and yearly earnings which is significant at the 10%
level for black females becomes insignificant when 19 observations for
those who worked less than 39 weeks are eliminated from the ample.

of class periods spent in vocational courses, as indicated in the youth's
school record. We estimated the relation of weekly earnings and weeks
employed to the total number of class periods in all vocational courses
taken (i.e., the total of class meetings for each class summed across
the number of vocational classes for each demographic group), holding
constant, as in the regressions underlying Table 3, the youth's test
score, parent's socioeconomic status, and an indicator of residence in

an SMSA. The coefficient for the variable indicating number of periods
spent in vocational courses was significant in only one regression,
indicating that for white females, each additional vocational class
period taken was associated with an additional .046 weeks of employ—

ment. The t—statistjc was 2.52. Insignificant effects of number of
vocational courses takenwere also noted when alternative specifications

of this regression were estimated. In one set of regressions the
intensity variable was separated into two according to whether the

major high school program was vocational or commercial—business. In
other regressions, the intensity variable was further separated according
to narrow high school program (as in Table 5). No systematic relation
between the number of class periods spent in vocational courses and
economic outcomes was apparent in these regressions.
A final refinement investigates the possibility that type of high

school affects learning. Vocational training may occur in a high school
that specializes in vocational programs, offering up-to-date training
on modern equipment, or it may be simply one of the three tracks in a
comprehensive high school where the training may be of relatively low

quality. The Class of 1976 Survey provides no direct indicator of the

25

type of high school, so we employed two alternative measures. One
indicator of potential specialization by the school is the proportion

of students enrolled in vocational programs. Accordingly, we include
in some regressions an explanatory variable which takes on a value of
1 if more than half the students are enrolled in a vocational program.
In addition, Andrew Koistad of the Department of Education identified

a subset of schools included in the Class of 1972 Survey which specialize

in vocational training. These schools were also identified by a dummy
variable. The measures pertaining to type of school were added
separately to regressions reported in Table 3.

(Give the distribution

of responses, the Kolstad measure was added only to the regressions for

male youth). In no case were the coefficient estimates for these
indicators of type of high school significantly different from zero.
Measures for Interarea Differences in Labor Market Conditions.

The last test for robustness introduces measures for interarea
differences in the general wage level and in unemployment rates into the

regressions. This test could be done only for the Class of 1972 Survey
data, since the Parnes data does not identify specific SMSA's.

Using

the Class of 1972 data, we confined the sample to those in the largest
98 SMSA'g and (i) deflated the youth's wage by a fixed weight index of
the average earnings of 25 to 55—year-old high school graduates in the
same SMSA, and (ii) included as an explanatory variable a measure of
the unemployment rate for 20 to 24—year-old young people in the SMSA.1

'The unemployment rate is measured as the ratio of time unemployed

to time spent in the labor force in the previous year. Both the unemployment rate and the adult wage rate are fixed-weig;1t indices th national
weights based on sex, race, and for the adult wage rate, age. For a further
description, see Gustman and Steinmeier, forthcoming.

26

The data on area wage and youth unemployment were taken from

the

of Income and Education, which was conducted during the spring

Survey

and

summer of 1976.

With the earnings variables deflated by the local wage index, there
were no significant relations between the weekly wage and vocational
training programs in the set of regressions specified in Table 3 above.
Similarly, with one exception, no significant results were obtained
when the SMSA youth unemployment rate was included as an explanatory

variable in these regressions. The only exception is in a weeks
employed equation for white females. The coefficient, which is
significant at a ten percent level, suggests that white females who
enrolled in a commercial—business course

were employed four weeks per

year less than white female general program graduates in comparable
circumstances.

III. The Impact of the Capacity of Vocational Programs on Labor Markets
In this section we will consider how the size of the vocational
program in an area may affect the measured returns to the program. To
indicate the general nature of the argument, it will be helpful first
to discuss a simple model of wage determination in the markets for
vocational training graduates and for those without such training.

The model distinguishes two kinds of workers: those who have been
trained in a high school vocational program or who received equivalent
training on the job, and those who have not received such training.
For convenience, we will call workers of the first type hltrainedtP and

workers of the second type "untrained." The demand curves for the two
types of workers are shown in Figure 1 as DT and D. Note that in this

diagram the number of trained workers is measured from the left axis,

and the number of untrained workers from the right axis. For any point
along the horizontal axis, the sum of the two types of workers will add
up to a constant total number of workers.1
A central feature of this model is that if the worker undergoes on—

the-job training at a cost represented by d

,

he will receive the

skills necessary to be considered a trained worker.2 If the number of

spaces in the vocational program is below A individual, then in the
absence of on-the-jobtraining the wage differential between trained and

untrained workers will exceed d .

This

will induce enough workers to

undergo on—the—job training to increase the number of trained workers

to A , thus reducing the wage differential to d .

If the number of

spaces in vocational training programs is between A and B

,

then

it

will pay anyone who can to take the vocational training. There will be
a positive wage differential between trained and untrained workers, but
it will not be large enough to induce anyone to undergo on—the-job
training,1 Finally, if the number of spaces in vocational training

programs is B or greater, then it will pay B individuals to accept
places in the program. In this case, one would expect no differntial
between the wages of trained and untrained workers.
In this model, a failure to observe any wage differential between
graduates of vocational training programs and general programs may arise
1

The essense of the argument is not affected if the total number
of workers (high school graduates) is allowed to vary. A more complete
version of the model is discussed in Gustman and Steinmeier (1980).
the model, the one time costs of on—the-job training are
implicitly converted into an annual amount whose present value equals
the costs. This annual amount is represented by d

29

for one of two reasons. First, it may be that vocational programs are
producing no usable skills, so that the amount of on-the-job training
necessary to produce an equivalent level of skills is zero (d =

0).

The

other possible explanation is that enrollments in vocational programs are

effectively unlimited, so that enough students choose the programs to
equalize the wages between graduates of vocational programs and other
graduates.

Explanations based either on a decline in d over fime or an
increase in enrollments in vocational programs are consistent with the
evidence presented earlier for female graduates of business and commercial

programs. Recall that in 1972, such graduates had higher earnings than
did general program graduates, whereas by 1975-76 the evidence pointed
to a small positive or zero earnings differential within the Parnes
sample, or a zero differential within the Class of 1972 sample. During
the same time period female enrollment rates in vocational programs

were rising. Hence, the lack of a substantial positive earnings
differential in the later years may have occurred either because the
program's performance deteriorated over time or because the additional

supply of business and commercial graduates caused the earnings differen-

tial to narrow. Two different approaches were tried in an attempt to
discern which of these explanations is correct.
Evidence from Enrollment Equations.

Suppose that the demand for graduates of vocational programs is

higher in some areas than others. In the high—demand areas, the demand

curve DT for trained workers in Figure 1 will be shifted to the

right relative to the demand curve Du 'or untrained workers. This

30

will in turn shift the point of intersection between D
T

and D

U

to

the right. In areas where the enrollment In vocational programs is
not limited, this intersection gives the number of students who enroll

in the program. Hence, if the explanation of a lack of earnings
differential between vocational program graduates and general program
graduates is that the earnings have been equalized by adjustments
equating supply and demand of program graduates, then one would expect

to find a positive relation between the demand for vocational program
graduates in an area and the number of students enrolled in the program
in that area.

To test this proposition, we developed a measure of demand for

vocational program graduates. This measure uses the responses to the
longitudinal survey of the Class of 1972 to calculate the national
percentages of vocational program graduates in each occupation; these

percentages are then weighted for each of 100 SMSAs by the fraction

of the SSA's employment in each occupation. A regression was estimated
for this group in which the dependent variable was a dummy variable
taking on a value of 1 if the youth had enrolled in a vocational program

in high school and zero otherwise. Observations were confined to those
1

who terminated their education with a high school degree.

There was

'To be sure that the wage equation estimates discussed In the
preceding sections of this paper were not affected by the omission of
a measure of demand mix, we reestimated the equation for observations
falling in SMS's where a measure of demand for vocational graduates was
available and included the measure of demand, and both that measure and
an interaction term between vocational enrollment and the demand measure.
The results reported earlier, namely that there is no significant wage
difference between vocational and general program graduates, remain
unchanged.

31

no evidence of a significant positive relation between the demand mix
variable and the probability of enrolling in a vocational program.1
This evidence suggests rejecting the hypothesis that supply side
adjustments are responsible for the absence of a wage differential
between vocational and other program graduates. However, one should be
somewhat cautious about rejecting the hypothesis based on this

evidence alone. One reason is that the measure of demand may be of
too poor a quality to generate significant results. Another is that
the Class of 1972 sample was not taken to be representative of
enrollments in geographic areas, but to provide information on schools

in each area. Thus the measured enrollment probabilities may not provide
a reliable indication of actual enrollment probabilities in the given
market.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Model.

A second approach to investiage whether the returns to vocational
training are affected by supply adjustments involves the maximum likelihood estimation of the model presented in the first part of this section.
This is particularly important for women, for whom previously discussed
evidence suggests that the returns had diminished but not necessarily

disappeared by 1976. If there were positive returns in some cities,
then the supply adjustment would not be complete in those cities, and
there would be no fixed relationship between enrollments and demand for

vocational program graduates. In these circumstances, an enrollment

11n an equation for black females with 38 observations, the
coefficient of the mix variable in an enrollment equation was
significant and negative.

32

equation might fail to find significant results because it applies
strictly only to those cities for which the adjustment is complete.
To accormnodate the possibilIty that the

adjustment may be complete in

some cities but incomplete in others, the complete model was estimated
with maximum likelihood techniques.

Note that this model requires a

much more explicit specification of the underlying structural model than
do the previous estimates, and the results may be sensitive to the

accuracy of this specification. Since individual cities cannot be identified in the Parnes data set, the model

was estimated ohly with the

Class of 1972 data.

The empirical specification of the model begins with two demand
functions, one each for trained and untrained workers:

where W is the wage rate for trained workers, W the wage rate for

trained and untrained, in a labor market is given
N=

by

where N is the number of 20-24 year olds with exactly a

high school

education expressed as a percentage of the population 20—64 years old.
For a given set of values for the cOs, the 13's, and for a given

value of the gap d in Figure 1, the values of WT and W for a particular
labor market depend upon the percentage of young people in that market
who

have had vocational training. In terms of that figure, the avail-

ability of vocational training determines whether the number of trained
workers will be A, between A and B, or B. The percentage of high school

33

graduates with vocational training in each labor market (SMSA) was
taken from the October 1979 Educational Supplement to the Current

Population Survey.1 The base wages for trained and

alternative way to treat on—the-job training would have been to
omit the dpT dummy variables and instead to include anyone with past onthe—job training in the group of "trainedt' workers. This would have
precluded consideration of on—the—job training for vocational program
graduates, however, and it would also have assumed that the average amount
of on-the-job training actually received is equivalent to the training
received in a vocational program. The approach used in the paper
avoids these restrictive assumptions.

The parameter set over which this likelihood function is maximized includes the a's and the 13's in the demand functions, the p's describing
wage responses to on—the-job training and test scores, the three

variancescY2, 4, and O, and the gap d. The a's, 3's and d enter
the likelihood function indirectly through their effects on WT and W.
This likelihood function was maximized separately for white males

and white females in the Class of 1972 group. The unrestricted
maximum value was compared to the maximum value obtained under the
contraint d =

0, and for both groups the likelihood ratio test indicated

that this constraint is not significant. This means that there is
no evidence from the maximum likelihood estimation that the gap d is
significantly different from zero, although the point estimates were

in both cases positive. Given the rather crude nature of the model,
this result alone should probably be used with caution, but it does add
further support to the results found using least squares techniques.

IV. Conclusions
The Grasso and Shea analysis of the Parnes data found that in
1972, male vocational program graduates had no higher earnings than
general program graduates, but that female graduates of business and

office programs did enjoy higher earnings. Fitting analogous equations
to observations for 1975 and 1976 using both the Parnes data and the

Class of 1972 data, we obtained similar results for men. But we found
that business and commercial training for women seemed
to have much less of an effect in the mid-l970's than it did in 1972.
This result appears to be robust with respect to a number of changes

in the estimating equations. It does not vary when additional explanatory
variables are included, when attempts are made to refine the nasure of
participation in vocational programs, or when we standardize for inter—
area differences in the general wage level and in youth unemployment
rates.

For men, the lack of any measurable impact of vocational training

subsequent earnings may occur either because the programs are not

on

producing useful skills or because supply
the

adjustments have eliminated

earnings advantage for vocational program graduates. The latter

would occur if enrollments in vocational training were not limited, i.e.,
the program could accomodate all who applied, so that enrollments in
vocational

earnings

courses would continue to rise as long as there was any

differential. If earnings

differentials for men had been

eliminated in this manner, however, we would expect in cross—section

comparisons between labor markets to find that there are higher percentages of students enrolled in vocational programs in labor markets

in

which the demand for training is relatively high. Cross-section

31

regressions testing for a relation between vocational program enrollments
and a measure of demand for training by employers in 100 SMSA's did

not

find significant evidence of this relationship. Thus none of the

evidence we have developed for men supports a view that vocational

programs in high school produce special skills valued by firms beyond
the knowledge gained in a general high school program.
The measured impact of business and commercial training on the earnings
of female graduates in 1972 could be considered to be the result of
supply side limitations which kept earnings for vocational program

graduates higher than those of other program graduates. If this explanation is correct, then the

decline in the impact of business and

commercial training by the mid 1970's

of the

could

be attributed to a weakening

supply limitation.

One cannot test for the existence of supply limitations using crosssectional data by simply regressing enrollments in vocational programs
on measures of the local demand for training, as was done for men.
The reason is that if the supply adjustment is not complete, or is
complete for some labor markets but not for others, there is no reason
to expect a tight relationship between enrollments and demand for training.
In fact, the regressions we estimated to explain variation among areas

in enrollments by young women in commercial—business programs did not
find any relation between an index of demand and commercial—business

enrollments. The relationship between the earnings advantage of vocational
program graduates and chiracteristics of the local labor market as

described in our discussion, is more complex. This relationship may

be estimated by maximum likelihood technques, albeit at th cost of
increased risk of specification error. The results of the maximuni

38

likelihood estimation, however, do not provide further support for
supply side adjustments as an explanation of the reduced impact of

business and commercial training in cross—section. Thus, in the case
of commercial—business programs for women, there is evidence that
these programs at one time were productive of skills valued by

employers. We cannot be sure whether the skills produced in later
years continue to be so valued.
