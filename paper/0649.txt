Dividend Yields and Stock Returns:
A Test For Tax Effects

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the empirical relation between stock returns and

dividend yields. Several equilibrium pricing models incorporating differ
ential taxation of dividends and capital gains are nested as systems of

time series regressions. Estimates of these models and tests of parameter
restrictions implied by the models are conducted within the context of

Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression. It is concluded that the data
fail to support these models as well as the hypothesis that dividends are

neutral. The inability to distinguish between these competing hypotheses
suggests the need for further research before definitive conclusions are
reached regarding the tax impacts of dividends.

DIVIDEND YIELDS AND STOCK RETURNS:

A TEST FOR TAX EFFECTS
By

Patrick J. Hess
Introduction

Th ffect of dividends on stock returns is a major issue in finance, with a

rich historical bacr'und. It has been argued (see Graham and Dodd [19511)
that low yield stocks require iigher returns because investors value dividends
more than retained earnings. Miller and Modigliani [19611 demonstrated that in

a world of no transaction costs, equal tax treatment of dividends and capital
gains, and investor rationality, the dividend policies of firms have no impact on
the welfare of security holders (given investment policies). Miller and Modigliani

pointed out, however, that the heavier taxation of dividends than capital gains
might lead to higher before-tax returns on shares with high dividend yields. But

they wained that such a relation would be weakened and possibly completely
offset by clientele effects. One important class of investors, pension funds, pay

no taxes and, therefore, have no reason to require higher returns on dividend

paying stocks. Other investors, notably corporations and casualty insurance
companies, face lower statutory tax rates on dividends than capital gains. On
the othe1 hand, some investors consuming wealth may find the tax penalties of

dividend paying stocks offset by lower transaction costs if part of their returns

are received as dividends. Recently, even the proposition that dividends are
taxed at higher rates than capital gains has been challenged. Miller and Scholes
[1978] have pointed to features of the tax code and currently available financial
instruments that investors could use to blunt any tax disadvantages of dividends.

Attempts to establish which of these hypothesized relations between
dividends 'and stock returns holds empirically have not resulted in a consensus.

—2--

Early tests of the general effects of dividends, such as Friend and Puckett

[1964], relied on cross sectional regressions of common stock prices on
dividends per share, and various alternative measures of earnings or retained
earnings per share. Friend and Puekett found little evidence of yield effects, but

their tests are subject to serious limitations. Black and Scholes (19741 also
tested for the general impact of dividends on common stock returns, using time

series methods that avoided many of the estimation difficulties of the earlier
cross sectional regressions of stock prices on dividends and retained earnings.
On the basis of their test, Black and Scholes [1974] found themselves unable to

reject the hypothesis that dividend yields have no significant effect on stock
returns.

Several authors have tested for the tax effects of dividends by comparing

returns on eum and ex days. Elton and Gruber [1970], in a well known study,
claim documentation of both a tax effect and a dependency between tax rates of

marginal investors and dividend yields (a clientele effect reflected in asset
prices). With a longer sample period and more appropriate statistical procedure,

Black and Scholes [1973] are unable to confirm either of these conclusions.
However, Black and Scholes do find evidence of unusual behavior in security
returns for several days surrounding ex dividend days.

Recent work, notably by Litzenberger and Ramaswamy [1979] and Blume
[19781, has sought to improve the efficiency of the Black—Scholes [1974] tests.

Both papers claims to have found evidence supporting the importance of
dividends. Litzenberger and Ramaswamy, at least, argue that the importance of
dividends is best explained by differential taxation of dividends.

In this paper I present a different estimation method that avoids some of
the shortcomings of the Litzenberger-Ramaswamy and Blume tests. I conclude

Black and Scholes estimate -y1 as the average monthly return of the
portfolio. For their overall sample period, January, 1939 to December, 1966, the

average return is .09 percent.

During three ten year subperiods, the

estimates range from .02 percent to .16 percent. None of the estimates are
statistically significant.

cross sectional regressions over time. Litzenberger and Ramaswamy use three
different, although closely related techniques to estimate (6).

The first technique is a regression of individual securities' risk premiums
(returns less than one month T-Bill rate) on a constant, the securities' betas

estimates in the previous sixty months, and a measure of anticipated dividend

yield of the securities for the month less the one month T-Bill rate. The
securities' betas are estimated with the following regression,

measure of anticipated dividends for any month equals the taxable dividends paid

in the month if the dividends were announced prior to the beginning of the
month. If the taxable dividends were unannounced and nonrecurring, anticipated

dividends were assigned a value of zero and if dividends were unannounced but

recurring, anticipated dividends were set equal to the last recurring payment.5

The third estimation techni uc seo

Litzenherg€i nad Ramaswamy is

motivated by the errors in variables probien siooiaed with individual secur—

ities beta estimates. The estimation technique icndes an explicit adjustment
foi errors in the beta estimates. Lit.senberger and Ramasamv argue that their
method

dealing with errors in cariables is superior to the portfolio rouping

procedure of Black—Scholes because it does not destroy cross sectional dis
persion. Moreover, the authors claim that the estimator is consistent and is a

maximum likelihood estimator if the joint distribution of security returns is
orrnal. These are remarkable claims since the errors in variables problem has
severely limited the ability to rnai<e reliable inferences in financial economics as

weil as onomics in generaL Litzenberger and Ramaswamys adjusted estimator

is analyied in Appendix A and it is shown there that this estimator is neither
consistent nor is it maximum likelihood.

Litzenberger and Ramaswamy derive estimates from each of these tech-

niques b averaging estimates over time. The standard errors of the estimates

itre estimated from the time series of monthly estimates. The resulting
estimates ot c are all quite close. turing the sample period January, 1936 to
Deeember 1977, they are .227, .234 and .236 for the OLS GLS, and adjusted

estimator. The t-values of these estimates relative to zero are 6.33, 8.24, arid

8.62 for the OLS, GLS, and adjusted estimator.6 The adjusted estimator is
computed for six subperiods. Litzenberger and Ramaswamy note that during the

overall sample period of Black and Scholes, January, 1936 to December, 1966,

the dividend yield of the market was .048 per year. Interpreting the Black—
Scholes

as equivalent to cdm they infer an estimate of c equal to .225 from

the Black and Scholes estimate of y1 (.0009 x 12/.048). On the basis of this
calculation, they claim to have documented roughly the same effect as Black and
Scholes, but in a more precise way.7
B1urie [1978]

Blume [1978] proposes the following model,

at + b 8it + Ctd1t +
for i =

1,

2 ...

N

and t =

1,

(8)

2 ...T. The coefficients of (8) are each assumed to be

normally, independent1y and identically distributed with means a, b, and c and

variances a , a

,

and

a,

respectively.

Equation (8) closely resembles the

stochastic version of Litzenberger and Ramaswamy's model, equation (6). The

major differences are supression of the risk-free rate and the interpretation of
random coefficients period by period.

Blume estimates (8) by regressing quarterly returns of twenty-five port-

folios on a constant, the estimated portfolio betas, and a measure of the
portfolios' quarterly dividends yield. Portfolios are used to reduce the errors in

variables associated with estimated betas.

Like Black and Scholes, Blume

attempts to maintain dispersion in both the portfolio betas and dividend yields.

The portfolio betas are estimated with sixty months of data prior to the
quarterly estimates. Although monthly data are available, Blume uses quarterly

The model (9) makes very precise predictions about securities' returns.
First, the model predicts that securities' risk premiums are constant over time,
except for changes in the riskiess rate and the securities' dividend yields. If the
dividend yield of a security, less the riskiess rate, is constant over time, the risk

(10) holds across securities and over time periods consistent with

constant betas. Like (9), equation (10) involves restrictions on parameters for

each security, as well as restrictions on parameters across securities. The
restrictions implied by (10) are more difficult to incorporate than the restric-

tions of (9), because equation (10) includes restrictions on products of parameters. More important, estimation of (10) requires identification of the market

portfolio and this imposes an untestable restriction on the data. Nor can much

comfort be taken on the latter count from evidence that suggest particular
implications of asset pricing seem to be insensitive to alternative specifications
of the market portfolio.9 The concern of this study is with a particular problem

and generalization of results obtained with other problems is inappropriate.

Since determining the effects of alternative market portfolios is beyond the
scope of this paper, equation (10) is used only as a check on the sensitivity of
some of our tests.

Both formulations of Blume's model, (9b) and (lob), closely resemble the
empirical formulations proposed for Litzenberger and Ramaswamy, (9) and (10),

and Brennan, (9a) and (lOa). In particular, the models share the implication that
the dividend yield coefficient is common across securities.

Alternative Formulations

Equations (11) and (12) are systems of time series regressions with a
regression equation for each security. To estimate the systems properly and to
test the model's implications, the cross sectional dependence in security returns

must be taken into account. Zeilner [1971] has called systems like (ii) and (12)

"seemingly unrelated regressions" (SUR). The regressions have different independent variables, but are related by the contemporaneous correlation of the

disturbances. The disturbances are presumed to be contemporaneously correlated across equations, but the non-contemporaneous covariances and auto-

—17—

covariances are here all assumed to be zero. The general form of the SUR is.

Although the orthogonality condition does not hold for our problem, the

spirit of the adjustment is similar.

Thus, if the market portfolio can be

approximated with the securities included in the system, the loss in efficiency

from not including the market portfolio in equation (11) is reduced. More

generally, if security returns are linear in other unobservable factors, the
seemingly unrelated estimator partially adjust for the excluded variables.

If the disturbances of the system are normally, independently, and iden-

tically distributed over time, the SUR estimator is the maximum likelihood

Equation (ha) and (hib) are estimated for a broad cross section of firms.
These firms are classified into systems of securities (equations) on the basis of

average dividend yields. These classifications are meant to control for any
dependency of effective tax brackets on dividends of the kind reported by Elton

and Gruber [1970], and by Litzenberger and Ramaswamy [1980]. If tax
induced clienteles effect asset prices, the tax parameters of (ha) and (lib)
would not be constant across securities, hence, our tests would be more likely to

reject a common effect across securities the larger the dispersion in dividend
yields.
Periods of Analysis and Samples of Firms

The empirical tests are conducted over nine sample periods between
January, 1926 and December, 1978. The sample periods include substantially

different statutory treatment of dividends and capital gains. During the first
sample period--January, 1926 to December, 1931--the statuory limit on dividend

income was 20 percent and the statutory limit on long term capital gains (two

year holding period) was 12.5 percent. Between 1935 and 1940, the statutory
limit on dividends increased from 54 to 75 percent, while the statutory limit on

long term capital gains (one to ten year holding periods) ranged from 30 to 60

percent. By 1945, the statutory limit on dividend income had risen to 90
percent, and 50 percent of the gain on assets held for more than six months were
excluded from taxable income subject to a maximum tax of 25 percent. Between

1945 and 1978, the statutory limit on dividend income decreased to 70 percent,

while the limits on long term capital gains have ranged between 25 and 30
percent.

—23—

For each of the nine sample periods, systems of thirty securities are
formed on the basis of average dividend yields over the sample periods. None of

the firms included in the systems have nontaxable cash distributions during the
period.

The securities are all sampled from the Center for Research in Security
Prices (CRSP) ionthly return file and include only those firms with complete
data during the period. Each system includes thirty securities.
Data and Defuitioris of Variables

Monthly returns from the CRSP return file are used in estimating the
models. After 1931 the riskless rate of interest is approximated with the one
month Treasury Bill rate. Prior to 1931, the shortest Government Bcnds with a

maturity of at least one month are used to proxy for the riskiess rate. The
source of this data is Ibbotson and Sinquefield [1977].

The dividend yield variable is actual cash dividends paid in the ex dividend

month divided by the closing price in the previous month. Note that this differs
from the definitions of Litzenberger and Ramaswamy and Blume (cf. pages 6 and

8). It is unclear on prior grounds which of the definitions is more meaningfuL
Blume's quarterly measures of dividend yields and returns are not used since our

primary interest is detection of tax effects. With this objective, it is unwise to
destroy time series variation in dividend yields, i.e., the variation due to dividend
yields being zero in months when no dividends are paid.

Estimates and Tests with Equations

(ha) and (hib)
The empirical results for equations (ha) and (lib) are reported in Tables 2

-24--

through 10. The first column of each table shows the range of average dividend

yield for each system. The second column lists the restricted estimates and
their asymptotic standard errors in parentheses. The third column shows an "F-

statistic" for the hypothesis that y ii is equal across securities, and the final
column lists the approximate probability levels conditional on 11i being equal for

all securities in the system. The "F—statistic" reported in these tables are
distributed as F, with degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions and

thirty times the degrees of freedom per equation if the covariance matrix is
known.14 For an unknown covariance matrix, the asymptotic distribution is chisquared with the same degress of freedom; however, the F approximation is more

conservative with respect to the equality hypothesis.15'

17

The constants in equations (ha) and (hib) implicitly include a beta (times a

market risk premium). Since other authors have assumed stationary beta for
sixty month periods, a dummy variable is included in the estimated equations to

allow for shifts in beta. The dummy variable is assigned a value of zero for the
first half of the sample periods and one otherwise. 18

The results of Table 2 thorugh 10 tell a very convincing story. The
restriction that the tax parameter 11i is equal across securities is badly violated

for virtually all the sample periods and yield groups. Since the restriction fails
to hold, it is not clear what, if any, interpretations can safely be drawn from the

restricted estimates. For what it may be worth, the behavior of the restricted
estimates across the dividend yield classification does appear roughly consistent

with the existence of clientele effects. The restricted estimates do appear to be
negatively related to dividend yield, though the relation is not strong or uniform.

is equal across securities from the other hypotheses.

Equation (11) is estimated with a sample selected from the securities
included in the Dow Jones Industrials during the January, 1926 to December,
1978 period. The sample always consists of thirty securities but the composition

of the sample changes over time. For purposes of comparison, the same thirty
securities used for estimating (11) are also used to estimate (lie) for each of the

—35—

nine periods. These results are reported in Table 11. Table 12 reports test
statistics, restricted estimates, and unrestricted estimates for three of the
periods, along with their standard errors.

From the results of Tables 11 and 12, it appears that our earlier
conclusions are insensitive to the specification of the riskless rate. Generally,

the restricted estimates of equations (11) and (ha) are quite close and our
inferences regarding the equality of 11i across equations are unaffected. As for

the riskiess rate, the hypothesis of a common coefficient appears to be a
reasonable approximation for periods after 1960. Prior to 1960, we are generally

able to reject this hypothesis. The unrestricted estimates of Table 13 show a
wide variation in all sample periods but are predominately negative, consistent

with the Fama-Schwert findings. Given the observed variation, it is surprising
that the hypothesis of a common effect of the riskiess rate is not rejected in all

periods. But the smaller variation in the riskiess rate makes precision of these
estimates much lower than that of estimates for the dividend yield coefficient.

An additional check on the sensitivity of the test to model specification
can be obtained from equation (12) which differs from (11) by inclusion of the

market return and dividend yield as separate variables (cf. Table 1). These
estimates are reported in Table 13 for the same time periods and for the sample

of Dow Jones Industrials. Including the market return and yield as separate
variables seems to have little impact on the results. The probability levels,

restricted estimates, and unrestricted estimates are very similar to those of
equation (11).

Definition of Anticipated Dividend Yields

The results presented in Tables 2-13 provide little support for the simple

—36--

nx effec. models of dividends. We can reject y model predicting a common
c-.e cie on dividend yield, including the case of neutrality of dividends. it
2ossible that our results are due to the perfect foresight definition of dividend
yields,

!iany dividend payments nre announced during the cx month, and

therefor announcement and tax effects may be convoluted in our estimates nf

the dividand i1,d coefficients. There is, of course no reason to suppose that
such announcement eieets would be the same across securities or across time

for the arne securities and because f this our tests may unfairly reject the
hypothesis of a common dividend yield ffec.. To control f or this possibility, we

consider a definition of anticipated dividend ioici tfat relies only upon
information announced prior to the ex month, namely the dnnition oC Litzen—

berger ane Ramaswamy. This choice allows us to make direct cornpaions
their results and may also be regarded as a naive definition from the set ct

possible definitions, i.e., many alternative definitions relying upon information
announced prior to the ex month will have forecasting errors that lie somewhere

between. those of the perfect foresight definition and the Litzenberger and
Ramaswamy definition.

UH .g Litzenberger and Ramaswamy's definition of anticipated dividend
yields, :atiorIs (11) and (12) are estimated with two groups of thirty securities:
the Dow Jones lndusttials sample and a sample of utilities and railroads. The

utility—railroad sample provides a check against peculiarities of the Dow Jones
IndustriaLs, ad this s;:mpie can be presumed to have been identified by investors

as high—yield stocks. The test with these securities are conducted for the same

periods as the previous tests are remrted in Tables 14 and 15. These results
indicate that the earlier conclusions rc;arding th dividend yield coefficient are

basically unaffected by the definition of atcipaed dividend yields. The F-

statistics and restricted estimates change somewhat, but the changes, on
balance, are not large enough to alter our conclusions. Further, the utilityrailroad sample exhibits the same pattern as our earlier samples of high—ield
stocks, and the variation of the unrestricted estimates for the Dow Jones sample
is similar to those earlier under the perfect foresight definition. In sum, the

failure to find a common tax effect cannot plausibly be attributed to an
obscuring of the tax effect by announcement effects impounded in the perfect
foresight definition.
Dividend Yields and Shifts in Expected Returns

Tables 2 through 15 reveal a complex relation between expected returns

and dividend yields. The unrestricted estimates highlight this complexity. In
many reseets, our results are unsettling since we have rejected the two simplest

models of the impact of dividends: neutrality and common tax effects. In fact,

the data

11 us both of these are bad approximations. But not why.

One pcssible explanation is that dividend yields are proxying for other
factors that affect returns. Imagine, for example, a world where dividends are

"steady" in the sense of not being adjusted immediately by firms to maintain
constant dividend yields. A decrease in the price of a firm's shares, on average,
will thus imply a higher dividend yield and an increase in price will, on average,

imply a lower dividend yield. For leveraged firms, changes in stock prices may

also result in changes in the riskiness of the firm's stock. Unless firms make
compensating adjustments in leverage, a decrease in the price of common stock

implies a higher leverage ratio and an increase a lower, leverage ratio. As a
result, both dividend yields and expected returns may be increasing or decreasing

simultaneously. Stated differently, equations have been omitted, namely, the

ones determining expected returns, and dividend yields are proxying for the
omitted equations.

To see the possible impact of this relation, consider equation (11). The
intercept of equation (11) may be expressed as,

oit —

oi + "it

whereu it is the difference between the expected return of security i in period t

and its average during the sample period (ignoring taxes).

Substituting this

expression into eqution (11),

Rit =yoi +yiidit +y2irft+Eit v it

(lic)

The disturbance term in equation (11) consists of the true disturbance plus the
deviation of the expected return in period t from its average during the sample
period.

Our previous discussion suggests that, on average,

it and d1t are both

negatively related to stock prices and, therefore, positively related to each
other. Further, the relation is not easily modeled. The best that we can do is

present videnee that establishes the plausibility of the connection. Nevertheless, this evidence had important implications for intercepting tests of the
relation

between dividend yields and expected returns (and perhaps also other

anomalies of asset pricing).

To test for this relationsip, we generalize equation (ii) to,

definition of anticipated dividend yields is used in estimating (lid). In

(lid) includes the dividend yield terms of (ii) in both the cum and cx months,
Since the cum month dividend yield is taken from the previous ex month, there

can be no information effects in the coefficient

and a fortiori in the two—

month lag coefficient y4. Clearly, there are no tax effects of the kind
hypothesized by Litzenberger and Ramaswamy in these coefficients since the

dividend has already been paid. If the ex month is included, the cum month

effects are purely statistical artifacts from their point of view. The tests
conducted with (lid) are tests of no effect of current or lagged dividend yields.
If both lagged and current dividend yields turn out to be non-zero, there is reason

to believe that dividend yields are proxying for shifts in expected returns. The
results of these tests for the Dow Jones Industrial sample are reported in Table
16.

As can be seen both the lagged and current dividend yields appear to be non-

zero in all time periods. It would be difficult, on the basis of these results, to
conclude either that the current values dominate the lagged value or vice-versa.

The current and lagged values both contribute to the explanation of expected

returns, thus warning again of the perils of attaching too much economic
significance to the observed relations between expected returns and dividend
yields.

Cone lusions

The purpose of this paper has been to test certain hypotheses on the
relation between dividend yields and expected stock returns, using a methodology

that is more powerful in a number of respects that those that have so far been

used in that context. The method employs systems of time series regressions
with the competing hypotheses taking the form of cross equation restrictions.

The major finding of this paper is that the relation between dividend yields

and stock returns is not constant across securities. In almost all cases examined,

the hypothesis that dividends have a common effect on expected returns can be
decisively rejected. This conclusion is inconsistent with the tax effect models of

Litzenberger and Ramaswamy and Brennan or the similar model of Blume. But

the results are also inconsistent with the hypothesis that dividends have no

effect on expected returns. Stated differently, the tests show a statistically
significant relation between yields and returns, but one that is not well described
either by dividend neutrality or by tax effect models. The unresolved question is

what does explain the results? The observed structure of dividend payments
suggests that dividend yields may be proxying for changes in the expected return

of securities over time. This possibility was tested by including the lagged
dividend yield in cum months along with ex month dividend yield. The cum
month dividend yields have no impact on' investors' tax liabilities and have no

informaitonal content since they are lagged values.

Nevertheless, the cum

month dividend yields appear to be as important statistically as the ex month
dividend yields. The cum month results emphasize the need for greater caution

in interpreting the dividend tests here and more generally.

They should

especially discourage attempts to appeal to existing empirical tests for justifying

It is easy to imagine circumstances where the cross moment around the

Litzenberger and Ramaswamy estimate will be too large in a probability

limit sense. If dividend yields

are negatively related to beta, the

probability limit of the estimate will be less than c. While the
magnitude of this effect is unknown for the

Litzenberger and

Ramaswamy sample, a serious suspicion is cast on the results

obtained with the '0LS and 'GLS' estimation

techniques.

distribution of security

returns. In short, there is no reason to believe that their adjusted
estimator is any better than the OLS and GLS estimators they
report.

The changes in the variance of u over time depends

d. Since

is the ratio of one variance to three variances,

it is probably reasonable to approximate A1 with a value of about .33.
An average quarterly dividend yield is approximately .01; for a high

yielding stock the value would be .02. Thus, in an ex month the
variance of the disturbance would be about ? (1.000033) for an average
firm, and

(1.000132) for a high yielding firm. In a non ex month,

FOOTNOTES

1. It is possible that a relation more complicated than the ones tested here
could exist. See, for example, Constantinides, G. [1979].

2. Actually c is a weighted average of investors' marginal tax rates where the
weights equal the global risk tolerance divided by the sum of the global risk
tolerances across all investors, see Litzenberger, R., and Ramaswamy, K.,
[1979, 171i't2].

3. lbid.,p.2.
4. Ibid., p. 15.

5. Only dividends paid in the last twelve months are used to calculate the
unannounced but recurring dividends. See Litzenberger, R., and Ramaswamy, K., [1979, 182].

6. Litzenberger, R., and Ramaswamy, K., [1979, Table 1].

7. The reliability of this calculation is questionable. First, Black and Scholes
measure dividend yield for any year as dividends paid in the previous year,
divided by the closing price of the previous year. Tax liabilities
will depend
upon dividends actually paid and not the previous years dividends. A
possible differential tax liability will not be proportional to the Black and
Scholes measure of dividend yield. Second, Black and Scholes estimate
using both ex and non-ex months. Since tax effects only occur in ex months,
the
estimates mixes tax effects with other dividend related effects.
Finally, Black and Scholes use an equally weighted index and not a value
index. In short, the relation between estimate and the presumed dividend
tax bracket of the marginal investor is by no means clear. The most that
can be said is that a positive estimate
in a Black and Scholes test is
consistent with differential taxation of dividends.
8. Blume apparently expected a negative coefficient, a preference by investors
for dividends, see Blume, M., [1978, 1].
9. See, for example, Stambaugh, R., [1979].

10. Gordon, R. and Bradford, D. (1979) estimate a model similar to (12).
Unfortunately, the authors never test any of the restrictions implied by
their model.

1945—1969.

Recently, attention has focused on the finite sampling properties of this test
statistic. Meisner has reported simulations that would

sugge't the test
statistic is heavily weighted toward rejecting the restriction
when the
degrees of freedom are small per equation. As expected, as the degrees of
freedom grows per equation (23

per equation were exsmined by Meisner) the
bias is substantially reduced. Since
the degrees of freedom
here, the large sample aproximation will be assumed to be are quite large
appropriate. See
Meisner, J., [1979] and Laitinen, K., [1978].
17.

The F—distribution is more onservative with respect to rejecting the
restriction and that approximation is adopted here.
See Theil. H., [1971,
402-O3}.

18. Since none of our hypotheses involve
dummy coefficients, these estimates
are not recorded.

19. This sample was also used to test for common cum month effects and
common differences between cum and ex month effects. In general, these
restrictions were rejected at high
probability levels.

20. This sum is distributed as chi-squared with N degrees of freedom. 1/N times
the sum has a mean of 1 anda variance of 2/N. See Theil, H., [1971, 402].
21. See, for example, King, B. [19661 and Meyers, S., [1973].
22. See Schmidt, P., [1976, 105—112].

23. I am indebted to E. Han Kim for bringing this particular example to
my
attention.
