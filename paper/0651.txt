will do in this paper is to argue that, even under seemingly favorable

assumptions, these distribution effects nay run the wrong way; that if they
run

the right way, they will be very weak; and that the incentives for inter-

national, portfolio diversification are in any case small, and can be

swamped

by quite modest transaction costs or other costs to diversification.
This

paper is in four sections. Section 1 briefly reviews the argument

about how an effect of current accounts on exchange rates can be ,jüstified

in a finance theory framework, then shows by a numerical example how the ef-

fect can run in the wrong direction. Section 2 sets out a formal model in
which the condition for distribution effects running the right way can be

explicitly derived. Section 3 then develops a continuous—time model in

and presents an argument that transaction costs may be as

important or more important than mean—variance considerations in determining

international portfolios.
1. Wealth Distribution and the
As

Forward Premium.

Kouri and de Macedo(l978) have pointed out, the essence of the port-

folio balance explanation of the current account's role in exchange rates lies
in what they Lall the "wealth transfer effc.". Suppose that Americans nr 1d
a higher proportion of their wealth in dollar denominated assets than Germans
do. Then a redistribution of wealth from America to Germany, occurring over
time through current account imbalances, will reduce the demand for dollar
denominated assets and increase the demand for mark denominated assets, re-

quiring either a rise in the U.S.—German interest differential or a deprecia—
tion of the dollar. The rote of the current account in exchange rate determination -

3.

arises from the assumed tendency of residents of each country to hold a larger
proportion of their wealth in domestic—currency—denominated assets than
foreigners

do. (This is a point which is somewhat obscured in "small country"

models, such as those of Branson (1977), Kouri (l976a),and Dornbusch and Fischer
(1980) ,

in which it is assumed that the home country holds foreign assets but

foreigners do not hold domestic assets. This of course implies that home
country residents do hold a larger share of their wealth •in domestic—currency

denominated assets; and it is this, rather than the small—country aspect of
the story, which really does the work of moving the exchange rate).
Where finance theory comes into this story is in explaining ! residents

of each country should have a "local habitat" in domestic bonds. Essentially.
it is argued that Americans hold American assets because they buy American

goods. That is, because the consumption basket of each country is weighted
toward domestically produced
risk

goods whose prices are set in domestic currency,

averse investors will tend to choose a portfolio with a disproportionate

share of assets denominated in domestic currency.

We can clarify the point by considering a world of two countries, America
and Britain, where the only assets are nominal bonds denominated in dollars

and pounds. Suppose that prices of American and British goods are predictable

inrms of dollars and pounds respectively, so that the only uncertainty is
about exchange rata changes. Then an individual who consumes only American

goods will be able to avoid all risk by holding only dollar bonds, and will

hold pound bonds only if they offer a higher expected real return. Similarly,
an individual who consumes only British goods will hold only pound bonds un-

less offered a higher expected real return on dollar bonds. If we can take
it as given that Americans will spend a higher proportion of their income on

American goods than Britains will, this seems to give a simple justification

4.

for the asstmlption that donestic residents have a local habitat in domestic
currency

bonds. The point can

be further emphasized if one goes to a

mean—variance

framework, as Kouri and de Macedo (1978), de Macedo (1980), and
Dornbusch (1980) do. In such a framework the optimal portfolio consists of a

"safe" asset plus a speculative portfolio which depends on expected returns ——
and the safe asset consists of dollar bonds for
a dollar consumer, pound bonds
for a pound consumer.
-

Unfortunately, the case for a wealth transfer effect of the right sign

is not as clear—cut as this argument makes it seem. The reason is that expected real returns depend on the constimption basket ——

and

they do so in such

a way as to encourage holding of bonds denominated in foreign currency.
Consider the example in Table I. For simplicity we consider a situation

in

which interest rates are zero on both types of bonds.

What would an investor do in this situation? It depends on two things:
his consumption tastes, and his degree of risk aversion. One extreme case

be reversed. Pound bonds have a positive expected return in terms

of

dollars,

while dollar bonds have a positive expected return in terms of pounds. Thus
in this case we will have cross—holding,the reverse of the local habitat story.

This paradoxical possibility results from Jensents inequality. There is
a small literature on the role of Jensen's inequality in international finance
(see Siegel (1972), Roper (1975), and McCulloch (1975).

practical

even slight risk aversion would be enough to establish the preferred

habitat result. however, this is not the case. Consider a Bernoulli investor, i.e. , one whose utility is linear in the log of expected wealth.

Such an investor would not ordinarily be considered to have an unreasonably
low degree of risk aversion.

Yet the Bernoulli case is not enough to estab-

lish a preferred habitat result. Let W be wealth in dollars, and S the
dollar—pound exchange rate. Then a Bernoulli investor who consumes American

Furthermore, the example suggests that the role of risk aversion in

international portfolio decisions is comparable in magnitude to that of Jensen's inequality —— an effect which has generally been dismissed as trivial.

If this is the case, presumably the importance of risk aversion is also minor.
Our

calculations later will support this view.

2.

A Formal Model.

The basic idea of the finance theory view of distribution effects on
exchange

rates is that investors have a "local habitat" biased toward assets

denominated in domestic currency because they spend a relatively higher pro-

portion of

their income on domestic goods. This presumes, of course, that

the purchasing power of domestic currency aver domestic goods is more predictable than the purchasing power of foreign currency over domestic goods;
i.e., that inflation rates are more predictable than exchange rate changes.

This is a reasonable presumption: inflation rates are both much less variable
than exchange rate changes and

much more serially

correlated (see Mussa (1980)).

In this section I will carry out a formal analysis which takes this presumption

to its logical extreme: price levels will be assumed to be wholly predictable,
so that the only source of uncertainty is the exchange rate.
We make the following assumptions:

However, $,

which measures the relative demand for British

At the beginning of the period, investors will allocate their wealth

dollar bonds and pound bonds. They will be bound by the budget con-

result: An increased demand fora country's goods leads toan increased

demand for assets denominated in its currency if and only if relative
risk aversion is greater than one. If relative risk aversion is less than one,
the

effect runs the "wrong" way.

3.

Distribution Effects: A Continuous Time Model
If

risk aversion is great enough, the wealth transferF effect will run

in the "right" direction. What we would like, however, is a measure of its
importance. It will be useful to develop a model in which we can solve

explicitly

for the effects of a redistribution of world wealth on the

equilibrium interest differential.
Recently Kouri (1976b)

de Macedo Q980 )

and Stulz (1980) have applied

the analysis of continuous time portfolio models to international finance.
The basic result we need .&om this analysis is the following: suppose an in—,

vestor has a constant relative risk avezsion utility function of the form

U=f 1Cdt
0

where C is real consumption. Suppose further that real returns on the
assets available follow Brownian motion. Then at each point in time the

(10)

will choose a portfolio which maximizes

V = E (dW/W)

where t

is

vat (dW/W)

(11)

real wealth, dW/W is its instantaneous rate of change, and

R = 1—y is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.

Applying this to the international problem, we simply note that real
wealth W may be defined as
=

where W is dollar wealth, E the exchange rate,
prices of American and British goods, and

The exchange rate will, however, follow Brownian motion:

(14)

where dz is the random element.

Let us also assume that dollar and pound bonds heat fixed nominal rates

Using these numbers, we find that redistributing one percent of world wealth
would lead to a change in the forward premium of less than .02 percentage
points.

Given sufficiently strong risk aversion, then, it is possible to explain
both imperfect substitutability of bonds and distribution effects on interest

rates. But given realistic numbers, these effects will be very small. If
distribution effects in international financial markets

significant

do play an economically

role, they must arise from sources other than risk aversion.

4. Will Investors Diversify Internationally?
In the last section we saw that for reasonable estimates of relative risk
aversion and

actual

exchange volatility the economic importance of international

portfolio diversification seems doubtful.

A natural question is whether investors

themselves will bother to diversify. Realistically, there will be some costs
to international diversification of one's portfolio. Will the advantages be

14.

large enough to outweigh these?
To ask this question we1 need to formulate the costs of diversification.

It seems mOst natural to suppose that there is a fixed cost to diversification.

However, in the continuous time formulation this will not be tractable. We
can easily handle the cost, however, if we model it as a fixed cost jj unit
time; this can be viewed as an approximation to a situation where there is a

simple fixed cost. The cost per unit time will simply be the fixed cost
divided by the maturity of the security.

Our revised model of portfolio choice can be written as follows. Let f
be a fixed cost per unit time which an investor must incur if he chooses to

hold

foreign

currency bonds. Thus the change in an internationally

diversified investor's wealth will be

This is as close as we can get to a situation

of pure diversification, since setting

viding a differential in real returns.

In this case, the interest rates drop out and the critical level of
fixed costs depends only on R, ,

this means is that a cost equal to .245 percent of wealth at an

annual rate will deter diversification. For short maturities
a

this can be

quite small number. For three—month securities, for instance, an investor

with $10,000 will be deterred by costs of $6.13; an investor with $100,000
by costs of $61.25.

These calculations suggest that for many investors the costs of inter-

national diversification will be enou to block such diversification.
In practice, international portfolio diversification is not something
that ordinary individuals do.

Instead, it is more typically something

that we associate with firms and individuals whose utility depends on the cx—
change rate in a "leveraged" way —— e.g., importers who must commit themselves

to pay for foreign goods in future. This analysis suggests why. And it fur—

16.

thur suggests that a realistic analysis of international financial markets
must take into account the fact that international investment is not costless.
