Currency Baskets and Real Effective Exchange Rates

ABSTRACT

With the major currencies continuously moving (if not floating
freely) against each other, a country that does not choose to float
must decide what to peg to. If it pegs to the SDR it floats against
all currencies. Thus in the system begun in the early 1970s the very
concept of a fixed exchange rate is unclear. In this situation many
countries have chosen to peg their currencies to a basket, or a weighted average of other currencies.
The analysis of this paper is focused on fluctuations in real exchange rates. We first show that pegging to a currency basket is the
same as holding constant a real effective exchange rate that uses a
specific set of weights depending on a chosen policy target. We also
show the weights that correspond to particular targets for stabilization
policy.

Next we discuss several problems involved in choosing and computing
optimal weights or the equivalent real effective rate. It is shown that
the index formula itself aggregates countries that are in a currency
area, so that monetary authorities should use weights based on trade
with countries rather than on currency denomination of trade.
Finally, we report on an initial empirical investigation of pegging
practices in Greece, Portugal, and Spain. These are all countries that
have moved to basket pegs, with geographically diversified trade. We
present initial estimates of the implicit weights in their baskets, and
find that all three countries experienced real appreciation relative to
the basket during the l970s.

Currency Baskets and Real Effective Exchange Rates

1. Introduction and Sunry.
With the major currencies continuously moving (if not floating freely)
against each other, a country that

does not choose to float must decide

what to peg to. If it pegs its currency to one of the major currencies,
It floats against the others. If it pegs to the SDR it floats against
all currencies. Thus in the system begun in the early 1970s the very
concept of a fixed exchange rate is unclear.
In this situation many countries have chosen to peg their currencies
to a basket, or a weighted average

of other currencies. This trend was

noted by Arthur Lewis in his Per Jacobssen lecture at the IMP:
"It is now the conventional wisdom that the currencies of
the developed countries should float, but the currencies of
the less—developed (LDC5) should not; that is to say that

each LDC should choose a more developed country (MDC) as a
partner ——

or the SDR —— and tie itself in a fixed

relationship.t' (Lewis, 1977, p. 33).

Since the SDR weights are not particularly relevant for any single
country,

many countries

compose their own

basket.

Generalized floating (or dirty floating) raises problems of

measurement. What is meant by "the" exchange rate in a floating,

multiple—CurrencY world? The answer that has appeared in the literature
is an "effective" exchange rate, which is generally 50e.rade—veighted

index of changes in the home currency price of various foreign currencies.

2.

rates. These are based
The IMF now publishes data on effective exchange
on the IMP's multiple exchange rate model (MERN), described by Artus and

Rhomberg (1973). It will be shown in this paper that this is only one
of a possible number of definitions for an

Iteffectiveti exchange rate that

depends on the implicit choice of a target for exchange rate policy.
In an earlier paper (Branson—Katseli (B—K)

(1981)] presented at a

conference in Stockholm in 1978, we derived weights for currency baskets
that would eliminate the effects of other countries' nominal exchange
rate fluctuations on various home—country policy

targets. There we

considered the problem of choosing a currency basket in the presenèe of
third—country exchange—late fluctuations,

holding prices constant. In this

paper we extend that discussion in several ways.

First, in section 2, e focus our

analysis on fluctuations In real

exchange rates and show that pegging to a currency

basket is the same

as holding constant a real effective exchange rate that uses a specific

set of weights depending on the chosen policy

target. We also show that

the optimal weights of the earlier paper can be used for currency baskets

defined across real exchange rate fluctuations.

.The underlying model of

trade prices and quantities is similar to the one in B—K (1981) and is
summarized in Appendix 1.

The model of section 2 differs from others in the recent literature

in two respects. First, a partial equilibrium approach is adopted as
opposed to the general equilibrium model of Flanders and llelpman (1979).
This affects the exact composition, but not the general form of the weights.

3.

Second, we derive weights that insulate policy targets from third—country

exchange—rate fluctuations. The alternative in the literature is to

real

adopt a variance—minimiziçig approach for a portfolio or a vector of targets.
Examples are Flanders and Helpman (1979), de Macedo(1979), and Lipschitz

Sundararajan

and

(1980). They derive weights which differ from ours in

form, being functions of the variance—covariance structure of movements

in

real exchange rates.
In

sections 3 and 4 we discuss several problems involved in choosing

and computing optimal weights or the equivalent real effective rate.

In section 3 it is shown that the index formula itself aggregates countries
that are in a currency area, so that monetary authorities should use weights
based on trade with countries rather than on currency denomination of trade.
In section 4 optimal weights are combined with a crawling peg against the
basket.

Finally,

in section 5 we report on an initial empirical investiga-

tion of pegging practices in Greece, Portuga1, and Spain. These are all
countries that have moved to basket pegs, with geographically diversified

trade. We present initial estimates of the implicit weights in their baskets,
and find that all three countries experienced real appreciation relative to
the basket during the 1970s..

theoretical framework for analyzing the cons-

exchange—rate policy.

basket weights may be calculated for a variety of policy targets. Flanders
and Helpman (1979) and Lipschitz and Sundararajan (1980), for example, derive
optimal basket weights for some of these as well as other policy targets.
The policy targets can, in turn, be expressed as combinations of
trade prices and quantities as shown In B—K (1981). In Appendix 1 changes

in trade prices and quantities are expressed as functions of movements in
(a) the home country's real exchange rate against the numeraire, r+

real exchange rates on export and import values, respectively.

Terms—of—trade weights.

We could derive weights insulating the terms of trade
from third—country real exchange rates from equations (A.lO) and (A.12)

in Appendix 1. However, given the balance—of trade weights in (7),

we can proceed more directly. Assume X = N initially, and eliminate
quantity effects from the balance—of—trade weights by assuming

These are the same as (28) in B—K (1981), and they define a currency bas-

in the small—country case where k = k

policy cannot influence the terms of trade; weights (18) are relevant

only when k k.
Weights stabilizing the relative price of traded goods.

Equation (7) gives weights for a currency basket aimed at stabi—
lizing the trade balance. These are essentially defined as weights for
"the" effective exchange rate in the IMP

literature.

See, for example,

Artus—Bhomberg (1973). On the other hand, as early as 1976, Stanley Black
derived weights aimed at stabilizing the relative price of traded vs non—

traded goods. These define an alternative effective exchange rate
oriented toward relative prices.

11.

In B—K (1981), the Black weights were shown

These are Black's (1976) preferred weights.

The weighting expressions in equations (7), (8), and (12) give
alternative weights for currency baskets, or definitions of real effective
exchange rates, for alternative targets of exchange—rate policy. The
Important points here are that, (a) as in our earlier work [B—K (1980,1981)],

each weighting system defines an effective exhcnage :ate that corresponds
to a chosen target, but (b) the weights here,as opposed to the model in
B—K (1980, 1980),are used to define an index across real exchange rates.

Even though the analysis is a straightforward extension of the earlier model
• it is an important extension in that it permits us to consider the cases of

PPP and of independent variations in prices and exchange rates as extreme

cases of one general framework. Next we turn to some comments on the
application of weighting schemes in the exercise of exchange—rate policy.

Issues in calculating optimal weights.

The weighting schemes of section 2 use trade weights ct and
and they are aggregated to the point where each country has a single
import—competing price disturbance q1 and all countries have the same

elasticity of demand d for one export good. Two kinds of questions
have been raised in considering how to apply any of these schemes.

One is whether trade weights or currency weights are appropriate. The
second is how to disaggregate, in general across commodities. Two examples of the disaggregation question are whether to use trade or current
account weights, and how to adjust for the commodity composition of ex-

ports across, e.g., agriculture, mining, manufacturing. In this section
we will consider these two kinds of questions in turt..

Trade shares vs currency shares.

Up to this point, we have noted the small—country special case in

passing. But we have left for separate discussion a problem that general—
ly appears as one of two seemingly different questions. These are as
follows: (1) How should trade weights be modified if trade is denominated

in a world currency? For example, Zambia's copper exports are stated in

sterling as determined on the London metal exchange. (2) Should we not
use shares of currency denomInation in the

and B weights, rather than

direction of trade? The first question was first raised at a seminar at
Columbia University, April 19, 1978. The second was raised in Lipschitz (1979)
and again in discussions at the Finance Ministry in New Delhi, and the Monetary

Authority of Singapore, January 9 and 28, 1980. Here we show that these questions
are essentially the same, that they are really the question of the smallness of thu

14.

countries, and that they are already answered in the formulation of the
real exchange rate in the weighting schemes of section 2.
Consider first the question of using currency area weights in-

stead of trade weights in the calculations. Suppose a subset R of the
third countries denominate their trade with the home (zero) country in

dollars, as an example. Then it seems intuitively plausible to argue
that those countries should be included In a "dollar area," and that
their weights should be combined with that of the U.S. in calculations.
This is not quite correct, though.

The true importance 3f the fact (if, indeed, it is a fact) that a
country h prices Its trade in dollars is the implicit assumption that
country h's prices move with U.S. prices, adjusted for the movements in
h's dollar exchange rate, 3h• This is the asthimption that h is a small country

relative to the United States. In this case the real exchange rate of h

—

vis—a—vis the U.S. is constant, and the term h +

in

the weighting

calculations is zero.

The implications of this for the use of the weighting schemes can be
seen by concentrating again on the example of the export price index for
country zero from Appendix 1:

(13) 'o —

+ k(r +

—

p0)

+ kZa1(J +

—

Suppose the U.S. dollar is chosen as numeraire, so N is the U.S. Con—
aider first a case in which all other country's prices are independent

15,

of the U.S. Then a

impulse will raise p, by

xO kq + kEa1(_q)

=

The summation in the third term

of

(13) runs across all N countries. Thus

the q impulse is entered with a weight of unity in the term giving the real
exchange rate of the home country against the numeraire, but it is taken out
N—i
with a weight E a1 by the term giving movement in third—country real exchange

rates. Thus the weighting scheme itself gives a lone

impulse a weight of

aN.

Now consider a case in which some subset of H countries
(1,..,h,..,H) have prices that move with the dollar, so that for each of

these the real exchange rate vis—a—vis the dollar is constant. This is the
case in which the h countries are small relative to the U.S., and one

would wish to integrate them into a dollar currency area. Now the effect
of a

impulse on

is given by

Thus the aggregation of countries that are truly in a currency area
in the sense that their real exchange rates are constant vis—a—vis each

16.

other is accomplished by the weighting index. If countries price their
trade in the same currency, but their prices move independently, they

will not and should not be aggregated. But if
they

their

prices move together,

automatically will be.
The problem of a country which is selling a commodity priced in a

nuineraire on the world market is essentially the same. If copper trades

at

one world price, then all the relevant q1 for

a copper exporter will

move together, and be aggregated by the indexes into one world market.
At this level, the appropriate aggregation is again automatically achieved by

the index. The real problem for a commodity exporter will come with com-

modity disaggregation within the importing countries. This takes us to
the disaggregation question.
Levels of disaggregation.

While the indexes of equations (A.lO) —

(A.13) will perform the aggreatinn

of the world market for a single—commodity exporter, they do not take into account the probability that in each country i, the demand price for
the commodity moves somewhat independently of the average import—competing

price. This example raises one question of disaggregation. The formulas
in equations (A.1O) —

(A.13),

and the subsequent weighting schemes, treat

each country i as importing a single good with demand elasticity d •
x

To

implement the weighting schemes ideally, one would want to use for
q the internal demand

prices

in country I for the particular exports

and imports of the home country zero, and apply to them the appropriate

disaggregated elasticity and share parameters. Thus for a country exporting only copper, one would ideally use movements in copper prices in
the various I countries, combined with estimates of elasticities relevant

I.

17.

for copper, and the exporter's trade shares. This would then give the

correct index for that country's p ,

etc.,

and the proper calculation

of weights.

Another major example of the disaggregation issue is the choice between current account and trade shares for

and

.

The effective

weighting schemes of the IMF [see, for example Artus and Rhomberg (1973)1,
and the portfolio weights of Kouri and de Macedo (1978) and de Macedo
(1979) use current account shares.

In general, we would expect the services components of the current

account to have different elasticities than the trade component. For
example, if migrant workers determine the value of thiir remittances in
terms

of

foreign exchange, k is effectively unity. If they fix the value

in terms of their home currency, k is effectively zero. Thus ideally, the
shares should be current account shares, and the elasticities should be

averages of the trade and services components. Consistency would suggest
not using trade elasticities with current account shares.

The broad point here is that the formulas of section 2 are

highly aggregated, with elasticities implicitly given as weighted averages of the relevant trade and services components. One can obtain a
first aggregate approximation for the weighting schemes by using trade
or current account shares

and

and the corresponding average elas-

ticities. But more precise calculation would require appropriate dis—
aggregation of both shares and elasticities.

18.

4. Adjustment of the real exchange rate and

choice

of optimal weights.

The optimal weighting schemes of section 2 give alternative sets of
weights for real exchange rates which have the following property: if the
home country real exchange rate vis—a—vis the nutneraire follows the

path of the real basket rate, effects of third—country fluctuations in

real rates will not affect the chosen target. Thus if the nominal rate
r is manipulated to maintain

r+_P0=_zw1(J+q1_q)
with the appropriately—chosen weights w, the target is insulated from

movements in real rates (J + q —

In

the case of the balance—of—trade weights, this movement in the

real rate will maintain trade or current account balance, depending on

whether the w1 include trade or current account weights. On the other
hand the terms—of—trade weights and the weights stabilizing the ratio

will

of prices of traded and non—traded goods

not in general

meet a balance—of—payments target. If those weights are chosen, there
will still remain the need for adjustment of the real rate relative to

the basket to hold the balance of payments near its target. One way to
-

achieve this adjustment would be to adopt a crawling basket peg such as

To summarize, adjustment of the

real effective rate can be used to

maintain external balance. This means that the weights for the currency
basket can be oriented toward a target

other than the trade balance,

namely toward one of the relative—price

targets. Use of one of those

weighting schemes will then stabilize the chosen target around the trend
dictated by the necessary adjustment of the real effective rate.

5. Application to exchange—rate experience in Southern Europe.
Three countries in Southern Europe, Greece, Portugal, and Spain,
have experimented with versions of basket pegs since exchange rates
began to float in the early 1970s. In this s'ection we briefly examine their experience, to see whether their choice of weights roughly

conforms to the analysis above. We begin with a brief description of
their experience. Next we discuss choice of targets for these countries,
and finally we examine the evidence.

Experience since 1971.

Following the breakdown of the Bretton—Woods system of fixed parities,
Greece, Portugal, and Spain each sought to pursue a more flexible ex-

change rate policy. Given the fact that the major currencies exhibited
substantial fluctuations vis—a—vis each other, pegging the exchange rate

to any single one of them meant substantial nd continuous realignments

vis—a—vis the others. Since all three countries have geographically
diversified trade (see Table 2 below), this implied that each would experience analogous tnovemnts in the home—currency price of traded

cotrimod—

ities if not of the terms of trade.

As early as the third quarter of 1971, Spain and Portugal abandoned
the dollar currency area and followed he Deutsche mark (DM) in its upward

trend against the dollar. This continued until the middle of 1975 when
both countries, hit by rising prices and appreciating effective real
exchange rates, started devaluing in nominal terms vis—a—vis both hard

currencies. The escudo's devaluation against the dollar has continued

22.

since; the devaluation against the DM halted around the end of 1979.

The Spanish authorities, probably sensitive to the inflationary consequences of further nominal devaluations against as major a trading
partner as Germany, reversed that trend at the third quarter of 1977

and attempted to stabilize the rate around 36 !esetasfDN. This lasted
approximately until the end of 1979.

Greece followed the dollar in its downward movement vis—a—vis the
other hard currencies for a much longer period than either Spain or
Portugal. The rate was held at 30 drachina/dollar until the middle of
1975 when a basket peg was adopted and the drachnia started devaluing

vis—a—vis the basket. It is only towards the end of the decade, with
rapid inflation of import prices and the CPI, that the rapid depreciation

vis—a—vis the European currencies was slowed. This policy shift was also
prompted by increased trade prospects with the European Community (EC)
in light of the imminent entry

into

the EC, and the expected movement

towards harmonization of monetary and exchange rate policies.

The experience of the three countries during tte 1970's can be thus

subdivided into three roughly comparable periods. In the first period,
mid—1971 to mid—1975, Spain and Portugal maintained rough parities
-

vis—a—vis the Deutsche mark and appreciated substantially vis—a—vis the
dollar; in the case of Greece the opposite held true. In the second period which lasted to 1977 III in the case of Spain, and

until

the end of

1979 in the other two countries, all three countries experienced substantial effective nominal devaluations vis—a—vis all major trading partners.

23.

Since that time, monetary authorities have attempted to maintain rough
parities with the European currencies.

Choice of targets for the currency basket.

Currency baskets aimed at stabilizing three different policy targets

were discussed in section 2 above. The targets are the trade balance,
the terms of trade, and the ratio of the price of traded goods to non—traded

goods T'N Which target would be most appropriate for Greece, Portugal,
and Spain?
In section 4, we argued that the effective real exchange rate can

be varied to meet a balance of trade target. This implies movement of
the home—currency real rate against the numeraire relative to the basket

real rate, as illustrated in equation (14). In Table 3 below, we see
that over the 1970s the effective real rate appreciated, on average, in

all three countries. In Table 4, we see that at least in the cases of
Portugal and Spain, there is evidence that the effective real rate was

responsive to an external balance target. Thus the choice of weights
for the currency basket itself comes down to terms—cit—trade vs
weights.

Exchange—rate policy can affect the terms of trade only in countries
with non—zero net market power; (k —.

k)

in equation (8) must be non—zero.

In Branson—Katseli (1980) we estimated indexes of market power on the

export side and the import side for 101 countries. [See B—K (1980,

pp. 62—67)]. Greece, Portugal, and Spain have relatively low values
of the market power index, suggesting that the small—country assumption

may be a good approximation in these cases. Thus the terms—of—trade
weights in equation (8 )

are probably not appropriate.

In

Table 3 a constant term is included for the

average movement of the real effective rate over the period; a negative

coefficient indicates real appreciation. In Table 4 we add the level
and rate of change of net foreign assets, F and F, as indicators of
external balance.

In general, the equations for Portugal and Spain seem reasonable;
those for Greece are more difficult to interpret.

This is probably due to

the fact that Greece's currency basket was defined across nominal rather

than real exchange rates. As has been shown in Katseli (1981), in the
case where the basket is defined across nominal rates, the estimated weights

are roughly the same as those of Table 3 but the explanatory power of the
regression is markedly higher (R2 —

.28).

In Table 3, all the constants are

negative, indicating real appreciation relative to the basket.

In Table 4,

the level of net foreign assets has a significant negative coefficient for

Spain, and both F and F seem to play a role in Portugal.

The patterns of coefficients giving currency weights permit us to draw
several tentative but interesting conclusions

1. The estimated weights seem reasonable as a description of

actual experience. They do not, however, correspond particularly closely

even to our T'N weights.
2. Over the whole period of the l970s the weight of the dollar in
the basket was markedly higher in the case of Greece than in either

Portugal or Spain. This Is hard to explain in terms of the Greek trade
shares (Table 2) but can be understood in light of the inertia of the

early period and preoccupation of the Greek authorities with balance of
payments considerations.

.

The weight of the Deutsche, mark is highest in
the case of

Portugal (.63). Here again the explanation is
tionships and possibly a domestic inflation
latively stable rather than declining

probably historical rela-

target. Maintaining a re-

home—currency value of emigrant

remittances might also be an important aspect of that choice.

4. In all three cases the share of the Italian lira

is quite high.

This probably reflects the preoccupation with competitive export positions in third markets.

5.

p

For all countries there was a nominal devaluation and real

appreciation of their currency relative to the basket. The nominal devaluation was strongest in Portugal (8

percent

on an annual basis) com-

pared to Greece (approximately 4 percent) and Spain (less than one percent). [Katselj
(1981)]. On the other hand, the real appreciation vis—a—vis the basket
was strongest in the case of Spain (around 4 percent).

30.

6. Inclusion of the current account balance and the level of foreign
assets as potential determinants of the adjustment vis—a—vis the basket

seem to improve both the Spanish and Portuguese results. This is especially true for the stock of foreign assets, which proves to be an im—
-

portant

determinant of the authorities' reaction to third—country exchange

rate movements. Inclusion of these two variables seems to make little
difference in the case of Greece.

These results suggest a general pattern: confronted with inflationary pressures in the mid 1970's from both domestic and foreign origins,
•

the monetary authorities in all three countries attempted to safeguard
.their competitive position internationally through a process of nominal

effective devaluations. These policies produced only a relatively small
real effective exchange rate appreciation in the face of domestic inflation rates which at least in Spain and Portugal exceeded 20 percent by
1977.

Thus by the end of the 1970s these countries found themselves caught
in the classic dilemma associated with exchange—rate policy, namely the

conflict between balance—of—trade and domestic inflation targets. The
econometric evidence,however sparse, seems to suggest that in small open
economies the effects of exchange rate movements on the price ratio of
traded to non—traded goods is higher than the effect on the terms of

trade. The experience of these countries in the l970s and the switch in
policies in the early 1980s seem to substantiate that claim.

31.

Appendix 1: A log—linear trade model with real exchange rates.

In this section a simple partial—equilibrium model is developed that
.provides the framework for the choice of weights for currency baskets or

effective exchange rates. The model is essentially the same as that
developed in Branson—Katseli (B—K, 1981), section IV. There independence
of movements in exchange—rates and price levels was implicitly assumed.

Here the model is developed in terms of real exchange rates. It is a log—
linear supply—and—demand model for exports and imports which Includes the

exchange rate as the translator between home and foreign prices. We begin
with the simple two—country version, and then disaggregate to many countries
and a numeraire.

Movements in aggregate trade prices and quantities.

Let us begin by concentrating on the export side. Export supply prices
are assumed to be stated in home currency units p, while foreign import

demand prices are given in foreign exchange units q. The supply function
is written as
(A.l)

lnp lnp +

11nX

Here p Is a shift parameter representing the domestic cost of production
of exportables and s is the price elasticity of export supply. We assume
that p is also the home—currency cost of production of import substitutes

and non—tradëables. Equation (A.1) gives export supply X as a function

of the relative home—currency supply price p/p. The demand function
giving the foreign currency price of exports is

32.

lnq ].nq + d'lnX.

(A.2)

Rere q is a shift parameter representing the domestic cost of production
of import—competing goods in the foreign country, and export demand depends

Again, we assume that q is also the cost

on the relative price

production of exports in the foreign country.

where domestic costs of production in the various sectors move differently,

see B—K (1981). The exchange rate e links

DisaggregatiOn to many countries.

To disaggregate the model, we consider a world of N + 1 countries,

O,...,N. Country zero is the home country, whose exchange—rate policy we
are analyzing. Country N is the numeraire, arbitrarily chosen. Countries

j (

— L,...,j,...,N

—

1) are the other (non—home, non-numeraire) countries

in the system. The index i runs

across

all countries other than the home

country, including the numeraire, thus i —

j,

N.

The home—country price index p in equation (1) is now p0. The import—
competing price in country i's demand function is q
supply price of country i is

country 0 against country i is

The bilateral exchange rate of the home
in units of currency zero per unit of

currency i. This can be decomposed into the home country price of the
numeraire r, and the numeraire price of the currency i, J:

This is precisely the same as equation (24) in B—K (1981), with slight
.changes in notation.

The analysis there proceeded in terms of nominal

exchange rates. Here we wish to continue in terms of movements in real
exchange rates.

First, let us add and subtract the change in the numeraire's import—
competing price

x0 —

in the second term of (A.9):

kEa(J + r)

+ kEct1(q

Now, remembering that Zc&

hand side into movements in real exchange rates:

(A.lO)

PxO P0 + k(r + 'N —

The first term on the RUS

of

+ kEcx(J + q —

(A.10) is the change in the domestic (zero—

country) export supply price due to changes in domestic cost conditions.

The second term is the change in the home—country real exchange rate against

the numeraire, using export prices. The third term sums the change in the
numeraire's real exchange rate against all countries other than the home
country, including the numeraire (country N), again using demand prices
for exports of the zero country.

Several properties of (A.lO) for

are worth noting:

35.

1. If the home country is small, k — 1 and p0 drops Out of

(A.lO); p depends only on world prices and exchange rates.
2. An increase in the demand price

q

in any one of the j (non—

numeraire, non—home) countries clearly raise p by

—

proportional to j's share in home—country exports. The increase
in

also raises the numeraire's real exchange rate vis—a—vis j.
qj

3. An increase in the demand price in the nuineraire country alone
raises

by

=

symmetrically to all the other countries.

This results from the summation of the third term in (A.l0) across

all i

l,...,N. Thus the formulation in (A.l0) is completely

symmetric across all non—home countries, with the numeraire chosen
arbitrarily.

The disaggregation of the expressions for X, p and H, and their statement in terms of real exchange rates, follow analogously to the development from equation (A.4) for
