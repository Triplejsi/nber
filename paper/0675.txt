In

disutility of that unit. The latter equation is the condition for efficiency
in risk—bearing (BorchTs equation

where one of the two parties is risk neu-

tral).

Next, we can consider the original

problem in the case when utility

4. Intuition and Comparison with Other Results
The discussion above has been quite abstract, yet the intuition behind
the overemployment result is actually very clear.

The diagram below repre-

sents the utility function of workers, increasing to the northwest.

2
The curve u is an indifference curve, and u is a constant marginal utility of

income locus. When leisure is a normal good U must have a smaller slope
(algebraically) than u. Moving northeastward along u, the marginal utility
of income declines.

If u were implemented as the contract we would always have productive

efficiency but U would not be constant. The first—best contract would lie
along u, but if we left it to a profit_maximizing firm to implement ur as
a contract we would have efficiency in risk bearing, but not in production.
The firm would profit maximize by setting marginal product

equal to the slope

of the contract not of the indifference curve. Because of the relationship
between these two slopes, the level of employment is too high under the U
contract.
