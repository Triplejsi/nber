Estimated Output, Price, Interest Rate,
And Exchange Rate Linkages Among Countries

ABSTRACT

This paper provides quantitative estimates of the output, price,
interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among a number of countries.
The econometric model that is used for this purpose is described in
Fair (1981), and the present paper is an extension of this work. The
linkages are examined by changing various policy variables and observing the resulting change in the endogenous variables.

The model is also used to estimate what is called the "exchange
rate effect" on inflation. One of the ways in which monetary and
fiscal policies may affect a country's inflation rate is by first influencing its exchange rate, which in turn influences import prices,
which in turn influences domestic prices. The model allows this
exchange rate effect on inflation to be estimated.
The results in the paper give a good indication of the properties
of the model. The linkages among countries are complicated and there
are few unambiguous effects with respect to sign. This is true not just
in principle but also in fact. Depreciation, for example, increases GNP
for Japan, but decreases it for Germany and the U.K. A spending increase leads to a depreciation in Japan, but to an appreciation in Germany
and the U.K. A spending increase in the U.S. has noticeably different
effects on different countries. The results also show the importance of
price, interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among countries as well
as the usual trade linkages.

ESTIMATED OUTPUT, PRICE, INTEREST RATE,
AND EXCHANGE RATE LINKAGES AMONG COUNTRIES*

by
Ray C. Fair

I. Introduction
This paper provides quantitative estimates of the output, price,

interest rate, and exchange rate linkages among a number of countries.
The econometric model that is used for this purpose is described in Fair

(1981), and the present paper is an extension of this work. The linkages
are examined by changing various policy variables in the model and ob-

serving the resulting changes in the endogenous variables. The results
of ten experiments are reported:

1. An increase in U.S. government spending,

2. Mi increase in the U.S. interest rate,
3. An increase in German government spending,
4, An increase in the German interest rate,
5. A depreciation of the German exchange rate,

6. An increase in U.K. government spending,
7. A depreciation of the U.K. exchange rate,

8. An increase in Japanese government spending,
9. A depreciation of the Japanese exchange rate,
10. An increase in the price of exports of the oil exporting
countries.

*The research described in this paper was financed by Grant S0C77—03274
from the National Science Foundation.

The model is also used to estimate what will be called the "exchange

rate effect" on inflation. One of the ways in which monetary and fiscal
policies may affect a country's inflation rate is by first influencing
its exchange rate, which in turn influences import prices, which in turn

influences domestic prices. This is what is called the exchange rate
effect on inflation. In order to estimate the size of this effect one
needs a model linking monetary and fiscal policies to exchange rates,
exchange rates to import prices, and import prices to domestic prices,

and the present dei provides these links.
A complete list of the equations in the model, including all the

estimated equations, is presented in Fair (1981). The model is reviewed
in Sections II and III of the present paper. If the earlier paper has

been read, these two sections can be skipped. This paper is concerned
only with the flexible exchange rate period, although there is also a
version of the model that pertains to the fixed exchange rate period.
The testing of the model is discussed in the earlier paper, and no men-

tion of this is made here. It perhaps goes without saying that the results
in this paper should be interpreted with caution. It is hoped that they
provide some insights into the qualitative and quantitative linkages among
countries, but further tests of themodel are needed before the results

can be considered anything other than preliminary. The results are based
solely on estimated equations and definitions: no adjustments to any
of the estimated equations have been made.

All exchange rates are in units of local currency per U.S. dollar.
This means that an increase in a country's exchange rate is a deprecia-

tion. When the phrase "depreciation of the exchange rate" is used in
this paper, this refers to an increase in the exchange rate (and vice

versa for appreciation). "Dollar" always refers to the U.S. dollar.

II. A Review of the Model
The model is quarterly and contains estimated equations for 44 coun-

tries. Most of the equations have been estimated by two stage least
squares. The basic estimation period is 19581—19801 (89 observations).
For equations that are relevant only when exchange rates are flexible,

the basic estimation period is 197211—19801 (32 observations). The trade
matrix contains data for 64 countries. The list of countries is presented
in Table A—i in the Appendix. The U.S. part of the model is the model
described in Fair (1976, 1980).

The model differs from previous models in a number of ways.
(1) Linkages among countries with respect to exchange rates, interest

rates, and prices appear to be more important in the model than they are
in previous models.

(2) There is no natural distinction in the model

between stock—market and flow—market determination of the exchange rate,

a distinction that is important in recent discussions of the monetary

approach to the balance of payments.1 (3) The number of countries is
larger than usual, and the data are all quarterly. Considerable work
has gone into the construction of quarterly data bases for all the coun-

tries. (4) I alone have estimated small models for each country and then
linked them together, rather than, as Project LINK2

has

done, take models

developed by others and link them together. The advantage of the LINK
approach is that larger models for each country can be used. The advantage of the present approach is that the person constructing the individual
models knows from the beginning that they are to be linked together, and

1See, for example, Frenkel and Johnson (1976), Dornbusch (1976), Frenkel
and Rodriguez (1975), and Kouri (1976).
2See Ball (1973) and Hickman (1974).

4

this may lead to better specification of the linkages. It is unlikely,
for example, that the specification of the exchange rate and interest
rate linkages in the present model would develop from the LINK approach.

Whether this possible gain in the linkage specification outweighs the
loss of having to deal with small models of each country is an open
question.

The basic theoretical model that has guided the empirical work is

discussed in Fair (1974). Individual agents in this model derive their
decisions from the solutions of multiperiod maximization problems. These
problems require that agents form expectations of the future values of

a number of variables. Even though the model is deterministic, agents
make expectations errors. They do not know the complete model and must
form their expectations on the basis of a limited set of information

(usually only the past history of a few variables). These expectations
errors lead at times to "disequilibrium" in the labor, goods, and financial markets, and much of the modeling is concerned with the effects of

disequilibrium. Another important feature of the modeling is making sure
that all flows of funds among the agents are accounted for. A two—country
version of this model is presented in Fair (1979). The idea for this
version came from considering how one would link the single—country model

to a model just like it. Stock and flow effects are completely integrated
in this model because of the accounting for all flows of funds. This is
the reason there is no natural distinction between stock—market and f low—
market determination of the exchange rate.

There are a number of versions of the two—country model. The version
that was used as a basis for the empirical work is the one in which the
bonds of the two countries are perfect substitutes, the short term interest

5

rates of the countries and the exchange rate are determined by reaction

functions, and the forward exchange rate is "passive." Whether this
choice, which was partly dictated by data availability, provides an adequate basis for constructing an empirical model is an open question.

No direct tests of the assumptions behind this choice have been attempted.
The choice has been indirectly tested by examining how well the model
explains the historical data.

Let R denote country l's interest rate, r country 2's interest
rate, e the exchange rate (the price of country 2's currency in terms

of country l's currency), and F the forward rate. The covered interest
rate from country l's perspective on the bond of country 2, say r'

is (e/F)(l+r) .

If

for R =

r'

people are indifferent as to which bond

they hold, then the bonds are defined to be perfect substitutes. In this

case arbitrage will insure that R

r' ,

and so one of the equations

in the model is:

(1)

R =

(e/F)(l+r)

Write the reaction functions as:

(2)

R =

f2(...)

(3)

r =

f3(.

(4)

e =

f4(...)

.

.) ,

where the arguments in the functions are variables that affect the monetary
authorities' decisions regarding the interest rates and the exchange rate.
The assumption that is most questionable in the choice of this version

is probably the assumption that e is determined by a reaction function.

6

The alternative assumption is that e is implicitly determined in the
model, with reserves taken to be exogenous. In practice there is obviously some intervention of the monetary authorities in the exchange

markets, and so this alternative assumption is also questionable. The

assumption that e is determined by a reaction function may not be, however, as restrictive as it first sounds. The monetary authorities are

likely to be aware of the market forces that are operating on e in the
absence of intervention, and they may take these into account in setting

their target each period. If some of the explanatory variables in the
reaction function are in part measures of these forces, then the estimated

reaction function may provide a better explanation of e than one would
otherwise have thought. Similar arguments apply to the assumption that

R and r are determined by reaction functions.
The assumption that F is passive means that it is determined by

equation (1): given R ,

r

,

and

e ,

F

merely adjusts to insure

that the arbitrage condition holds. In this case the forward market imposes no "discipline" on the monetary authorities' choice of the exchange

rate. Again, however, if the monetary authorities take into account

market forces in the forward market operating on e and

if

the explana-

tory variables in the reaction function for e are in part measures of
these forces, then the estimated reaction function for e may not be too

bad an approximation. Given the assumption that F is passive and given
that F does not appear as an explanatory variable in any of the equa-

tions, F plays no role in the empirical model. For each country it
is determined by an estimated version of the arbitrage condition, but
the predictions from these equations have no effect on the predictions
of any of the other variables in the model.

7

The U.S. model is much larger than the models for the other countries.
The two key exogenous foreign sector variables are the import price de-

flator and the real value of exports. When the U.S. model is embedded
in the overall model, these two variables become endogenous. Since the
U.S. model is discussed in detail elsewhere, it will not be discussed

here. All

only to the non U.S. part of the model.

There are up to 11 estimated equations per country in the econometric

model. These equations and their explanatory variables are as follows.

Many of the variables are on a per capita basis. A "b" after an equation
number denotes that the equation was estimated only over observations

in the flexible exchange rate period. Unless otherwise noted, "lagged"
means lagged one quarter. Explanatory variables were dropped from the
equations if they had coefficient estimates of the wrong expected sign.

Both current and one—quarter lagged values were generally tried for the
explanatory price and interest rate variables, and the values that gave

the best results were used. Similarly, both the short—term and long—term
interest rate variables were tried, and the variable that gave the best

results was used. Data limitations prevented all the equations from being
estimated for all countries and also required that shorter sample periods
from the basic period be used for many countries.

Lagged dependent variables were used extensively to try to account

for expectational and lagged adjustment effects. This procedure is consistent with the treatment of expectations in the theoretical model, where
expectations are assumed to be formed on the basis of a limited set of

information. All

the

equations except lOb and 11 were estimated with

9

a constant and three seasonal dummy variables. A time trend was also
included in a number of the equations. In most cases the functional form
chosen was the log form. The demand pressure variable is a nonlinear
function of GNP.

The specification of the equations is generally consistent with the

theoretical model. An exception to this is the specification of the consumption function, where income (GNP) is used as an explanatory variable.
If a household is choosing consumption and labor supply to maximize utility,

then income is not the appropriate variable to use. This procedure can
be justified if households are always constrained in their labor supply

decision, and this is what must be assumed here. Also, the investment
equation is missing a variable that plays an important role in the theoretical model and in the U.S. model, namely, the amount of "excess" capital

on hand. The transition from the theoretical model to the U.S. model is
discussed in Fair (1976), and this Is a useful reference for the current
transition as well.

Equation 7b is the interest rate reaction function, and equation

9b is the exchange rate reaction function. Although not noted above,
the U.S. and German short term interest rates are explanatory variables

in a few of the interest rate reaction functions. Also, the German exchange rate is an explanatory variable in the exchange rate reaction
functions of the other European countries.

There are 9 definitions per country. The four most important are:
(1) Final sales equals consumption plus investment plus government spend-

ing plus exports minus imports, (2) inventory investment equals GNP minus
final sales, (3) the balance of payments equals the price of exports times
exports minus the price of imports times imports plus net transfer pay—

10

ments, and (4) net foreign assets equals net foreign assets of the previous period plus the balance of payments (i.e., the change in net
foreign assets equals the balance of payments).

III. Some Ceteris Paribus Effects in the Model
It is possible to get some idea of the properties of the model without

performing simulation experiments. In what follows a variable is said
to have a "direct" effect on another variable if it appears on the right
hand side of the equation (either a stochastic equation or a definition)

explaining the other variable. Most endogenous variables have at least
an indirect effect on the other endogenous variables——either contempor-

aneously or with a lag of one quarter. Because of this, it is difficult
to explain the properties of the model in a very systematic way. The
following discussion is designed to try to give a general idea of the

properties without going into every possible indirect effect. It should
also be kept in mind that not all of the effects operate for all countries.
All interest rates referred to are short term rates unless otherwise noted.

Trade Effects Among Countries
There is a standard trade multiplier effect in the model. An auton-

omous increase in GNP in country i increases the demand for imports,
which increases the exports of other countries and thus their GNP and

demand for imports, which then increases the exports of country i and
thus its GNP. In short, exports affect imports and vice versa.
Price Effects Among Countries

There is also a price multiplier effect in the model. An autonomous

increase in country i's domestic price level increases its export prices,
which increases the import prices of other countries, which increases

11

their domestic prices, including their export prices, which then increases

country i's import prices and thus its domestic and export prices.
In short, export prices affect import prices and vice versa.

Direct Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Effects Among Countries
As noted above, the U.S. and German short term interest rates appear
as explanatory variables in the interest rate reaction functions of a

few countries. The U.S. and German interest rates thus directly affect

these other countries' rates. The German exchange rate appears as an
explanatory variable in the exchange rate reaction functions of the other
European countries, and so it directly affects the other rates.
Direct Effects Within a Country
The short term interest rate directly affects the long term rate

in the term structure equation (equation 8). The short term or long term
rate has a direct negative effect on imports and consumption (equations
1 and 2) and a direct positive effect on the GNP deflator (equation 5).
The short term rate has a direct negative effect on the demand for money
and the exchange rate (equations 6 and 9b).

(Remember that an increase

in the exchange rate is a depreciation of the country's currency.)

The asset variable, which is the sum of past values of the balance
of payments and is a measure of the net asset position of the country
vis—a—vis the rest of the world, has a direct positive effect on imports
and consumption (equations 1 and 2) and a direct negative effect on the
short term interest rate and the exchange rate (equations 7b and 9b).
The exchange rate has a direct positive effect on the local currency
price of exports (equation 11) and on the local currency price of imports

(the equations involved in linking export and import prices). It also
has a direct negative effect on the dollar price of exports (because the

12

coefficient estimate of the exchange rate in equation 11, which is in

log form, is less than one). It has a direct positive effect on the short
term interest rate for three countries (equation 7b).

The price of imports has a direct negative effect on imports (equation 1), a direct positive effect on the GNP deflator (equation 5), a
direct negative effect on the asset variable (the balance of payments
definition), and a direct positive effect on the short term interest rate

for four countries (equation 7b). The price of exports has a direct positive effect on the asset variable (balance of payments definition). The
GNP deflator has direct positive effects on imports, the demand for money,
the short term and long term interest rates, the exchange rate, and the
price of exports (equations 1, 6, 7b, 8, 9b, and 11).

The level of imports has a direct negative effect on final sales
and the asset variable, and the level of exports has a direct positive
effect on these two variables (the final sales definition and the balance

of payments definition). The level of final sales has a direct positive
effect on GNP (equation 4). Any deviation of GNP from final sales in
a period is absorbed by a change in inventories (inventory definition).
The stock of inventories has a direct negative effect on GNP (equation 4).
GNP or the demand pressure variable has a direct positive effect
on imports, consumption, investment, the CNP deflator, the demand for
money, the short term interest rate, and the exchange rate.

Some Indirect Effects Within a Coun
It should be clear that there are very few unambiguous indirect effects

in the model with respect to sign. The signs depend on the relative sizes
of the coefficient estimates. It is useful, however, to consider the
likely signs of some indirect effects, even though these signs are not
necessarily logical consequences of the model.

13

Consider first the indirect effect of the exchange rate on GNP.
The main direct effect of the exchange rate is on the price of imports,

at least in the short run. The price of imports has a direct negative
effect on imports, and the level of imports has a direct positive effect
on GNP. In other words, an increase in the price of imports causes sub-stitution from imports to domestically produced goods, which raises GNP.

The exchange rate thus has an indirect positive effect on GNP through
this channel (i.e., depreciation increases GNP).

Depreciation also lowers the dollar price of exports, which lowers
the import price indices of countries that import from the given country,
which in turn increases the demand for the given country's exports.
Therefore, depreciation also increases GNP through this channel.

Depreciation is likely to have a negative indirect effect on GNP

through a third channel. The likely initial effect of a depreciation
on the balance of payments is negative. Depreciation raises the local
currency price of imports more than it does the local currency price of
exports, which, other things being equal, has a negative effect on the

balance of payments. Depreciation also lowers imports and raises exports,

which has a positive effect on the balance of payments. This latter effect
is, however, likely to be smaller initially than the price effect, and
so the initial net effect is likely to be negative. (This is, of course,
the "

J

curve" effect.) A decrease in the balance of payments decreases

net foreign assets, which directly decreases imports and consumption and

directly increases the short term interest rate. Although the decrease
in imports raises GNP, the decrease in consumption and the increase in
the interest rate lower GNP, and the net effect is likely to be negative.
Depreciation is thus likely to have an initial indirect negative effect

14

on GNP through this "assetT' effect channel.

Depreciation has two main indirect effects on the GNP deflator, one

positive and one ambiguous. The positive effect is through the price of
imports, which has a direct positive effect on the GNP deflator. The
second effect is through GNP. If the net effect of depreciation on GNP
is positive, this will have a positive effect on the GNP deflator through
the direct positive effect of the demand pressure variable on the GNP

deflator. If the net effect of depreciation on GNP is negative, the indirect effect on the GNP deflator is negative.

There are three main effects of the short term interest rate on GNP,

one negative, one ambiguous, and one positive. The negative effect is
through consumption. An increase in the short term rate increases the

long term rate. An increase in the short term rate or the long term rate
decreases consumption, which lowers GNP. The ambiguous effect is through
the exchange rate. An increase in the short term rate has a negative
effect on the exchange rate (an appreciation), which has an ambiguous

effect on GNP. The positive effect is through imports. An increase in
the short term or long term rate lowers imports, which, other things being

equal, raises GNP. The consumption effect is likely to be the dominant
one, and so the net effect of the short term rate on GNP is likely to
be negative.

An increase in the short term interest rate has three main effects

on the GNP deflator, one positive and two negative. The positive effect
is a direct one: the short term or long term rate appears as an explanatory variable in the price equation (equation 5). The first negative
effect is the likely negative indirect effect of the short term rate on
GNP

and

thus on the demand pressure variable. The other negative effect

15

is the effect on the exchange rate: the exchange rate appreciates, which
lowers the price of imports, which lowers the GNP deflator.

IV. The Results of the Experiments
The results of the experiments are presented in Tables 1 through

10. The experiments were performed as follows. The estimated residuals
were first added to the stochastic equations and treated as exogenous.
This means that when the model is simulated using the actual values of

the exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution is obtained. Each
experiment corresponds to changing one or more exogenous variables and

running a dynamic simulation. The effect of this change on an endogenous
variable is the difference between the predicted value of the variable

from this simulation and the actual value. All experiments were for the
19761—1977IV period.
All

of

3

the 44 countries for which there are estimated equations were

used for the experiments. The results for 15 countries and 13 variables
per country are presented in the tables for the two—quarter—ahead and

six—quarter—ahead predictions. Except for the numbers for the balance
of payments, each number in the tables is the percentage change in the

variable (in percentage points) divided by something. For the spending
increases (Tables 1, 3, 6, and 9) the divisor is the change in government

spending as a percentage of GNP (in percentage points).4 Each number

is

y. after the
and

16

in these tables is thus the percentage change in the variable induced by
a one percent autonomous increase in GNP of the country in which the policy

change was made. For the interest rate increases (Tables 2 and 4) the
divisor is the change in the interest rate (in percentage points). The
actual change in the interest rates for the experiments was 2.0 percentage

points, and so the divisor was 2.0. Each number in these tables is thus
the percentage change in the variable induced by a 1.0 percentage point

increase in the interest rate. For the exchange rate increases (Tables
5, 7, and 9) the percentage change in the exchange rates was 10.0 percent
and

the

divisor was 1.0. Each number in these tables is thus the percentage

change in the variable induced by a 10.0 percent increase in the exchange

rate. Finally, for the increase in the export prices (Table 10) the percentage change in the prices was 50.0 percent and the divisor was 1.0.
Each number in this table is thus the percentage change in the variable
induced by a 50.0 percent increase in the export prices.
The numbers for the balance of payments are not in percentage terms

and have not been divided by anything. They are merely the actual changes
in the balance of payments corresponding to whatever policy change was

made. The balance of payments variables are in units of nominal local
currency, and so it is not readily apparent from the tables how one country's

balance of payments changed relative to another's. For the most part it
is unnecessary to know this to understand the rest of the results. When
it is necessary, the relative change will be mentioned in the text. The
main interest in the balance of payments results for a country is the
sign of the changes.

The following discussion of the results is somewhat loose. Reference
is sometimes made to a change in one endogenous variable "leading to"

17

or "resulting in" a change in another endogenous variable. This is not,
strictly speaking, correct because the model is simultaneous, but it does

help give a general idea of the model's properties. Not all results in
the tables are explained, and not every possible indirect effect is noted.

Emphasis is placed on the main results and effects and, as the discussion
progresses, on the results in a table that are different from the results

in previous tables. In what follows "GNP" and "income" are used interchangeably, interest rates are always short term interest rates unless
otherwise noted, and import and export prices are local currency prices
unless otherwise noted.

U.S. Spending Increase (Table
The results of an increase in U.S. government spending on U.S. goods

are presented in Table 1. The increase in spending increased U.S. income,
which in turn increased U.S. imports. This increased other countries'
exports, which in turn increased their income and imports. This is the
trade multiplier effect. The increase in U.S. income and prices led to
an increase in U.S. interest rate through the U.S. interest rate reaction

function. This offset some of the increase in U.S. income that would
otherwise have occurred. It also led to an increase in some of the other
countries' interest rates, which in turn offset some of the increase in
their income that would otherwise have occurred from the pure trade multiplier effect.

There are four main effects of the U.S. spending increase on the

exchange rates, three negative and one positive. The spending increase
raised U.S. output and prices relative to those of the other countries,

This experiment is also discussed in Fair (1981), and the present
discussion can be skipped if the earlier paper has been read.

both of which have a negative effect on other countries' exchange rates

(an appreciation). The U.S. balance of payments fell relative to those
of the other countries (the balance of payments of other countries generally rose), and this also has a negative effect on exchange rates.

The positive effect is the interest rate effect. The U.S. short term
interest rate rose relative to other countries' rates, and this has a

positive effect on exchange rates (a depreciation). As can be seen in
Table 1, the net effect can go either way. For some countries, such as
Germany, there is a depreciation after two quarters (the interest rate
effect dominating) and then an appreciation after six quarters.

The changes in import prices are negative for countries whose exchange

rate appreciated. For most of these countries the fall in import prices
led to a fall in the GNP deflator. In other words, the U.S. expansion
generally led to a fall in inflation rates in those countries whose ex-

change rates appreciated. This exchange rate effect on inflation (through
import prices) tends to dominate the pure price multiplier effect that
would exist if exchange rates were fixed.

The balance of payments fell for some countries. If a country's
exchange rate depreciates in response to the U.S. expansion (the interest

rate effect dominating), then, as noted above, the initial effect on the

balance of payments is likely 'to be negative (the J curve effect).
The results at the bottom of Table 1 are for the U.S. model alone.

In this case the rest of the world is exogenous. The results show that
the properties of the U.S. model are not very sensitive to the treatment

of the rest of the world. The increase in the GNP deflator is somewhat
less in this case, which is due to the fact that U.S. import prices did

not rise. In the complete model U.S. import prices rose because of the
general depreciation of the U.S. dollar.

20

U.S. Interest Rate Increase (Table 2)

For this experiment the U.S. interest rate reaction function is dropped

and the U.S. interest rate is taken to be exogenous. The results of an
increase in the U.S. interest rate are presented in Table 2. This increase
lowered U.S. income and imports and led to a general contraction in world
income and exports (trade multiplier effect).

The interest rate increase also led to a depreciation of the other

countries' exchange rates. The depreciation of the German exchange rate
after six quarters, for example, was 4.5 percent. This depreciation was
also due in part to the increase in the U.S. balance of payments relative

to those of other countries. This depreciation led to an increase in other
countries' import prices and then to the GNP deflators. The U.S. interest
rate increase thus led to a general increase in other countries' infla-

tion rates through the depreciation of their exchange rates. The U.S.
inflation rate was little changed: the positive direct effect of interest
rates on inflation was offset by the negative effects on inflation from
the fall in U.S. import prices (due to the appreciation of the dollar)
and the fall in U.S. income.

The balance of payments of some countries (other than the U.S.) in-

creased. In these cases the change in export revenue (exports price
times exports) was greater than the change in import costs (import price

times imports). In all cases export prices rose and exports fell, and
in almost all cases import prices rose and imports fell.

The results at the bottom of Table 2 for the U.S. alone again show
that the properties of the U.S. model are not very sensitive to the treat-

ment of the rest of the world. The increase in the GNP deflator is greater
in this case because import prices did not fall.

German Spending Increase (Table 3)

This experiment is an increase in German government spending on German

goods. As in the U.S. case, it led to a worldwide increase in exports
and income. The increase in income led to a fairly large increase in the
GNP deflator after six quarters (1.96 percent). This increase and the
increase in income led to a large increase in the interest rate through

the reaction function (3.17 percentage points after six quarters). The
negative interest rate effect on the exchange was larger than the positive
price and balance of payments effects in that the German exchange rate

appreciated. The German exchange rate has a positive effect on the exchange rates of the other European countries, and this resulted in an

appreciation of the other European rates. For a few countries, such as
Italy, the appreciation resulted in a fall in the GNP deflator (through
the fall in import prices).

German Interest Rate Increase (Table 4)

For this experiment the German interest rate reaction function was

dropped and the German interest rate was taken to be exogenous. The re—
suits of an increase in the German rate are presented in Table 4. This
increase lowered German income and imports and led to a general contraction in world exports and income.

The relative increase in the German interest rate and balance of
payments led to an appreciation of the mark, which led to an appreciation

of the other Eueopean currencies. The price deflator of Germany and of
most of the other European countries was lower because of the appreciation
and of the fall in income.

German Exchange Rate Increase (Table 5)

For this experiment the German exchange rate reaction function was

dropped and the German exchange rate was taken to be exogenous. The re—
suits in Table 5 are for an increase in the exchange rate of ten percent
(a depreciation).

It was argued above that the initial effect of a depreciation on
the balance of payments is likely to be negative, and this is the case
in Table 5, even after six quarters. The depreciation also led to a de-

crease in GNP. As noted above, the effect of a depreciation on GNP can
go either way. In this case the negative effect from the fall in the
balance of paynients (the asset effect) and the negative effect from the
rise in the interest rate dominated. (The rise in the interest rate was due in
part to the increase in the rate of inflation that resulted from the depreciation.)

The depreciation of the German exchange rate led to a decrease in

the U.S. GNP deflator and an increase in U.S. GNP. The decrease in the
deflator was due to the fall in the U.S. price of imports, which was due

to the general appreciation of the dollar. The increase in GNP was due
in part to the increase in assets from the increase in the balance of
payments and in part to the fall in the interest rate from the fall in
the rate of inflation.

U.K. Spending Increase (Table6)
This experiment is an increase in U.K. government spending on U.K.

goods. In the German case in Table 3 the increase in spending led to an
appreciation of the mark because of the large relative increase in the

German interest rate. In the U.K. case in Table 6 the increase in spending

led to a depreciation of the pound. The U.K. interest rate did rise in
response to the U.K. expansion, but the negative interest rate effect on

the exchange rate was dominated by the positive price and balance of payments effects.
The other European exchange rates appreciated relative to the dollar,

although only slightly. This is due primarily to the balance of payments
effect on the exchange rate. The European countries benefited more from
the U.K. expansion than did the U.S. with respect to the increase in exports, and so their balance of payments improved more.
U.K. Exchange Rate Increase (Table 7)

For this experiment the U.K. exchange rate reaction function was

dropped and the U.K. exchange rate was taken to be exogenous. The results
in Table 7 are for an increase in the exchange rate of ten percent (a depreciation).

As in the German case, the depreciation led to a fall in GNP. Unlike in the German case, the effects on the other European exchange rates

were slight. The depreciation led, as in the German case, to a decrease
in the U.S. GNP deflator and an increase in U.S. GNP, although the effects
in the U.K. case were smaller.

Japanese Spending Increase (Table 8)

This experiment is an increase in Japanese government spending on

Japanese goods. The interesting result in this case is that the increase
had only a small effect on the rest of the world. The increase in Japanese
imports was fairly small, and so there was a small trade multiplier effect.
The increase in imports was small in part because of the increase in the

price of Japanese imports relative to the GNP deflator. This led to a
substitution away from imported goods. The increase in the price of imports was due to the depreciation of the yen. Unlike in the German and
U.K. cases, the exchange rate depreciated in response to the expansion:

in this case the positive balance of payments effect dominated.
Japanese Exchange Rate Increase (Table 9)

For this experiment the Japanese exchange rate reaction function
was dropped and the Japanese exchange rate was taken to be exogenous.

The results in Table 9 are for an increase in the exchange rate of ten
percent (a depreciation).

In this case, unlike in the German and U.K. cases, the depreciation

led to an increase in GNP. The dominant effect on GNP in the Japanese
case was the substitution away from imported goods due to the increase

in the price of imports relative to the GNP deflator. Japan is the only
main country in the model for which the import price index is not an explanatory variable in the equation for the GNP deflator (equation 5).

No effects of import prices on domestic prices could be found in the

Japanese case. ii Increase in the price of imports in Japan thus corresponds to a larger increase in the relative price of imports than is the

case in other countries. This is the main reason for the larger Japanese
substitution response.

The effect on the Japanese balance of payments was initially negative,

as expected, but by six quarters the effect was positive. This is also
due primarily to the Japanese substitution away from imported goods.

The depreciation led, as In the German and U.K. cases, to a decrease
in the U.S. GNP deflator and an increase in U.S. GNP, although the effects
on GNP were very small.

TABLE

33

Increase in the Price of Exports of the Oil Exporting Countries
(Table 10)

The oil exporting countries in the model are Algeria, Indonesia,

Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,

and Venezuela. The price of exports is exogenous for these countries.
The experiment corresponded to a 50 percent increase in the price of exports of all these countries.

Different countries were affected quite differently in this experi-

ment. The exchange rates of all countries except Japan appreciated relative

to the dollar, This is due in large part to the generally larger decrease
in the U.S. balance of payments relative to the decreases for the other

countries. The price of imports rose for most countries, as expected,
although part of the increase that would otherwise have occurred was offset

by the appreciation of the exchange rates. The increase in import prices
led to an increase in the GNP deflators, and so there was a general worldwide increase in inflation,

GNP fell for many countries. This was due in part to the increase
in the interest rate in many countries (because of the increase in inflation and the decrease in the balance of payments) and in part to the decrease
in net foreign assets (because of the decrease in the balance of payments).
There was, in other words, both a negative interest rate effect and a

negative asset effect on CNP. Imports fell for all countries because of
the increase in the price of imports relative to the GNP deflator. For
some countries this substitution effect was large enough to lead to an
increase in GNP.

Although not shown in the table, the balance of payments of the oil

exporting countries rose substantially, as expected. This increase in

net foreign assets then led to an increase in imports of the countries
for which there are import equations (Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia,

and Venezuela). In some cases these increases were quite large. The
six—quarter—ahead increases for Iran, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia, for ex-

ample, were 28.6, 27.6 and 56.9 percent, respectively. These increases
were not, of course, large enough to offset completely the increases in
the balance of payments of these countries (and thus the decreases in the
balance of payments of the oil importing countries).

V. Estimates of the Exchange Rate Effect on Inflation (Table 11)
Exchange rates have an effect on domestic inflation in the model through

their effects on import prices. The 10.0 percent depreciation of the mark
in Table 5 resulted in an increase in the German GNP deflator of 0.95 per-

cent after six quarters. For the U.K. results in Table 5 the increase
was 2.02 percent. In the case of Japan, as noted above, the price of
imports does not directly affect the GNP deflator, and so for the Japanese
results in Table 7 there was little change in the GNP deflator.
The question considered in this section is how much of the change
in inflation that results from a monetary or fiscal policy change can be

attributed to the change in the exchange rate that results from the policy

change. Estimates of this exchange rate effect on inflation are presented

in Table 11. The results in the a rows are from the experiments discussed
in the previous section. The results for all eight quarters of the prediction period are presented in Table 11 for the particular variables.

For the results in the b rows the same experiments were performed except
that all exchange rates were taken to be exogenous. Exchange rates, in
other words, were assumed to be fixed. The difference in the two rows

rate effect on inflation for the quarter. The differences are presented

in the c rows.
The estimates in Table 11 vary considerably across countries. Consider, for example, the effect of the spending increases after 8 quarters

and consider the ratio of the c—row value to the a—row value. This ratio
is .19 for the U.s. (.131.69), —.02 for Germany (—.05/2.70), .59 for the

U.K. (.55/.93), and .10 for Japan (.02/.20). The effect for the U.K. is
large because the pound depreciated more than did the mark and the yen.
The mark, as noted in the previous section, actually appreciated for the

first six quarters. The initial sign of the exchange rate effect for
Germany is thus negative (although the size of the effect is small).

The size of the effect for Japan is small because of the lack of a direct
effect of import prices on domestic prices.

The exchange rate effect for the interest rate increases is much

larger. All of the fall of the GNP deflator for Germany is attributed

to the exchange rate effect. When exchange rates are exogenous, there
is essentially no effect on the GNP deflator of the German interest rate
increase, whereas when exchange rates are endogenous, the effect after

eight quarters is —.68 percentage points. For the U.S. the effect after
eight quarters is .18 in the exogenous case and —.06 in the endogenous
case, for a difference of —.24.

VI. Conclusion
The results in this paper give a fairly good indication of the prop-

erties of the model. It is clear that the linkages among Countries are
complicated and that there are few unambiguous effects with respect to

sign. This is true not just in principle but also in fact. Depreciation,

38

for example, increases GNP for Japan, but decreases it for Germany and

the U.K. (Tables 5, 7, and 9). Also, a spending increase leads to a de—
predation in Japan, but to an appreciation in Germany and the U.K.
(Tables 3, 6, and 8). A spending increase in the U.S. has noticeably
different effects on different countries (Table 1).
The results also show the importance of the price, interest rate,

and exchange rate linkages among countries as well as the usual trade

and output linkages. They thus suggest that models that are primarily
trade linkage models are not likely to be very realistic.
