1. Introduction

A striking feature of the recent experience with flexible exchange
rates has been the widely-observed

sensitivity of nominal wages and national

price levels to exchange-rate fluctuations.1 The close link between the exchange rate and domestic prices, operating through both demand-side substitu—
tion between home and tradable goods and

through resistance in the labor

market to real wage cuts, has helped undermine early beliefs--as expressed,
for example, by Johnson {22]--that a regime of market-determined exchange

rates can enhance the efficacy of

monetary policy as a stabilization tool

while ensuring balance-of-payments equilibrium.2
discussion has centered on the possibility that

Indeed, much recent policy

freely floating exchange rates

may be inherently unstable. This "vicious circle" view of the current arrangements holds that inflationary asset-market disturbances

entail short-term ex-

change-rate movements which feed into domestic price levels and may set off
successive, explosive rounds of wage-price inflation and further exchangerate depreciation.,3 The concern is reflected in the emphasis on exchangerate surveillance in the revised Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund, in the adoption of informal exchange-rate
tral banks, and in the emergence of more formal

targets by most cen-

arrangements to limit the

degree of exchange-rate flexibility, such as the European Monetary System.4

This paper studies the effects of monetary policy in a small, open
economy with a floating exchange rate, sticky wages, and rational expecta-

tions in both asset and labor markets. The model
the link between exchange-rate depreciation and

developed here emphasizes

nominal wage inflation,

embodying it in an expectations-augmented Phillips curve. The institutional

2

assumption made below is that an economy-wide nominal wage is determined in
advance of the period in which it is to prevail, with workers agreeing to
supply all the labor required by employers during this period.5 Expected
real wages rise gradually over time whenever the demand for labor by firms
persistently exceeds a fixed natural level of labor supply, and decline over

time in the opposite situation. For the sake of analytical simplicity, the
analysis below is carried out in continuous time. The assumption that the
nominal wage is a predetermined variable that cannot jump instantaneously
but must adjust gradually provides a rough approximation to the set of wage-

setting arrangements described above. The model may be interpreted as one
in which unions and firms interact to reverse the real-wage changes induced
by unanticipated price fluctuations through successive wage bargains that

push the real wage toward the level equating aggregate labor demand to fullemployment labor supply.6
The interplay between various wage rigidities and the effects of monetary policy has been studied by Argy and Salop [1], Bilson [3], Burgstaller
[9], and Sachs [30] in models based on the classic Mundell-Fleming framework

of a single domestically-produced good with endogenously-determined terms of

trade.7 The economy studied in this paper comprises sectors producing both
traded and non-traded goods, and thus provides a framework in which to explore
the relationship between patterns of aggregate dynamics and the underlying
supply structure and degree of openness of the economy.8 Of particular inter-

est are the model's predictions concerning the effects of monetary policy on
the real exchange rate (defined as the domestic-currency price of foreign ex-

change deflated by the general price level),9 on the domestic real interest
rate (defined as the domestic nominal interest rate minus the expected instant-

aneous percentage rate of increase of the general price level), and
nominal interest rate itself. While

[26], have ascribed

variables, in part, to speed-of_adjustment

domestic goods markets,1° the approach fol-

lowed here allows goods prices

to adjust instantaneously to clear output
markets. The temporary real effects of money and the dynamics of
adjustment are consequences of the
wage-setting process, which responds only over
time to labor-market
pressures and inflationary expectations.
The organization of the paper is as follows.
Section 2 presents a model of

goods only. The price level in this

on output through its impact on the real

wage, but can influence neither the real

exchange rate nor the real inter-

est rate, which are exogenously determined.
The model is made more realistic in Section 3 through the
explicit
introduction of non-traded or home goods that are regarded by
consumers as
imperfect substitutes for goods

entering international trade. This modifi-

cation weakens the link between the

general price level- -defined as a geo-

metric average of the absolute prices of tradables and non-tradables__and
the exchange rate.

Accordingly, it enhances the ability of

monetary policy

4

to influence real economic variables.

Section 4 uses this extended model to study the effects of an unexpected, one-time increase in the money stock. A key determinant of the
economy's response is the relative magnitude of the output-wage elasticities

of supply in the economy's two sectors. When the supply elasticity in the
home-goods sector is smaller than that in the traded-goods sector, an increase in money causes a rise in the real interest rate and an appreciation
of the real exchange rate, both of which are

reversed over time as the real

wage is restored to its long-run eauilibrium level. When the ranking of
supply elasticities is reversed, monetary expansion has the opposite effects
on the real interest rate and exchange rate. In

the

latter case, also, the

exchange rate may, but need not, overshoot its long-run level in the short

run. The exchange rate may thus exhibit the type

of volatility studied by

overshoots in this
DornbusCh {12]. The likelihood that the exchange rate

case is greater the lower the substitutabilitY between home and traded goods,
but need not increase with the share of non-traded goods in national output.
There is thus no simple relation, in the framework explored below, between
the degree of openness of the economy and exchange-rate volatility.
Section 5 investigates the effects of monetary disturbances that are

anticipated in advance. The real effects of such disturbances are seen to
disappear only when they are anticipated

infinitely far in advance.12 In

addition, the belief that arnonetary expansion

will occur at some time in the

future is likely to set off a period of explosive exchange-rate depreciation
and wage-price inflation that corresponds well to the picture of the "vicious
circle" emerging from policy discussions. The increase in money, when it occurs,

inputs.13 Demand for labor is determined

by the equality of the output-wage and the marginal physical product of labor.
On the assumption that the available

stock of capital is fixed and always

fully employed, the home country's output

level, y, can be expressed as a de-

creasing function of the ratio W/Q, where W is the nominal wage and Q the

domestic price level:

y =

y(W/Q), y' < 0.

corresponding to the output-supply schedule is the labor-demand schedule,

n =

n(W/Q), n' < 0.

Domestic residents divide their wealth among domestic money, domestic interest-

bonds4 All non-money
bearing assets (bonds and capital), and foreign-currency
assets are viewed by wealth owners as perfect

substitutes; their common nominal

rate of return in terms of domestic currency is denoted by R.

The demand for

real money balances is an increasing function of domestic output and a decreasing

function of R. Letting M denote the nominal money supply, asset-market equilibrium

may be written as

M/Q =

L(y,R), L > 0,

0.
(3)

The nominal exchange rate, E, is the price of foreign
money in terms of

domestic money. As the economy is small with respect to the international
markets for both goods and assets, it can influence neither the

foreign_currency

price of its output, Q*, nor the

nominal foreign bond rate, R*, both of which
are assumed to be fixed. The domestic
price level is related to Q* by the

(7)

Equation (7), in turn, can be written as a differential equation in E,

(8)

LIE = E(E,W,M).

An increase in E, given W and M, raises output, leading to excess
demand for real balances in the absence of a rise in LIE.

Similarly, as in-

crease in W or M must be accompanied by a fall in EIE in order that (7) continue

to hold. It follows that

Unlike the exchange rate, the nominal wage, W, is assumed to be a predetermined variable that cannot jump instantaneously but must adjust to dis-

turbances over time. Firms can always hire the amount of labor they desire
at the prevailing nominal wage. But there exists a "natural" level of employment, n, having the property that the expected real wage is increasing
whenever labor demand n(W/E) exceeds n, and decreasing whenever n(W/E) falls

short of n. The implied wage-adjustment scheme is an expectations-augmented

labor market, and, by (9), increases the

expected inflation rate; both factors
cause the growth rate of money wages to rise. In

From (7) and (10), the long-run exchange rate and

wage must both rise in proportion to the

increase in the money stock. Ac-

cordingly, monetary expansion has no lasting effect on the real

put. This long-run neutrality is

represented in Figure 2 by the proportionate

Connecting the initial stationary state and the origin.
The temporary rigidity of the nominal wage enables
monetary policy to
have real effects in the short
run, however. At the initial exchange rate
and interest rate, there is a momentary excess supply of
money, which causes

the exchange rate to depreciate immediately to the value

The economy therefore moves to its new long-run equilibrium

along a path char-

acteri:ed by a rising price level, a declining nominal interest
rate, and
levels of production and employment that fall over time as nominal

outstrips inflation. The pattern of

adjustment, in which wages, prices, and

disturbances, is suggestive of the experience of several Western
European
economies during the recent period of exchange-rate flexibility.
It stands
in interesting contrast to the
in which an inflationary shock

adjustment pattern described by Dornbusch [12],
leads to rising prices, but also to a rising

interest rate and an appreciating exchange rate.
The Keynesian liquidity effect

rates in the short run and forces the

the nominal interest rate

Instead,

adjusts to monetary expansion in Fisherian fashion,

fully reflecting subsequent price-level inflation, and then returns to its
initial level over time as

inflationary expectations subside. The real rate
of interest remains constant.
It is easy to see why this must occur. Because the price level
increases
one-for-one with the exchange
rate, exchange-rate overshooting, in the present

setting, would imply an initial net decline in real balances, but a simultaneous increase in both the income- and

interest-sensitive components of

money demand. This configuration of prices would be inconsistent with
moneymarket equilibrium.

3. The Role of Non-Traded Goods

The existence of goods that do not enter into international trade
weakens the link between the price level

and the exchange rate, and frees

the domestic real interest rate to diverge from the world bond rate. We now
extend the previous section's model by adding to the economy described there

homogeneous of degree one, implying that

Real balances are now defined as nominal balances deflated by a pricelevel index Q(E,P) =

When P < 0, an increase in W (holding B

constant) entails a fall in the output of both industries and a rise in real

balances; the depreciation rate of E must fall, as before, to restore moneymarket equilibrium. When a rise in W is accompanied by an increase in P,
however, the fall in home-goods output is dampened to some extent,18 and the

stock of real balances declines. The net outcome, in this case, of a rise in
W at unchanged B may be either excess supply or excess demand in the money

market. In the latter circumstance, the expected depreciation rate will
have to rise to ensure equilibrium, and the sign of

official fiscal measures, will shift the P(.,.) function, causing
a fall in the

the output-wage paid by the industry that is hurt. The adjustment
to the shift
will in general require a realigiiment of nominal as well as relative
prices, and in
particular a-period of labor-market imbalance as money wages change.

4. Monetary Disturbances and Patterns of Adjustment with Non-Traded Goods

This section studies the effects of money-supply disturbances in econo-

mies producing non-tradable commodities. The adjustment to monetary perturbations is seen to differ in several respects from that in the simple one-good

economy of section 2. Three of these differences are of particular interest.
First, monetary disturbances induce persistent deviations from purchasing

power parity that disappear only in the long run. Second, monetary disturbances induce movements in the real rate of interest. Third, the exchange
rate may overshoot its eventual, long-run level in response to a nominal

shock. Our aim here is to relate the economy's response to monetary shocks
to its production structure, highlighting in particular the importance of
sectoral output elasticities and the degree of openness.

The latter is de-

fined in terms of both the share of tradable goods in overall output and
the substitutability in consumption between traded and non-traded goods.
Consider first the effects of an unanticipated, permanent increase

of the money stock on an economy in which h in such an economy, that

and nominal wage on the assumption that the economy is initially at rest.
The long-run exchange-rate and wage again rise in proportion to the
increase in money.

The exchange rate depreciates in the short run, too,

but by an amount necessarily smaller than its long-run depreciation.

The

reason for this is that, by (22) and (23), the relative price of home goods

in terms of tradables must rise initially if h <

implying an appreciation
As in section 2, exchange-

rate overshooting would be inconsistent with money-market balance.

19

The initial real exchange rate appreciation must be reversed during
the transition to the stationary state, for money is neutral in the long run.
It follows that the price of home goods in terms of tradables, and with it,
the output share of home goods, declines during the adjustment process. This
is possible only if the rate of increase of the price-level index, Q(E.P),

falls short of the rate of increase of the exchange rate, E.2' An interesting, and counterintuitive, implication is that when

h<

the real

rate of interest, R - Q/Q = R* + ElF - Q/Q, must rise in response to an increase in money, and fall subsequently to its original level, R*, if no
further shocks buffet the economy.

The effects of the disturbance are different when h exceeds n.

We conclude by examining the extent to which the degree of openness

terms of both the degree of substitutability

is in-

of section 2, in which the exchange

rate always undershoots. The more limited the possibilities for substitution
in consumption, the weaker the link

between the prices of tradables and non-

tradables, and the greater the likelihood that an exchange-rate depreciation
less_than_proportional to a given increase in money leaves an incipient excess supply of real balances requiring

further depreciation and a fall in the

nominal return on bonds. If the openness

of the economy is measured by the

degree of 5ubstitutability between home and international goods, exchange-

rate overshooting will tend to be associated with less open economies.
If the degree of openness is measured by

the share of tradables in dom-

estic output, however, the association between overshooting and openness

becomes less compelling. A less open economy,
which exchange rate depreciation has a

in this sense, is one in

relatively small direct effect on

real output and the money-stock deflator. This, by itself, would imply a
tendency for the domestic interest rate to fall in response to an increase

in the money supply. But an increase

in E has, in addition to its direct

effect, an indirect effect on real output and the price level through its in-

22

fluence on the price of home goods, P. And a decrease in the

share O, as we have seen, lowers

traded-goods

(W/P)Pw, and, by (23), raises

which measures the sensitivity of the price of non—tradables to exchange-

rate movements. A decrease in

O thus affects the likelihood of overshooting

in a second, possibly offsetting,

manner by strengthening the link between

the prices of domestic and foreign goods.
To summarize, while lower
tradables makes overshooting

substitutability between tradabjes and non-

more likely, there is in general no monotonic

relation between the output share of

non-tradables and the likelihood that

the exchange rate overshoots its long—run level in response to

monetary

perturbations.

S. Anticipated Monetary Disturbances and the "Vicious Circle"
Phenomenon

The analysis has, so far, been

limited to monetary disturbances that

take the public by surprise. We ask, in this section, how the
analysis must
be modified when the same
monetary disturbances are instead anticipated.
by
the public some time before their
occurrence. Three points of particular

interest emerge. First, the exchange rate, like any nominal asset
price,
responds immediately and discontinuously to new information about future
monetary developments, subsequently evolving along a smooth path in the ab-

sence of further news. Thus, while the

exchange rate must, in the long run,

change in proportion to any change in the

nominal money supply, exchange-rate

movements may bear no relation to actual contemporaneous movements of the money stock over finite intervals of time. Second,
disturbances that are expected in

monetary

advance in general have real relative_price

effects that persist after the disturbance has occurred. Only a monetary

23

shock anticipated infinitely

far in advance is fully neutral, having no

effect on relative prices at any

time. Finally wages and the exchnge rate

are likely to evolve explosivelY during the period between

of nominal price move-

These three

money supply is imminent has an immediate expansionary effect. As E and P
both rise, the stock of real balances is reduced, and money-market equilibrium
requires a rise in the nominal domestic interest rate and, by (5), a depreciating
exchange rate.

The exchange rate and nominal wage rise together until T, the moment

at which the monetary change takes place. Because the nominal money supply
rises discontinuously at r but prices and output cannot jump, the nominal inter-

est rate R necessarily falls at this point. The expected depreciation rate
thus declines, actually becoming negative if the saddlepath slopes downward

as in Figure 6. Thereafter, the economy moves along the convergent path to
the long-run equilibrium associated with money stock (1 +

It is of particular interest to trace the paths of output and

employment. The real wage in terms of tradables rises steadily until time

t, as Figure 6 shows, and this implies that the real wage measured
terms of home goods rises as

induced. As noted above, nominal prices

cannot jump at time T, and the expected

increase in money therefore has no effect on output and employment at the moment

it occurs. Real wages continue to rise smoothly toward their long-run levels,
while output and employment remain above

their natural levels until the economy

returns to its stationary state.
These real effects of an anticipated monetary change disappear only when
the change is anticipated infinitely far in

advance. To make this point formal-

ly, it is convenient to work with a linear approximation of the differentialequation system, valid in a neighborhood of the initial long-run equilibrium

So

in this case, too, it is possible that the anticipated monetary change ulti-

inflation.

The "VICIOUS circle" phenomenon

is often linked to a

monetary policy

that systematically accommodates money wage increases in order to avoid
unemployment. But the present
analysis shows that no such permissive
policy
is necessary. Nonetheless, the expected increase in the
money supply may
well ppear to accommodate the increase in wages and
prices, particularly
since output declines and the nominal interest rate
generally rises along
the path following the initial

depreciation. Actually, it is the belief

that this monetary increase will occur that sets off the depreciation_inflation

spiral. The expected event brings the vicious circle to
an end by pushing
down the nominal interest
rate, reducing the rate of
exchange_rate depreciation,
and allowing a smooth transition to a convergent path.

6. Conclusion

This paper has developed a model of exchange-rate determination

and

nominal wage adjustment in a two-sector economy with
foresight. The model
assumes that goods prices adjust

immediately to clear markets, but that the

nominal wage is sticky in the short run. The persistent
effects of monetary
disturbances are thus ascribed

to the gradual adjustment of expected real
wages to labor-market imbalance, rather than to the short-run
rigidity of the
domestic price level postulated in
much recent literature. This is in accord
with the observation that
exchange-rate fluctuations are immediately reflected
in import prices, while domestic
goods' prices are often closely linked to the

28

prices of international1y.-trade goods.

The model predicts a variety of macroeconomic adjustment patterns,
linking these to the supply structure

of the economy and to some key economic

parameters. Also, the model generates the "vicious circle"
and wage-price inflation as the response

to anticipated future monetary ex-

pansion.
A major shortcoming of the model

is its neglect of the external balance

labor-market pressures have their full impact but current-account adjustment is

4. Additional Concerns lie

behind these developments, of course, but a
complete discussion would lead beyond the scope of this
paper.

5. Hall [19] argues that many U.S. labor contracts do have this
feature of
demand_determined labor supply over limited periods. The
assumption of predetermined nominal wages is familiar from the closed-economy
macroeconomics
literature exemplified by Fischer [14] and by Phelps and Taylor
[28].

6. Some econometric evidence on the extent of real-wage
resistance in
Western Europe in the l970's can be found in Branson and
Rotemberg [} and
Sachs [31].

7. See Mundell [24]. These

authors generally extend the

Mundell-Fleming
framework by fleshing out the labor market, allowing
wages and prices to
adjust gradually to market disequi1jbrj, and introducing
expectations. The
approach of this paper is closest to that of Burgstaller [9],
who studies
anticipated and unanticipated changes in the monetary growth
rate and public
spending in a neighborhood of
an inflationary stationary state.

34

8. Gordon [17] develops a two-sector

fixed-exchange-rate model in which a

Phillips curve mechanism ensures a long-run real wage that clears the labor

market. Buiter's [7] model is of related interest.

9. The existence and persistence of

real exchange rate movements (i.e., de-

viations from purchasing-OOwer parity) during the recent period of floating
have been documented by Kravis and Lipsey [23] and Frenkel [16], among others.
Calvo and Rodriguez [11] develop an

alternative theory of real exchange rate

movenients based on external asset accumulation.

10. Like this paper's model, that of Mussa [26] describes a two-sector economy.
Mussa's model abstracts from the labor market and from endogenous fluctuations
in output, however.

11. Dornbusch [12] has made the point that exchange-rate undershooting may
occur when the level of real output

rises in the short run as a result of mon-

etary expansion. In the model of Section 2, however, undershooting necessarily
occurs.

12. The possible real effects of anticipated money under rational expectations
are widely discussed in the literature on the macroeconomics of closed econo-

mies. See, for example, Fischer [15].

counter-intuitive result follows from the fact

that in Dornbusch's model, the locus obtained by imposing the initial condition
mentioned in the previous footnote has a slope differing from the long-run equi-

librium terms of trade. As Mussa [26] has emphasized, the problem is caused by
the model's price-adjustment mechanism.

The latter builds into the model a form of

domestic output,
money illusion by postulating that the (sticky) nominal price of

rather than its price in terms of foreign goods, adjusts over time in response

to goods-market disequilibrium. This problem

is avoided in the present model by

the expectatioflal, forward-looking component of the wage-adjustment scheme, which

automatically adjusts the nominal wage over time to offset expected increases in
the absolute price level even in the absence of labor-market imbalance.
