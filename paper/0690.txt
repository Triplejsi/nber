Consumption Correlation and Risk Measurement
in Economies with Non—Traded Assets
and Heterogeneous Information

ABSTRACT

The consumption beta theorem of Breeden makes the expected return
on any asset a function only of its covariance with changes in aggregate

consumption. It is shown that the theorem is more robust than was indicated
by Breeden. The theorem obtains even if one deletes Breeden's assumptions
that (a) all risky assets are tradable, (b) investors have homogeneous
beliefs, (c) other assets can be traded without transactions costs and
(d) that all assets have returns which are Ito processes.

Introduction

Douglas Breeden [1979] has recently considered an intertemporal capital
asset pricing model which implies that the expected return on an asset depends

on its "consumption beta." His result is that asset i's mean excess return
can be explained by the covariance of asset i's return with aggregate consumption. His model has attracted interest because it solves the problem of extending
the simple one—period Sharpe—Lintner portfolio model to the intertemporal case

without assuming an unchanging investment opportunities set. The kind of solution shown earlier by Robert Merton, Breeden argued, implies that the return on

an asset depends on its covariance with s+2 portfolios where s is the number
of state variables in the economy. Since s is likely to be large, Nerton's
approach does not suggest a simple empirical regularity as does Breeden's.

We show here that Breeden's result is even more powerful than is suggested

by his paper. We assume that there is a single consumption good and that an
individual's consumption is a diffusion, i.e. an Ito process. Under this assump-

tion, if asset i is freely tradable and if its return follows an Ito process,
then its mean excess return will be explained by the covariance of its return

with aggregate consumption. This theorem is true even when we delete Breeden's
assumptions that (a) all risky assets are tradable, (b) that investors have homogeneous beliefs about future returns, (c) that all other assets can be traded with

2

no transactions costs, and (d) that all other assets have returns which are an
Ito process.-" This extension of Breeden's result is important because (i) human
capital cannot be traded, but has an uncertain payoff, (ii) other assets, such
as housing, are very lumpy, and can be traded only subject to a significant
transaction cost, and (iii) when information is costly, traders will, in equilibrium, have different beliefs about returns or consumption.

Our method of proof is more direct and simpler than Breeden's, in that it
is not necessary to complvtely solve the consumer's intertemporal continuous

stochastic optimization problem. Our argument can be summarized as follows.
For the consumer to be at an optimum, the distribution of excess returns between
two

traded

assets r1—r2, given his information I., must satisfy

0.

E[U!(C.)(r1—r2)I I.] =

That is, each trader must expect his marginal

utility of consumption to be uncorrelated with excess returns on traded assets.

This is true even if there are untraded risky assets. In continuous time, the

solution to individual i's portfolio problem is as if he has quadratic utility.
It is as if consumer i's marginal utility is linear in his consumption:

u(C.) = a.—b.C..

When

marginal

ten as (a./bjE[r —r

utility is linear, this relationship can be writ-

i2 I

E[Cjr

I ]. If we let I

c

denote the

information which all consumers hold in common, such as past prices, past aggregate consumption, and past asset payoffs, then we can take the expectation of

both sides of the last stated equation conditional on I .
c

Since

I. contains
1

strictly more information than 1c' the above procedure yields the same equa-

tion except that I. is replaced by I. This equation can now be summed over

I I=

(E (a./b.))E[(E C.)(r —r ) I I. This
1

equation holds for any subset of the information set which is common to all

the consumers to yield E[r -r J

traders. Hence it is also true using the unconditional distributions
Thus this model states that covariance with aggregate consumption is the

3

appropriate measure of risk even when traders have different beliefs. The consumption correlatedness model works even when there are nontradable assets and
heterogeneous beliefs because it does not rely on there being one portfolio

which is optimal for everyone. It holds even when individuals do not have per-

fectly correlated consumption. The linearity of each consumer's "first order"
condition for optimality implies that idiosyncratic components of consumption

are irrelevant for asset pricing. This is true even though there does not exist
spanning or a comp1ete set of markets which traders can use to insure against
fluctuations in the idiosyncratic components of their non—tradable assets.

The Model

2.

We assume that a consumer has a time—additive utility function over a single
consumption good

T/h

U =

(1)

hJ(ch)h

j=O
where T is his time horizon, Ct Is consumption at time t and h is the discount fac-

tor between utility at t and t+h. (Note that consumers may differ in their utility

functions and discount factors and time horizons.) u(C) is the flow of utility
during the period of length h Our approach to the continuous time optimization
problem will be by taking a limit of discrete time problems as the time h between
periods goes to zero.' To define the budget constraint, suppose the consumer ar-

rives at time t with a portfolio of N traded assets ft—h' where the date the consumer

last trades is denoted by t—h. Let Pt be the vector of prices for these assets in

terms of the single consumption good. Let

be the vector of per share payouts

on each of these assets which is accumulated by time t when the asset is purchased
be the consumption that the consumer gets at t from nontraded or

at t—h. Let

imperfectly traded assets, and let

be the consumer's information at time t. Let

denote the portfolio he decides to hold at t; then his budget constraint is

Thus the

Note that when the consumer chooses ' he

be interpreted as the consumption derived from human capital and housing at

time t, i.e. stochastic wage income and stochastic imputed rental income.
It is notationally convenient to eliminate the dividend payment as a corm'o—

nent

of holding period return. We thus assume that all companies use dividend

5

income to buy back shares of firms rather than paying out dividends. Let V
be the market price of asset i at time t. Clearly the real returns are unchanged in this model when dividends are paid out to shareholders instead of
being used to make share repurchases (since we assume no taxes).

Let (C,X) be a solution to the discrete time problem for the consumer
when the trading interval is h. Assume that Ctl > 0.

For this to be optimal,

it must be the case that the consumer cannot raise his expected utility by sel-

ling some of asset i at time t, planning to buy it back at time t+h. At
any time t, the consumer can sell s units of asset i; this would increase
his consumption at t by sV.1. Let him make no other change in his portfolio.
Suppose he buys the s units back at time t+h, by reducing his consumption at
t+h, but keeping his other assets as before, and from then on makes the same

trades as previously. Thus the consumer's consumption only changes at t and

t+h. Hence his total change in expected utility from selling s units at t

and buying them at t+h is

(3)

u(C1) + Eu(Ch+h) —

Iu(C + sV.) + Etu(C+h — SVit+hfl

For xh,c1 to be optimal, the proposed trading plan must not raise expected

utility. Hence (3) must be minimized at s = 0

tive for s

0 and equals zero at s =

0).

(since (3) must always be posi-

Assuming u is strictly concave

and differentiable, this means that the derivative of (3) with respect to s

must be zero at s =

(4)

0.

Hence

uT(C)V. =

hE[T(Ch)vJ

This is just the statement that a trader equalizes his marginal rate of substitution between current consumption and shares to the relative current price of

6

shares. Let t be a time after t such that r—t is an integer multiple of
h. Then r is a feasible trading date. The reader can verify that, for any
'r, the consumer must also be indifferent between selling

feasible trading date

a little of the asset at t and buying it back at t. This implies that

In order to take limits as h goes to zero, we assume that we are looking
at a given consumer and only varying the length of time h between his trades.
That is, we will take prices as being unaffected by the change in trading oppor-

tunities (i.e., the change in h) to which this consumer is subjected. This paper
will say nothing further about the equilibrium determination of prices. Our goal
is simply to derive a simple relationship between rates of return and consumption.
(See Cox, Ingersoll and Ross {l978] for a model with endogenous prices.)

We assume that C urn {Ch} exists and is a diffusion, i.e. an Ito process.

stochastic processes {H,V} will lead the consumer's optimal consumption policy

be a diffusion. However, the reader should be aware that all of the work

which uses the stochastic calculus (such as Breeden) to solve for the consumer's
optimal consumption policy also assumes that the optimal policy is a diffusion,
rather than proving that it is best in a larger class of policies. We also
assume that the log of the price of the assets follows a diffusion.

We first give an intuitive proof and then give a very short formal argument

using Ito's lemma. Intuitively, (11) follows from (10) because over short time
intervaLs the marginal utility of consumption can be approximated as a linear

function. That is, take a Taylor expansion of u'(C.) about C to get,

Therefore we have the same first—order condition as with quadratic utility. As
we noted in the introduction, quadratic utility immediately gives a consumption

beta model.' This can be seen as follows. If we take the limit of (14) as

T + t (i.e. as T goes to t from above), then (14) is identical to (11). This
is because, for diffusions,

That is, (14) essentially states that the expected value of excess rates of
return per unit time is proportional to the covariance between the rate of growth

Aggregation Over Consumers
In the last section, we showed that an individual consumer will have as a

condition of optimality that the covariance between his own consumption changes

and excess returns be proportional to average excess returns. Since we do not
have much data on individual consumption, it is important to express (11) in

terms of per capita consumption. An aggregation result derived by Breeden for
his more restrictive model also applies here.

We first analyze the effects of heterogeneous information. Let I denote consumer L's information at time t. Then, using the fact that
(EdC)(EdV) is of order (dt)2 so that we treat it as zero, we can write

It is important to note that (A2a) is consistent with traders having different

information about future returns. To get (A2a) to hold, it is sufficient that

all traders know the current At which is generated by the current consump—
tions and risk aversions of traders. For our purposes, this will be sufficient:

under (Al) and (A2b), we obtain from (23)

Equation (24) is the basic equation for explaining mean returns. If, for
example, asset j

is commercial paper, then (24) states that any tradable as-

set's ex ante expected excess return over commercial paper's return can be
explained by the ex ante covariance of the excess return with aggregate con-

sumption changes. Testing (24) for tradable assets requires that we know the

common information of traders at each date t. However, a great simplifica-

tion is possible if A is constant. If At is a constant, or independent
of I' then (24) must hold for any subset of the common information of agents
I. That is, take the conditional expectation of (24) onditiona1 on I.
Then, by the previously mentioned result on iterated conditional expectations,

we obtain

(25)

E[___1JIJ =AtEt_(_y_1)j J

Note that At will be a constant if all tFaders have the same constant reiative risk aversion, or if the traders have different but constant relative risk

Equation (25) is extremely useful for empirical implementation because it
now involves the distribution of observables and a single constant for each

date At. Thus, for example since all consumers observe current prices and
rates of return, we can replace 1

by just those variables, since (25) holds

for any subset of consumers' common information.
to

An interesting special case of (25) obtains when we choose to set

be the null set. That is, (25) holds for expectations conditioned on no information. Thus, if there is a constant long run joint distribution of aggregate
consumption changes and rates of return, this long run distribution can be used

to test (25). To be more precise, suppose that returns, consumption and
have a stationary joint distribution. (This is consistent with consumers'
expected returns changing from period to period as they observe different

realizations of theirinformation.) Then we may test (25) by using only the
marginal joint distribution of returns and consumption alone (ignoring l).

Equation (26) involves only the unconditional distribution of the variables of interest. Note that (26) will hold for portfolios of traded assets.
We are currently empirically testing (26) for assets like the Standard and
Poors portfolio of 500 stocks, commercial paper, long term bonds, etc. over
long time horizons (1890—1980), using the ex post estimated joint distribution
of rates of change in consumption and rates of return on those assets.

Conclusions
We have shown that cross sectional differences in mean asset returns can

be explained by the cross sectional differences in the riskiness of the assets
where risk is measured by covariability of the return with rate of change in

aggregate consumption. This result is true in the presence of heterogeneous
expectations as well as nontradable risky assets. We obtain our result because
of the linearity of consumers' first—order condition in a continuous time model,
rather than from the condition that all consumers hold the same portfolio of

risky assets or have perfectly correlated consumption. The latter two conditions will not obtain in a model with heterogeneous expectations or non—tradable

assets. Our result is similar to that of Mayer [1978] who analyzes a discrete
time model with nontraded assets under the assumption that returns are Normally

distributed. There he is also able to make use of the fact that each consumer's
first—order condition is linear and

this

permits aggregation over consumers.

We have shown that under the assumption of constant relative risk aversion,
the relationship between ex ante mean returns and covariance may be replaced

by an ex post (i.e. unconditional) relationship between these quantities. We
are currently implementing empirically a test of the consumption correlated—

ness model based upon that result. We have also shown that the fundamental
relationship between ex ante returns and covariances with consumption is true
conditional on any subset of information which is common to all consumers,

such as current interest rates, prices, money supply, etc. This should lead
to interesting empirical tests of the model.

FOOTNOTES

Note that equation (3) in Breeden permits labor income to be stochastic.
However, in equation (7) only the deterministic component of labor affects the
rate of change in wealth. That is, Breeden assumes that when the portfolio
decision is made at time t, the investor can act as if he is locally certain
about the size of his labor income. See Nerton [1971] for an earlier model
which explicitly used consumption.

-

Indeed, we do not solve a continuous time optimization problem, but only
take limits of discrete time problems. The continuous time solution which we
derive should be interpreted as the approximate solution of a very, very short
discrete time problem rather than as the solution to an unstated continuous
time problem. See Merton [1978] for a good exposition about this technique.
See Harrison and Kreps [1978] for another approach.

Throughout this paper, we refer to the fact that excess returns are explained by covariance with consumption as 'a consumption beta model.tI Of course
