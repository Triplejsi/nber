Wealth Mobility: The Missing Element
ABSTRACT

We consider the problems that may arise when cross sectional data alone
are used for inferences about individual welfare, the existence of elites,

the possibilities of class boundaries, the openness of a society, etc. We
also consider problems with alternative measures of socio—economic position.
We then use a sample of 2400 households observed over one or two decade
intervals together with data on the population of households at each observation
point to examine mobility within the distribution of wealth for an almost

closed economy, Utah, 1850—1870. We use information on households to examine
those characteristics that contribute to mobility. We find considerable
mobility, much apparently stochastic, within quite highly skewed distributions
of wealth that also exhibit increasing inequality through time.

WEALTH MOBILITY: THE MISSING ELEMENT
Introduction

Often inferences about economic and social opportunity are based

solely on distributional data. For example, in his study of the distribution of wealth in mid-nineteenth century United States, Soltow compares
the Gini coefficients for 1850, 1860 and 1870 wealth distributions based

on a sample drawn from the census manuscripts. He finds that there was
remarkable stability in the distribution of personal property and real
estate and then concludes that, "There is no question that a sizable
portion of total wealth was held by a small proportion of the people in
each census year studied. .

.

.

There very definitely was an elite

upper group in America in terms of control of economic resources."1
Williamson and Lindert compare inequality in the U.S. and Europe for the
early twentieth century and find that "by the eve of World War I, wealth-or at least decedents' wealth--was as unequally distributed here as in

Western Europe. DeTocqueville was right; less than a century after his
visit, the American equalitarian ?dreamt had been completely lost."2
Henretta, examining the distribution of property in Boston in 1687 and

in 1771, found a trend toward more inequality. The upper ten percent of
the wealthholders in 1687 owned about 42% of the taxable wealth in 1687

and 65% in 1771. He concludes "Society had become more stratified and
unequal.

Comparable conclusions about the presence of elites, the existence
of social stratification or the validity of the equalitarian ideal,
based solely on the level or trend in inequality are numerous in studies
of the distribution of wealth in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

2

But one element is missing from the story of wealth inequality told in
increasing detail by economic historians. This missing element, central
to any judgment that we might make about the normative or political
implications of unequal distributions of wealth, is the economic mobility
of individual households as they accumulate or lose wealth and change

position relative to other households. We must know how individuals or
households moved within the rather stable distributions of wealth in

order to evaluate America's fulfillment of the egalitarian ideal. We
cannot conclude that there was an elite if households move in and out of

the upper strata of the distribution with frequency. We should not
puzzle over the quiesence of the lower class if the probabilities of
moving to richer strata In five or ten years were substantial even

though a stable distribution of wealth were observed. Indeed the idea
of class loses meaning or takes on significance as individual mobility
or immobility characterizes the situation within the cross sectional

distributions that have been collected and studied. Thus an increase in
inequality or persistent inequality may or may not imply loss of the
American dream or the existence of social stratification since such an
increase may be accompanied by more or less mobility.

it is possible, of course, for an economy to have great disparity
in wealth holdings and no movement or change in relative position through

time for any household. Alternatively, it is possible to have great
disparity in wealth holdings and more or less random movements by indi-

vidual households through time. In the first case, we might expect
political discontent or repression but in the second case simply expect

to find comment on the capricious nature of economic life. Unfortunately,
most normative judgements of interest require strong, but unverified,

3

assumptions about the level of individual household mobility. However,
an unequal distribution of wealth that persists through time cannot be
used to verify such assumptions and thus cannot be used alone to conclude
that there were elites.

Similarly, DeTocqueville's egalitarian ideal

cannot be evaluated by comparing summary measures of wealth distributions
for the United States and Europe unless there is evidence that the same

pattern of mobility exists in both areas. Unequal distributions of
wealth in precolonial times cannot be made into convincing evidence of

political or social unrest. Each of these conclusions would have to be
based, in part, on an assumption that there was little or no mobility.
Others have also noted the importance of basing normative judgments

on mobility as well as cross-sectional inequality. Kuznets has stressed
the importance of measuring long-term inequality so that mobility and

cross-sectional inequality are merged together. Lebergott has also
argued for an approach that combines movement with inequality.4 Nevertheless, economic historians have devoted few resources to measurement of
economic mobility even though there is significant interest in distributional issues as evidenced by the work of Jones, Soltow, Gailman,

Williamson, Lindert and others.5 A number of factors have undoubtedly
contributed to the emphasis on cross-sectional data. Much contemporary
work has the same focus. Data of the sort required to effectively
examine mobility or to test for assumptions about mobility are costly to

acquire and hence not readily available. Mobility issues introduce
additional measurement problems into an area already fraught with ambiguity.
However, many of the inferences based on cross-sectional data alone
remain unverified and unverifiable and, consequently, it is important to
begin a careful development of the relevant data.

4

The focus of this paper is on the testing of the implied assumptions
about mobility within a sample capable of describing both cross-sectional
distributional inequality and movements through distributions by individual

households across time intervals. In the following section we provide a
brief discussion of the methods of measuring economic mobility. We then
turn, beginning in Section III, to a consideration of a fairly large
sample case study of mobility and distribution based on records drawn
from the censuses of Utah from 1850 to 1870.

II. Measurement of Economic Mobility
Three alternative measures have been used in both contemporary and
historical studies of economic mobility--occupation, income and wealth.
The most common measure of change of the economic position of a household

has been occupation.6 Most of the historical studies of occupational
mobility have followed the analytical design of Thernstrom in his study
of Newburyport, Massachusetts with the primary measure of economic or
social movement being change in occupational class by blue-collar workers

or their sons. While occupational change is a useful measure of mobility,

it does present certain difficulties.7 The observed mobility or rigidity
is influenced by the arbitrary decisions made relative to the scaling

and classifying of occupations. Should the movement from carpenter to

brick-mason be considered as upward or lateral? How much of the mobility
observed in occupational studies represents slight movements across
boundaries where both occupations observed could just as easily have

been included in the same category? Just as classification may generate
illusory mobility, it may mask true mobility since each occupation is
8
likely to encompass a hierarchy.

As a particular craftsman moves from

apprentice to journeyman to master or even small manufacturer, it is

5
possible that the occupational designation, often self-described, may
not change.

A second difficulty with the use of occupation as a measure of
economic mobility is the ever changing context within which the indivi-

dual movements are observed. The distribution of occupations among
classes (blue collar, skilled, professional etc.) changes with time and
economic growth so that the probability of being in a particular occu-

pational class changes regardless of the flexibility or openness of the

society. Increases in the percentage of jobs classified as white collar
or professional create upward mobility that is deceptive as a measure of
the openness of the society while being real in terms of absolute improvement for the individual.

Finally and most importantly for historical studies, occupational
mobility is not a useful mode of analysis in an agrarian economy or in

an economy with significant rural-urban migration. Farm occupations
such as farmer or farm laborer have little or no use as indicators of

economic position. Further, it is very difficult to scale movements
from the farm to urban occupations since agriculture includes the total
spectrum of economic success.

Economists have tended to use income to study contemporary economic

mobility.9 Income represents the flow of purchasing power for a household and may closely approximate economic fortunes for that particular

period of time. The use of income to measure mobility by examining
relative movement between two periods (e.g. from one decile or grouping
in the first period of observation to another decile or grouping in the
last period of observation) eliminates the problems of scaling that are

6

present with the use of occupation. However, a new problem is created
by the use of income to measure mobility. It is well known that income
has both permanent and transitory components so that part of the observed
mobility is due to the random effects of transitory income and does not
reflect fundamental change in a household's economic position.'° Thus,
an important task of the researcher who uses income as a criterion for
mobility is the decomposition of mobility into permanent and transitory
elements.

Ultimately, the question of how to measure mobility is an empirical

issue. What measure (wealth, occupation or income) will correlate most
closely with economic or social status?12 Wealth has attractive features

as a measure of mobility. It requires no scaling.

Rural mobility can

be measured effectively with changes in wealth. Rural-urban migration
and the resultant occupational changes present no particular problems of
measurement if wealth is used as a measure of mobility.13 The transitory
component of wealth should be much smaller than that of income so that
wealth mobility should reflect rather permanent changes in a household's
14

economic position.

Hence, wealth may be the best single measure of

economic if not social mobility. This would certainly be the case if a
full measure of wealth in both physical and human capital forms were

available. Unfortunately, accurate measures of human capital are rare.
While studies of contemporary wealth mobility are rare, there have
been several historical studies of the wealth mobility of households.

15

However, these historical studies are limited to study of the richest
tail of the wealth distribution or confined to very limited segments of

the economy. For example, Pessen's conclusion that Jacksonian America
was not an "age of fluidity" is based in large part on the lack of

7

movement in and out of the list of very wealthy taxpayers in New York

and Boston.

16

.

.

.

Since Pessen s analysis includes the top lb of the wealth

distribution or even less, there could well be substantial mobility
within the bottom 99% of the distribution while the extreme of the

distribution contains the same households through time.17 It would seem
useful to consider mobility within the full distribution of wealth.

There is an additional interpretive problem with measures of the movement in and out of the richest tail of the wealth distribution at dif-

ferent points in time. The group at risk constantly changes as people
migrate, die, form new households or disappear from the tax lists so
that comparison of two points in time may involve groups of quite differ-

ent people. To illustrate, Pessen finds that 57% of the wealthholders
in Boston who possessed wealth in excess of $40,000 in 1833 had accumulated more than $50,000 in wealth by 1848, while 15% had wealth of less

than so,ooo.l8 This means that 28% of the rich housholds of 1833 were
not on the tax list of 1848. There is no way of knowing whether these
households no longer existed because of the death of the household head;
or because of migration from Boston, remaining wealthy or becoming poor;
or because they became so poor that they were not on the tax list.

Similarly, the origins of the wealthy of 1848 who were not on the tax

list of 1833 are also unknown. It would seem more useful to hold the
group at risk constant between two periods of time so that the initial
and terminal wealth of each household is known.

Those studies confined to smaller communities can hold the group at
risk constant more easily.

19

However, confinement of the analysis to a

small group within a larger economy increases the migration in and out
of the sample so that a new question becomes very important--was the

8

experience of the migrants significantly different from that of the

non-migrants? This is a difficult but important question for open
economies with high levels of geographical movement across the boundaries

of the study. Thus, such studies are able to examine a group of households with initial and terminal wealth observations, but the group is a
small percentage of the total population.

With the Utah data presented in this paper, we attempt to analyze a
fairly large group of households with wealth observations in both 1860

and 1870. Since Utah was quite isolated from the rest of the U.S.
economy and the migration to Utah was induced largely by religious
beliefs, the problems created by self-selected migration would appear to

be minimal.20 Since Utah has a large agrarian sector with substantial
urban-rural migration as well as rural-urban migration, wealth would
appear to be a better measure of economic mobility than occupation.

Future work will compare mobility as measured by the three alternatives--

occupation, income and wealth. In this paper we report the results
using wealth as a measure of economic movement.

III. Wealth Nobility in Utah Between 1850 and 1870
We consider wealth mobility for an almost completely independent

economy--Utah from 1850 to 1870. Wealth, occupational and demographic
information have been collected for the population of households in each

census year.21 Thus we are able to observe the complete distributions

of wealth in this economy. We have linked a large number of households
across decade intervals so that mobility within the same group of indi-

viduals can be observed. (We refer to this group as the "linked sample.")
Since we observe both the population of households and a sample of
households drawn from the population that can be linked through time, we

9

are able to place the study of wealth mobility within the distributional

context. Finally, we observe a number of household characteristics and
can, as a consequence, roughly separate stochastic from household charac-

teristic effects in relative movements. These elements of our data
allow us to address some of the issues suggested in the preceding sections
and to illustrate and draw conclusions about the importance of mobility,

the missing element, in distributional studies. We begin with the
distributional setting.

Table I summarizes the distributions of wealth in Utah in 1850 and
1870 and compares these distributions with those of the United States.22

In 1850 Utah was clearly more egalitarian than the U.S. Utah households
were also much poorer than their U.S. counterparts, and this shared
poverty was undoubtedly a contributor to the more equal distribution of

wealth. In part the poverty and equality can be attributed to the
recent settlement of the area, the Mormons first arriving in Utah in
1847.

Summary measures also indicate that by 1870 Utah displayed a
distribution that was almost as unequal as the distribution of wealth

for the U.S. This two-decade period was characterized by rapid population growth as Mormon converts from the East and especially from northern
Europe migrated to Utah (over 87 percent of the households in the 1870

census were not present in the 1860 census). This period also saw a
growing urban population within Salt Lake County (23 percent of the

households) that supported the usual occupational structure. Both rapid
growth and the development of interdependent urban market activities
probably contributed to the increasing inequality. This increasing
distributional inequality contrasts with the more common circumstance of

10

a stable or slowly changing distribution of wealth. Was this increase
in inequality accompanied by social stratification? Did the increasing
dispersion limit or enhance opportunity?23
We model economic mobility with transitional matrices summarizing
relative movements of households between two distributions of wealth.

Given a specific group of households (the population, the linked sample
or some sub-group within the population) we construct decile boundaries

for the distribution of wealth in a given year. Distributional deciles
for 1850 or 1860 are rows in the matrices; decile positions within the

1860 or 1870 wealth distributions are columns (See Table 2). Relative
movement or mobility is reflected by changes in distributional position
from year to year, specifically measured by which decile of the wealth

distribution the household occupied in each year.24 There are at least
three interesting comparisons that can be considered.

One can consider

relative movement of the linked sample against the entire population of

the economy in any given year. In this case, the decile occupied in
each year would be determined by the boundaries drawn from the population

distribution of wealth. Alternatively, one can consider relative movement
within the sample of linked households itself. That is, the distributional
positions would be determined by the distribution of wealth held by the
sample of individuals that we observed through time. Finally, one can

consider relative movement against a subgroup of interest. For example,
it might be interesting to consider relative movement of those in the
linked sample living in the urban area against the distribution of

wealth within the urban area.25 We have used each of these three alternative comparisons in our analyses since each allows us to factor out
important elements that might contribute to the observed mobility.

11

First we measure relative movement within the distribution of wealth for

the population in each observation year: If a household is observed to
be in the third decile of the wealth distribution of the economy in
1860, what is the probability that it will be in the top decile of the

distribution of wealth for the 1870 population, etc.? A likely hypothesis is that aging ten years as well as being in the economy for ten

years leads to considerable upward mobility. If so, the household would
have moved upward relative to the distribution of wealth for the population in the next measurement year.

Second, we have defined relative position by using the distributions

of wealth held by households in the linked sample itself. Since the
sample consists of exactly the same set of households in each observational year, these transitional matrices give an indication of relative

movement within the same group of households. This approach examines
mobility for a group within which each member shares a common characteristic--being linked through time (or surviving within the economy through
time). In this case, upward movement is less likely and downward movement
more probable since drawing the decile boundaries from the distribution
of wealth among the linked group controls for immigration, time within
the economy, and to some degree for age (households formed after the
initial census observation will not be included in the distribution).

Finally, we consider the movement of households with particular
characteristics against population subgroups with the same characteristics, such as the same age cohort, similar occupational activities, same

residence, etc. The expectation is that age, occupation, place of

birth, etc., would affect economic mobility. Therefore, we are likely
to observe less mobility when such household characterisitcs are factored

12

out. This comparison allows us to go beyond distributional-mobility
relationships to a preliminary and partial decomposition of mobility
into systematic components explained by age, occupation, residence,

nativity and other observable household characteristics and the stochastic
elements that represented the vagaries of economic life in that economy.

One difficulty with our methodology should be noted. Household
wealth estimates exhibit "heaping't on even values such as $100, $500,

etc. When a decile boundary occurs on such a value the "decile" boundary
has been moved the minimum distance up or down in order to avoid separating

households with identical wealth holdings into distinct deciles. This
means that the number of households per decile may not be identical as

it would be with a continuous distribution. It also means, however,
that we avoid introducing spurious relative movement for households with
the same wealth who would otherwise have been arbitrarily placed in

adjoining deciles. It is, of course, true that if the decile boundaries
are drawn from any group except that which is linked, there need not be
an equal number of households from the linked sample in each decile
since the linked group may not necessarily be a random sample of the

group from which the decile boundaries are drawn. This will occur for
the first and third comparisons outlined above.

Table 2 summarizes the movement from 1860 to 1870 of our linked
sample through the distribution of wealth for the economy within which

these households were living. The left hand column indicates the decide
position from the 1860 distribution of wealth, 1 being the poorest 10

percent of the population and 10 the richest 10 percent. The first row
of numbers (1 through 10) indicates the 1870 deciles. The numbers
within the table indicate the percentages that occupy each cell where

13

each cell represents a particular combination of deciles for 1860 and

1870. For example, 14.9 percent of those who were within the bottom
decile in 1860 were in the third decile of the 1870 distribution; 2.1
percent in the fourth decile; 20.6 percent in the top decile and so

forth. The column and row labeled "N" indicates the number of households in each decile position. Thus, for example, there were 204 households in the 6th decile of the 1860 distribution but only 185 in the 6th

decile of the 1870 distribution. The final column provides a summary

measure of mobility, the conditional mean decile position. Again, by
way of example, for those in the bottom decile in 1860, the "expected"
decile position within the population distribution of wealth in 1870 was
7.2; for those within the top position in 1860, the "expected" position

was 9.2. We note, for comparative purposes, that if mobility were a
completely random process, each cell in this matrix would have the same

expected entry, .1. That is, for any household occupying a given decile
position in the 1860 distribution, the chances of occupying any given
decile position in the 1870 distribution would be 1 in 10 since there

are 10 possible positions in the 1870 distribution. In addition, the
expected or mean decile position for such a household if mobility were
completely random would be 5.5 and this "expected" position would be
independent of the position occupied by the household in the 1860
distribution.

The impact of rapid and costly immigration is illustrated in the

1860-1870 comparisons: in 1860 less than ten percent of the population
had no wealth but in 1870 more than twenty percent of the households had

zero wealth.26 The linked sample also includes households with zero

14

wealth in one or both years (more than 10 percent of the sample) so that
zero wealth was not simply an outcome of migration or coming to the
economy late (relative to our measurement times).
A perusal of the 1860 cell sizes (the 11th column, under N)

indicates that our linked sample is not quite a random sample of the

1860 population. (With a random sample from the population each 1860
cell would be expected to contain one-tenth of the sample or about 220

households.) The poorer deciles have fewer and the richer deciles more
members than would be expected with a random selection. This is
reflected in the unconditional mean decile position as well, which, for

the sample in 1860, is 6.1. The mean decile position for any random
sample would be 5.5; this would also be the mean decile position for the
population itself by construction.

As hypothesized, the entire group of households present in both
1860 and 1870 censuses moved upward through the population distribution

of wealth. Nearly 46 percent of the sample is within the top 20 percent
of the 1870 wealth distribution while only 27 percent is in this position

in 1860. The unconditional mean decile position for the linked group in
the 1870 population distribution of wealth is 7.6, well above the population mean (5.5) and above the unconditional mean decile position for

this same group in the 1860 distribution (6.1). Again, this is a reflec-

tion of the upward movement of these households. Those fortunate enough
to be in the top decile in 1860 faced a probability of only .31 of a

decline in relative position. The prospects of moving into the top ten
percent of the population wealth distribution or staying there were
quite good for this linked group since the probability of being in the

top decile in 1870 was .267. Clearly, however, this probability was

15

dependent upon one's decile position in 1860 (note that the probabili-

ties increase as one reads down the column under "10"). Rags to modest
riches was a practical possibility since the probability of moving from

the bottom decile in 1860 to the top decile in 1870 was .206. While the
probabilities of movement differ in ways that we consider below, the
expected decile position based on one's 1860 relative position (column 12)
was well above the expected position for a random member of population
and above the original 1860 position in every case.27

Elsewhere we have noted the effect of time or experience within an
economy on wealth holdings.

28

Time of entry into an economy had a

significant and pervasive effect on mobility; the sample of linked
households occupy a higher position in the 1870 distribution of wealth
than would be expected of a random group of households drawn from the
1870 population and they occupy a higher relative position in the 1870
distribution than they do in the 1860 distribution.

Obviously, one of the characteristics that these linked households

share is that they all were in the economy for at least ten years. We
can factor out or control for this effect by considering the movements
of households within the distributions of wealth for the sample itself

rather than for the population of all households. This analysis is
summarized in Table 3 where, again, the deciles in 1860 and 1870 are
based on the distribution of wealth within the linked sample and hence
over exactly the same group of households in each year.

We observe considerable economic mobility up and down through the

distribution of wealth held by the sample. While movement is obviously
not random, there is a high degree of mobility from the lower deciles to

the top and to a lesser degree vice versa. Note that with the exception

16

of the probabilities of those in the 9th and 10th deciles of the 1860
sample distribution remaining in these attractive positions in the 1870

sample distribution, no probabilities exceed .2. However, the higher
probabilities in the bottom right-hand corner of the matrix do indicate

some rigidities in the upper tail of the wealth distribution. Moreover,
the mean decile attained is clearly dependent upon the initial position
in 1860 although the relationship is not strong except for the households

in the upper tail of the sample wealth distribution. However, households in 1860 decile positions 6 and below had an expected decile position in 1870 less than that of a random process (all but the bottom two
elements of column 12 are less than 5.5).

While the mean decile position in 1870 is dependent upon relative
position in 1860, there is clear evidence of regression toward the mean.
Households from low decile positions have an expected decile position in
the 1870 sample distribution well above their position in 1860; those
occupying decile positions above 5 have an expected decile position

below their 1860 position. For those households occupying 1860 decile
positions 8 through 10, the expected decline is 1.8 deciles. For all
other 1860 decile positions the expected change increases with the
distance from the mean position of 5.5.

For this sample, even though there is both considerable dispersion
in wealth holdings in any given year and an increase in dispersion
through time, there does not appear to be economic stratification except
perhaps for the very wealthy.

We can push our analysis back one decade by considering the distri-

bution of real property in 1850 and 1860.29 The movement of households
within the sample relative to each other shows more mobility between

17

1850 and 1860 than it did from 1860 to 1870. (Data not shown here.)
This finding suggests that mobility may be a function of the maturity of

the economy. Kuznets has postulated an "inverted U" relationship between
inequality and the development process: at first, economic development
increases inequality and then diminishes it.3° The relationship of the

development process to wealth mobility is important as well. If inequality
and mobility move together, the interpretation of the process might be
different from a situation in which more equality also implied more

mobility. If the process of economic development eventually leads to
more equality and less mobility, such a tradeoff makes judgments about

the egalitarian ideal difficult. For Utah from 1850 to 1870 we observe
a considerable increase in inequality with early development and an
apparently small decline in mobility.

Part of the sample (696 households) is observable over a two-decade
interval, allowing observation of longer-term mobility and of the effects,

if any, of the dramatic increase in dispersion over this interval. The
effect of early entry and time within a growing economy is very pronounced.
Fifty-nine percent of the 696 households were in the top two deciles of

the population wealth distribution by 1870. Those in the lowest decile
in 1850 had a .35 probability of moving to the top decile over the
twenty-year period while those already in the top decile in 1850 had a
two-thirds likelihood of remaining there.

Table 4 illustrates this longer-term relative movement within the
sample itself (deciles are drawn from the distribution of wealth among

the 696 households). We note that there is more mobility over the
longer time period than over either of the two ten-year intervals. This
suggests that even some of the stratification observed in the tail of

18

the wealth distribution decays with time. Those in the bottom half of
the sample wealth distribution had a probability of .44 of being in the
top half of the 1870 and, consequently, those in the upper half could
well fear decline since the probability of falling into the bottom half
is also .44.

Thus far, an examination of the transitional matrices suggests the

following conclusions. Time with the economy pushes households upward
through the cross-sectional population distributions of wealth so that
few households who were relatively poor intitially were likely to be
among the economyt s poor later. Part of this can be attributed to the

age-wealth profile that is well-documented in historical data. Further,
factoring out this time effect by examining the movement of the sample
households relative to each other (as summarized in Tables 3 and 4) does

not eliminate the pattern of extensive mobility. This implies, of
course, that mobility is not solely a life cycle or duration phenomenon.
Households seem to move quite randomly relative to each other in the
wealth distribution with the exception of the upper wealth level where

movement is less pronounced. However, comparison of mobility in the
1850-1860 decade with the 1860-1870 decade suggests that mobility declined

somewhat with the development of the economy. Finally, the extent of
long-term mobility as reflected in the comparison of households living

in Utah in both 1850 and 1870 is striking. To be sure, the initial
decile position does affect the probabilities of a household's final

decile position, but the effect does not strike us as large. Moreover,
while we observe a decline in mobility in the second decade, there was
considerably higher probability of movement for any given household over

the two-decade interval than for either one decade interval. These

19

observations suggest that there was a regression toward the mean, the
rate of which may be dependent on the distribution of wealth and hence
on those factors leading to increased dispersion.

Are relative movements simply the result of fate or fortune, or is
mobility related to characteristics the household can either acquire or

already possesses? Alternatively, how much of the observed relative
movement would remain if adjustments were made for age differences or

other characteristic differences? It is to these questions that we now

turn. However, because of the cumbersome nature of the transition
matrices, we have chosen to use summary measures in these comparisons.
Specifically, we use the unconditional mean or "expected" decile position
of the distribution of wealth for different groups in comparison with
the distribution of wealth over either the sample, the population or a
population sub-group with the same characteristics as the group drawn

from the sample. Table 5 provides a comparison of these summary measures
against each of these three distributions for groups with the character-

istics indicated. For example, we can examine the distribution of
wealth for those who were engaged in farming who were also in the linked

sample. The third row first indicates the relative position of these
households in the 1860 sample wealth distribution and then in the 1870

sample wealth distribution (columns 1 and 2). We also provide comparisons
of this group of farmers (who were linked) with the distributions of
wealth in 1860 and 1870 for all those engaged in farming within the

population (columns 3 and 4). Finally, we consider the relative position
of the distribution of wealth for these linked farmers within the distribution of wealth over the entire population of the economy in 1860 and
again in 1870 (columns 5 and 6).

20

We have already noted that there is one household characteristic
that influences the expected mean decile position in 1870 for any house-

hold--the relative wealth position (decile) in 1860. This creates a

problem of interpretation. Since we know that mean decile position in
1870 is affected to a degree by the decile from which the household
moves in 1860, and a characteristic group of households is not a random
sample of the linked sample, relative movement will be affected both by
the position of the household group in the 1860 distribution and by the

household group's characteristic. We can control for the effect of the
beginning position by comparing the expected movement of all households
in the same position with that of the households with the characteristic
of interest by using Table 3.

We first consider the relative movements of households with given
characteristics within the sample distribution of wealth, columns 1 and

2. For example, those living in the urban area in 1860 occupy a position
consistent with being randomly selected from the 1860 sample distribution
(mean decile of 5.6) but have an expected mean decile position in 1870

of 6.1. Since all those occupying the fifth decile in 1860 had no
expected positional change (5.4, Table 3), this upward movement may be
attributed to the characteristic of residing in an urban area instead of

to the average decile position in 1860. Using this method, we find that
households characterized as farm, urban, foreign-born and a listing in
all three census years (triple) as well as 35-44 and 45-54 age cohorts

evidenced upward mobility. Note that for triples the expected decile
position in 1870 is less than that for 1860 but not by as much as would
be expected for the randomly selected household occupying the 7th decile

position in 1860. The same effect of less relative downward movement
holds for the age cohort of 45-54 years.

21

Since the change in the relative positions of the age cohorts is

very much like that of a random sample of households occupying comparable
1860 positions, age appears to have only a small effect on relative

movement. This observation is reinforced by a consideration of relative
movements within age cohorts, columns 3 and 4. The second pair of
columns considers the movement of a particular subgroup of the sample
against that same subgroup in the population, where the decile boundaries

are drawn from the wealth distribution of the population subgroup. The
third pair of columns considers the movement through the population
distribution of wealth with boundaries being drawn from the population

distribution. Thus, farmers in the sample, meaning farmers found in
both censuses, move from a mean decile of 6.0 relatIve to all farmers in

1860 to 6.8 in 1870. This was a more modest movement than most groups

achieved. Finally, farmers moved up significantly, relative to the
whole population, with mean decile positions of 5.4 in 1860 and 8.2 in
1870.

It is clear from column 5 of Table 6 that, with the single exception
of the foreign-born, our sample sits in the upper part of the wealth

distribution in 1860 although the effect is not pronounced. It is also
clear from column 6 that the relative position of the sample vastly
improves by 1870 with the sample occupying the upper portion of the

wealth distribution for the whole population by 1870. This positioning
and movement is fairly uniform relative to subgroups as well as the

population. The exceptions are nonfarmers who are moving up relative to
other nonfarmers considerably more than they move relative to the popu-

lation and farmers for whom the opposite is true. The two age cohorts,
35-44 and 45-54, move up more relative to the population than they do
relative to their age groups within the population.

22

The striking observation about movement within this sample is that
no single characteristic generated much differential mobility for house-

holds with that characteristic. Farmers, those who lived in the urban
area of Salt Lake City, the foreign-born and the young-age cohorts
(25-34 and 35-44) improved their position, but the gains were not large.

Age cohorts 45-54 and 55-64 as well as the characteristics of being
U.S.-born and present in all three censuses produce a decline in the

relative position of households with those characteristics. However,
there appears to be no observed characteristics which would make a

dramatic difference in mobility in this sample.31 The results are
similar for a comparison of 1850 and 1860. It should be noted that the
young and the foreign-born, two relatively poor groups, were moving up
relatively rapidly, producing convergence toward the mean for those

groups. This was not true for the nonfarm occupations.
Mean decile position considers the expected possibilities for any

random member of the linked group. We have observed that these possibilities are not independent of initial decile position, and that there
is a weak correlation of possibilities with household characteristics.

We now consider possible interactions between characteristics and the

initial decile of the household. Rather than using a summary statistic
(say mean decile position, given an initial position) we provide in

Table 6 the leading diagonal of each of the transition matrices. These
are the "stayers" who remain in the same relative position from one

observation period to the next. If the distribution is random, in the
sense that from one period to the next there is an equal chance of
landing in any given decile independent of one's starting position, then

for each decile ten percent of those observed should be "stayers." We

23

have provided the leading diagonals for characteristic groups and for

the sample itself. The decile boundaries in this case are drawn from
the sample wealth distribution. Hence, Table 6 summarizes the comparative
probabilities of staying in each decile for subgroups within the sample.

Table 6 suggests that the staying? patterns observed for the
sample are not dramatically different across characteristic groups. The
probability of being a stayer bounces around a good deal and appears to
have a MU,, or "J" shape (higher probabilities at the ends of the distri-

bution, lower probabilities in the middle) but the same pattern occurs

for most characteristic groups. There are two exceptions: TJ.S.-born
and the 45-55 age cohort clearly have lower probabilities of remaining
in the top decile.

We note that the urban wealthy were especially immune to the

possibilities of decline. At the other extreme, those in the poorest
decile were less likely to move up in certain instances. The nonfarm,
urban and foreign-born poor were less likely to be able to move out of

the poorest decile. Hence, we do observe an interaction between household characteristics and expected mobility experience in terms of oppor-

tunities when one occupies either tail of the distribution. On the
other hand, with the exception of the final column in Table 6, the
general observation would be very much consistent with the argument we

have developed to this point: while the 1870 wealth distribution cannot
be characterized as anything but one with considerable inequality, it
was a distribution within which individual households moved upward
(relative to the population) and upward and downward (relative to a
group of peers present over the same decade intervals) with frequency.

Only those in the top wealth decile could be very certain of their

24

relative position. Even in this case the probability of decline was
usually greater than .5.

Conclusion
There is no particular reason to conclude that the patterns of
mobility in Utah in the mid-nineteenth century may be generalized to
other economies, but the Utah data are instructive and lead to interesting conclusions that may be worth examination in other contexts.
There is a distinct pattern of regression toward mean wealth in

Utah. Regression is not complete in a ten-year period but it is substantial. This regression toward the mean implies that any boundaries
defining elites or classes were constantly being breached by particular

households. If this pattern of movement toward the mean was perceived
by the population of the time, then social discontent and pressure for

change would be lessened. Therefore, cross-sectional inequality, or its
trend, is not sufficient evidence upon which to establish existence of
an elite.

Further, much of the observed mobility must be stochastic in the
sense that it cannot be explained or controlled by holding particular
characteristics such as age, residence, birthplace or occupation constant.
In order to explore the full relationship of mobility to particular
characteristics, one would need a much larger sample than is present in

the Utah data. There simply are not enough households that appear in

more than one census. Nevertheless, much of the mobility appears to be
stochastic. In particular, the mobility within age cohorts and occupational groupings such as farmers is quite large.

Cross-sectional regres-

sions have been used to explain levels of wealthholding by households.
Such regressions usually explain less than half

of the variance in

25

wealth.32 The question has remained as to whether the unexplained
variance was due to unobserved variables or was, in fact, stochastic

variance. The transition matrices suggest that the variance may be
stochastic since we find households moving quite freely through the

matrix rather than being confined to particular cells. However, further
work disentangling patterned mobility from stochastic mobility would be
useful.

33

If the Utah data are representative, wealth mobility studies should
not be confined to analysis of movement in and out of the richest extreme

of the distribution. Clearly, mobility within the other nine deciles is
different than the mobility of the richest decile. The number of "stayers"
in the richest decile is about twice as high as it is for any other.

Consequently, studies such as those of Pessen or Lebergott that focus on
the richest group do not convey much information about the possibilities
for most households.

Finally, there appears to be no close relationship between dispersion

or cross-sectional inequality and mobility. In particular, one cannot
easily relate increasing dispersion with reduced mobility. In Utah,
inequality increases from 1860 to 1870 while mobility appears to be at a

very high level. Mobility does appear to decrease slightly between the
1850s and the 1860s, but the decrease is small. Furthermore, the observations between 1850 and 1860 must be based on real property rather than

the total wealth of a household. Perhaps the most important point about
the relationship between dispersion and mobility is that the relationship,
if there is any, is so tenuous that historical trends in both cross-

sectional inequality and mobility must be measured and compared. It may
be that the trend in economic mobility moves with the trend in cross-

26

sectional inequality so that an increase in dispersion in the wealth

distribution is accompanied by increased mobility. In such a case,
reality and the egalitarian ideal are difficult to compare. It may be
that mobility is inversely related to modernization so that opportunity

gradually fades. Mobility may be more volatile than cross-sectional
inequality where summary measures move slowly, if at all, and convey a

sense of stability that may be illusory. Economic mobility observed
through tIme and across economies or societies may have more variance
and may be more closely related to periods of political discontent and
change.

One very important issue is raised by the presentation of measures

of mobility. How much mobility should there be? Since there are few
measures of wealth mobility, it is difficult to establish any frame of

reference from which to compare the results presented here. For this
reason each scholar examining wealth mobility has been left free to
reach conclusions relatively unconstrained by the implications of the

data. Moreover, there is a more difficult question. Is mobility good
or bad? Clearly, in the American egalitarian ideal, mobility in terms
of rags to riches or upward movement has been viewed as a beneficial

condition. What about riches to rags or lesser movements downward?
Mobility implies risk, and risky outcomes are generally viewed as bad.
Would completely random movement be optimal?
The American historical and contemporary experience has been filled

with tension between economic efficiency and justice. Economic historians
have tended to judge the issue of fairness or justice largely in terms

of cross-sectional measures of inequality. The Utah experience in the
mid-nineteenth century suggests that cross-sectional measures may not be

27

sufficient to make such judgments. Temporary or even lifetime inequality
may be acceptable relative to the egalitarian ideal that runs through

American history if mobility is possible or probable. These are all
historical issues worth investigating. They must be considered if
wealth mobility is an important element in the story of the egalitarian
ideal in American society.

13. The main problem raised by consideration of wealth mobility in an
economy with urban and rural sectors may be the differential levels

of human capital in the two sectors so that the ratio of physical
wealth to total wealth (including human capital) is higher in the
rural area.

14. Wealth represents the accumulation of savings for life cycle purposes
and bequests. It is also a store of the changes in transitory
income. One would expect the second aspect of wealth to be small
relative to that aspect that reflects permanent income flows.

17. Soltowts sample of the 1870 manuscript census suggests that only
.15% of males in 1870 owned more than $100,000 dollars in wealth.

(footnote 5) While the tax assessments that Pessen uses were to
include personal wealth as well as realestate, it is likely that
the personal wealth was substantially underreported and that

assessment of real estate was below market value. Hence, Pessen is
clearly considering the extreme tail of the wealth distribution in
his study of mobility.

Economy examines mobility within the most wealthy stratas. He
finds that 60 to 80% of the very wealthy are 'new" in any generation.

(p. 174) He also finds that the children of the wealthy have
incomes and wealth that have regressed significantly toward the

mean. Again Lebergott's study does not compare an identical group
at two points in time.

20. In later work, we plan to use the available demographic records on
Utahns to trace the economic fortunes of out-migrants. Some of the
migration out of Utah to the surrounding states of Idaho, Nevada,
California and Arizona was motivated by Brigham Young's colonizing
plans so that individual households may have undertaken migration
out of Utah at an economic loss.

21. We have collected from the federal censuses of Utah the available
wealth, demographic, occupation and location data for 1850, 1860

32

and 1870 for the populations of households within the region in

each of those years. Using these population data, we have linked
all of the households that were clearly identifiable by name, age,

birthplace, etc. across the census decades. Every time a linkage
is made, we have at least two separate observations on the same

household and can observe changes in wealth, demographic, occupa-

tional or locational characteristics. Some of these linkages begin
in 1860 rather than in 1850; some, beginning in 1850, end in 1860.

Others begin in 1850 but miss 1860 with the household not being

observed again until 1870. Finally, we have some households that
are observed in each of the three censuses. These various time-

linked households comprise our "linked" sample. Also, as indicated, we have the populations with the same information, within
which the linked sample households were living.

The census data include the following household characteristics:
name of household head, gender of household head, age of household
head, birthplace of household head, size of household, residence of
household, real wealth of household, personal wealth of household
(1860 and 1870 only), occupation of household head.

We have coded alphabetic information, excepting name, into

numeric information for ease of handling with a computer. Occupations have been identified with a three digit code; location by
town and county codes; birthplace by a state or country code.

22. The distribution of wealth for the U.S. has been analyzed by Soltow
in Men and Wealth.

23. We approach these questions by considering the opportunities, as
measured by ex post relative position in a distribution, of a

33

sample of all households that appeared in more than one census from

1850 to 1870. We created this sample with hand rather than computer
linkage, using place of birth, place of residence and occupation,

as well as age and name. Some latitude was given for name spelling
variations in the censuses as well as for age differences of more

or less than ten years between censuses. Ambiguity about linkages
still existed so that the sample was divided into two categories-those who were linked with certainty and those where the link was

ambiguous. We were unable to detect any systematic differences
between the certain and ambiguous linked groups and will therefore

report analyses using the entire linked sample. We note that a
false link may impart spurious mobility to our data since the two
households are in reality completely different households who are
viewed as the same household.

24. One observes the ex post proportions in each cell of the matrix.
These ex post observations provide maximum likelihood estimates of
the ex ante probabilities.

25. A fourth possibility would be the consideration of movement within
a subsample where the deciles are drawn according to the distribution

of wealth of the linked subsample. For example, one could consider
relative mobility within the linked group of farmers compared to

nonfarmers. Unfortunately, such matrices require more data than we
currently have available.

26. Between 1860 and 1870 large numbers of foreign born immigrants came

to Utah with very little wealth. This influx raised the proportion
of households with no wealth.

34

27. We note one additional methodological problem at this point. If
one considers the mean decile position, given initial decile position,
there is essentially a monotonically increasing relationship excepting

for the first decile position in the initial year. This decile

position is always occupied by those with zero wealth. The problem
is that this zero wealth estimate may be a true estimate or it may
result if the respondent simply failed to indicate wealth to the

census marshall. Thus, we undoubtedly have in this cell some with
a true zero wealth position and some who simply did not respond in
the initial year even though they did have wealth but did respond

in the second year. Hence, the mean decile position is likely to
be an overestimate of that for those in the "true" zero category.

If appropriate adjustment could be made, we would likely observe a
monotonically increasing pattern of mean decile positions given
initial decile position.

28. See J. R. Kearl, Clayne L. Pope, and Larry T. Wimmer, "Wealth in a
Settlement Economy: Utah 1850-1870," Journal of Economic History,
XL (1980), 477-496.

29. The census of 1850 reports the value of real property but does not
report personal wealth. Hence, a comparison involving the 1850
data can only examine mobility within the distribution of propertied

wealth. Clearly, mobility relative to a segment of total wealth is
likely to be higher than mobility within the total wealth distribution.

30. Kuznets, "Economic Growth and Income Inequality," 1-28.
31. Flultivariate analysis is needed to examine marginal effects of
various characteristics on the probability of moving from one

35

decile to another. Unfortunately, very large data sets are needed
for such analysis, since a decile breakdown yields 100 probabilities
for analysis.

Markor Assumptions" Economic Journal, 86 (1976), 566-578; Lillard
and Willis, "Dynamic Aspects of Earnings Mobility"; McCall, Income

be applied to wealth data even though the

transitory element of wealth is probably small.
