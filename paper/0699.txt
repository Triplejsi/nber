Inflation, Resource Utilization, and Debt and Equity Returns

ABSTRACT

Enormously

short

diverse real and nominal ex post returns on equity and

and long term debt securities have accompanied substantial variations

in inflation and resource utilization during the past half century. This
paper contains an examination of the relationships among these security
returns and an analysis of the effects of inflation and resource
utilization on the relationships.

The three major results are the following. First, prior to the
Treasury—Federal Reserve Accord in 1951, nominal yields on one—month
Treasury bills were reasonably stable, while real bill rates were incredibly

volatile. Since 1952, the reverse has been true. Nominal bill rates have
cycled around a rising trend, and real bill rates have stayed near zero.
Second, changes in yields on new—issue, long—term bonds have been largely
unanticipated, and these changes have dominated the realized returns on

bonds relative to Treasury bills. Because bond rates have risen with
(unexpected) inflation during the last fifteen years, bonds have earned

negative real returns. Third, the relative returns on equities and bonds
are greatly affected by the business cycle with equities performing very

well around troughs and very poorly around peaks. This has been true
for all ten troughs since 1926 and all six peaks since 1946.

Introduction
During

the

last half century, the American economy has been subjected

to numerous shocks. The greatest of these were the depression and

War II, but there were also other wars, OPEC and Itregulart?

World

business cycles. As a result, both resource utilization and inflation
have varied widely, and enormously diverse real and nominal ex post

returns

on

equity and short and long-term debt securities have

accompanied these variations.

This paper contains an examination of the relationships among these

security returns and an analysis of the
resource

report

effects of inflation and

utilization on the relationships. More specifically, I will

on the impact of inflation on: Treasury bill rates, the realized

returns on Treasury bonds versus bills, and realized returns on

equities versus corporate bonds. Further, I will discuss the relationship
between the business cycle and realized returns on equities versus bonds.
Thus,

the

analysis provides a background for the fundamental portfolio

decision regarding the broad division of investable funds into
equities,

long-term debt and short-term debt.

Before

turning to the analysis, a few words about the data are in

order. First, all of the underlying

yield data. -- equities, corporate

2

bonds, Treasury bonds and Treasury bills -- are those ccRrrpiled by Ibbotson
and Sinquefield (19'7'9, 1980). These are roughly representative of returns on
economy-wide

"rsarket"

portfolios and

are

available monthly for the

period. Second, these yields are realized, rather than expected
returns, except for those on Treasury bills which are both expected and
1926-7'8

realized because their one-month maturity equals the period over which

the returns are calculated. Third, the returns -- income plus capital
gains (except for bills) - are before-tax returns. They are not truly
representative of what either highly-taxed or tax-exempt investors actually
earned after tax (both investor gnoups pràsumably would have opted for

portfolios with different relative income and capital gains

components

than the market average, and the former, of course, paid taxes). Hopefully

differential returns, at least, are roughly representative of those
earned by most investors.

Inflation and Treasury Bill Returns
During the 1926-80 period there was a single episode of significant

deflation, 1930-32. In those three years the inflation rate ranged
from -6 to -10 percent. Modest deflation also occurred in 1926-27,
1938, and ]99. In contrast, there have been three significant
bursts of inflation -- the beginning of World War II (9 percent in
l941 and 19b2), the postwar surge (18 percent in 19136 and 9 percent

in 19117) end the korean War scare (6 perceflt

of pegging nominal interest

rates at low levels during a period of significant inflation. The
high real rate in the 1930s is largely attributable to the combination
of the general nonnegativity constraint on the nc*ninal rate and the

existence of significant deflation.

However,

it is noteworthy that

the real bill rate exoeeded 14 percent in al]. years in the 1926-30 period
during which the nonnegativity constraint was not binding (the nom(nil

rate ranged from 2.14 to 14.7 percent).

Because only biLls were available in

into biLls. Because corporations did not have sufficient bill holdings

banks and municipalities had nonyield reasons for intaining bill holdings,

bill rates fell relative to other yields. As a result, expected inflat ion
was not fully reflected in bill rates • In fact, the enormous disparity
between private and U.S. short-term yields in 197k was the driving force

behind the creation of the money market fund, en entity that will prevent

such disparities from recurring.
Inflation and. Relative Returns on Equities,, Bonds and Bills

The first two columns in Table 2 repeat the same columns in Table 1

(except that 1979 and 1980 are excluded). The third and fourth columns
record the mean and standard deviation of the difference between the

annual returns earned on equities and corporate bonds. Equities earned

a7

percentage point premium over both the 1926-51 and 1952-78 eubperiod*.

However, when these periods are further subdivided, the enormous variability
of this premium becomes apparent. The premium was much greater in the
1930s, 1950e and 1960a than in the 1930s and 1970s .

It would appear

from these data that there is no si1e relationship between the premium
and either the mean or standard deviation of the inflation rate.

Nonetheless, two of my co—authors in this volume have argued that the

income -

are causes of the relatively poor

is that these phenomena explain the relatively modest rise in promised

sharp decline in share values (Hendershott 1981).

large, 3.8 percent, in the l926-1O period, and it was a negative one

percent in the 1952-67 and 1968-78 periods. The reason for these

differences is apparently unanticipated movements in interest rates.

To illustrate, if yields fall unexpectedly, then prices of long-term
bonds will rise unexpectedly and the one year return on bonds will be

large. This was apparently the case in the l930a (the one month bill
rat. declined from an average of over 3 percent in 1926-30 to less than

percent in the 1933-hO period). In contrast, if yields rise unexpectedly,
then prices of long-term bonds will fall unexpectedly and the one year
retn on bonds will he low. This apparently has happened in the post 1952
period (the one-month bill rate rose frcsa l percent in 1952-55 to
percent in 196hi67 to over 6 percent in 1973-78).
It is important to note that only unanticipated movements in interest
rates have such impacts on the difference in realized returns on bonds

and bills. Par cample, if long-term bond rates were expected to rise
during the year, then bonds would be priced at the beginning of the

year such that a. high incone return wou]4 offset the anticipated capital
loss • In this case, the difference in ex post returns on honda and bills
would be independent of observed chAnges in new issue bond yields. To

determine whether changes in bond yields bays been anticipated or unanticipated, yield data on new-issue equivalent 20 year U.S. government bonds

were collected! Pigwe 2 contains plots of the difference in ex post
annual yields on bonds and bills (the "turity" premium of Ibbotson
sad Sinquefield) for the 1953-78 period and the change in the new issue
bond yield (scaled by a factor of 1.0) between the beginning and end of

the same year. The striking negative correlation implies that the

Annualized differences in equity and bond returns over different
phases of the cycle have been cCared. For contractions, the first and
last 5 months (which overlap for the two 8 month contractions) were
examined, For expansions, the first, second, third, and last six months

were studied (the last two periods overlap during the 21 month upswing in

the late 1920.). The cycles were divided into the 1926-52 and 1953-78
subperiods, and means and standard deviations of the differences in equity
and bond returns were calculated for the 5 pre1953 cycles, the 5
post1952

cycles, and all 10 cycles. A quick examination of the data revealed

that equities tend to earn a re].ativejy superior return (recall that

7 percent) late in contractions an early in expansions and a relatively
interior return late in expansions and early in contractions.
Table 4 has been constructed to highlight this results. The means
(and standard deviations) over all 10 cycles in the 1926-78 period are

listed at the bottaa of the table. The mean net return on equities
is 20 percent in the last five months of contractions (column 1) and
38 percent in the first six months of expansions (column 2). On the
other hand, this net return is -20 percent in the first five months of
contractions (column 3). (The mean net return during the other six
month phases of the expansions was around the normal 6

percent.) While

the mean net equity returns are large (in absolute value) during these

periods, their variability is also large. Statistically, this is revealed
by the fact that none of these means is twice the size of its st&ndard
error. Inspection of the indiyidu cycle datum also indicates numerous
"Outliers."
The most pronounced outlier ia the net equity return in the recovery
of 1933, 125 percent; the other net returns in the first six months

of

upswings in the pre1952 period vary within the narrow 23 to 36

percent

band. Interestingly, the second most pronounced outlier appears to be
the return in the imed.iat.].y preceding period, the end of the 1932-33
contraction. Rather than the normally high return, -37 percent was
earned. Thus, the incredibly high return in the middle of 1933 is largely
a catch up for or offset to the low return in late 1932 and early 1933.
The return over the full late contract ion-early expansion period seems
to be roughly in line with those arow'4 other lower turning points,

Moreover, the •a. pattern occurs in 1957, when the highest postl952
excess return early in the upswing, 50 percent, is preceded by the only

negative excess return in the late contraction months•

It would appear

that the variance in net equity returns over the, tull late contractioneerI.y expe.ns ion period would be con4erabiy lena than the variance in

returns in either the late contraction or early upswing months. The
third column in Table Ii ir4icatas that this is indeed the case. The
aean net return on equities for the last six months of a contraction
and first six months of the following expansion over all cycles is
26 percent, and it has a standard deviation of only 7 percent. Moreover,

this is also roughly the case for both the first and last five cycles
Thus, th. net equity returns are significantly positive at the 0.05
level, eM this is even true if the "normal" net return of 6 percent
is taken into account.
A sossewbat siaflar pattern appears in late expansions and early

contractions during the postl953 period. The two largest negative net
equity returns in early recession months (column 5),

-116

percent in late

1957 and -39 percent in early 1970, were preceded by the only positive
net equity returns in late expansions (column 1), 211 percent and 6 percent,

i

respectively. The lsat column in Table 1 reports the net equity return
the last six months of an expansion and the first six months of

the following recession; a].]. are negative in the 1953-78 period.
Moreover, the mean net extraordinary return (the .9 percent return less
the normal 6 percent) for these 5 cycles is -15 percent with a. 5 percent

standard deviation. Thus, the net extraordinary returns are significantly

.16

negative in the late stages of the expansion and the early stages of the

contraction. (This is not true, however, for cycles prior to 1953).
A

possible problem with th. above calculations is the oceiparison

of the net returns around turning points with a conata.nt "normal" 6

percent return.

The

mean net annual return on equities was shown in

Table 2 to vary widely between different "eras;" the net return was only
2 percent in the 1926-leO period, about 13 percent in the 191-67 span,

and actually negative in the recent 1968-78 years. This suggests that
net returns around turning points should be conpe.red with the average

net returns in surrounding years, rather than over the entire half
century. To accomplish this, we have first divided the months between

January 1926 and December 1978 into three types of periods: those around

troughs in which equity returns appear to be superior, those around peaks

in which equity returns appear to be relatively inferior, and the remainder.
The inferior periods are defined as the last six months of every expansion

and the tint half (dropping fractions) or first six months, whichever

is less, of every contraction. The superior periods are defined as the
last half (dropping fractions) or last six months, whichever is lees,
of every contraction and the first aix months of every expansion. The
second step in this comparison is to divide the total 1926-78 period
into ten overlapping intervals that contain single adjoin 1ng peaks and
troughs and all the aurrouMing months that do not overlap with adjacent

superior and inferior periods. That is, the intervals extend from
6 months after a trough to 6 months before the second following peak.

These ten overlapping intervals are listed at the left in Table 5.

prior to the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord in 1951,

nominal

on one-month Treasury bills were reasonably stable while real

bill rates were incredibly volatile. This was largely due to the
nonnegativity constraint on nominal bill rates during the rapid deflation

in the early 1930s (and 1938 and 19149, to a lesser extent) and the pegging

(at

low levels) of nominal interest rates during the rapid inflation

early in World War II and

in

the Korean Conflict and following the former.

Since 1952, the reverse has been true.

Nominal bill rate have cycled

around a rising trend, and real bill rates have stayed near zero. Short
term bills have been a hedge against inflation

during the last thirty years.

Second, changes in long-term new-issue bond yields have been largely
unanticipated, and

these

changes have dominated the realized returns

on bonds relative to Treasury bills. Because bond rates have risen with
(unexpected) inflation during the last fifteen years, bonds have earned
negative real returns.

Footnotes

1This paper is based upon a larger ongoing study by Roger D. Huang and

myself (1982). The underlying study provides econometric support for

many

of

the propositions advanced in this paper.

2Data for nominal bill rates in 1979 and 1980 have been computed from
the one-month tax-adjusted bill rates calculated by Huston MeCulloch,

whom I thank for making

them available to me. To check the comparability

of these rates with those of Ibbotson and Sinquefield, I computed
the annual return on one month bills from McCulloch's data, 7.23 percent,
and found that it differed little from that based on the I-S data,

7.18 percent. The method for calculating tax-adjusted yields is presented
in J. Huston McCulloch (1975).

3me premium equities earned over Treasury bills is very similar except
for the i926_140

interval.

As is indicated in the last column of Table 2,

government bonds outperformed government bills by nearly 1 percentage

points per annum
bills

in

this period, resulting in the equity premium over

being much larger than that over bonds.

a reference describing construction of

the

data.
