Investment Strategy in an Inflationary Environment

ABSTRACT

This paper addresses the issue of how an investor concerned about the
real rate of return on his investment portfolio should allocate his funds

among four major asset classes: stocks, bonds, bills and commodity futures
contracts. It employs the Markowitz mean—variance framework to derive
estimates of the pre—tax, real risk—return tradeoff curve currently facing
an investor in the U.S. capital markets.

Some of the major findings are: 1) Bills are the cornerstone of any
low—risk investment strategy. The minimum—risk portfolio has a mean real
rate of return of zero and a standard deviation of about 1%. The slope of
the tradeoff curve is initially 1, but it declines rapidly as one progresses

up the curve to higher mean rates of return. 2) Stocks offer the highest
mean and are also riskiest. 3) Bonds play a prominent part in portfolios
which lie in the midsection of the tradeoff curve, although not much would

be lost if these instruments were eliminated. 4) Commodity futures contracts
are the only asset whose returns are positively correlated with inflation.
By adding them to the portfolios of stocks, bonds and bills, it is possible
to achieve any target mean real rate of return with less risk.

IN7ESIMENT STRATEGY IN AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT

Zvi Bodie

For presentation at the NEER Debt/Equity Conference

in

Williamsburg, Virginia, April 2, 1981

The basic premise of this paper is that ultimately what is of

concern

to an investor, whether a household or an institutional investor such as a life
insurance company or a pension fund, is the real value of its investments in

terms of purchasing power over consumer goods and services. The issue to be
addressed is what investment strategies make sense in an economic environment in
which a major factor (although certainly not the only one) to be considered
is substantial uncertainty about the future level of the prices of those goods

and services. By investment strater I mean decisions about how to allocate
investible funds among four major asset classes: common stocks and other equity
investments, long—term fixed—interest debt instruments, short—term or variable—

rate debt instruments, and other "inflation—hedging" assets such as commodity
futures contracts or commodity—linked bonds.

The paper is organized as follows. I will first discuss why it is real or
inflation—adjusted rates of return and their uncertainty which ought to be the

main concern of investors. I will then present an analytical framework for formulating investment strategy, examine the historical record of real rates of
return on the four asset categories, and derive estimates of alternative risk—

return tradeoff curves. Finally, I will discuss the implications of my findings
for individual and institutional asset allocation policies.

—2—
I.

Thy It Is Real Investment Returns and Their Uncertainty That tter.
With respect to the individual investor, i.e. the household, there can

be little doubt that the dollar value of its investment portfolio is not what
counts, 'out rather its real value in terms of purchasing power. It follows,
therefore, that households will be concerned about the real or inflation—
adjusted rate of return rather than the nominal rate of return on their

investments. If the future rate of inflation were known with certainty, it
would make no difference whether households were making their portfolio deci-

sions on the basis of real or nominal rates of return. The expected real rate
on any particular asset would just be the nominal rate less the known inflation
rate, and its real risk would be the same as its noiainal risk. But in an
environment of uncertainty about future inflation there can be a great dif-

ference between the real and nominal risk associated with an asset. The most
extreme example is the case of conventional bonds and mortgages which offer a

guaranteed nominal return to an investor, but a highly uncertain real one. As
inflation becomes more uncertain, these instruments become riskier and less
attractive to households.

But what about institutional investors, should they be concerned with real

or nominal rates of return? Institutional investors are financial intermediaries between the nonfinancial business sector and the household sector of

the economy. Their ultimate survival and success depend on providing households
with the kinds of financial assets that households want to hold. In our infla—
tionary environment contractual savings plans such as ordinary life insurance
policies, which offer guaranteed nominal cash flows, and money—fixed annuities
have become unattractive.

policies accordingly. In a previous paper I have discussed the feasibility of

indexed annuities as a po ile innovation for providing stable real retirement
income in a inflationary environment, and

many other suggestions along these

lines are bound to be forthcoming in the future.1 The central concern of

staing level of the retirement benefit promdsed to the worker is based on an
average of the worker's wage in the last several years prior to retirement.

If, as

in the past, wages increase in tandem with consuner prices, then such a plants
liabilities are in effect indexed during the phase of benefit accrual.
Furthermore, it is likely that the future evolution of pension plans is going to

be in the direction of at least paial indexation of benefits in the post—
retirement phase too. Thus, at least these pension funds have to plan their
investment strategy with a focus on real rates of return too.

II. The Theory of Portfolio Selection.
The analytical framework which underlies the investment strategies I will
present in this paper is known as mean—variance analysis, and it goes back
almost thirty years to the pioneering work by Harry Markowitz.2 The basic pre—

mise underlying this approach is that the investor is risk—averse, that is to
say, given a choice between two investments offering the same mean (or average)
rate of return the investor would always choose the one that has less risk.

Risk in the context of this analysis is identified with the unpredictability or
uncertainty of achieving one's expected rate of return and is measured by its
variance or standard deviation.

_'4 -

The investor's decision process is divided into two stages.

In the first

stage he computes what his risk—return opportunities are, and in the second he
chooses the risk—return combination which suits him 'best.

In stage one, the

investor starts by finding the minimum—risk strategy, determining the nean rate
of return associated with it, and then proceeding to derive other portfolios

which offer higher and higher means with the least possible risk. The result of
this part of the process is a tradeoff curve showing the terms—of—trade 'between

risk and expected return.3

The inputs needed to generate the tradeoff curve are the means and standard
deviations of the real rates of return on the individual assets and the correla-

tions among them. In the following section we examine what these parameters
have 'been over the past 27 years and discuss our assumptions about their current
values.

III. Inflation and Asset Returns: The Historical Record.
Table 1 contains the historical record of real pre—tax rates of return on

each of four categories of assets for the period 1953 through 1979. The measure of
the price level that was used in adjusting these rates of return was the
Personal Consumption Expenditures Deflator published by the U.S. Department of
Cormuerce. This measure was chosen rather than the Department of Labor's
Consumer Price Index 'because serious doubts about the adequacy of the CPI as a

measure of true inflation have been raised in the past seven or eight years.

The main objection to the CPI is that it gives too such weight to new mortgage

rates in the computation of shelter costs. The last two columns in Thble 1 present the rate of inflation as measured first by the Consumer Price Index, then

—5—

as measured by the Personal Consumption

Expenditures Deflator.

There are serious

d:fferences between the two Eres, esrecally in l91 and l99; but as the
correlation coefficient of .9T reported at the bottom of Table 1 indicates,
they are highly positively correlated.
The first column in Table 1 is the real rate of return on a policy of

"rolling over" thirty day easury bills, and is representative of the rate of
return on money—market instruments. This is by far the least volatile series,
with a standard

deviation of only l.li%. This is because over this period,

short—term interest rates have tended to follow rather closely movements in the
rate of inflation.

Of course, this is not a coincidence. All

irket—determined

interest rates

contain an "inflation premium," which reflects expectations about the declining

purchasing power of the money borrowed over the life of the loan. As the rate
of inflation has increased in recent years, so too has the inflation premium

built into interest rates. While long—term as well as short—term interest rates
contain such a premium, conventional long—term bonds lock the investor into the

current interest rate for the life of the bond. If long—term interest rates on
new bonds subsequently rise as a result of unexpected inflation, the funds
already locked in can be released only by selling the bonds on the secondary
market at a price well below their

face value. But if

an investor buys only

short—term bonds with an average maturity of about 30 days, then the interest

rate he earns will lag behind changes in the inflation rate by at most one
month.

The problem with money—market instruments, however, is their low rate of

return. Over the last 2?

years,

the average pre—tax, inflation—adjusted rate of

this series is that the investor bought a twenty—year bond at the

beginning of each year and sold it at the end. His return therefore includes
both coupon interest and capital gains or losses. As the relatively low mean
and high standard deviation indicate, the past twenty—seven years was a bad

period for the investor in long—term bonds. Capital losses caused by unanticipated increases in interest rates tended to more than cancel the coupon
yield over this period.

It would probably be a mistake to assume that the mean real rate of return
on long—term government bonds in the future is going to be the

—. 87%

per year

that it was over the 1953 to 1979 period. A more reasonable approach to estimating the ex ante mean real rate would be to take the yield to maturity on
long—term government bonds and subtract an estimate of the mean rate of inflation expected to prevail over the next 20 years. When we do this we find a mean
real rate of return on U.S. Preasury bonds of 2% per year.

includes dividends and capital gains. The mean real rate over our sample period was

1.08% per year, but we will use 10% per year as our estimate of the ex ante mean
in our computations of the tradeoff curve. There are two main reasons for doing
so. The first is that several recent careful studies of the real rate of return
on unlevered corporate capital (i.e. ,

indicate it to be in the

range of 6

the

return to debt and equity combined)

to 1% per year. Since the average

debt/equity ratio for the S & P 500 companies is about 1/3, and the after—tax
real interest rate on corporate borrowing is quite negative, a 10% mean real

rate of return on levered equity seems plausible.5 The second reason is
that 10% per year is the estimate of the mean real rate of return on the S & P
500 derived by Robert C. Merton in a recent National Bureau of Economic Research
study employing a new estimation technique, which incorporates more information
than just the simple average of past rates.6

over the 1953 to

a futures contract reflects the proportional change in the futures price over

the holding period. The series was generated by assuming a "buy and hold" stra—

tegy whereby contracts were entered into at quarterly intervals, held for three
months, and then liquidated. The number of commodities increases from 13 in
1953 to 22 by

the end of the period. Table 2

through 3. When an investor takes a long position in a futures contract he does
not buy it in the sense that he would buy a stock or bond or the physical corn—

modity itself; rather, he agrees to purchase the commodity for a specified price

at a certain point in the future. The

commodities

exchange which acts as an

intermediary requires all parties to a futures contract to post bond called
'trnargin"

to

guarantee

performance.1

Investors are permitted to post reasury

bills, on which they continue to earn the interest, so the funds used as
margin are therefore not strictly speaking an investment in commodity futures.

The rates of return reported in column 1 should therefore be interpreted as the
addition to the total investment portfolio rate of return the investor would
have earned in each year had he taken a position in commodity futures with a
face value equal to his total investment in other assets.

In order for a buy—and—hold strategy in the futures market to be profitable
it is not enough for spot prices to be rising; they must rise by more than was

anticipated in the futures price at the time the contract was entered into. On
average one might expect the spot price forecasts implicit in futures prices to
be right, and therefore expect the mean rate of return on futures contracts to

be zero.8 But what is more important for our purposes, futures contracts will
yield a positive rate of return when there are unanticipated increases in

spot

prices, and it is this feature which makes them valuable as an inflation hedge.
The critical parameters which determine how valuable commodity futures are
in this role, and which play a crucial role in determining the shape of the tradeoff curve, are the correlation coefficients presented at the bottom of Thble
1.

Perhaps

the most significant thing to notice is that the real rates of

return on bills, bonds, and stocks are all negatively correlated with inflation

and all positively correlated with each other. But commodity futures are posi-

-11—

tively correlated with the rate of inflation and negatively correlated with the
real rates of return on the other major asset categories, and therefore can
serve to reduce the risk associated with any portfolio containing them.
The mean rate of return on our buy—and—hold strategy in coimnodity futures

during the 1953 to 1919 period was 7.13% per year, a strikingly large

number, and one which may

not

be an accurate indicator for the future. In com-

puting the tradeoff curve we will assume a rran of zero, although we will also

Before proceeding to our presentation of the risk—return tradeoff curves in
the next section, let us summarize the assumptions that we are making about the

key parameters relating to the real rates of return on bills, bonds, stocks and

commodity futures and the interrelationships among them. With regard to the
means, we assume zero on bills, 2% on bonds, 10% on stocks, and zero on commodity
futures. With regard to the standard deviations and correlations we assume the

ones reported in Table 1.

The Risk—Return Tradeoff.

folios consisting only of stocks and bills. The minimum—risk investment strategy is to invest

In order to provide a clearer picture of the nleaning of a movement along

the risk—return tradeoff curve, we have graphed in Figure 2 three probability
distributions, corresponding to the first three points on curve 1.

They are

based on the assumption that the distribution of the real rate of return on the

portfolios is normal, i.e. a "bell—shaped" curve. The first corresponds to the
portfolio consisting of bills only, which has a mean of zero and a standard

bills and 10 percent invested in stocks with a mean real rate of return of 1%

per year and a standard deviation of 2.%; and the third to a portfolio which
has eighty percent invested in bills, twenty percent in stocks with a mean of 2%
per year and a standard deviation of )4.2)4%.

As the proportion of the portfolio

invested in stocks and therefore the mean go up, the bell—shaped curve shifts
the right and becomes more flat or stretched out, indicating greater upside
potential but also greater downside risk.
Now let us consider what the tradeoff curve would look like if the investor

As a comparison of curves 1 and 2 makes

clear,

at mean real rates of

return

greater then 3.5% the stock—bond portfolios have less risk for any mean than do

the corresponding stock—bill portfolios. On the other hand, for mean values
below 3.5%, stock—bill portfolios have less risk for any mean than do the

corresponding stock—bond portfolios. Perhaps more important, however, is the
fact that very low risk strategies are unattainable using only stocks and bonds.
The mnimurn—risk stock—bond portfolio still has

which

a

standard deviation of 6.6)4%,

is quite high compared to the lower risk levels attainable with bills.

Now let us consider portfolios containing all three assets: stocks, bonds
and

bills. The process of computing the tradeoff curve in this case is more

complicated than before, because for each value of mean real rate of return one
must use an optimization procedure to find that portfolio which has the lowest

standard deviation.—' The resulting tradeoff curve and portfolio proportions are
presented in Table 5 and Figure 3 which allows us to compare the risk—return tradeoff
curve derived using all three assets to the two previously derived curves from
Figure 1.

The main improvement comes at the low risk, low return end of the curve. The
minimur—risk strategy is still to invest in bills only, but as we move up the curve

we replace bills with increasing amounts of both bonds and stocks. This continues up
to a mean of 5% per year. At higher means bills disappear from the portfolio and the
proportion of bonds declines; curve 3 just becomes identical to curve 2.

of special interest on curve 3, which is not tabulated in Table

5,

One point

is the point

having the same mean as the minimum—risk stock—bond portfolio on curve 2, i.e. 2.5%
per year.

It consists of a portfolio with 53%

bills,

28% bonds and 19% stocks and

has a standard deviation of )4.8%, as opposed to the 6.6)4%

standard deviation of the

minimum—risk stock—bond portfolio. Thus by adding bills to the minimum—risk
stock—bond portfolio one can achieve a substantial reduction in risk with no
loss in expected return.

Now we are ready to introduce coimnodity futures contracts into
our
portfolio. It is important to remember that when we take a position in commodity futures we are not actually using up any of our funds; our funds are

invested in stocks, bonds and bills. We are simply taking a position which has

a

face value equal to some specified proportion of the total amount invested in

these other assets. The only restriction on our portfolio imposed by the
futures

contracts is that we must have an amount invested in bills equal to at

least 10 percent of the position in commodity futures, to serve as margin.
The results with commodity futures included are presented in Table 6

does not change

the

by much. The major effect is that bills do not disappear entirely from the
portfolio when we move to high mean real rates of return because there is a need

bills to serve as margin on the commodity futures contracts. We

see

that as we move to higher mean real rates of return and the investment in stocks

goes up, there is a steady increase in the size of the relative position in corn—

futures, although it never exceeds 3)4 percent

investment

of the total value of the

portfolio.

What is the effect on the tradeoff curve of assuming a positive mean rate

of return on commodity futures? Table 7 and Figure 5

present the results of -7

assuming a 2% per year mean rate. Perhaps the best way to describe the effect
is as an upward shift of the entire curve. At any level of risk it becomes
possible to achieve a higher mean real rate of return, with the gain being

larger the higher the level of risk. Even the minimum—risk portfolio now has a
positive mean rate of return. It now becomes possible to attain a 10% mean real
rate of return with a standard deviation of only 16.39% instead of 19.)46%, by
holding a portfolio consisting of 86% stocks, 8% bonds, 6% bills and a position

in commodity futures equal to 59%

of

the portfolio's value.

It should be stressed once again before ending this part of the paper that
the

role of commodity futures stems from the fact that it is

the only asset

stocks goes up is that the real return on stocks is negatively correlated with
inflation. I have performed the experiment of deriving the tradeoff curve under
whose

and the result is that there would be virtually no role for commodity futures
contracts in that case.

It is their value as a hedge against inflation, to off-

set the inflation risk associated with the investment in stocks, that accounts
for commodity futures' significant role.

V. Implications of Findings for Asset Allocation.

The first implication of our findings is that bills are the cornerstone of

at

would have to be invested in these securities. Of course, along with the low
risk comes a low return.

Who

might

be interested in a low—risk strate,r, despite its low return?

The prime candidates are probably retired people with a small—to—moderate accu-

mulation of assets and a low tolerance for risk. In Great Britain the
government has for years been selling bonds bearing a zero real interest rate on
a voluntary and restricted basis to citizens aged 65 and

in corey market instruments. In fact, if they wanted to avoid the

investment risk altogether, they could offer them as variable annuities.
What can we say about the role of bonds and other long—term fixed interest

securities? The first point suggested by our findings is that one can get along
without bonds with very little loss of portfolio efficiency; the improvement in
the risk—return tradeoff that one gets from adding bonds to stocks and bills is

relatively minor. Some institutional portfolio managers might say that the risk
associated with long—term bonds is exaggerated n xrr findings because I have
included in rqy measure of annual returns unrealized capital gains and losses.

Most insurance companies and pension funds do not count unrealized capital gains

or losses on long—berm bonds as part of their annual rate of return. But even
disregarding them, any instrument which commits the investor to a fixed nominal
flow of coupon income and a money—fixed principal mmount at maturity is in fact
extremely risky even for an investor with a long-run horizon, in fact, espe—
cially for such an investor.

Many institutional investors have already come to the conclusion that long—
term fixed—interest securities are too risky relative to their expected return

and have simply stopped investing in them. If that trend continues we can
expect to see the disappearance of these financial instruments frOm the U.S.

Finally, what are the implications of our findings for investments in com-

cate that as long as stocks are negatively correlated with inflation, there is

going to be a need for some kind of asset that haS the property that its rate of

return is positively correlated with inflation. Commodity futures contracts
have the considerable advantage of already being in existence and therefore can
be used right away.

There are some new types of financial instruments that have started to

appear and may play an increasingly significant role in this regard in the
future. I am referring specifically to commodity—linked bonds, that is to say,
bonds whose principal and/or interest is linked to the price of some commodity.
The silver—linked bonds issued by the Sunshine Mining Corporation are an

example. Bonds linked to the price of petroleum and other natural resources
owned by
tional

the

issuing corporation are being actively discussed by

the

institu-

investment community. These securities would share with commodity

futures contracts the property that their rate of return wnuld be positively

correlated with the rate of inflation. If significant inflation persists in the
future, these kinds of securities will probably come to play an important role
in

investment portfolios.
