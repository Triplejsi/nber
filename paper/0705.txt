Real and Monetary Disturbances in an Exchange—Rate Union

ABSTRACT

This paper investigates how a small country fares in an exchange—
rate union if that country is subject to real and monetary disturbances
originating at home and abroad. By joining a union, the country can fix
the exchange rate between its currency and the currency of another country
or countries. The paper asks whether or not fixing this exchange rate
helps to modify the effects of disturbances on the domestic economy.

question is investigated within a model consisting of an aggregate demand equation dependent upon the terms of trade, an aggregate supply
This

equation

in which labor supply is responsive to the general price level,
and a financial equation that determines the exchange rate of the domestic
currency relative to one of two foreign currencies (the other being determined
by triangular arbitrage). Aggregate supply behavior varies depending upon
whether wages respond to prices with a lag or are indexed to current changes
in the general price level. Because the small country model cannot be
used by itself to analyze the effects of foreign disturbances, the paper
introduces models of two foreign countries with the same analytical structure
as the domestic country model. Foreign disturbances are studied in two
stages, first within the foreign model, then within the domestic model.

The analysis shows that one of the most important factors determining
the effects of the union is the degree of wage indexation in the domestic
economy. The greater the degree of indexation, the less difference there
is between output variation in the union and in a flexible regime. Apart
from wage behavior, two other factors are important: the sources of the
disturbances and the pattern of trade. Contrary to common belief, the
case for a union is not necessarily strengthened if disturbances primarily
originate outside the union and if the domestic country trades primarily
with other members of the union.

Although

the current period is often characterized as one of flexible

exchange rates, many currencies are tied together in joint floats against
other currencies, forming exchange-rate unions within a system of flexible

rates. This paper investigates how a snail country fares by joining such
an exci-iange—rate union 1)

The country is assumed to be buffetted by real and monetary distur-

bances originating at hane and abroad. By joining the union, this country

is able to fix the exchange rate between its currency and the currencies
of the union countries. The central question addressed in the paper is

whether or not fixing this exchange rate helps to modify the effects of
disturbances on the danestic econany2 The specific sources of the dis—

tubances clearly• matter in determining the inact of the union and so
also does the pattern of trade between hane and foreign countries. The

paper will investigate tv intuitively plausible propositions about these
factors that the case for a union is stronger when disturbances primarily
originate outside the union and when the hane country trades primarily with

other countries in the union. The paper shows that neither proposition holds

in general.

(1) The terminology here is potentially confusing. In this study, the term
exchange—rate union refers to an arrangement in which rnanber countries
of the union maintain fixed exchange rates between member currencies,
but with each country retaining its own central bank with control over
its national monetary policy. This limited type of union, which Corden

(1972, p. 3) calls a "pseudo-exchange-rate union", is to be distinguished
from a "canplete exchange rate union", or rronetaty union, with a single

central bank and a union—wide currency.

(2) Tower and Willett (1975) provide a comprehensive survey of the literature
on optimum currency areas which examines the conditions necessary for
successful exchange-rate or monetary unions ; McKinnon (1963) and Mundell

(1961) are t early contributions to this literature. Among other studies

are Allen (1976), Corden (1972), and Ingram (1973). The method of analysis

used in the present study is more similar to that of the internal-external
balance literature, of which Mundell's (1963) study of fixed and flexible
rates is the best known.

—2—

The macro model used to address these issues consists of three basic
equations : an aggregate demand equatic

dependant upon the tarms of trade

as ll as foreign output, an aggregate supply equation in which latxor supply
is responsive to the general price level, and a financial equation that de-

teniiines the exchange rate of the daistic currency relative to one of the
to foreign currencies (the other being determined by triangular arbitrage).
The paper shows to what extent aggregate supply and demand behavior are

important in detennining the effects of the union. Supply behavior varies
depending upon whether wages respond to prices with a lag or are

indexed

to current changes in the general price level, while demand behavior is

particularly sensitive to price elasticities.
The small country model has the advantage of analytic simplicity,

but by itself gives misleading results when foreign disturbances are
examined. The model can be used to show, for example, that variations
in foreign incone due to foreign disturbances anywhere abroad unambi-

guously lead to greater donestic output variance in the union. But without

a model of the two foreign regions, the union countries arid the rest of

the world, it is difficult to determine the total effects of the underlying foreign disturbances, since these disturbances affect the daiestic
econany through a variety of channels. For example, in addition to changing foreign output, a foreign demand disturbance concentrated in one

of the two foreign regions will change the terms of trade between the
foreign goods

iirrted

by the small country and

the

exchange rate between

the to foreign currencies. The total effects of this foreign disturbance
thus nay be quite different fran the effects of a change in foreign incane
alone.

—3—
To study foreign disturbances, the paper introduces a rrodel of the

foreign trading regions with the same analytical structure as the small
country model. This model determines the exchange rate and terms of trade

then are traced through the domestic model to determine the effects

on

the small country.

The first section of the paper introduces the small country model,
and the next two sections successively examine the effects of disturbances
within the one country and extended models.

A. Demand Behavior

Unless purchasing power parity is assumed, demand behavior in a

country trading with two other countries is inherently complicated. Three

national prices

are

involved

as well as

at least ts.o exchange rates. We

begin by defining the prices of the three countries' goods expressed in
francs

P

price of Country l's good,

+ X price of Country 3's good in francs,
+

x2

: price of Country 2's good

in francs.

It is convenient for later analysis to measure Country

2's prices

relative

to Country 3. Define the teims of trade between Countries 2 and 3 as

Tt=P- (P--X).
Then the price of Country

2' s good in

francs can be

written as

P + Tt + X.

The general price level in Country 1 can be expressed as a weighted average
of the prices of the three goods

are two relative prices affecting demand in Country 1, the price

of Country 1' s good relative to each of the foreign goods. The demand for

output can

be expressed as a function of these relative prices,

output in the to foreign countries, the real rate of interest, and a
stochastic factor with mean zero and serially uncorrelated'5:

g beccnes infinite in size, this aggregate demand equation reduces
to

the familiar purchasing power parity relationship.

B. Supply Behavior

When a country imports many of the products it consumes, two prices are

for sply decisions, the price of dariestic output (Pt) and the general price level (I) based on foreign and dcrnestic prices and foreign eximportant

change rates.

When expressed in levels, this price index has a gecmetric form with

many modern economies, moreover, wages are at least partially indexed

to current changes

in the general price level. As

a result, supply as

well as demand can respond to current changes in foreign prices and
exchange rates.

The model chosen to represent this supply behavior consists of a
production function of the Cobb-Douglas form and a wage equation based

on the partial or complete indexation of wages.8 The wage equation as-

sumes that labor ties its wage to the general price level in an attempt
to maintain a constant value of purchasing power despite frequent changes

in prices and exchange rates. Because of lags in labor contracts, the current wage is based on last period's expectation of current prices. Wages
may be indexed, however,

to protect the wage earner from unexpected changes

(8) As with the other structural equatiors in the model, the supply equations
were kept relatively simple. Since this model is used to represent all
three countries (as modified below) any additional complexities are multiplied by a factor of three.

(9) For studies of wage indexation behavior, see Fischer (1977), Gray (1976),
Modigliani and Padoa-Schioppa (1978), and Sachs (1979), the latter two

dealing with open economies. Flood and Marion (1980) provide an interesting analysis of how indexation behavior may respond to the choice
of exchange rate regime. Here we have assumed that the degree of indexation has been fixed institutionally, leaving optimal indexation behavior

in a

union for later analysis.

—7—

The coefficient, b, the indexation parameter, typically varies between zero
(no indexation) and one (full indexation)
If domestic producers choose an output level where the marginal pro-

duct of labor is equal to their real wage, W. -

P. , then output can be

ex-

pressed as follows

log(1—&)

Whatever the degree of indexation in the economy, output depends upon the
price of domestic output as well as the general price level. With full indexation, only current

prices

matter, but with partial indexation output

responds to unanticipated changes in the general price level through the

differential

impact of changes in prices on

the real wages faced by pro-

arid rkers, respectively. Notice that when indexation is complete
(b=1), equal increases in Pt1 and 1 leave supply unaffected. When indexa-

ducers

tion is less than ccmplete, however, equal increases in P and I. increase
supply since the real wages faced by producers fall.
C. Financial Behavior

The three countries have t financial assets each

latter bearing interest rate r). To keep the financial sector simple,
hever, the three bonds are assumed to be perfect substitutes so that their
(the

expected returns expressed in the same currency are equal (11)

(10)

Note that there are some countries (notably Italy) where indexation has
been greater than 100 %. See Mdigliani and Padoa-Schioppa (1978).

(11) For a nre general study of financial behavior in an exchange-rate union,
see Marston (1980 b). In that study where the effects of various financial disturbances are analyzed, foreign and domestic bonds are assumed
to be imperfect substitutes.

determine three dcmestic

The

resulting expressions, equations (I) and (II) in Table 1, describe

aggregate demand and supply behavior in both exchange-rate regimes 14) The

stochastic variables influencing

demand disturbance, u1, as well as the random ccaionents of X and the
foreign variables.

The foreign variables can be expressed in this sirrple form because the
underlying disturbances are assumed to be of mean zero and to be serially
uncorrelated (see Section III).

in Table 1, we have assumed that the shares of the t foreign goods
in the price indices are proportional to the respective price elasticities in the aggregate demand equation : a12/a13 =
g2/g3. This restriction allows trade to be biased toward one foreign country or the other
(see below), but the bias must be equally reflected in the

Under

flexible exchange rates, in contrast, the increase in output leads to an

When wage indexation is complete (b=1),

however, these familiar results

down. Aggregate demand disturbances or monetary disturbances then have

identical effects in the to regimes ; that is, the variance of output is
the same regardless of the exchange rate regime. The reason can be seen by
examining Figure 2 showing how aggregate demand and supply adjust to these

disturbances.

(18) Under flexible exchange rates, the direct (positive) impact of u' on
in equation (I) is modified by the fall in u' (which reduces 4).
Output nonetheless increases even under flexible rates. In contrast,
Mundell's

study of internal-external balance

showed that output

did

increase at all in response to a demand disturbance ; given his
assunptions that domestic prices were fixed and exchange rate expectations static, only a constant output was consistent with money market equilibrium. In this study, an appreciation of the exchange rate
leads to a change in the expected exchange rate and therefore to a
not

change in the darstic interest rate, so output can increase despite
a constant noney supply.

— 13 —

First consider the monetary disturbance. Under flexible rates, the
resulting depreciation leads to an outward shift in the aggregate demand

function (to point B) because of the sensitivity of aggregate demand to

relative prices and the real interest rate. When wages are fully indexed
to the general price level, however, there is a corresponding leftward

shift in aggregate supply (to point C) because the depreciation leads to
rise in the nominal wage. The price of domestic output accordingly rises

further ; in fact, the price of domestic output and the exchange rate in—
crease by the same amount, with the constant terms of trade ensuring that
output

remains fixed at its original ievei.(19) In

the union, in contrast,

no depreciation occurs, so the aggregate suly and demand curves remain

The

aggregate demand disturbance does change real output in both

regimes. In the union, the demand disturbances shifts equilibrium to

point A'. Under flexible rates, the increase in demand leads to an appreciation of the franc and to a smaller increase in aggregate demand than
in the union (to point B'). With complete indexation of wages, however,
the appreciation of the exchange rate also raises aggegate supply by

lowering real wages faced by producers. Point' is reached where the

dcxnestic price as well as in the general price level, there is no

change in the real interest rate. The real interest rate could change

The case for an exchange—rate union thus depends upon whether dcntestic

types of disturbances, the difference batween regimes diminishes the mere

All of these channels are potentially important. For many disturbances, mere-

over, Country l's

output is pushed in contrary

directions.

— 15

The

—

net effect of foreign disturbances on Country 1

upon

depends

which of these channels are Itkcst irrortant. That, in turn, depends upon

the types of econanic disturbances encountered as well as on the pattern
of trade. We might expect the union to be nore desirable if economic disturbarices predominantly originate from outside the union and if the pat-

tern of trade is biased so that Country 1 trades primarily with Country 2.
Both of

these propositions will be explored in the analysis below.

In order to investigate foreign economic disturbances, we need

equations and

in

the financial equations are the same for the two countries. Thus we can
specify

one national nodel which can apply to both countries.20

This as-

does not restrict the nature of Country l's relationships with
the two foreign countries since any asyrrinetries in Country l's links with
sunption

the foreign countries could not affect the latter given the small country
assumption. Mcre specifically, Country 1 may choose to trade with one country
nore than the other, or ny be rrore sensitive to one country's prices or out-

put.
(20) The

countries' price indexes, for example, are mirror images of one another ; the weight of each country' s own gocx in its price index is the

In both foreign countries, there is cariplete wage indexation so that equal
increases in darestic prices and exchange rates (or foreign prices) leave aggregate supply unaffected. Foreign output is then solely a

It is interesting to note that the converse is not true. If Country 1
is fully indexed, but the foreign countries are not fully indexed,

then foreign monetary disturbances have real effects on Country 1.
A general monetary expansion raises output in Country 1 in a flexible
exchange—rate regime as ll as in an exchange-rate union. But with

full indexation in Country 1, the increase in output is identical in
both regimes ; that is, the choice beteen reginEs has no effect on
the variance of output.

As

far as Country 1 is concerned, what matters under flexible rates

are the franc prices of the to foreign goods and the franc return on the
dollar (or mark) security, since these are the only variables that can affect Country l's aggregate demand or supply. Both of these remain constant,

gregate Demand Disturbances
Demand disturbances generally do affect Country 1 under }x)th flexible

exchange rates or the union. How a country fares in the to regimes depends
upon the specific form which the disturbance takes. We will consider three
types of demand disturbances

because they all provide insight into the ef-

fects of the union
(1)

A shift in demand from the prcxucts of Country 3 to those of

Country 2. The shift in demand affects Country 1 primarily by changing
the terms of trade and shifting output (and hence demand for Coun l's
prcxlucts) from one foreign country to another. This disturbance serves

to illustrate the irrprtance of the pattern of trade between Country 1
and the other countries.
(2) A generalized increase in demand in

loth countries.

This disturbance,

in contrast, si-ows why price sensitivity in Country 1 is ijtortant, since
aggregate demand disturbances originating abroad have different effects
on the franc exchange rate depending upon Country 1 's price elasticities.
(3) An increase in demand which is concentrated in one country more than

the other, a third case combining the first t to show the irtportance
of where the disturbance occurs.

(27) Country l's interest rate falls because with a fixed rate between the
1
2
franc and mark, r must decline
with r. Only if there is full wage
indexation in Country 1 (b=1) does this purely nominal disturbance
leave Country 1 's output unaffected in the union. The flexibility
of wages and prices then makes up for the fixity of the exchange rate.

— 22

—

All of these disturbances have the effect of changing interest rates
abroad. If the real interest rate effect on aggregate demand in Country 1 is
large enough, ho\ever, even a generalized demand expansion abroad will have

aiubiguous effects on Country l's output since the resulting rise in foreign

interest rates runs counter to other effects on the foreign demand expansion.

To avoid this additional ambiguity, v assume in this section that the real
interest rate effect in Country 1 is zero (g = 0). Under this assumption,

higher foreign interest rates can still have a significant effect on Country
l's output, but indirectly by changing exchange rates.
Equation (I) can then be written in the following simplified fonn

Note that any aggregate demand disturbance originating aboard affects Country l's

With the two foreign countries responding symaetricafly to the distur-

the two countries. First, consider the neutral case where Country 1' s trade
is evenly balanced betven Country 2 and Country 3, so that the output and

price coefficients (or elasticities) in equation (I)' are equal,

change in relative prices also has opposing effects on aggregate demand.

So Country 1' s output is insulated frai' the disturbance.

(28) Country 1 's trade is evenly balanced in the sense that its exports (and
inorts) to the foreign countries are equal. The incane coefficients also
depend upon the incane elasticities of demand for Country l's good in the
two foreign countries, while the price coefficients also depend upon the
export and inort price elasticities. (See the Jppendix). We assume these
are equal for the two countries throughout the discussion in this section,
although the trade pattern could alternatively be interpreted in terms of
asyrrinetries in these underlying elasticities.

For similar reasons, Country 1 fares better under flexible rates when

direct effect

of the shift in foreign output is to reduce Country

l's aggre-

gate demand since the output of its closest trading parther, Country 3, drops.

Since the appreciation of the franc in the union is greater than under flexible
rates, Country 1' s output falls even further in the union than under flexible
rates. The greater appreciation associated with the union adds to the deflationary effects of the shift in demand. (29)

(29) This result holds even if there is no foreign output effect (ie, the
output coefficients are equal, g2 g3), since the price effects of
the disturbance are also greater in the union than in the flexible recan be simplified

— 25

—

If Country l's trade is biased towards Country 2 (g2 < g3, g2 < g3),
which may be the more likely case for a country joining a

union,

then the

direct output effect is positive. That is, the shift in output towards Country
2 tends to raise Country l's output. Now the greater appreciation of the franc
in the union than under flexible rates
help to stabilize Country l's output.30 So the union may be superior to flexible rates when trade is biased

towards Country 2. If the price elasticities (g 's) are large enough so that
the price effects in equation (I') daninate the output effect, however, then
once again the greater appreciation of the franc in the union becomes a drawback. Country 1 's output then varies more in the union than under flexible

rates.(31)

The output effect is positive if g 2 > g 31 while the price effects are

negative (assuming that k2 c (1-a) > k1/2) because of the appreciation
of the franc. Since the price effects run counter to the output effect,
one may neutralize the other thus helping to stabilize Country 1' s output.
(31) In equation (I'), the price terms increase in (absolute) value relative
to the foreign output term as the price elasticities (g2, g3) increase.
—

— 26 —

Flexible rates are superior to the union only when price elasticities are high.

If demand increases (or decreases) by the same auunt in both countries,

there is no change in the terms of trade nor in the mark price of the dollar.
Since foreign output is a function of the real wage, which is constant as long

as the terms of trade remain fixed, output in both countries is constant.(32)

transactions lead to an appreciation. How much the domestic interest rate
increases depends upon the price elasticities,

price elasticities imply greater increases in darestic output. The franc

If the franc appreciates, then darrestic output increases less under flexible

3. Increase in Demand Concentrated 'bre in One Country

the cloice between flexible rates and the union is relatively siniple. Unfortunately, actual demand disturbances that occur seldom fall solely in one

The analysis of this more general case, however, can draw on the first

condition, which requires that the sum of the elasticities of export

aggregate demand function as a whole ; in fact, as the Zppendix shows,
the Marshall-Lerner condition is required in order for these elasticities

to be

positive. When indexation i less than complete in the t foreign
countries, the effect of foreign demand disturbances depends not only

Consider

—

the case where trade is balanced between Country 1 and the

twD foreign countries (the neutral case considered in Section 1), but where
the increase in demand is more concentrated in Country 2. Then strangely
enough Country 1 is better off in the exchange-rate union -- tying itself
to the country with greater demand disturbances. That is simply because

changes in relative prices counter the effects of the general expansion.36
With the disturbance more concentrated in Country 2, the terms of trade of

that
also

country rise

and

the

mark appreciates.

Under flexible rates, the franc

appreciates relative to the dollar, but by less that the mark. By

joining the union, Country 1 ties the franc to the mark and finds its output
increasing less because of the dampening effect of the mark's appreciation.
If Country l's trade is biased toward Country

advantage of

2, however, then

a union over flexible rates is diminished. This

the

paradoxical

result arises because the pattern of trade helps to determine how much
the franc appreciates relative to the dollar under flexible rates. The
franc appreciates more under flexible rates when trade is biased toward
the country with the greater expansion

of

output than when trade is ba-

lanced, since Country 1' s interest rate rises more in the former case. So
the advantage of moving to a union, where the franc is tied to the appreciation mark, is correspondingly diminished.
When trade is balanced but the increase in demand is more concentrated

in Country 3, in

, Country

1 is worse off in the union. Now the mark

depreciates more than the franc. So joining the union further increases the
effect of the disturbance on Country 1 's output.
(36) We assume, however, that the demand shift is not large enough to lower

Country l's output in either regime.

o0o

The form which a foreign demand disturbance takes clearly determines

how desirable an exchange rate union would be. Only in the case of a demand

shift between countries is there a definite presumption in favor of one re-

gime or the other, but that presumption is in favor of flexible rates. In
the second case, that of a general increase in demand, the union is superior

other, the result

also depends

upon where the disturbance is concentrated as well as upon the pattern of
trade. If foreign demand disturbances are a major source of concern, the
case for or against an exchange—rate union will have to be based on a va-

riety of considerations including the type of disturbance typically encountered, the pattern of trade with union and non—union countries, and the

price sensitivity of the darstic economy.

CONCLUSION

This paper has shown how a union uld affect a country subject to rrone—
tary and aggregate demand disturbances originating at home or abroad. How much

difference a union makes depends first of all on domestic wage behavior. Iny

disturbance has an identical effect on the home country under flexible rates

or in an exchange-rate union if wages are fully indexed to the general price

level. Short of full indexation, the case for a union is stronger if rirnetary
disturbances originate at home rather than abroad and weaker if domestic demand disturbances are important. But the advantage of one regime over another

diminishes the closer is the country to full indexation.

Zpart from wage behavior, t other factors are important : the pattern
of trade and the sources of disturbances. But a pattern of trade biased toward
the potential parther in the union does not always beister the case for a union.
Such a pattern of trade will not rrdify in any way the effect of domestic disturbarices as long as Country 1 is small.

the case of sane

APPENIJIX: THE AGGREGATE DEMAND FUNCT ION

The foreign output and price coefficients in the aggregate demand

equation play a major role in the analysis of foreign disturbances. This
appendix derives the aggregate demand equation from a more traditional

equation (in level form) and interprets the output and price coefficients
in terms of this more traditional model.
We begin with an expression relating output to consumption,
exports, and imports:

Q1

(Al)

= c1() + EX2(Q2,R) +

EX3(3,R)

- R

2(Q1,R) -

IM(Q1,R)

All variables are expressed in level form with the time subscripts omitted.
and C'

are domestic output and spending in Country i,

respectively,

while EX' is the demand for exports of Country 1 by Country i and IM' is

the demand for imports from Country i by Country 1. To simplify the
analysis, we assume that there are no changes in the terms of trade
between the two foreign countries and that the dollar prices of the two

foreign goods are initially equal. Thus R can represent the terms of
trade between Country 1 and either foreign country. We also assume that
trade is initially balanced with each foreign country so that EX' = R IM'.

Define the following elasticities (where the partial derivative
with respect to the first (second) argument of a function has the subscript
1 (2)):
h. = income elasticity of foreign demand for Country l's good,

=

EX (Qi/EXi)
fi = price elasticity
=

=

EX (R /Ex'),
price elasticity

-IM (R/INi).

of foreign desand for Country l's good,

of domestic demand for Country i's good,

— 34

Also,

define d =

sum

(1 -

by Country 1

—

of the marginal propensities to save and to import

Then equation (Al) can be written

c) + IM + IM.

in terms of percentage changes as follows:

dQ

EX2 dQ2

+ f2

+

(nf3 +

—

EX3 dE
(—)11.

Thus the coefficients of the aggregate demand equation in the text,
which is expressed in logarithms, can be written:

g.

h. () / d,

g. = (nf.

+ n. -

i) () / d.

The relative sizes of the g. coefficients depend •upon the income elasticities
in the two

country

i

foreign countries (h1) as
as

well as the share of exports to

a fraction of total domestic output. The relative sizes

of

the g. coefficients depend upon the underlying price elasticities as
well as the share of exports. The Marshall-Lerner condition for the trade
balance between Country 1 and Country i is
a

nf. + n. - 1 > 1,
condition which is necessary for

to be positive.
