Risk Sharing Through Breach of Contract Remedies

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the sharing of risk under three different remedies

for breach of contract. The risk considered arises from the possibility
that, after a seller and buyer have entered into an agreement for the
exchange of some (not generally available) good, a third party who values
the good more than the original buyer may come along before delivery has

occurred; the seller will want to breach. It is shown that this risk is
optimally allocated by the expectation damage remedy if the seller is

risk neutral and the buyer is risk averse, by the fic performance
remedy if the opposite is true, and by a liquidated damage remedy if

both parties are risk averse. The level of damages under the liquidated
damage remedy is also shown to be bounded by the expectation measure of
damages and a "damage equivalent" to the specific performance remedy.

By means of a numerical example, it is shown that use of the prevailing
remedy for breach of contract——the expectation damage remedy——may plausibly
cause a welfare loss of as much as 20% due to inappropriate risk sharing.

1.

Whenever parties enter into a contract they realize
that circumstances may change and that one of them may want

to breach the contract.
The remedy available against a
breaching party will, of course, influence each pnrtys
decision whether to breach. The remedy will also affect
each party s investment in "rel iance"——expenditures made in
anticipation of performance (e.g., building a warehouse to

store the goods to be delivered). These effects of contract
remedies have been thoroughly examined by Shavell (1980a,
198Db), Rogerson (1980), and others. The remedy for breach
will, as well, allocate the risks among the parties due to
changed circumstances.

The conclusions reached in this paper may be easily
summarized.

Under the expectation damage remedy, the buyer

is, by definition, made indifferent between performance and
breach.
Thus, since this remedy insures the buyer against
the risk of nonperformance and leaves the beneficial risk of

selling to the third party entirely on the seller,

it

optimally allocates the contract risks only when the buyer
is risk averse and the seller is risk neutral.
In terms of risk allocation, the specific performance
remedy is the mirror image of the expectation damage remedy.

be shown that a liquidated damage agreement optimally

allocates the contract risks when both the buyer and the

seller are risk averse and that the optimal liquidated
damage award is bounded by the expectation measure of
damages and the damage equivalent to specific performance.
A numerical example is also developed to illustrate

concretely how the optimal liquidated damage agreement
varies with the risk aversion of the parties.

As far as risk sharing is concerned, the preceding
discussion suggests that a liquidated damage remedy should
be the normal remedy if, as I assume, parties are generally
risk averse at least to some extent. In practice, however,
the expectation damage remedy is the normal remedy.3 The

loss of welfare due to inappropriate risk sharing from
relying on the expectation damage remedy rather than a
liquidated damdge remedy (or the specific performance remedy

when the buyer is risk neutral and the seller is risk
averse) is calculated from the numerical example. The loss
ranges in this example from 2% of the value of the contract
(when the buyer is much more risk averse than the seller) to
20% of the value of the contract (when the buyer is risk

and the seller is very risk averse).

Reasons why

the expectation damage remedy might still be preferred,
despite the generally superior risk sharing effects of a
liquidated damage remedy, are discussed in a concluding
section of the paper.

situation described here is the simplest

one imaginable which still allows discussion of the risk
sharing issues.

parties are assumed to know the probability that a third
party will come along and the amount that would be offered.

the buyer's remedy is either

Conversely, holding the seller's risk aversion

As mentioned in the introduction, the expectation
damage remedy is the normal remedy in practice. However,

only when the seller is risk neutral does this lead to the
optimal allocation of the contract risk. In every other
case, use of the expectation remedy lowers at least one of
the party's expected utility below what it otherwise could

Table 2 shows the absolute welfare loss, as well as the

from using the expectation damage remedy

rather than a liquidated damage remedy (or the specific
performance remedy when the buyer is risk neutral and the
seller is risk averse). In the case most favorable to the
expectation damage remedy——when the buyer is most risk
averse (certainty equivalent of $3,000 in Table 2) and the
seller is only slightly risk averse (certainty equivalent of
$4,500)——the welfare loss represents a 2Y reduction in the
value of the contract. In the case least favorable to the
expectati on damage remedy——when the buyer is risk neutral

and the seller is most risk averse——the welfare loss
corresponds to a 20 reduction in the value of the contract.
Thus, the example suqgests that in plausible circumstcinces
the inappropriate allocation of contract risks under the
expectation damage remedy can be of some importance.

A liquidated damage remedy, however, encourages

the parties to take into account every facet of the contract
when negotiating the damage payment in advance, including

their relative aversion to risk and the likelihood and
magnitude of thi rd—party offers.

If the parties can renegotiate (including with a third
party) when circumstances have changed, then all of the
remedies will lead

to efficient breach

decisions.

However,

when renegotiation is impossible (or very costly), Shavell
433) has 3hown that only the expectation damage
remedy will induce efficient breach decisions. It is clear
(l9SOa, p.

remedy would lead to too few breaches since damages are
higher than under the expectation remedy, and that the

It will be shown below that the damage payment

Thus, under these

will demand performance and then resell to the third party.
