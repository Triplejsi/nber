Transition from Inflation to Price Stability

ABSTRACT

This paper provides a detailed discussion of the real phenomena that
materialized in the stabilization per&od which followed the German hyper—
inflation.

Significant real dislocations arose after the monetary reform;

and these can be attributed to a government policy which subsidized heavy
industry through the inflation tax

proceeds.

The "credibility problem"

appears not to have been a significant factor in the post—reform dislocation.

The accelerating iniation rates of the past decade have elicited

propoa1s to implement monetary policies which will eventually stabilize the
price level,

There seems to be a general agreement that the steady-state

costs of the current inflation rate are high and that the rate should be
reduced.1

However, that additional substantial real costs may arise because

of the transition has led some economists to prescribe monetary policies aimed
at reducing such costs through a gradual reduction of the inflation rate.2

Other economists, believing that the transition costs may be low, suggest
policies designed rapidly to move to price stability.3
The nature of the transition costs has strong implications for the kind

of research input required for policy decisions intended to reduce inflation.
If transition costs are low, then one should seek to attain price stability

immediately, without requiring any additional knowledge about 'the steady-state
costs of various inflation rates.

If the transition is costly, then there is

a tradeoff between transitional costs and steady-state costs.

Since only

vague notions about the relative magnitudes of these costs exist, a largescale, time-consuming research effort would have to precede any serious policy
recommendation
Since there are many theories producing as many different predictions
about the effects of transitional policies, sifting through them requires an
examination of historical episodes which display transitions from inflation
to price stability.

5

Of the recent empirical studies concerning the real

effects of such policy shifts, Sargent's (1980) examination of the post-World
War I hyperinflations is most provocative.6

Sargent argues that these extreme
