An Examination of Empirical Tests of
Social Security and Savings

ABSTRACT

The effect of social security and other forms of government debt on

national savings is one of the most widely debated policy questions in

economics today. Some estimates suggest that social security has reduced
U.S. savings by almost forty percent. This paper examines recent cross—
section and time series empirical tests of the social security—savings
question and argues that, given current data, neither type of test has

much potential for settling the controversy. In particular, there are
a number of specification problems relating to social security time series
regressions that can easily lead to highly unstable coefficients and to
rejection of the hypothesis that social security reduces savings, even
if it is actually true.

These points are demonstrated by running regressions on hypothetical
data generated by a perfect foresight life—cycle growth model developed

previously by the authors. While the data is obtained from a model in
which social security reduces the nation's capital stock by almost twenty
percent, time series social security regression coefficients vary enormously
depending on the specified level of the program, the preferences of
hypothetical households, the level of conconmdtant government policies,
and the time interval of the data.

Both models posit rational utility maximizing behavior; the

life cycle model assumes that economic agents are selfish and care only

about their own current and future consumption. The infinite horizon

model assumes that aents are alturistic and care about their descendent's
consumption as well as their own. In a life cycle model since individuals
care only about consumption over their remaining exDected lifetimes, their

marginal propensities to consume out of full available resources will depend

crecially on their age. Intergenerational redistribution of resources

in a life

cycle model will affect aggregate

consumption and, thus, national

savings. In a Barro-type infinitely lived family model, consumption of
family members of a particular age depends not on their own resources, but

rather on total fanhly resources. In a Barro model cohort consumption and

thus aregate consumption is independent of the cross-cohort distribution
of resources.

resources as well as the resources of other cohorts. If resources of
other cohorts significantly affect the consumption of a particular cohort,
the flar'ro view would 'seem" to be supported. If the resources of other

cohorts did not affect a particular cohort's consumption, Feldstein's view
would "seem' to be supported. We use the word "seem" because a finding

that resources of other cohorts did not affect the consuiiption of a particular cohort could be consistent with the Barro view according to the follow-

ing scenario: suppose that the family head at each rrient in time allocates
total resources to the various family merrbers and tells them to consi.ine just

like life cycle consmrs. The Barro family head could, then, always redistribute

family assets in such a way that each family member at each age

looked like he was behaving independently from the others. Such an exact
year—by-year reshuffling of family resources seems unlikely, but is,
none—the—less, a theoretical possibility.

of one cohort to the conszrtion of other cohorts and the resources of one

example of inter—cohort risk pooling. Suppose life cycle agents live for
two periods, and suppose the government indicates at the beginning of one

period that it will announce with probability P a lurip sum transfer from

the young to old at the end of the period, and with probability 1-P a
lump sum transfer from the old to the young at the end of the period. At

the berinirig of the period risk averse old and young cohort rrnbers will

seek to pool this risk arrxng themselves. Since, by assption, there is
no social risk to be absorted collectively by the young and the old, insurance
arrangements permitting, these cohorts will arrange to consume exactly the
same a'Tnunt independent of the eventual goverrnent transfer. Each cohort's
consunption will depend on aggregate resources rather than the cohort

distribution of resources after the government enacts its policy.

If tijr series data on cohort consrrption Is not available and

data Is insufficient, Is there hope that

cross—sectional micro evidence could resolve the controversy? A key problem

with using cross section data is that the data is based on households

rather than families and again certain results that might at first glance
be thought to verify the life cycle theory are also perfectly consistent
with the Barro theory and visa—versa. In this case problems arise because

the cross section data does not distinguish transfers across generations
from

transfers across fnilies. *
To give an exanpie, suppose one found a positive and significant

effect of social security wealth on household consumption in a cross section

regression. While such

is predicted by the life cycle theory,
it is also consistent with Barro's view for the following reason: Those

households with greater than average social security wealth are presumably

members of families that receive greater than average social security wealth;

thus the social security variable is contaminated with inter-family transfers
and these inter—family transfers will Increase the consumption of Barro—type

While a social security wealth coefficient would not help resolve

the issue, other cross section regression experirrents iuight. Under the
life cycle theory, ftr example, the marginal propensity to consume this
period out of all future resources increases with age. This prediction
holds for conventional specification of preferences independent of whether

authors.

8

the date of death is taken to be uncertain and independent of whether

annuity insurance is available. In a Barry ndel the rarginal propensity
to consume out of total fanily resources could increase or decrease by

age. Hence, given the problem that ater household reources may proxy
for

geeater fanily resources, the Barro ndel could not be refuted by a

finding that the marginal propensity to consume increased with age.

suppose one found that the marginal propensity declined with age. Such

a

finding would, we believe, be hard to reconcile with

ifortunately the paucity of U.S. consumption data is not confined
to the macro level; there exists no U.S. micro data set that simultaneously
reports household conscrption and household resources in sufficient detail
to conduct the above described experiment.

In the absence of micro consumption data, economists have naturally

turned to data cn net worth and bequests. Net worth

reflects

in part

consumption, but in addition to accumulated past flows of consumption,

current net orth reflects accumulated flows of net intergenerational

transfers

as

well as patterns of earnings and rates of return that are not

directly related to consumption.

9

Insofar

as net wDrth data reflects past patterns of consunption,

regression coefficients of net worth on social security variables face

tL sane problems of interpretation as regression coefficients of consnption

on social security variables. Thus a finding that social security wealth
depresses private

household net worth accuinulation

is consistent with both

the life cycle and the infinitely—lived family theories of consurption.
Aciln cross—family transfers could make families with greater than average

social security wealth accunulate less private assets than would otheriise
be the case.
Cross section bequest regressions may provide refutable tests of at

least the life cycle theory, but caution is advised here as well. At
first glance the Feldstetn view would seem to be refutable by finding that

the elasticity of bequests with respect to full future resources was

siificantly greater than zero both in the statistical sense and in the
sense of a large number, and that this large elasticity held true at all
levels of resources; that is, for the rich and poor. If bequests represented the only forTn of intergenerational transfers from the old to the
young and there were no transfers from the young to the old, the issue

would be settled. Ce could sirrply take this elasticity, find the per—
centage change in full resources of the aged represented by social security
intergenerational transfers, and conpute how riruch they transferred back.

C-ie might think that siJTply the real world observation that the

elderly at nil lifetime incorr levels leave bequests by itself refutes
the life cycle theory. The answer is not necessarily. First of all the
theory is about net transfer flows. Our data generally details gross

rotflkoff and Spivak (1981) demDnstrate that family risk pooling

behavior, where the risk is the uncertainty of the date of death, could

give rise to bequests as well as transfers from the young to the old. These
transfers can occur even though family members are completely selfish.

Indeed, fauily members could hate each other and still bequeath and transfer

resources to each other simply because of the desire to mitigate the risks
associated with the date of death. The way these implicit family annuity
contracts work is that old fanijy members use their pramise to bequeath in

the event that they die to extract consumption support from their children
as they continue to live. IC the government now comes to this selfish,

but risk pooling family and uses social security to transfer a dollar frcm
the young rrembers to the old members, the family risk sharing deal may be

renegotiated with the old extracting sore support from the young in exchange
for their now larger premised bequest. * The fact that social security

II
corres in the form of an annuity is not fundienta1, since old family

nembers can purctase life insurance to, in effect, transfer those future
streams into a current contingent bequest. In such a Feldstein world one

could find a positive cross sectional coefficient of social security on
bequests despite the fact that the old people end up cons'Lnmtng nxre than

they would otherwise have consi.rd. The old may thus increase their

gross transfers to the young in response to social security while at the
sare tirre expected net transfers from the old to the young decline.
To sunrnarize these general comrents, one must be cautious of any

macro or micro findings that proport to support one theory and, refute the

other because both theories are quite flexible in terms of the sangs
and transfer behavior they can explain and the regression coefficients
they can rationalize. In addition, in cir pre—occupation with Social
Security coefficients we may be overlooking scrne more ñmdamental tests

of the life cycle theory.

several problems. First, the appropriate incaTle Treasure would not include

ratio of the latter to the fonmr decreasing over tiire. Again, these ratios
will depend on the interest and tax rates expected to prevail in the future,
and these surely cannot be assumed constant.

Finally, socIal security wealth as it appears in equations 4) and
(6) should be calculated using the actual path of future net Interest rates;
standard enIrical analyses assume sorr constant discount rates to estimate

social security wealth. Since rates of return will change during the
econcxriy's transition response to social security, this procedure obviously
introduces errors in variables bias.

In surrrnary there appear to be severe difficulties in estimating a
stable relationship between ag-'egate consumption and the various forms of

aggregate wealth when variations in the data reflect changes in tax rates

or savings incentives that disturb net rates of return and the age distribution of different forms of wealth. The theory of unfunded social security
in a life cycle model uriequivocably predicts siguificarit change s in the

time path of Interest rates and the distribution of resources by age.

generations alive during this steady state correctly perceive the tax
schedule and factor prices they will face over time, and behave optimally

20

with respect to these conditions. We utilize a Gauss—Seidel iteration
technique

to solve for

this equilibrium; we start with an initial guess of

the capital labor ratio (K/L), derive in each iteration a new estimate
to update our guess, and continue the procedure until a fixed point is
reached. Given the method of deriving new estimates of VL, such a fixed
point corresponds to a steady—state rational expectations equilibrium.

The foflowirig is a description of how the iteration technique proceeds.

A schematic representation is provided in Figure 1. In the first stage, a
guess is made of the capital—labor ratio (equivalent to a guess of the

capital stock, since labor supply is fixed). Given the marginal productivity
equations (Ba) and (Bb), this yields values for the wage w and interest

rate r. By using the estimate of w , we may then solve for the steady
state level of benefits, SSB as well as the payroll tax,.
necessary

to

,

support those benefits.. Since incne and required goverrrnent revenues

are given a first guess of T is obtained. Fmn the values of r and r,
we then calculate the present values of social security benefits (SsW)
as well as future earnings (HW) . Assuming initial assets to be zero,
we then apply equations (14)

and

(5) to obtain the life—cycle consumption

path of the representative individual, .

From

the definition of

savings, this yields the age—asset profile, A, which may be aggregated
(subtracting any national debt assumed to exist) to provide a new value

of the capital stock and capital-labor ratio. When the initial and final
values of NIL and the tax rate are the same, this implies that the steady
state has been reached.

Solution for the final steady state prtceeds in a similar rranner.
The transition is

solved for in the following way. We assume the transition
to the new steady state takes 150 years, then solve simultaneously for equil-.
ibrium in

each

of the 150 years of the transition period under the assumption
that everyone believes the new steady state will obtain. This solution
method is necessary because each household is assund to take the path of

future prices into account in detennining its behavior. Hence, the equilibrium
that results in later years will a.ffect the equilibrium in earlier years.
Specifically, we assume that Lidividuals born after the transition begins

ow the transition path iriuiediately, and that those born fore the beginning

policy existing cohorts are "born again," they

behave like members

of the new generation except that their horizon is less than fifty—five
years, and they possess initial assets as a result of prior accumulation.

An iteration technique is used ain, but here we must begin with vectors
of capital stocks and tax rates (one pair for each year). Further, we
cannot simply solve for the behavior of a representative cohort, but rather
must calculate the behavior of each cohort alive during the transition.

This procedure, while conceptually no more difficult than that used to find
the steady states, requires considerably more computation. As the ultimate

paths converge to the final steady state well before year 150, the assumption about conditions after year 150 does not influence our results.

As

expected, the introduction of pay—as—you--go social security is

beneficial to initial, retirees under the new system since they receive
benefits and are required to pay no payroll taxes. However, ultimate
crowding out of capital lowers the welfare of individuals, in the long run.
F'iire 3 depicts the path of welfare changes by birth date of particular

cohorts the vertical line in the diagr marks the year of birth of the
cohort born in the year of enactrint. 1900 is taken as the hypothetical
year of enactment. The nurrers on the vertical axis measure the percentage
increase (decrease) in each cohort's lifetime resources that would leave

them with the saiie 1ifetirr level of utility in the absence of social
security as they receive under social security. Thus a cohort born in
1900 at the time of enactjyent suffers a loss in welfare due to social
security that corresponds to a 7 percent reduction in lifetime resources
in a world of no social security.
All retirees at the time of enactment gain; those retiring just at
the time of the enactrrent gain the most, the equivalent of a percent increase

in lifetirr resources; these retirees receive benefits for their entire retire—
iiient period, but pay no taxes whatsoever. The gain to initial

middle—age

generations is smaller, since they must pay payroll taxes, and continues to
decline for successive younger cohorts because of the gradual crowing out
of capital and reduction in wages. The eventual loss in welfare for genera-

tions in

the

new steady state is quite large—about 9 percent. !breover,
this 1Ios COUC3 on quite rapidly. Even cohorts fifteen years old when social
security is introduced are net losers, and individuals born in the year of
enactment lose close to the full long—run amount.

A

more generous social security system would be expected to airçlify

the results just described. This is indeed the case. In fact, the basic
characteristics of the transition are virtually unchanged. Adoption of a
60 percent replacemant rate, rather than the L45 percent rate used in the

baseline simulation, leads to eater gains and losses by those generations
already in these respective categories. The long—run welfare loss is now

12 percent; those just retiring at the tirr of enactnnt gain about 55

per'—

cent, and cohorts age 15 at the tirn of enactment again approximately break

even. The capital stock declines by 22 percent, and the transition is again
quite rapid.

Just as a sir1e increase in replacement rates has little qualitative
effects on the patteni of economic consequences of social security, this is

also tree of a change in preferences. Simulations carried out for values

of y

ranging

betoen .5

and

2 indicated that both the speed of con-

vergence to the new steady state and the ultimate size of capital stock
reduction were comparable to those of the baseline simulation.

In reality, we are never able to observe the effect of a single
isolated fiscal policy change on the economy. Nany policy shocks may be
at work at once, and this fact not only confounds our understanding of how
any on of these policies affects the economy, but may also influence the

coefficients of a tirre series regeession atterrting to "hold constant" the
effects of all but one policy change, such as social security. This latter
iuoblern

is present

because, as discussed above, such regeessions axe mis—

specified and hence are not invariant to policy.

through a tenporary cut in inccxne taxes. This leads to a further decline

IV. Time Series Pr'essions Using Simulated Data
The data generated by the various simulations described in the
previous section are rrucb t)cleanerU than any aggregate data we could hope

to collect from actual observation. There is no nasw-ent error, and
the multitude of other shocks to the system have been assumed
away. Thus,

it is not possible to state with confidence that our madelling of the

effects of social security is or is not realistic. However, these data
may be used to estimate what the tire series regressions coefficients
would be for a Feldstein—type consumption function if indeed the 1extended"

life—cycle model were exactly correct and social security had a major impact

on national saving. If the coefficients of such a controlled regression
prove to be highly unstable, this sh3uld cast doubt on the assumed stability
of tire series coefficients in rrore complicated dynamic econc)-rdes.

Table 1 presents results of rssions on data obtained fran the
baseline sirrulation in which an unfunded social security system with a

percent replacement rate is enacted at tire zero. The dependent variable
in the estimated equation is per capita consumption. The independent
variables are disposable inccne (YD), disposable income lagged (YD1), real
wealth (W), and soca1 security wealth (Ssw), all measured per capita. The

three regeessions in Table 1 differ only with respect to sample period; the

first regression is based on 70 years of data starting ten years prior to
enactment. Regression 2 covers 60 years of data, but begins with data from

the 1'irut year of emmactnent. The third regression is based on data frcn

the year 10 to year 60. The results for the sple period which begins
10 years prior to enactment do not correspond exactly to previous estimates,
