Taxation and On—the—Job Training Decisions

ABSTRACT

This paper is an econometric analysis of the on—the—job training (OJT)

decisions of a group of white American males during 1975. The data are
obtained from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which asked a very careful

series of questions concerning the individual's OJT status. Each individual's
internal rate of return is estimated and used as an explanatory variable

to predict the probability of taking OJT. The individual's marginal tax
rate is also entered in the equation. The results suggest that income
taxation has tended to increase the probability of being involved in OJT.
I conjecture that this is because income taxation makes investment in physical
capital a less desirable vehicle for carrying consumption into the future,
and hence increases the attractiveness of human capital.

Introduction

The rich econometric literature on the impact of taxes upon hours of

work has provided important results for students of tax policy. There is,
however, a tendency to neglect the possibility that taxation may also affect

other dimensions of labor supply. The purpose of this paper is to estimate
the effect of income taxation on the decision to engage in one significant

kind of human capital investment, on-the-job training (OJT). I study the
OJT decisions of a group of white American males during 1975. The results
suggest that income taxes have tended to increase the number engaging in OJT.
Section II discusses some conceptual problems that arise in an attempt

to study econometrically taxes and OJT decisions. A simple theoretical and
econometric framework for analysis is presented in Section III. The data are
described in Section IV, and the results and their implications are laid out

in Section V. A concluding section contains some caveats and suggestions for
future research.

II. Background
Mincer [1974], Heckman [1976] and Blinder and Weiss [19761, among others,
have provided careful theoretical discussions of the determinants of OJT

decisions. The models differ to varying degrees, but they hold in common a
view of OJT as an investment, the amount of which is sensitive to its rate

of return. The econometric literature on the determinants of OJT i quite
thin. Although OJT sometimes appears as an explanatory variable in wage

econometrically is measurement problems. Unlike education, one cannot ask
a simple question to discover how mi'eh of it a. person has accumulated.2 I

attempt to deal with this problem by taking advantage of a special set of
questions asked in the ninth wave of A Panel Study of Income Dynamics (Survey
Research Center, 1976) corresponding to the year 1975:

1. "On a job like yours, how long [in months] would it take the
average 'iew person to become fully qualified?"
2.

"How long [in months] have you held your present position?"

If the answer to the second question is less than or equal to that of the
first, then the individual is classified as being in OJT, and otherwise,

not. On this basis, about 30% of the sample were engaged in OJT.
Do these questions lead to an adequate depiction of the individual's
current OJT status? Duncan and Hoffman [1978,] discuss this issue at length,

but a few remarks seem appropriate here. One can certainly imagine situations in which the Panel Study responses will produce misleading inferences.
For example, while those observed not to be in OJT at a point in time might
be past the time of any further investment, they might also be on the verge

of taking new jobs which will involve more OJT. Unfortunately, given the
absence of similar questions on OJT for subsequent years, it is impossible

Of course, even for education the measurement issue is not straightforward,

to determine the likelihood of such classification errors.4
Another problem with the questions is that they tell us nothing about
the intensity with which individual.; undertake OJT. It is quite possible,
for example, that even those who claim to be doing no OJT are actually devoting some fraction of their potential earnings to human capital forma-

tion, albeit a very small one. It may be useful, then, to think of the
dichotomous

variable derived from the Panel Study questions as telling us
5

whether or not the individual devotes a "substantial" amount of time to OJT.
Finally, one should note that for purposes of this paper, it is un—
necessary to interpret the answer to question 1 as an exact value of the

length of the OJT period. All that is required is information on whether
the training period is longer than the individual's tenure, so that the OJT
classificatiOn can

be

made.

It is clear, then, that the survey questions do not provide a perfect
indicator of an individual's OJT status. I think, however, that it is a
significant improvement over other measures available for a representative
samrle of individuals, and is worth exploiting.

It is often the case that the value of a dichotomous variable indicates
the individual is pursuing more than some threshhold amount of an activity,as
opposed to a zero amount. For example, many individuals report that they give
"no" charitable contributions, when, in fact they give small positive amounts.

that

assumptions on the nature of the prcess that generated the profile.6 In
this paper, I adopt one of Mincer's Ll974] formulations, the advantages and
disadvantages of which are discussed in the next section.
The complications brought about by introducing taxes into this situation
can be illustrated by a simple two-period model of lifetime utility maximiza-

tion. Eaton and Rosen (1980] have shown that even in such a simple model, the
direction of the impact of an income tax upon human capital accumu].ation is

ambiguous. Intuitively, because the tax influences the utilization rate of
OJT, i.e., hours of work, it changes the rate of return to OIJT. Due to the
familiar conflict of income and substitution effects, however, the effect of
an income tax upon hours of work is itself ambiguous, and therefore so is the

impact upon human capital accumulation. The unearned income component of the
income tax introduces an additional effect. By making physical capital a less
desirable vehicle for carrying consumption into the future, it increases the
attractiveness of human capital investment, ceturis paribus.7
Even in a very simple model, then, the impact of taxes upon the OJT

decision cannot be known a priori. The framework of this paper allows the
data to determine the effect.

Although the OJT decision is made i a lifetime context, the Panel Study
questions give us only a snapshot ol each

individual

in

the

year 1975.

If the answer to the Panel Study qustion indicates that the individual
is involved' in OJT during 1975, it is assumed that he is in the midst
of a spell of OJT, and that his wage can be explained by the human capi-

tal wage generating model described below. The wages of individuals who
are not in OJT are assumed to be governed by the same type of process, but

it is expected that their age-wage profiles are much flatter. Such individuals
may be past the time in which they invested substantially in OJT, or they may
have chosen career paths which never included it at all.8
All models of optimal human capital accumulation imply that a key variable

driving an individual's OJT decision is its internal rate of return. This
suggests the following two—step procedure for investigating OJT decisions:

(1)

Estimate for each individual in the sample the internal rate of return to OJT.
(2) Estimate the responsiveness of the probability of taking OJT to the rate of

return and the individual's tax situation. These issues are now discussed in turn.

A.

The Internal Rate of Return to OJT
As stressed above, the internal rate of return cannot be directly observed.

It can be inferred from age-wage profiles, and such inference requires that an

explicit wage generating model be specified. Mincer's [1974] formulation is
tractable, yields interesting results, and has been employed in a wide variety

of contexts. Under certain conditions, the

th individual's wage rate (w.)

is related to his years of education (ED.) and job experience (EXP.) by the
relation

As noted above, we are unable to account for the possibility that some of
8.
those not in OJT happen to be caught in the period after the completion of some
training and before the beginning of additional training.

portion of potential wages devoted to OJT, T is the number of years
over which OJT takes place, and p is the increment to potential earnings each period that follows from a $1 increase in expenditure (in terms
of foregone earnings) on OJT.

The wage function (3.1) is derived on the basis of a number of quite

restrictive assumptions. For example, the proportion of potential earnings
devoted to OJT is assumed to decline linearly with time, rather than determined

by choice theoretic considerations)0 Unfortunately, attempts to add more
"realistic" assumptions to the human capital generating story have lead to nonlinear specifications that are barely tractable from an estimation point of
view.

(See, e.g., Haley [1976].) In light of its simplicity and widespread use

in other contexts, I adopt (3.1).

11

The wage generating equation applies both to those who are engaged in OJT
and those who are not, but one expects that the parameter values will differ between

the two groups. Therefore, (3.1) is estimated separately for each)2 Specifically,

The assumptions behind this formulation are discussed carefully by Mincer
[1974]. He uses earnings as the dependent variable, but as Blinder [1976] has pointed
out, in the presence of variable hours of work, the wage is more appropriate.

jointly.

12. Since the decision to take OJT is endogenous, there is a possibility that the
estimated parameters may be inconsistent due to selectivity bias. However, application of the test suggested by Heckman [1979] indicates that such bias is not a
problem in this sample. (In the wage generating equation for each group, the ratio
of the coefficient on the inverse Mill's ratio to its standard error is less than
0.5 in absolute yalue.)

I append a normal error to each euuation, and estimate the parameters by
maximum likelihood.
Although our main point of interest in (3.1) is the parameter p
one should note that it is not quite the variable that drives the OJT de-

cision. As Blinder [1976, p. 12] has pointed out, standard theoretical
considerations suggest that the

F estimated fron (3.1), information on the individual's age, and an
assumption on the age of retirement (R=65), r is straightforward to
a

compute.
With estimates of r for all members of the sample in hand, the only
remaining step is to estimate how it affects the probability of taking
OJT.

According to Equation (3.3) the internal rate of return captures all

the information that is needed to make the OJT decision. One could argue
that "tastes" for OJT might differ amonq

characteristics should be ,*rlcluded. The notion that personal character-

istics are "proxies" for the individual's access to capital markets would lead

to the same conclusion. In order t avoid colinearity problems and to keep the
specification as simple as possible, I conducted only a limited amount of in-

vestigaon along these lines.14

In some experiments, (3.3) was augmented with

a non—labor income variable. This was intended to be a rough measure of nonhuman wealth, which might be related to the extent of the individual's access to
capital markets, his tastes for human capital investment, and/or his attitudes
toward risk.

B.

Taxes

As shown in Section II, economic theory puts no constraints on how taxation

affects the rate of return to human capital investments. Ideally, one would want
to estimate how each of the various tax effects discussed there influences the OJT
decision., To do so would require the construction of structural equations for

hours of work, savings, the rate f return to OJT, and the OJT decision itself.

Such a program is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, I merely hypothesize
that the probability of taking OJT is some function of both the pre-tax internal

rate of return and the tax rate. At the outset it is assumed that the relation-

ship

are age, number of children, education, non—lat)or

IV. Data

The data are observations for the ninth wave of the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics, correspondinq to the year 1975 Ilnstitute for Socialsearch.,.l976j.
The sample consists of wiuite males under the age of bS, who were salied or paid
y the hour and not employed in agriculture. A few observations were omitted because of missing data on one or more of the variables, leaving a total of 1554.
The variables that appear in (3.1) are the wage, experience and educa-

tion. The pre-tax wage is found by adjusting the Survey Research Center's
hourly wage rate by a deflator to account for regional differences in

price levels. Experience (EXP) is measured as years the individual has
spent in the labor force since age 18. Education (ED) is also measured

in years. The following are the other exogenous variablessed to form
the fitted value of the marginal tax rate: AGE = age in years CHILDREN
= number of children living at home; NE = 1 if individual was raised in

Survey Research Center. (No attempt is made to correct f or state and local income
taxes.)

The mean values of the variables conditional upon the OJT decision

and for the entire sample are reported in Table IV.l. One observation from the

table is particularly noteworthy Although the individuals classified as OJT
takers,, are younger than those who are not, the mean difference is only about 4.5

years. The survey responses thus appear to be indicativeof something other
than just age differences.

errors of the estimates are computed by taking the square roots of the diagonal elements of the negative inverse Hessian matrix of the log likelihood

function. Elements of the Hessian ire in turn calculated as numerical differences of various log likelihood values. Unfortunately, the likelihood
function turns out to be rather flat around the maximum value20, and

the second partials are therefore quite sensitive to the size of the intervals over which these differences were taken. One cannot, then, attach great
confidence to the accuracy of the standard errors, although they are presented along with the parameter estimates below.

I report in the first column of Table V.1 the results when the wage equation is estimated using the subsample of all individuals in OJT.

The esti-

mates seem fairly reasonable. The approximately 5% rate of return to schooling
is somewhat below values that have been reported in other studies

Mincer

[l97].) The value for p implies that when an indiyidual deyotes 1 additional dollar of foregone income to OJT, his earnings increase by 12 cents er
year for the rest of his life. A similar value is found by Mincer when he
estimates a linear version of (3.1) and assumes T=20 (Mincer [1974], p. 94).

The estimate of k

suggests that about a third of an individual's potential

initial earnings are devoted to OJT, which is slightly below Mincer's figure

of 0.42. The value of T indicates that QJT continues over a period of about
26

years.

marginal tax rate are entered linearly.
Some equations were estimated with an
interaction term. This term did not
contribute significantly to the explanatory
power of the equation, and its inclusion rendered all the coefficients
unstable.
(The t—statjstjc on the interaction
term was 1.27.) In this sample, at least,

gives

to

substitute human for physical capital as a means for carrying consumption into
the

future. (In the next section I discuss the quantitative significance of the

coefficient.)

In column 2, the individual's non-labor income is added to the probit equation.
The estimated coefficient suggests that increases in physical wealth are associated

with a lower probability of taking OJT. Although the inclusion of wealth leaves
the qualitative picture unchanged, it has a dramatic effect on the magnitude of

the tax effect. This is a consequence of the colinearity introduced by the
fact that NLINC is one of the instruments used to form t .

The question of the

suitability of NLINC as an instrument thus arises. In a life-cycle model, asset
accumulation is the subject of choice. Indeed, in such models doubts can be
cast upon the exogeneity of practically any variable. If the variables used to

form t are endogenous, it is not clear that using the fitted value is any
better than using t itself. I therefore re-estimated the probit equation using
the actual marginal tax rate rather than the fitted value.

(See columns 3 and 4.)

The main qualitative conclusion is the same —- an increase in the marginal tax
rate

increases the probability

of taking

OJT. But the quantitative results are much

more in line with those of column 1.

enormously.

I somewhat arbitraril'; choose the coefficients of column (1)

as the basis for exploring the quantitative implications of the results.

Perhaps the most sensible way to d this is to use the coefficients
some

for

simple simulations. The problem is to determine how the

number of men doing OJT would vary under tax systems with rate schedules

different from those now in effect. For each individual in the sample, I
use the probit equation from column 1 of Table V.2 to predict the probability

of taking OJT, and multiply it by the individual's sample weight. I then
recalaulate the probability of taking OJT, with marginal tax rates 20% and
33% below those currently faced, and again multiply by sample weights.

The simulation results are reported in Table V.3. They suggest that
if marginal tax rates were reduced by a third, the number of white men
taking OJT would decrease by about

2.4%.

The proportional decrease is

greater for those over than under the age of 40 --

about 6.7% to 0.8%.

For those who attended college, the tax induced decrease in the incidence
of OJT is about the same as that for the population as a whole. The smaller
tax cut of 20% brings about a smaller decrease in the proportion of white
men taking OJT, about 1.7%.

Given the absence of other empirical studies of the tax impact upon
human capital decisions, it is hard to determine whether or not these
magnitudes are "reasonable." They seem to inc to be well within the bounds

as OJT takers or non-OJT takers. flincer's [1974] simple but elegant theory
of human capital was employed to e:timate internal rates of return to

OJT. This internal ra1e of return, along with a tax variable, were used
to explain the OJT decision in a probit equation. I found that the income tax tends to increase the probability that an individual engages

in OJT. A decrease in marginal tax rates of one—third would decrease the
incidence of OJT among white males by 2.4%.
The normative implications of this findino are not entirely clear.
There have recently been claims that increases in federal income tax rates
have generated serious decreases in the accumulation of physical capital

(Boskin [1978]). Such analyses have ignored human capital accumulation.
The results of this paper suggest that reductions in physical capital may

have been accompanied by tax induced increases in human capital. Obviously,
the two effects do not cancel out --

taxation

distorts both decisions away

from their first best values. Estimates of the welfare cost of income taxation
should be extended to take into account human capital effects.24

24. An attempt along these lines using simulation techniques is reported in
Driffill and Rosen [19811.
