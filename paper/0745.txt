Financing Capital Formation in the l980s: Issues for Public Policy

ABSTRACT
Three specific aspects of the corporate financing decision — internal
versus external funds, equity versus debt within the external component, arid

features of the debt including especially maturity — present opportunities
(and pitfalls) for public policy for affecting U.S. capital formation.

First, by reducing the government's dissaving and hence its claims on
the economy's financial resources, policy can make credit market funds available
for corporations to finance their investment externally, thereby both stimulating the overall amount of capital formation and also taking advantage of the
allocative efficiency of the competitive market mechanism to achieve a produc-

tive composition of that capital formation. At the same time, by using the tax
system to augment the rate of return on corporate—sector assets, policy can
also enable corporations better to compete for such funds once they are available.
Second, by eliminating or even reversing the current tax discrimination

in favor of debt, policy can encourage corporations to rely at least in part
on equities in their external financing, thereby reducing the economy's
aggregate-level financial risk.

Third, by neutralizing or even reversing the current emphasis on long—
term securities in managing the federal government's own debt, policy can
encourage corporations to issue long— instead of short—term debt instruments,

thereby further reducing aggregate-level financial risk. Along the same lines,
policy can also play a role in pioneering markets for new financial instruments,
like bonds providing protection of the investor's purchasing power, that
private borrowers can then use to finance private capital formation.

FINANCING CAPITAL FORMATION IN THE 1980s: ISSUES FOR PUBLIC POLICY

Benjamin M. Friedman*

Increased American capital formation has emerged as a nearly undisputed

objective of economic policy for the 1980s. Dissatisfaction with the U.S.
economy's poor productivity performance in the l97Os, as well as with the
erosion of international competitiveness that began much earlier but also
became more evident in the 1970s with the dramatic declines in the international exchange value of the dollar, has elevated what was once largely a business

interest into a much more widely shared goal. In today's environment groups
representing labor and consumers also recognize the need for capital investment
to create jobs and to raise productivity and hence the population's overall

standard of living. On the whole, public discussion has moved from whether
more capital formation is desirable to what policies can best achieve it.
An important aspect of capital formation that this discussion has

often overlooked, however, is its explicitly financial side. In an economy
like that of the United States, each decision to create more physical capital

necessarily has a financial counterpart. This financial counterpart may be
a single transaction, but in an economy with highly developed financial
markets it is more likely to be an entire chain of obligations and transfers

leading from an ultimate saver to an ultimate investor. In the end the
financial and nonfinancial systems interact so that the allocation of the

economy's real resources —whether to make consumer goods or producer goods,
for example, or how much and what kind of each — exactly corresponds to its
allocation of financial resources.

The financial aspect of the capital formation process is especially

—2—

important in a public policy context for two reasons. First, the financial
transactions associated with capital formation are not merely a reflection of
real resource allocations that would necessarily come about in any case.
The setting in which the financing of capital formation takes place can also
be a key determinant of real resource allocations, including not only the

total amount of capital formation but also its composition. The financial
and the nonfinancial elements of the process jointly determine one another,
and public policy may affect the ultimate outcome by influencing either.
Indeed, financial aspects of private capital formation decisions, like a firm's
after-tax borrowing costs, may be much more readily subject to public policy
influence than physical aspects like the production rates of the latest machine
models.

A second reason why the financial side of capital formation is so
important for public policy is that, when financial markets are as fully
integrated into the economy's life pulse as they are in the United States,
fragility of the financial structure can pose major hazards for the entire

economic system. Moreover, there are sound. reasons for believing that the
considerations determining the actions of individual financial market participants do not adequately reflect potential threats to the system as a whole
from too brittle a financial structure at the aggregate level.

Financial

structure is therefore a kind of "public good" in the familiar sense that
an individual's (or individual firm's) actions bear "externalities" potentially

affecting everyone else. Because there is no reason for the presence of
such externalities to affect directly the decisions of individual financial

market participants, there is a role for public policy in providing incentives
that will in the end lead to a more satisfactory aggregate financial structure.
The object of this paper is to consider, from the financial perspective,

—3—

both the setting of and the prospects for Pxnerican capital formation in the

l980s, and to focus in particular on the opportunities (and pitfalls) for

public policy. Section I reviews the evolution of investment and saving in
the United States during the last quarter—century and emphasizes the connection

between the allocation of physical and financial resources. Section II examines
in detail the financing of investment through the economy's nonfinancial corporate business sector, which historically has accounted for nearly three—quarters

of all U.S. investment in plant and equipment. Section III develops more
fully the concept of externalities associated with private financial actions

and the resulting role for public policy. Section IV focuses on three specific

aspects of corporate financing decisions —

internal

versus external funds,

equity versus debt within the external component, and the maturity of the

debt — and identifies in each case the issues for public policy. Section V
provides a brief summary of the paper's principal conclusions.

—4—

I. Physical Capital Formation and Financial Capital Formation
The principal development that has spurred interest in increased U.S.
capital formation as a goal for the 1980s has been the economy's deteriorating
productivity performance, in conjunction with its declining rate of net invest-

ment in productive plant and equipment. The productivity of labor in the U.S.
nonfarm private business sector increased by 2.6% per annum during 1948—65,

and 2.2% per annum during 1965-73, but only 0.6% per annum during l973_79.1
Although neither 1978 nor 1979 was a recession year, labor productivity declined
absolutely in both, marking the first two-year continuous productivity fall

in U.S. postwar history. With a recession in 1980, productivity has now
declined for still a third successive year.

In principle, any or all of a number of potential explanations may
help to account for the U.S. productivity slowdown.2 There is evidence that

the rate of technical progress has slowed, probably as a result of the trend
away from research and development activities undertaken by industry.

There

is also evidence that both capital and labor resources have become less
mobile, and hence less able to adapt to changing technologies and consumer

tastes. Demographic factors were rendering the labor force progressively
younger, and hence less experienced and less skilled, until the very end of

the 1970s. Government regulation has added increased burdens to production,
importantly so in many industries. Slower output growth per se also typically
exerts downward pressure on productivity, and the 1970s were a recession—

prone, slow—growth era, at least in comparison with the l960s.3
The increased attention to the nation's capital formation rate, how-

ever, has brought into a single focus the role of capital — that is, plant

and equipment —

in

the basic production of goods and services. Although

economists investigating the production process have often found the role of

—5—

capital frustratingly difficult to quantify, both economic theory and empirical evidence make clear that fixed

capital is essential to production in the

modern economy.4 Table 1 shows the experience of investment in plant and
equipment in the United States during the

past quarter-centu, by five—year

spans (as well as for the single year 1980, to indicate
the starting point

for today's policy environment). The table shows not Only gross investment
in plant and equipment but also the corresponding net investment after subtraction of capital consumption allowances adjusted to reflect true economic

depreciation. The table shows these totals both in absolute dollar amounts
and as percentages of gross national product in each year.
The experience reviewed in the bottom panel of Table 1 in particular
suggests clearly why capital formation has received increased attention as
the economy's productivity performance has slipped during the l970s.

gross investment in plant and equipment has moved to
share of the nation's total

Although

a progressively larger

gross national product, the corresponding net

investment has shown a sharp reversal since

the late l960s. Indeed, by the

late l970s the share of total output devoted to net investment in plant and
equipment was almost back to the level of the

of the capital stock had fallen back

late l950s, and the growth rate

accordingly. In light of the economy's

declining net capital formation rate, it is

hardly surprising that the

amount of capital available to each employed u.s. worker has actually declined
since 1974 after rising steadily at 3% per annum during the previous
twentyfive years.
Moreover, even the dramatic decline in the net investment rate shown
in these statistics may understate the true extent of the effective reduction

in the economy's productive capital investment. One reason is that at least
part of net capital outlays in recent years have gone into special investments
that protect the environment, or enhance workers' health and safety, but do

not otherwise increase capacity to produce the items included in conventional

measures of output and productivity. In addition, the sharply higher price
of energy relative to the prices of other inputs to the production process
(especially labor) has changed the appropriate mix of those inputs to be used,

so that substantial amounts of labor-saving but

energy—consuming capital are

no longer economical.5
Increasing the economy's investment rate is, at one level, a matter

of the allocation of real resources. Although additional capital increases
the economy's productive capacity once it is available for use, in the short
run resources are fixed, and devoting more to any one use means devoting less

to something else. Devoting a larger share of output to business fixed investment than the 1980 level of 11.3% would require devoting a smaller share to
consumer spending (63.7% in 1980), or to purchases of goods and services by

federal or state and local governments (7.6% and 12.8%, respectively), or
to residential investment (4.0%).6
Increasing the economy's investment rate is also a matter of the alloca-

tion of financial resources, however. An important key to understanding the
functioning of any economy is the truism that, on an ex post basis, the

economy's saving must equal its investment. Since it is unlikely in a decentralized market economy that ex ante plans for saving and investment will
precisely balance one another, the market mechanism must influence the decisions
of businesses and consumers so as to change these inconsistent ex ante plans

into consistent ex post actions. Financial markets play a large role in this
mechanism, generating adjustments in the real yield which the market pays
to savers as suppliers of funds and in the cost and availability factors which

confront those who demand funds to invest in productive plant and equipment,

office buildings, inventories, and residential construction. If plans to

availability and a decline in yields. If plans

leads to reduced availability

and higher yields. The result is that, ex post, saving equals investment.

Table 2 shows the balance of

saving and investment in the United

States during the past twenty—five years, scaled in relation to the
gross
national product as in the lower panel of Table 1. It is clear from the

table that during this period

there has been no trend at all in the economy's

total gross saving or total gross investment (which equals total
except for statistical discrepancy) in
The 15-16% range has held

spending.

remarkably steady throughout.7

Several important changes have occurred, however. Behind the steadi-

ness of the total gross saving

rate, the gross private saving rate has shown

some tendency to increase while government as a whole has moved from a
neutral
position to that of persistent
dissaving. Within the private sector, capital
consumption allowances have risen, even after adjustment to reflect the true

economic depreciation, so as to

account for essentially all of the increase

in the gross private saving

rate. Personal saving as a share of gross national
product has varied irregularly, as
movements in the rate of personal
saving
out of disposable personal income have sometimes offset and sometimes
compounded
movements in the share of gross national
product represented by disposable
income itself. Undistributed
corporate profits have increased in relation

to gross national product during the l970s, but here essentially all
of the
increase has consisted of artificial

profits due to price inflation for firms

treating inventories on a first—in-first-out

basis. Within the government

sector, continually growing surpluses among state and local governments
(consolidated to include retirement

funds) have offset about half of the

growing deficits at the federal level.8
Because of the key role played by the federal governmentts dissaving
in affecting the economy's overall

balance of saving and investment, it is

useful to focus on this one development in

somewhat greater detail. Total

federal government expenditures have risen steadily as a share of
gross

national product over the last quarter_century, from 18.4% during 1956—60

to 22.0% during 1976-80. This relative growth of federal expenditures has
itself reflected the net result of

two sharp but opposing trends, as federal

purchases of goods and services have

represented a steadily declining share

of gross national product (from 11.2% to 7.3%) and federal transfer
payments

a steadily rising share (6.0% to 12.9%).

Both the goods and services purchases,

which represent the govermnnt's own use of economic resources, and the transfers, which represent the government's redirection of claims on these resources

within the private economy, must be financed.
The federal government's receipts from taxes and Social Security
contributions have also increased in relation to the overall economy over
these years, but only from 18.4% of gross national product during 1956—60

to 20.0% during 1976—80. The shortfall
federal expenditures, shown in Table 2

from the corresponding growth of

as a steadily growing negative surplus,

has therefore represented a direct absorption of the private saving available

to finance investment. To the extent that the government itself has undertaken
investment activities, however

including either infrastructure investments

like highways and bridges, or directly productive investments like hospitals

and power facilities — the
familiar private investment data shown in Table

2

understate the economy's overall investment total.
On the gross investment side in Table 2, the one clear trend during this

period has been the increasing share of

output devoted to gross investment in

plant and equipment, as already indicated in Table 1. Apart from the typically
cyclical characteristics of the single year 1980, which depressed homebuilding
and induced an inventory run—off, there has been little trend in the other
two components of private domestic investment.

II. Focus on the Corporate Sector
In the U.S. economy many kinds of institutions as well as individuals

undertake investment in plant and equipment, but the dominant source of this
investment has traditionally been incorporated firms doing business in nonfinancial industries including manufacturing, natural resource extraction, transportation, communication, and public utilities and other nonfinancial services.
As Table 3 shows, nonfinancial business corporations have consistently accounted
for nearly three—fourths of all U.S. plant and equipment investment. No other
single readily identifiable group has even accounted for as much as 10% of the

total — although
the miscellaneous category, presumably a catch-all for individuals
and unincorporated firms apart from farms, has consistently represented some

10-15%. While the remaining one—fourth of investment is hardly unimportant,
any major increase in U.S. fixed investment activity is likely in
large part to involve the nonfinancial corporate business sector.
Just as the corporate sector bulks large in the nation's total plant
and equipment investment, investing in plant and equipment represents a large

share of the corporate sector's activity. As Table 4 shows, nonfinancial
business corporations typically use far more funds for physical investment
than for financial investment, and plant and equipment is by far the dominant

focus among corporate—sector physical investments)0 The table also shows
that the increase in total U.S. plant and equipment investment as a share
of gross national product indicated in Table 1 has been entirely due to

the corporate sector. The increase from 9.8% of the nation's output devoted
to gross investment in plant and equipment in the late l950s to 11.0% in the
late l970s has simply reflected the corresponding increase from 6.9% to 8.1%
in corporate—sector plant and equipment investment in relation to gross national
product.

Almost any kind of financial

financial markets is that, in

so doing, they also perform an important alloca—

tive function. At the aggregate level the market mechanism determines
the
overall amount of the economy's
income to be saved, and hence the overall
amount of its output to be devoted to

augmenting the physical capital stock.

At the underlying level of the micro-unit, the same process enables
a multi-

tude of individuals and institutions
invested efficiently

to allocate the total amount saved and

among countless potentially productive projects.13

This key role in efficiently
constitutes the fundamental rationale

tive financial markets. In

allocating the economy's scarce resources
underlying the very existence of competi—

centrally planned economies, for example, the fiat

approach is also generally capable of

commandeering resources from various

sources and transferring them to designated

applications. Without competitive

markets, however, the efficiency of the resulting resource allocation rests
entirely on the centralized information

gathering and decision making process.'4

By contrast, a competitive market system utilizes each individual market
participant's information (and preferences) in

arriving at the prices of

and yields on the full range of financial assets and liabilites. These
prices
and yields in turn provide the
signals and incentives that induce individual
savers to direct their savings toward the

ultimate real investments that the

market as a whole considers most valuable.
When individuals (or the intermediary agents acting in their behalf)

decide which firm's equities to buy, or to which firm to lend via securities
or other loan arrangements, they do so on the basis of the prospects for return

and the apparent risks associated with

that firm's equities or debt claims.

—15—

For firms in nonfinancial businesses, however, the prospective returns and

risks associated with its securities mostly reflect the returns and risks
associated with the firm's underlying real activity, based on its physical
assets, its human resources, its organization,

and other features of its

business. If a firm's managers believe that it can expand in ways that will
generate unusually high returns,

they will advance financial resources

hence the more financing it does — the
more
important this public good becomes.

of public policy influence.

The likely
avenues of Policy influence in this area lie with the
tax code's treatment
of the respective costs
and returns associated with
debt and equity instruments.
Probably the greatest such
single influence in the United States in recent
years has been the discrimination

between debt and equity forms of pay—out

at the corporate level under the corporate
profit tax.25 Because the tax

code

allows interest payments (but not dividends)
as a deduction from corporate profit taxes, in
most circuInstces a corporation can reduce the
total
taxes due from its
operations by financing its assets with debt instead of

equity. Moreover, the interaction of the tax code and

accelerating price

inflation has made this

discrimination all the more Powerful in recent years,
as nominal interest rates have
risen to reflect the inflation
premium necessary to compensate lenders for the
reduction in the real value of their
principal.

It is impossible to know the extent to which the
tax code's discrimination in favor of debt
and against equity has accounted for the observed
pattern of corporate external
financing. Even so, it is clear that eliminating
this discrimination would at least remove

including not only currently

Prevailing interest rates but also its expectations
of interest rate movements in the future. At the simplest
level, the relevant
comparison is not between today's
twenty—year bond rate and ninety—day paper
rate, but rather between the bond rate and the (risk-adjusted)
expected cost
of renewing short—term paper for twenty years. In reality the
comparison
is far more complex, because
a decision to issue short-term
paper today still
leaves open the possibility of
issuing long-term bonds in the future. The
available empirical evidence indicates that, in deciding the
maturity of
debt offerings, U.S. corporations respond to interest rate
considerations
along just these lines.26
The federal government is also a borrower in these markets,

however,

and evidence suggests that the government has at least some significant
ability to influence the relative interest

rates on short- and long-term

instruments by the management of its own debt.27 Because lenders are not
