September 1981

Have Black Labor Market Gains
Post—1964 Been Permanent or Transitory?

ABSTRACT

One of the most important questions regarding black economic

gains post—1964 is whether they are permanent or transitory. This study
examines the relative economic progress of black cohorts and of individual
black workers in longitudinal samples to evaluate the permanence of

changes. It finds that the preponderance of evidence runs against the

proposition that the post—1964 advances have br transitory or illusory.
Measured by earnings of workers and occupational attainment, blacks have

continued to make significant progress in the 1970s. Measured by the
increase in earnings of speciEic cohorts, black gains did not dissipate
due to slow growth of earnings.

The question of whether the labor market gains of black workers
which followed in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and diverse
governmental and private antibias activities are permanent or transitory

has recently begun to receive attention. Some claim that blacks have
experienced a drop in economic position in the sluggish economy of the
1/

1970s.

Others assert that recent gains are illusory, transitory in thc

sense that as the young black cohorts for whOm gains have been most noticeable
age, they fail to obtain the same salary increases as whites, falling
2/

back to their previous relative economic status.

To what extent are these claims supported by the data? How have black
workers, particularly the young cohorts of the late 1960s—early 1970s
who made unprecedented ecOnomic gains compared to whites in wages, occupational
attainment, and earnings (but not in the chances of being employed)

fared in the ensuing decade
This study uses six

different

data sets: the Naticnal Longitudinal

Survey of Young Men ("Parnes" survey), the National Longitudinal Survey of
the High School Graduates in the Class of'1972, the March Current Population
Survey tapes, the May Current Population Survey tapes, the 1962 and 1973
Occupational Change in a Generation surveys, and the Michigan Panel Survey
of Income Dynamics to evaluate the cohort or longitudinal progress of

black workers post—1964. Since any evaluation of post—1964 changes depends
not simply on what happened after the antibias effort but also before, an
effort is made to contrast the longitudiLLal/cohort progress of blacks

post—1964 with progress in earlier dec&des. The paper concentrates on
young male workers for whom age—earnings profiles have historically been
3/
steep, and for whom lack of earnings growth 'is potentially most severe.
The major finding of the paper is that, while there are measures
of economic position and groups for whom retrogression is observed, the
preponderance of evideace runs against the proposition that the post—1964

—2—

of workers
advances have been transitory or illusory. Measured by earnings

and

occupational

attainment, blacks have continued to make significant

progress. in the 1970s.

Measured by the increase in earnings of specific

cohorts, black gains did not dissipate due to slow growth of earnings
so as to make the heralded progress 'illusory'.
This is not to deny that in certain aspects of their economic position,

blacks encountered serious problems in the 1970s: because of continued
decreases in the proportion of black families with male heads of house—

hold, black family incomes did not rise relative to white family incomes;
in the 1970s, despite increases in black incomes relative to white incomes

among

irAividuals

an employment crisis did develop for young blacks, par-

ticularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds; and the earnings of some
black workers did not increase as rapidly as those of whites.

Overall, however, the general picture that emerges from a wide
body of empirical analysis is of either continued progress, or at least
lack of retrogression in the gains accrued earlier.

The paper first reviews the aggregate evidence on black labor
market progress in the 1970s, and as a benchmark for comparison, earlier

decades as well. After that, it examines the earnings position of persons
with specified characteristics and of persons in a given cohort in Census

of Population and Current Population Survey (CPS) data sets. Then the
paper presents a detailed analysis of cohort progress in the CPS and lon-

gitudinal data sets. There is a brief summary and conclusion.
Changes in the 1970s

As a starting point for evaluating black economic progress in
the 1970s, Table 1 summarizes readily available evidence from the Census

of Population and Current Population Survey. It records ratios of black
to white incomes/earnings/occupational representation in the earlier post—
World War II years for which data are available, in 1964, in 1969, and in

1978—79. The final column records the change in the relevant ratios in the
1970s period of concern. Due to differences between Census of Population
and CPS income data, comparisons should be limited to data from the same

source: accardingly, in several of the more detailed contrasts, I have
reported figures from both data sets.

The table tells a clear story about the 1970s. If the black position
in the labor market deteriorated in the period, the changes in ratios in

Column 5 would be negative. They are not. They are, with one exception,
4/

positive: in several cases, rather substantively so. As many have noted,
blacks traditionally suffer more in weak labor markets than whites. Since

the latter part of the 1970s, in particular, was a period of sluggish over1
economic performance, whereas 1969 was a peak boom year, the continued
positive trend in black economic position occurred despite cyclical forces
operating against blacks, which makes the 1970s trends particularly impressive
as indicative of substantial underlying economic changes.

Qhile the Table 1 data tell a reasonably clear story about earnings
and occupational progress in the 1970s labor market, they do not tell the

entire story. In two important areas of economic position there were
serious problems.

First, while individual black earners, both male and female had
earnings gains, black family incomes stabilized relative to white family in-

comes. In 1968 the ratio of black to white family incomes was 64%; in 1978,
it was 64%. The reason for this lack of improvement is, as noted by the
5/

Bureau of Census,

that the proportion of homes with male heads of house-

holds declined at a much thore rapid pace for blacks than for whites. Relative
family incomes,while important for. social reasons, are of course an erroneous
measure with which to judge changes in labor market discrimination over the
period.

The second and equally serious change in black economic position

-6-

has been the reduced labor participation and measured unemployment, par-

ticularly among the young. In 1964 the black male civilian employment/
population ratio stood at .73; in 1969, it was .73; in 1979 it was .64.

By contrast, for white males, the ratio went from .78 (1964) to .78 (1969)

to .75 (1979). As noted elsewhere, the youth unemployment problem of
the decade was one of increasing relative worsening in the black youth
position, for reasons that no one has yet satisfactorily explained.
Fbr black workers with the same job over the year, particularly
full—time workers, however, the 1970s was a period of progress, as shown
in Table 1.

Cohort economic

advance

That black/white income ratios rose for workers overall or with
given characteristics does not imply that the ratios improved for specific

cohorts as they aged in the 1970s. It is possible that particular groups
obtained sizeable gains in the late 1960s—early 1970s which, for whatever reason, dissipated thereafter. As with other period comparisons,
however, it is important to examine the 1970s changes in income ratios

for cohorts from the perspective of earlier cohort changes. It is possible,
for example, that black cohorts, particularly the youngest where the minimum
wage cuts most importantly, have traditionally experienced less rapid

increases in income as they age than white cohorts. If this pattern were
to weaken in the l970s, one would not want to misinterpret an improvement
in traditional cohort patterns as evidence of 'transitory' gains.

Evidence on the economic progress of specific cohorts prior to the
1970s is exceedingly sparse with evidence on cohort advance prior to 1964
essentially limited to Census of Population data and the 1962 Occupational

Change in a Generation Survey. Accordingly, any analysis of data to obtain
a benchmark for comparison must be exceedingly circumspect. We can, per—.
haps, identify broad patterns but no more than that to use as a measuring

—7—

rod for later, changes.

Panel A of Table 2 sunnnarizes the relevant Census of Population

data on how specified age cohorts progressed in the 1950s and 1960s. It
tells a somewhat different story of cohort income progress in the two

decades, particularly for the youngest group considered. In the 1950s,
the general pattern for 14—24 year olds is for a decline in nonwhite/whi
income ratios as the cohort ages, whereas in the 1960s, the pattern shows

greater evidence of stability. In the older age groups, the differences
are smaller, with the evidence sufficiently mixed as to suggest a rough
stability in income ratios as the most reasonable generalization for the
pre—1970s pcricd, with the 1960s looking somewhat better for blacks aged
25—34 at the outset than the 1950s does for similarly aged blacks.

What about the 1970s?
7/
Panel B suimnarizes available CPS median data on this question.

While any firm conclusion about differences with the earlier periods are
marred by differences in the sources and

in

the precise age groups covered,

the data yield a sufficiently clear picture as to sustain the following

conclusion about the 1970s itself: on the basis of published CPS data, there
is no indication of a retrogression in the positionof black cohorts relative
to whites, as the two groups aged. At the least, the seventies do not
look worse compared to earlier decades, which implies that the gains of
the period were relatively permanent.

Cohort Patterns in Current Population Survey Data Tapes
To obtain a more refined measure of the changing economic position
of black cohorts, I have analysed data from the March and May CPS Surveys.
These surveys contain information on the yearly and weekly wages and salaries

and self—employment earnings of thousands of workers. They have the advantage
of covering a large population on an annual basis, which permits comparison
of cohorts over time, and the disadvantage of not following the same persons

over time. I use the CPS data to estimate semi—logarithmic earnings functions
for the 1970s, with the March tapes covering 1968—1977 and the May tapes

covering 1969—1978. The one year difference in the years covered reflects
the fact that the March tapes in a year relate to earnings in the previous
year while the May

tapes

relate to pay in the same year.

The earnings function estimates are given in Table 3. For comparability with other studies, the sample excludes farmers, farm workers,

or self—employed persons, and students. The dependent variables are
yearly earnings (wage and salary plus self—employment income of wage and
salary

non—farm workers) and weekly

earnings (yearly

earnings divided by

weeks worked) in the March tapes and usual weekly earnings in te MAy tapes.

however, the data show blacká making less progress in the occupational
structure (defined by Duncan scores, not income) in the pre—1963 period

and in all but the youngest age group in the 1972 sample. More important
they show the difference in the occupational grading declines greatly in

the period. While occupation scores are not income levels, this evidence
clearly contradicts the hypothesis that the black gains post—1964 were
transitory through the early 1970s.

Longitudinal data
Longitudinal data, which enable us to follow a single cohort through
time, provides a potentially superior picture of t6e changes in incomes

for specified grrups of workers. I have examined longitudinal changes
in three different data sets: the National Longitudinal Survey of Young
Men Aged 14—24 in 1966; the Michigan Panel Survey of Income Dynamics; and

the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. In
contrast to other studies of black economic progress, I control in these
equations only for the education of workers in the base year; the host of
other factors which might affect racial income differentials,includirxg

such important factors as region and experience within an age group are
ignored to provide figures at least roughly comparable to the crude bench-

marks given earlier. Our

estimates

of the lii difference in earnings asso-

ciated with race is not to be interpreted as a discriminating differential
of the usual type for this reason.

Table 5 presents the results for the three longitudinal data sets

which we have examined. Lines 1—4 present results from an analysis of
the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men Aged 14—24 in 1966. The
NLS is a sample of approzimately 5,000 young men aged 18—24 in 1966, inter—

viewed yearly until 1971 and then in 1973, 1975, and 1976. The advantage

All regressions that included variables for other age by years of

Persons for whom the imputed years of experience were negative have

self-empluynient income; weekly and annual earnings/weeks worked.
Lines 5—6: Male heads of households, with annual earnings greater

of this data set is that it provides an especially large sample of young

n in the group for which some of the preceding analysis show a decline in
the relative position of blacks.

Lines 1 and 2 record calculations for the sample of persons reporting
earnings in both years subject to the restrictions listed in the table source.

The analysis shows a decline in the black disadvantage for the specified
cohort in both annual and weekly earnings.

LInes 3 and 4 expand the sample to all persons, including those

who report in one year but not the other. The results are similar. In
this data set black cohorts improved their position relative to whites
as they aged.

Lines 5—6 present results from an:analysis of the Panel Survey of

Income Dynamics. This is a survey of about 5,000 hcuseholds in 1962 and

subsequent years. Itis the largest available longitudinal file covering
the entire work force. Our analysis treats the sample of male heads
of households aged 20—24 and 25—29 (subject to the restrictions noted in

the table). The results show a pattern among age groups similar to that
found in the CPS: for the youngest group we obtain a decline in the ratio
of black to white earnings for the next group, a rise.

Finally, lines 7 and 8 report the results of analysis of the National

Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. This is a survey
based on a nationwide sample of high schools, stratified in such a way
that schools in lower socioeconomic areas were somewhat oversampled, and

includes three follow—up surveys in 1973, 1974, and 1976. It shows essentially
ito differential in in earnings in 1972 but a decline of 5 to 6 percentage

points in the black/white wage ratio thereafter, until blacks earned 94— /
95% of whites in 1976. Thus, these data confirm Lazear's analysis of the

—20—

the NLS Class, of 1972. However,

when we note the level from which the ratio

falls and the level to which it falls we obtain a very different perspective.
A differential of 5—67. between black and white is hardly a cause for nega—

tivism about the economic gain of the period. Indeed, Wise and Meyer's
assessment of the data is that there is essentially no discrimination
-

in the sample.

with other studies

There have been four other studies of the longitudinal progss
of black workers with which ours can be compared.

and Donovan analyzed the Panel Survey and found, in a
comple: r2gression analysis than ours, stronger evidence of an improveRãisian

more

ment in the relative position of blacks. According to their calculations,
nonwhites obtained an increase in real average hourly earnings (other
factors
of

fixed) of 1.8% from 1967 to 1977

compared to a gain for whites

1.17.. Over a decade this implies a 7% improvement in the black position.

They also estimated that blacks with 0 years of experience, and 1—5 years
of experience but not other experience groups had more rapid increases
than whites.

Daymont analyzed the annual

in

and weekly earnings of blacks and whites

the NLS of Men Aged 14—24 in 1966 over the period 1968—1976 and obtained

results consistent with ours:. noticeable increases in the black/white

earnings ratio. His calculations show that black incomes rose relative to
white incomes by 1.5% per annum to 1.9% per annum, depending on the precise

sample studied (see Table 8., p. 290). with addition of a cyclical- control,
the incomes of blacks rose by 2.7% to 2.9% per annum

more than those of whites.

Lazear's provocative analysis, to which we have referred earlier,
found a decline in the black/white income ratio in the NLS 72, as we did:
as noted, however, we believe that a drop from .99 to .94 isto be interret.d
differently than he suggests. Like Dayinont we obtain quita different results

—21—

for the NLS

of

Men Aged 14—24 than Lazear, presumably because of the larger

number of years covered.

Malveaux has examined the occupational progress of black cohorts
from 1968 to 1977 and found, consistent with our analysis, an improvement

in the distribution of blacks relative to whites. Her analysis focused
on men arid women aged 25—34.
Duncan and Hoffman analyzed wage and earnings ratios in the PSID
and found that there was a substantial increase in the relative wages
and earnings of blacks across cohorts and generally flat or slightly
falling within—cohort ratios, with no indication the within—cohort changes

wipd out the cross—cohort gains.
Overall, we read the other studies (including Lazear's) as rejecting
the notion that the economic gains of blacks were, in fact, transitory or
illusory.

Conclusion and Assessment
In this paper we have evaluated the claims that the post—1964
labor market gains of blacks disappeared in the l970s sluggish economy

and have rejected those claims. While there are definite areas in which
the blacks' position worsened, notably the employment/population ratio,

the preponderance of evidence shows continued economic advance. We have
also examined data pertaining to the progress of black cohorts and have

found a mixed picture. In cases where there was virtually no initial
black—white difference in economic position among young workers, the evidence
suggests the development of (larger) differentials as the individuals!

cohorts age. This decline appears, however, to be smaller than that found
in earlier decades and much too small to come close to restoring traditional

discriminating differences. In cases where there was a non—negligible

earnings differential between blacks and whites we have found blacks catchin
up with whites, not the reverse.

—22—

The question naturally arises as to why among the youngest workers
but not those in the next age bracket, studies have found virtual equality

in wages. The most plausible reason for the initial small wage ratios and
in one sense the ensuing drop is, I suggest, the effect of the minimum wage.
The minimum, particularly the more inclusive minimum exacted in recent
years can be expected to have a substantial compressant effect on wage
differentials of young workers, as has been documented by Wise and Meyer

(1981). Looked at from this perspective and in light of the increased
income ratios for blacks in the 25—29 age group, the observed declines
carry

a

very different connotation than one of transitory gains.

Overall, the evidence rejects the claim that the gains of blacks

are transitory. It does suggest, however, that the virtual equality in
income ratios among the very youngest are unlikely to be maintained and
thus should not be taken as an indication of the attainment of equality.
