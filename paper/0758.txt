Capital Gains Taxation in an Economy

with

an "Austrian Sector"
ABSTRACT

tax

This paper examines the effects of a proportional capital gains

in an economy with an Austrian sector (with wine and trees) and an
ordinary sector. We analyze the effect of capital gains taxation (on both
an accrual and a realization basis) on the efficiency with which resources
are used within the Austrian sector. Since time is the only input which
can be varied in the Austrian sector this amounts to looking at the effect
of capital gains taxation on the harvesting time or selling time of assets.
Accrual taxation decreases the selling time of Austrian assets. Realization taxation decreases the selling time of some Austrian assets and leaves
it unchanged for others. Inflation further reduces the selling time of
assets taxed on an accrual basis; often, but not always, inflation increases
the selling time of Austrian assets taxed on a realization basis. These
results suggest that the capital gains tax can reduce the holding period
of an asset. However, there is a sense in which such taxes (at least when
levied on a realization basis)
discourage transactions and increase holding
periods. It is never profitable to change the ownership of an Austrian

asset

between the time

of

the original investment and the ultimate harvesting
of the asset for final use. We examine the
effect of capital gains taxation on the efficiency of the allocation of investment between sectors.
No neutrality principles emerge when ordinary investment income is taxed
at the same rate as capital gains income.

We also analyze the effect of the special tax treatment of capital
gains at death and find that the current U.S. tax system, under which
capital gains taxes are waived at death, encourages investors to hold
assets longer than they otherwise would.

Introduction

I.

This paper examines the effects of a simple capital gains tax

in

an

economy with an Austrian sector and an ordinary sector. In the ordinary
sector the investment process is simple and straightforward; an investment

of a dollar produces a stream of returns in the future. Assets in the
Austrian sector do not yield a stream of services. They increase in
value as they age; when they are harvested this growth stops. The standard examples of Austrian investments are wine and trees, and we shall

use these terms to refer to two different kinds of Austrian assets. Trees
are assets which require scarce resources ——

while

i.e.,

ones which earn rents ——

they age. In considering when to cut down a tree it is important

to take account of the fact that the land on which a tree now stands
can be used to grow another tree once its present occupant is felled.
Wine, in distinction, uses no scarce resources as it matures; the casks
and cellars in which wine ages earn no rents.

We focus on the effects of capital gains taxation on Austrian investments for two reasons. First, the effects are simple and straightforward.
We are able to obtain exact expressions for the effect of capital gains
taxes on the allocatjTon of investment between sectors and for the efficiency

of resource use within the Austrian sector. We extend some of this analysis
to the case where the death of the investor (which has significant tax

consequences

in the U.S.) is uncertain.1

In an earlier version of this paper, we also considered the effect of
uncertainty about the growth of Austrian assets; since the main conclusion
of that exercise was that considering uncertainty did not change the
character of our results, we have drop?ed it from our paper.

that capital gains taxes should, at least in an inflationary world,
operate as a kind of turnover tax,

inhibiting the sale of stocks and

bonds which show gains and encouraging

the sale of assets on which

losses have been incurred. Constantinides

(1980) and Constantinides and

Scholes (1980) have shown just how appealing the strategy of realizing
losses and never selling gains can be when well—organized futures

markets with low transactions costs exist. Feldstein, Sleinrod, and
Yitzhaki (1980), Feldstein and Slemrod (

Yitzhaki (1978) have presented evidence

that

the capital gains tax does indeed

that this theory is correct ——

inhibit the sale of assets whose

were purchased. It is not clear, at

least to us, what the real effect of such an inhibition is. In general,
sales of stock are purely financial

ment or disinvestment of real

transactions and do not lead to invest-

assets. ile it seems quite likely that

the volume of transactions has some

effect on the efficiency of the

allocation of investment, to our kno1edge, no one has framed a theory

which will allow us to deLer the preferred volume of transactions.
Without such a theory one cannot say whether discouraging transactions
is good or bad.

2Lippn and McCall (1980) is a significant e:ception.

Our analysis assumes that capitaa gains taxes fall only on Austrian

assets. Thus we can only analyze the effect of the capital gains tax
on Austrian assets. The ordinary sector is in our model for two reasons;
first, we assume that it is sufficiently large that the after—tax rate
of return ——

is

which in our simple model is the social discount rate ——

determined outside of the Austrian sector and is independent of the

rate and form of the capital gains tax. Secondly, having an ordinary
sector allows us to examine the effect of capital gains taxation on the
allocation of resources between Austrian and other investments.

We summarize our results as follQws. Section I sets out the basic model
and analyzes the effects of capital gains taxation on Austrian investments.
Our partial equilibrium model assumes that the total amount of investment is

fixed. Taxation, in particular the capital gains tax, can affect economic
efficiency in two quite different ways. First taxes can affect the flow of
investment between sectors. The intersectoral allocation of investment is
efficient when the present discounted value of all returns —— public and
private —— from a dollar of investment is the same in all sectors. We find
that when income in the ordinary sector is taxed at rate

and capital gains

in the Austrian sector are taxed at rate T, this equality is unlikely to

hold, even if T =

T

In particular, when tax rates in the sectors are equal,
0

Austrian investments have lower total returns than ordinary investments.

While not without interest, this cornparison is quite artificial. A
major accomplishment of recent research on the ta::ation of capital has

been the demonstration that T is an axtraordinarilv
conplicated beast.

effect of capital gains taxation is on the allocation of

resources within a sector. For Austrian investments, the resource whose
use can be varied is time; we find that the capital gains tax leads to

inefficiencies within the wine sector by encouraging wine to be sold
more quickly than it would be in the absence of taxation. This does not
hold for some tree investments. If investment opportunities are stationary,
and if there is no inflation, cutting time is independent of T and capital

gains taxation introduces no distortions. If conditions are not stationary,
or if there is inflation, taxes affect cutting time in a complicated way.

These results were obtained for taxation on a realization basis.

Accrual taxation introduces different distortions. When T

returns

T0 total

from Austrian investments (both wine and trees) can be greater

or less than returns from ordinary investments.

For a given rate of

taxation, selling time (again for wine and trees) is less under accrual
taxation than under realization taxation. We have made comparisons of taxation
at equal rates rather than equal yields because such comparisons are simpler.

However, as Stiglitz (1981) has shown, the problem of calculating the effective
yield of a capital gains tax is sufficiently complex that it seems no good case
can be made for the proposition that comparisons of taxes which have equal
yields are more meaningful than comparisons of taxes which have equal rates.
Our model produces no strong a priori case for the greater efficiency of

accrual taxation. Our examination of the effects of inflation in Section II
strengthens the case for realization as opposed to accrual taxation. Although
there are exceptions, on balance inflation (at least rapid inflation) tends to
alleviate the distortions caused by taxation on a realization basis while it

5

complicates, sometimes exacerbating and sometimes alleviating the distortions
caused by accrual taxation.
In Section III we show how the

analysis is changed by

taking account of the special ways in which capital gains are, or could be

taxed, at death. We show how the present United States tax system, which
allows automatic step up of basis at death, encourages' people to hold

on to assets longer than they would otherwise. Since the tax system leads
them to sell wine sooner than they should, at least for wine

this

corrects (and possibly overcorrects) a distortion of the tax system.

Much previous work on capital gains taxation has focused on the way
in which capital gains taxes tend to inhibit transactions and to encourage

investors to hold assets ——

longer

at

least assets which are growing in value ——

than they otherwise would. Our analysis suggests that the effects

are diverse and complicated. The results suiamarized above showed that
the capital gains tax could sometimes shorten, sometimes lengthen, and

sometimes leave unchanged the length of time the owner of an Austrian

asset would wait before he harvested it. However, we did obtain one result
which shows that the capital gains tax discourages transactions in Austrian
assets. In Proposition 3 below we show that the owner of an Austrian asset who
is subject to capital gains taxation on a realization basis will never

sell it to another interediate producer. He

will

always nake higher

profits by holding on to wine until it is sold to the consicaer.

Although

Proposition 3 is stated for wine, it also clearly holds for trees. Thus
the capital gains tax acts as a kind of tu:ncver or transaction tax on
Austrian assets and as such prornotes vertical integration in industries
which use ,ustrian processes.

We have sacrificed a great deal of reality to keep our models simple

and tractable. The capital gains tax is proportional and everyone pays

the same rate. We ignore the complexities and arbitrage opportunities
which are encouraged by progressive taxatian at different rates.3

We also ignore the arbitrage opportunities which the options market

permits. Constantinides (1980) and Constantinide-s and Scholes (1980)
have argued th.at by using the options imarket, investors can avoid ever

realizing capital gains. Sales of assets (which are taxable events) are
dominated by the purchase and sale of options (based on the asset's

We have also assumed that investors have a very simple goal.

maximize the present discounted value of wealth. We assume a constant

discount rate of r. When we treat uncertainty we assume that investors

I. The Basic Model

A. The Ordinary Sector
A dollar invested in the ordinary sector yields a constant stream of gross

returns y. We abstract from the entangling detail of the real world by

assuming a simple proportional tax. Thus, after tax returns are y(l — T0)
where

is the tax rate in the ordinary sector. The tax rate

cannot be

identified with any single parameter of the tax code such as the corporate

profits tax. Auerbach (1979) and others have analyzed the complex ways in

which the provisions of the tax la combine to produce

If the stream of

returns is not constant, -r0 is even more complicated.

1. The After Tax Rate of Return.
We define the after tax rate of return r as the solution to
—rs

1= fy(l—T)e ds.

(1)

Thus, y =

0

r/(l

-

T0).

Since r is the rate of return available in the

ordinary sector in a competitive economy it is the rate which all investors

will use to discount all future benefits. In a complete model r will be
determined by the interaction between tastes (particularly time preference),

technology and endowments. In this paper we analyze the effects of changes
in parameters, particularly tax parameters, which do not affect the ordinary

sector. Since these parameters shifts leave r unchanged, we can use r to
assay the effects of such changes on economic efficiency.

2. Gross Returns and the Value of Investment.
If government revenues are used efficiently ——

or if, equiva-

lently, proceeds of taxation are returned to taxpayers — a dollar of tax -

revenue collected at time t

is worth

e_t. Thus the taxes collected from

yielding a stream of returns y( ) have a present

discounted value of I y(s) Tersds which, because of (1), is equal to

T/(l —

T).

Thus a dollar invested in the ordinary sector produces a

stream of returns which is worth 1 + T/(l —

T)

= (1 —

when

both private benefits and the value of tax benefits are considered. The
fact that a dollar of investment produces more than a dollar's worth of

benefits, can lead to complications. Anything that increases

and

increases welfare. If proceeds of investment are reinvested they

are worth more than if they are consumed. By positing mechanical rules for

reinvesting proceeds of investment projects, we could derive alternative
formulae for

valuing dollars of investment. Our concern in this paper is

with valuing investments in different sectors and it does not

seem worth-

follow this line of analysis, at laast in part because to follow

it we would need to assume that the allocation of investment between sectors

was also fixed mechanically. Another way of aking the same point is to

say that we are assuming that the total an:nt cf investment is fixed. Given
this we examine the efficiency of the allocstfon of resources to investment,
both

within and between sectors.

1.

Wine and Trees.

We consider two kinds of Austrian

production processes. In the

first, and simpler, an initial investment produces an asset which increases

in value as it ages. We call the

output of this process wine. The other

Austrian output, a tree, is distinguished from wine by the fact that it
uses a scarce resource, land, as it ages. When a tree is felled, another

can be planted in its place. When iine is drunk, the bottle in which it has

matured

is discarded. We need terms to describe the time when an Austrian

asset's maturation is terminated and it is consumed. For trees "cutting

seems appropriate. For wine we shall call this time "selling time."
This usage is justified in Proposition 3, below where it is shown that the
time"

capital gains tax discourages transfers of wine before it is consumed.
Since the argument of Proposition 3 can be adapted to trees, we shall also
occasionally use selling time to refer to trees and wine together.
2. Values and Rates of Return Without Taxes.

Suppose that there are no taxes in the Austrian sector. In equilibrium assets invested in the Austrian sector must earn a rate of return

equal to r. If they ear-ri a rate of return greater than r, the value of
resources used to produce wine will be bid up until the rate of return is

just r. If B is the value or price of resources used to produce wine
which has

a value of X(t) when sold or harvested after

t

years,

B = max e —rtx(t).

equilibrium, scarce resources in the other Austrian sector (trees)

also earn the competitive rate of return, but since the scarce resource,
land, is not used to produce trees but

to provide a place for them to

mature, the analysis is slightly different.
If trees can be planted at cost

F, the present discounted value of a

plot of land which can support one tree

forever is, if trees are harvested

at intervals of length u, and if the value of a tree of age u is V(u),

The optimal cutting period u is chosen to maximize L(u); if used in the

Austrian sector this plot of land has a value of L(u). If used in the

A dollar invested in the ordinary sector produces returns with a total dis-

understand. Considered solely in terms of costs and returns on invest-

it were taxed as an ordinary investment, the tax base would be X(t), tax
revenues would be TX(t) and the total return from a dollar's worth of invest—

ment

would be (l—T) —1 .

Since investments in wine are taxed as

capital gains the tax base is not X(t) but X(t) — B.

We summarize this

discussion in

Proposition 1: The present discounted value of total returns from a dollar
invested in wine is less than the present discounted value of total returns
from a dollar invested in the ordinary sector if and only if

There is a slight, and inessential, technical difference. In order to
use continuous time we assume that returns from ordinary investments are
flows while returns from Austrian investments are stocks.

If

T, then returns to investments in the ordinary sector are greater

than returns

to investments in wine. If i > T 0,

then returns to investments

in wine may or may not be greater than returns to ordinary investments.
Since different kinds of wines may have different selling times (different

t*) it is quite possible that some wine investments may have greater and
some lesser total social returns than ordinary investments. In interpreting
the condition T <
T

0

it is well to keep in mind what a complicated parameter

is.
The value of B determines the allocation of resources to the wine

sector. As B increases more resources are devoted to the production of
wine. Whether or not this increases or decreases economic

well—being

depends on (4). In contrast, the parameter t determines the efficiency
with which resources in the wine sector are used. The value of all
resources devoted to wine grows according to the function X( ).

interpreting this proposition it should be remembered that while

each wine investment may have a different

socially optimal selling

time £ and a different privately optimal selling time t*, for all such

investments the privately optimal time is too short.

Were it to increase,

the resources allocated to the wine sector would be used more efficiently
and the present discounted value of the output of the wine sector would

increase. Like proposition 1, proposition 2 is a consequence of the form
of

capital gains taxation. If wine were taxed as

ordinary income the after

tax return would be X(t)(l—T) and t*would be chosen to maximize (lT)X(t)e_'t

so t would equal 1.
A high basis increases the value of an asset subject to capital gains

taxation. it is conceivable that this effect could be strong enough to
encourage turnover of assets like wine. Working against this is the fact
that capital gains taxes are also turnover taxes and thus they inhibit

transactions. We show in Proposition 3 that this latter effect dominates.

Proposition 3. No wine is sold before

it

is consumed.

Proof: Suppose first that the basis is 0. In this case the wine will be
consumed at the same time as it would be were there no tax. The value of
holding the wine to maturity is

C. Accrual Taxation
It is sometimes asserted that many of the distortions and inefficiencies which the capital gains

tax

causes are due to the fact that

capital

gains are taxed on a realization basis; if taxation were on an accrual basis

these distortions would disappear. We examine

this

claim by analyzing the

effect of accrual taxation on the efficiency of allocation of resources

between and within investment sectors. Our model does not support the
proposition that

accrual

taxation is to be preferred on efficiency grounds.

Accrual taxation introduces distortions different from, and in some cases
greater than,

parameter

the

distortions caused by realization taxation. While some

values may favor

accrual taxation, one cannot make

a

strong

apori case for it —— at least using the model of this paper. If anything
the evidence ses to run the other way. We observed above that in the
stationary case taxation on a realization basis does not affect the cutting
time of trees. We will see in Proposition 10 below that the cutting time
of

trees is a decreasing function of the rate of accrual taxation.

Proposition

9

The present discounted value of a dollar of resources invested in wine

is exp[rt T/(l—T)].

Proof:
Consider one dollar invested in wine

vested at ta and worth

which goes to produce wine har-

X(ta) at that time. Gross returns are clearly

X(t)ea. Hower, in

equilibrium the present discounted value of

after tax returns is equal to one dollar so X(ta) = e

(r/(l_T))ta

Substituting, we find gross returns from one dollar are

exp[t(r/(l—-r) —

r)]

=

exp[rtT/(1—T)].

Since gross returns are the sum of private returns and the present
rta T/l—T
discounted value of taxes paid this latter amount must be e

We note that whether the total return from investments in wine are
greater or less than returns in the ordinary sector depends on whether

When we analyze the gross returns to investment in trees with accrual

The discussion following Proposition 9 applies here. Whether the rate

of return to trees taxed on an accrual basis is greater or less

It

is well known that as P increases to the point where

Ua converges to ta; that

Ua satisfies V'(Ua)/V(U) =

Thus,

the examples of Appendix II.A demonstrate that
(l_T)exp(rua'r/(l_T) can be

increasing or decreasing in T and that lim (lT)exp(ruaT/(1_T)) can be

either 0 or .

B. The Austrian Sectors

Under accrual taxation, the analysis of the effects of inflation is

straightforward, but the effects themselves defy simple summary. About all
that can be said is that inflation complicates —— sometimes exacerbating
and sometimes alleviating --

the distortions induced by taxation. If the

inflation rate is ri and the tax rate is T, wine taxed on an accrual basis

is exactly the same as wine which is untaxed but discounted at a rate
1— T

From (18) inflation can be modeled by assuming that the discount rate rises
to r+n while the nominal value of wine sold at time t equals X(t)eflt. Thus,

wine harvested at time t has a present discounted after tax value of

Thus, ta is

The right hand side of this equation is increasing in fl.
decreasing in ri.

The calculation of the present discounted value of gross returns
under inflation is similar to that of Proposition 9, only now the discount
rate r+fl is substituted for r; the gross rate of return is

exp [(r+fl) taT/(1_Tfli

which, as examples in Appendix II.B show, can be increasing or decreasing in fl.

Trees are again more complicated than wine but the effects of inflation

are cualitatively the same. The optimal cutting time Ua

contrast to the case of accrual taxation, these results fit into a

simple pattern. Inflation, at least inflation at a rapid rate, reduces the
distortions which a tax on realized capital gains induces. There is a

straightfoard explanation. The distortions which this tax induces stem
from the exclusion of the base value of the asset from the tax base.
Inflation reduces the value and the effect of this exclusion.
One entry in Table 1 does not fit this neat pattern. With no inflation
trees taxed at realization are cut down at the socially optimal time. As

34

inflation increases, the cutting time

of

trees increases; inflation induces

inefficiency. The proof of this fact is tedious and given in the appendix.

However, there is a simple intuitive explanation. Inflation and taxation
interact to make it appear to the investor that

While in any period he must pay planting Costs of P, when he pays taxes

he can only exclude Pe from his tax base. Effective planting costs
have increased. The natural response is to use less planting by increasing
the time between plantings.

III. Death and Taxes

Death complicates. Until 1976, in the United States, when the holder
of an asset died, the estate

paid no capital gains tax; if the investor's

heirs sold the asset in the future the basis value of the asset used to

compute capital gains tax liability was its value on the date of the
investor's death. From the point of view of the estate, death was equivalent to a sale on the date of death

to recommend it, it was a dandy

way to avoid taxes. This system ws changed in 1976, and the U.S. began
to wove toward a system like that analyzed in Part I in which the heir's
basis would be the basis of the

original purchaser of the asset.. In 1980,

this movement stopped; and the U.S. has reverted to the pre—1976 system.

In this part of the paper we analyze the effect of the capital gains
tax on the selling time and value of Austrian assets when death alters
the way
in which capital gains are taxed.

Another possible treatment of capital gains at death is what is known

as constructive realization. Under this system the estate is presumed to
sell the asset at death and to pay tax at the ordinary capital gains rate

on the gains which the sale realizes. Under constructive realization

We compare these two systems to the system analyzed in the last

part which is referred to as a carryover system.
If an investor plans to sell an asset at t, the expected present dis-

counted value of the after tax

is

J(t) =

The first term in (27) represents the discounted after tax value he will
receive if he lives until t. The second term is the discounted after tax
value which his estate will receive. This formula is not quite correct for
two reasons. First, the pretax value the estate realizes will in general
be more than X(t) since the value of the asset will exceed X(t). Determining
exactly what this value is seems very difficult. Secondly, in contrast to
the analysis of Section I above, B here is an arbitrary parameter. Although
in principle B should satisfy a zero profit condition, it is hard to write
down this condition for this model because investors'mortality functions will

influence their profits. It is hard to figure out what should be the
"market" mortality function. We think neither of these simplifications will
affect our analysis.

The planned selling time t is chosen to maximize J(t); t satisfies

may plan

to sell an asset at a different time than the original investor

planned. This is

because the heirs will have a different, higher basis

which will cause them to plan to sell sooner than the
original investor.
They also will have a different mortality function which will, under step
up

also affect their planned selling time. It is easy to see from (27) that

increases in either T or Td will decrease the value of an asset.
The effects of increases in T on planned selling time are more complicated. Since planned selling time is the same under constructive reali—
zatio.n as under carryover, dt*/dT < 0 in both cases. Under step up dt*/dT

can be either positive or negative. If B = 0, the selling time will be
greater under step up then if there were no taxation so
must be positive.
On the other hand if B is positive and — f(t*) is very snail,

decreasing as X'(t)/X(t) is undefined for t< d; however, since

it

is decreasing for t > d. Moreover,

X'(t)/X(t) has but a single local maximum.)

Let C(ri)

Let X(t) =

(r+Trl)/(1_T).

Then we know from example 1 of Appendix II.A that

C(O) < (1—T)1 for T > 0 so that if C'(O) > 0 the distortions induced
by the capital gains tax are reduced by small increments in the race

of inflation. For this case, t =
and C'(fl) =

C(fl)r(l—T)t/(r+Tfl)2

(l—T)/(r+Tfl);

C(n)

exp [T(r+n)J(r+Tfl)J,

so inflation at low races reduces

distortions. However, liin C() = e and if
n-3w

e > (1—T)' (or if T < .632),

then high rates of inflation more than correct the
distortions induced by
the capital gains tax. Increases in inflation beyond the point where

C(n) =

(1_T)1

increase distortions.

2. For a more dramatic example of this effect, consider again the
case where

It is easy to calculate that C'() > 0.

We showed in example 2 of

Appendix II.A that C(0) > (1—T) so increasing inflation exacerbates
the distortions of the capital gains tax.
