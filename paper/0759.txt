Anticipated and Unanticipated Oil Price
Increases and the Current Account

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the
future increases in real oil

current-accot response to anticipated
prices as well as to Unexpected increases

which may be temporary or permanent in nature. The

analysis is

conducted using an intertemporal

two-period model of a small open
economy which produces both traded
and nontraded goods and imports its
oil.

The paper identifies the
oil price increases affect

nontraded

channels through which various types of

the current account. The inclusion of

investment and consumer goods permits oil price increases
to

generate intertemporal and Static Substitution effects in production
and consumption which alter net international saving.
Moreover, the
relative oil—value_added ratio in the traded and
nontraded sectors
plays a crucial role in shaping these substitution effects and
hence

the current-accot response.

Introduction
Much research effort has been devoted to investigating the macro-

economic effects of an oil price "shock" on oil-importing nations.
Since a price "shock" connotates an unanticipated disturbance, but more
recent oil price hikes have been either partially or wholly expected,
it is important to study the economy's response to anticipated

disturbances as well. That is one purpose of this paper. It examines
the current—account response to anticipated future increases in real oil
prices as well as to unexpected increases which may be temporary or
permanent in nature.
The paper also stresses the important role of nontraded goods in

determining the current—account response to oil price increases. When
the economy produces nontraded investment goods and consumer goods, oil
price disturbances generate intertemporal and static substitution
effects in production and consumption which alter net international

saving. Moreover, the relative oil- value-added ratio in the traded and
nontraded sectors plays a crucial role in shaping these substitution

effects. This latter finding supports the oft-repeated observation
that structural characteristics of individual oil-importing countries
matter in any analysis of current—account adjustment to foreign price
disturbances.

Previous studies of oil price disturbances and current-account
adjustment in the small open economy (e.g. FindlayRodriguez (1977), Buiter (1978), Bruno—Sachs (1978), Katseli—Marion
(1980), Obstfeld (1980), and Sachs (1981)) have considered only unexpected

disturbances. They usually conclude that permanent unexpected oil price

2

increases worsen the current—account of the net oil importer with limited
substitution in production.

However, most of these studies fail to consider the intertemporal
nature of current-accnt (net saving) behavior. The two recent exceptions

are the excellent papers by Obstfeld (1980) and Sachs (1981). Their
analyses indicate that permanent unexpected oil price increases can actually

improve the current account. But neither study considers the effects
of anticipated future oil price increases or the role of nontraded goods

in current-account adjustment. That is the task of this paper. Using
an intertemporal framework, it seeks to identify the channels through
which various types of oil price increases (i.e. expected or unexpected,
temporary, permanent, or future) affect the current account of an
economy producing both nontraded and traded goods.
The analysis is conducted using an intertemporal two-period model
of a small open economy facing given world prices and a given world rate

of interest. The model itself is based on intertemporal maximizing

behavior and saving is consistent with this behavior. The"dual"
approach, characterized by the use of expenditure and revenue functions

rather than utility and production functions, is adopted. As pointed
out by Dixit and Norman (1980) arid Dixit (1980), models employing

duality are formally equivalent to traditional ones, but have some
practical advantages, among them notational simplicity.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The basic model is
set out in Section 2.

In Section 3, the response of the current account

to a change in world oil prices and world interest rates is derived,
and the distinction between expected and unexpected disturbances is

3

finally

drawn. In Section 4, the results are extended to the case where

there are nontraded investment and consumer goods. Section 5 provides
some concluding remarks.

2.

The Model
Consider a small open economy in an intertemporal framework.1 There

are two dates, 1 and 2, and two goods, one final good and one intermediate

good. The country can trade on the world market at given spot prices at
each date, and it also has access to a world credit market with a given

world interest rate.2 Let the date 1 final good be the numeraire. Then
1 denotes the real spot price at date 1 of final goods at date 1, and
1/(l+r)

represents

the real discount rate, where r is the real interest

Let q1 be the relative spot price at date i of intermediate goods

rate.3

(in terms of final goods) at date i.
With respect to welfare and demand, assume the country can be

represented by a well—behaved utility function U(c1, c2),
are nonnegative and represent consumption at date 1

where

c1, c2

and 2, respectively.

Households seek to maximize utility subject to the constraint that presentvalue expenditures not exceed present—value income. The dual is to

minimize the expenditure necessary to attain a target utility level at
given

prices. The corresponding expenditure function is

u) E

E(l, S,

c1 +

mm

subject to U(c1, c2) >

The small economy produces final goods (x) using capital (k), labor
(9), and

oil

(z). For simplicity, assume initially that the supplies of

capital and labor are fixed and that all oil is imported. The assumption
of a fixed labor supply will be dropped in Section 3 and the assumption

of a fixed capital stock will be relaxed in Section 4. Firms maximize

5

the present value of total profit. Specifically, for given world prices
of final goods and oil and for given quantities of labor and capital, the
firms' problem is to choose a technologically feasible x to maximize the

present value of output. The corresponding maximized value of output is
a function of these fixed prices and factors inputs. It is called the
revenue, or national product, function. For the two—period case, we can

the revenue functions as:

write

R1(1,

l) + SR2(l, q2, 2 k2) =

where

real present value of income at date 2.
The equilibrium of the country can be represented by the intertemporal

budget constraint

E(l, ,
Equation

u) = R1(l,

q1) + 6R2(l, q2)

(2.1)

(2.1) states that the present value of expenditure equals the

present value of domestic value—added.
There are many well known properties of expenditure and revenue
functions [see Dixit and Norman (1980) or Varian (1978)]. For instance,
the derivative of the expenditure function with respect to the price of

a good is the Hicksian compensated demand for that good. The derivative

of

the revenue function with respect to the price of a good is the

6

optimally

chosen supply of the good. It follows that optimal consumption,

production of final goods and imports of oil are given by

(2.3)

which is the excess of income at date 1 over spending at date

In

the

absence of domestic investment or government deficits, the current account
surplus at date 1 is equal to real saving at date 1 and represents the

accumulation of net foreign assets. Equation (2.1) ensures that trade
in present—value terms is balanced over the two dates, though not
necessarily at each date.

7

3.

Solving the Model
To find the effect on the date 1 current account of a change in world

oil prices or interest rates, we totally differentiate (2.3). Because
welfare effects are needed in the calculation of current—account effects,
it is helpful to proceed by first differentiating (2.1).

This differentia-

tion yields:

Edu =

A11dq'

+

A12dq2

+

X13d

(3.1)

where
A11 =

<0
<0

A12 =

X13 = R

2 -

E2

=

b2

In the above expression, Eu denotes the partial BE/u, the inverse of the
marginal utility of total (present-value) income, which is positive. The
expression Edu is the income equivalent at given prices of a change in

welfare. Hence (R/E)dq1 is the (negative) effect on welfare of an
increase in world oil prices at date 1, (5R/E)dq2 is the (negative)
effect on welfare of an increase in oil prices at date 2, and (b2/E)dS
is the effect on welfare of an increase in the real discount factor. The
latter effect is positive if the small country runs a trade surplus
(deficit) in date 2 (1).

In order to calculate the effect of a change in world oil prices and
the real discount rate on the current account, we totally differentiate

(2.3), making use of (3.1). This gives

where c1 is the real marginal propensity to spend at date 1 out of real

present value income.3 The term E12 is a substitution effect, with

E12 =

0.

An increase in oil prices has two effects on the current account:

a direct effect on value added (Rdq), which worsens the current account,
and an income-consumption effect [-c1(Rdq1 +

SRdq2)],

which improves

the current account. Oil price increases do not generate substitution
effects in either consumption or production since consumer prices are

unaffected by oil price increases and there are as yet no intertemporal
elements in production.
Let us now look at the change in the current account in the following
three cases:

(1) A temporary increase in oil prices, which is defined as
dcl'

>

0, dq2 = 0.

(2) A permanent increase in oil prices, which is defined as
dq1, dq2 >

0.

(3) An anticipated future oil price increase, which refers to the case
2
dq1 = 0, dq > 0.

All three types of oil price increases are expected increases.

At the

9

start

of date 1, OPEC announces oil prices for dates 1 and 2.

Agents can

fully adjust their behavior in dates 1 and 2 in response to this

announcement. Later, we shall distinguish between expected and unexpected
price increases.

As can be seen in (3.2), a temporary oil price increase
reduces

the current—accot surplus; it

unambiguously

has a direct negative effect on

value added and a smaller positive income effect on demand.
A permanent oil price increase has a larger impact on aggregate
demand and hence an ambiguous effect on the current account. As in the
case of a temporary increase, it has a direct negative effect and a smaller

positive income effect in date 1. But it also produces a positive income
effect in date 2. If the two income effects should dominate, then the
current account will improve.

An anticipated oil price increase improves the date 1 current account
since it lowers welfare, inducing a drop in domestic consumption in the
first period.

Up to this point, agents have been treated as having perfect foresight;
they can fully adjust in dates 1 and 2 to any oil price increase that
occurs in the present or the future.
Suppose we want to introduce a distinction between unexpected and

expected oil price increases. One way to do this is to impose some
constraint on the ability of agents to adjust their behavior in date 1 in

response to an announced oil price increase. In particular, suppose that
firms have limited production substitution possibilities in date 1. Any
change in date 1 oil prices — whether temporary or permanent -

is

now

unexpected in the sense that firms would have tried to alter their factor

10

mix had they known of the forthcoming price disturbance.
As an example, assume that firms face a fixed coefficient technology

in date 1. In order to have current output variable, let us also relax
the assumption that there is full employment of a fixed supply of labor

in date 1. Let

represent employment in date 1.

Maximization of date 1 value-added requires that x1 =

Let

Hence

denote the derivative

A standard property of the

revenue function is that this derivative represents the real demand price
for labor.

Suppose that the real supply price of labor in date 1 can be represented

by the function w'(l, 2)). Then a labor-market equilibrium is given by

w1(l, l) =

R(l,

q1, i1)

(3.3)

For simplicity, we ignore any intertemporal elements in labor supply, so

that the real wage demanded in date 1 depends only on the price of final
goods and employment at that date.

modifies the analysis to the

that negative employment effects are now associated with an

Unexpected increase in today's oil price. Unexpected oil price increases
thus have a stronger negative effect on the
current account surplus than
do expected oil price increases. Note that
whether expected or unexpected,

12

a temporary increase in oil prices reduces the current-account surplus and
a permanent increase in oil prices has an ambiguous effect on the current

account. Anticipated future oil price increases always improve today's
current account.

Let us now examine how the current—account response might differ when
a nontraded good is introduced.

13

Nontraded Goods

Suppose that the small economy produces
nontraded goods (n) as well
as traded goods (x). The nontraded goods can be consumed by domestic
households or costlessly transformed into investment goods (I).
Since there are only two periods,
Both traded and nontraded goods

investment occurs only in period 1.

are produced with oil, labor and sector-

specific capital. Labor is mobile between sectors and all oil is imported.
In order to distinguish between

expected and unexpected oil price

disturLances, we again invoke the assumption that in date 1 all firms

face a fixed coefficient technology. We also assume that in date 1
firms face an economy—wide wage indexed to final goods prices. Thus
overall employment will vary in response to oil price disturbances.

In

2, firms can fully adjust their factor mix and labor is fixed in

total supply and fully employed. The economy's revenue functions, which

The four equations contain

(44)

four unknowns: u, j1, j2 and b'.

The determinants of the investment and employment
functions can be

derived from (4.1) and from information about labor
Supply.
For example, the investment
that maximizes Output yields the marginal
condition

SR(l, q2, 2 2

+ Ii) =

which says that firms should invest

up to the point where the value of

the marginal product of capital in date 2 production
equals the cost of

capital. it follows that investment demand can be represented
by:

, j2,

q2); i < O I, 12 > O 12

16

It is a function of the cost of capital, j1, the prices of date 2 final

goods, 5 and 2, and the date 2 price of oil.

Since 5

l/(1 +

r),

the

investment function captures the familiar relationship between the

real interest rate and investment demand. Changes in the date 1 price
of oil affect investment demand indirectly through j1 and

by influencing

the supply of investment goods.7 The properties of the investment function
can be obtained from information about the production technology. Given
a convex production technology in date 2, it can be shown that an increase
in the price of capital goods decreases investment

demand while an

increase in date 2 final prices raises the marginal product of capital

and hence investment demand. An increase in date 2 oil prices lowers
investment demand if capital and oil are complements in date 2 production
and increases investment demand if the two factors are substitutes.
The employment function, S, can be derived from the labor-market
equilibrium condition:

raises employment in the nontraded goods sector and

lowers it in the traded goods sector, so there is an ambiguous impact on

economy-wide employment in date 1. An increase in q1 lowers the net
marginal product of labor in both sectors and hence reduces overall
employment in the current period.

Having discussed some of the properties

of the model, we are now ready

to analyze the effects of oil price increases on the current account when
the economy produces both traded goods

and nontraded consumer and/or

17

investment

goods.

First, totally differentiate (4.l)—(4.4).

Equation (4.1) can be

solved separately to obtain the welfare effects of oil price increases.

Equations (4.2) and (4.3) must be solved

simultaneously to obtain

equilibri values for the price of nontraded goods in dates 1 and 2.
The solutions to (4.l)—(4.3)

can then be used in (4.4) to obtain the

current—accot effects of oil price increases.
The welfare and current—account effects are as follows:

A temporafy increase in oil prices affects the supply of investment
goods but not the demand. The disturbance can either raise or lower
nontraded goods prices, depending on the relative oil intensity of

production in the two sectors of the economy. Technically, the response

of j1 depends on the sign and size of R2 in A31. The term represents
the supply response in the nontraded goods sector to an increase in date

1 oil prices for a given economy—wide level of employment. If a
temporary increase in date 1 oil prices reduces the supply of nontraded

investment goods (R2 < 0), then j1 will rise. The resulting drop in
investment demand helps improve the current account (A24 >

0).

Note that

the current account is also helped by the small drop in household

absorption induced by the oil shock. But since temporary oil price increases

also have a direct negative effect on GNP (R < 0 in A21), their net impact
on the current account is ambiguous. Only if temporary oil price increases
reduce the relative price of nontraded goods will the current account

clearly deteriorate. Recall that in the absence of nontraded goods,
temporary oil shocks always led to a current-account deterioration.
Temporary oil price increases are more likely to increase the supply

of nontraded goods and reduce their price the lower the oil—value—added
ratio (the greater the c*) in the nontraded goods sector relative to the

traded goods sector.9 That is because under such circumstances an
increase

in oil prices will induce a movement of labor from traded to

nontraded goods. Temporary oil price increases which are unexpected

also generate additional employment effects in both sectors when there

is

real-wage resistance.

Permanent oil price increases alter both the demand and the supply
of nontraded investment goods and have an ambiguous effect on their

21

price. As in the previous case, the supply of investment goods will
rise or fall depending on the relative oil intensity of capital goods

production. A permanent increase in

oil prices

will also reduce

the demand for investment goods if oil and capital are
complements (substitutes) in date 2 production.
(increase)

Permanent

oil price increases have an ambiguous effect on the

current account as well. For given prices of nontraded

reduce GNP and employment (R +

shows

that investment demand drops if capital and oil are complements in date

2 production. But prices of nontraded goods do not remain fixed. As
we have seen, permanent oil price increases can either raise or lower

nontraded goods prices. If j' should increase, we see from A24 that
employment is stimulated and investment demand is further reduced.

The

spur to output and the fall in absorption help improve the current

account. If

should fall, there is instead an additional negative

effect on the current account.

An anticipated future increase in oil prices reduces (increases)
the demand for investment goods if capital and oil are complements
(substitutes) in date 2 production, but has no effect on their current

supply. Consequently, the expected future disturbance reduces (increases)
today's relative price of nontraded goods.

When oil and capital are complements in date 2 production, an
anticipated future increase in oil prices improves the date 1 current

account. It can be shown that when 112 < 0, the expression [X22dq2+A2432dq2j

22

in (4.11) is unambiguously positive.

The anticipated future increase in

oil prices reduces permanent income, leading households to cut their expend-

itures in both periods. The expected increase also lowers the relative
price of capital goods, j1, with a resulting drop in employment.

This

additional welfare loss also induces households to reduce their spending.
Finally, since the drop in j1

triggers

a contraction of employment in

the nontraded goods sector, there is a concomitant drop in the demand for
oil imports, given the fixed coefficient technology in place in date 1.

All of these responses contribute to an improved current account.
Recall that anticipated future oil price increases always led to an
improved current account when the economy produced just traded goods.
The introduction of nontraded investment goods, however, permits oil
price increases to influence the current account through additional

channels. As we have seen, anticipated future oil price increases
unambiguously improve the current account if capital and oil are
complements in date 2 production.

The inclusion of nontraded goods highlights the importance of the

oil—value—added ratio in the nontraded goods sector relative to the
traded goods sector in determining the current-account response to current

oil price increases. The relative oil intensity of production will also
be an important determinant of the current-account response to anticipated
future oil price increases once we introduce nontraded consumer goods
and hence nontraded goods production in both periods.

4.2 The role of nontraded consumer goods
Consider next the case where the small economy's only nontraded good

is a consumer good. Then the general model represented by equations

Happily, the cumbersome expressions (4.16)-(4.18) have a ready
economic interpretation.
From examination of (4.18), it is clear that a temporary increase in

oil prices has an ambiguous effect on the current account. The term

production, a negative employment effect and

a smaller

Temporary oil price increases also influence the current account by
altering the price of nontraded goods in dates 1 and 2.

X31 represents the supply effect in the date 1

If the oil—value-added ratio in the nontraded goods sector is large

in today's oil price will reduce the supply of nontraded goods for a

production, and given that labor is fixed in supply and fully employed

will be positive.

Consequently A32 in (4.16) is negative, A42 in (4,17) is likely to be
negative, and we can say that expected future oil price increases will
lower the relative price of nontraded goods in dates 1 and 2.
We know that a fall in j1 tends to worsen the current account while
a fall in

tends to improve it. Consequently, we cannot ascertain the

impact on the current account of anticipated future oil price
increases without knowledge of specific parameter values, including
net

sectors.

Comparing the results in Section 4.2

with those in Section 3, we

Conclusions
A small—country model has been used to examine the current—account

response to temporary oil price increases, permanent oil price increases,

and future anticipated oil price increases. The analysis has been
conducted Using a two—period model with maximizing agents. This framework
allows us to work with aggregates which are consistent with micro
behavior and permits us to capture explicitly the intertemporal nature

of net international saving. It also offers a useful way of distinguishing
between unexpected and expected price changes and permits the calculation

of welfare effects. Moreover, the model is analytically tractable.
The model of Section 3 demonstrates that a temporary oil price
shock worsens the current account, a permanent oil price shock can
improve or worsen the current account, and a purely anticipated oil price

increase improves the current account. All oil price increases reduce
welfare for the small economy that is a net importer of oil.
When the analysis is extended to include a nontraded investment and
consumption good, we introduce substitution effects in production and

consumption which are static and intertemporal in nature. These
sUbstitution effects modify the current—account response to oil price

increases in important ways. The relative oil—value—added ratio in
the traded and nontraded sectors also becomes a crucial determinant of
the current—account response.

Since the small—country model is a simple one and amenable to easy
economic interpretation, it is a convenient place to start when trying
to determine the differential response to various types of oil price

increases. However, the small—country model is limiting in some

30

respects. For instance, its partial—equilibrium nature ignores the
feedback effects of higher oil prices on traded goods prices and

world

interest rates that have been stressed in the two-country model of
Sachs (1980) and the three—country model of Marion-Svensson (1981).
The model described here should be seen as offering a useful way to
analyze the effects of expected versus unexpected disturbances on
important macro variables, but should be viewed as a first step in
developing a more complete general equilibrium analysis.
