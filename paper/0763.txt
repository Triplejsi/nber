Partial Retirement and the Analysis of Rtirement Behavior

ABS TRACT

This paper examines the phenomenon of partial retirement. Topics
covered include: (1) the quantitative importance of partial retirement,
(2) institutional constraints in addition to mandatory retirement which
limit the opportunity to retire partially in the main job, (3) the effect
of these constraints on the specification of the relevant structural equa-

tions in a life cycle retirement model, (4) the impact of standard explanatory variables on four outcomes —— complete retirement, partial retirement
both in and outside the main job, and non—retirement, (5) the importance
of partial retirement even for those who do not face mandatory retirement,

are not covered by a pension and are healthy, (6) the sensitivity of
results based on a dichotomous retirement variable to whether the partially retired are classified as retired or not retired.

A number of studies have either treated partial retirement inappropriately or have adopted unrealistic assumptions about the opportunity

set facing potential retirees. Our findings call their results into
question.

the Retirement

These statistics indicate the extent and nature of partial retirement

I. The Extent and Nature of Partial Retirement
This section contains descriptive statistics relevant to the

phenomenon of partial retirement. Most of these data are from the Retirement History Survey, a longitudinal sample of individuals

who were 58 to

63 years old when they were initially surveyed in 1969. They have been
reinterviewed every two years. Responses from four survey years (1969,
1971, 1973, and 1975) are pooled. This procedure means that there is
a greater number of observations for those in the middle ages of the
survey than for those in age brackets falling in the extremes for the

group sample. Our analysis is restricted to white males who are not
self-employed in their main job.1
It is useful to begin by considering how the frequency of full and

partial retirement is affected by the definition of retirement used.
One obvious way to define retirement status is to use some objective

measure based on wages or hours. Another is to accept the individual's
self—description of retirement status. For each survey year the question—
aire asks whether the respondent considers himself to be completely

retired, partially retired, or not retired. In Table 1, we relate the
responses to this question to observable indications of work effort
reduction, either in the form of a reduction in hours per week worked,
or in the form of a reduction in wages which may be associated with an

the main job is taken to be the job that the individual held

at age 55 (as long as the individual worked at least 30 hours per week

in this job), or if wages and hours information is unavailable for this
job, the longest job that the individual has held if information is
available for that job.2 The vertical axis of this table similarly

The wages and hours in the main job- are measured as of the time the
terminated the job or, if he was still in it in 1969, as of

that year. This procedure was necessitated by the data. By defining
the main job as the full-time job held at age 55 we do not mean to imply
that there is no turnover in the main jobs. Data pertaining to such turnover are presented in Table 2 and are discussed below. We do, however,
take the job held at age 55 to be representative of the full-time opportunities available to the individual during prime working years. In
requiring information for the main job, and in defining the main job as
we do, there will be a tendency to eliminate from the sample those in
occupations which are characterized by very high turnover, eg., construction.

levels of wages and hours that they exhibited in their main jobs.

(Those exhibiting such a reduction fall in the cells above and to the

left of the dashed line in the table.) Prom the infonation in the table,
it appears that for those reporting partial retirement, a reduction in
wages from the main job, suggesting an easier or more flexible job, is
slightly more coimnon than is a comparable percentage

reduction in hours

worked. The statistics for individuals who report themselves as not
retired are presented in

these

the lower part of the table. Relatively few of

individuals exhibited a substantial reduction in either wages or

hours from the levels found in the main job; only 8 percent had reductions
in either wages or hours that were as large as 40 percent.
Table 1

indicates that some people consider themselves to be partially

retired even though they are working more, and for higher
they

wages, than

did in their main jobs, while others consider themselves not retired

even though they have experienced a substantial drop in hours or wages.
Nevertheless, there is a close correspondence between observed changes
in wages and

hours

and

reported

status. Indeed, although in our

empirical

analysis we classify people into different retirement categories based on
reported status, we obtain similar findings when we base the definition

of full-time work on an objective measure —

i.e.,

working at least 60%

of the hours for at least 60% of the wage paid in the main job.1

1The advantage of measuring the dependent variable by self-reported
rather then objectively measured retirement status is that fewer observations need be eliminated from the sample using the former definition.
An alternative definition, one which does not distinguish between retirement and part—time work, classifies as partially retired all these who
work less than some number of hours. (E.g., Zabaiza, Pissarides and
Barton, 1980).

8

Table 2 reports on the percentages of individuals by age according

to their response as to whether they are retired, partially retired or
not retired, whether they are still in or have left the main job, and
whether or not the individual has faced or will face mandatory retire-

ment in the main job. Note that the number of people in their late 60's
who report they are partially retired is substantial. Indeed, among those
65 or over who are working the number who are partially retired is compa-

rable to the number who are working full-time. Around 20 percent of the
people in this age range who do not face mandatory retirement on the main

job are partially retired at any point in time. For those who will or
have faced mandatory retirement on the main job and are 65 or above, the

comparable figure is 11 percent.

This comparison suggests that while a person

not retired is much more likely to be working in the same job as

the one he held at age 55, a person who reports that he is semi—retired
is considerabley more likely to be in a different job from the one held
at 55.

Table 2 also provides information on the relation between retire-

ment status and

mandatory retirement on the main job. Compared to indi-

viduals who do not face mandatory

retirement,

those who are facing

mandatory retirement in the future have a higher probability that they

still be working full-time in their main job and a reduced probawill
bility that they will either have taken another full-time job or

will

have partially retired in any kind of a job. After the mandatory retirement age, a few people are able to remain in their main jobs, indicating
that for these individuals, either the mandatory retirement requirement

Note

that for an observation to be included in this table, it was

necessary that we could determine whether or not there is mandatory
retirement in the individual's main job. The probabilities of
partial retirement for those included

in this table are

somewhat below

probabilities for the entire sample. For example, the probability
in the entire sample of a white male who is 65 or above reporting he
is partially retired is about 19% compared to a weighted average of
the

since they indicate that partial retirement is an important

phenomenon, they imply that if a dichotomous measure of retirement status
is used, as it is in many studies, (eg., Clark and Johnson, 1980, and
Quinn, 1977) findings may differ in a non-trivial way depending on
whether the partially retired are classified with the retired or with

those still working. Second, it also means that a model of retirement
behavior which excludes the possibility of partial retirement is misspecified with respect to an important aspect of behavior, and raises
the possibility that any resulting specification errors may be large.

Thus the descriptive statistics raise the possibility that inappropriate
treatment of partial retirement in analyses of retirement behavior may
have

important consequences. These 'implications underline the importance

responding non—business concerns. For related data on industries and

II. Variations on the Life Cycle Model of Retirement
Behavior arid Implications for Estimation

In this section we explore models of retirement behavior and
modifications required by various limitations on the opportunities for
partial retirement. First, we briefly describe the standard life cycle
model of retirement behavior. We then discuss how differences in

opportunities for partial retirement are reflected in the specification
of the utility function and the opportunity set facing each individual,
and how this influences the retirement decision that emerges from the

standard life cycle model.
The basic retirement decision may be viewed as the solution to a
lifetime utility maximization
problem,

the

problem. In the simplest fori of

where r is the real interest rate, K0 is initial wealth, and W(t) is
the wage offer at time t.

This problem is of the form that may be analyzed with the theory

of optimal control.1 With some minor assumptions about the boundedness

and

of the function u, optimal control theory assures that
a solution to the problem does exist. That is, there is a consumption

environment contemplated in the basic model is one in which the indi-

vidual is free to vary his hours on the job without affecting the wage

literature requires that the labor supply decision be an all-or- nothing

that the person must either work full-time or retire (Burbidte

possibly at substantially reduced wages, if he desires to continue to

that it specifies that there is likely to be a sharp drop in the wages

to the alternative job.

Two further environments assume that there are always two jobs
available to the individual, and that some aspect of the main job becomes

more

onerous over time, ultimately causing the individual to choose an

cation into the optimal control problem, namely, that the control set
is ne longer convex [e.g., 0.5 is a linear combination of 0 arid 1 but
is not itself a permissible value for H(t)], as required by the optimal
control theory. This kind of complication, which is also found in many
of the other extensions examined in this section, can be overcome by
a technique described in Gustman and Steinmeier (1981). The important
point for purposes of the present discussion is that even with this
complication, the control problem still possesses a determinate solution
for the optimal paths of consumption and labor supply.

Normally,

choose one job or the other, but not both. The corresponding budget

the individual becomes older (e.g., the job may involve hard physical

This is reflected in the fact the H1(t) reduces the value

of the utility function more than would a similar nber of hours

This may be introduced in the model

by constraining H1(t), but not H2(t),

to be either 0 or 1.
For each of the five job environments described above, the optimal
control problem will have as a solution a determinate pair of paths for
consumption

and labor

supply.

However, these paths will in general not

be identical. This means that the paths of consumption

and labor supply

are dependent not just on the parameters a which influence the shape of
the utility function and the waqes offered to the individual, but [hey

are the time paths of wages and hours, respectively1 and S is a vector

of Social Security parameters. w(t) and b are introduced into model
of retirement behavior through the budget constraint.

Private pensions may be introduced into the models in much the

same way as Social Security. Instead of the Social Security tax rate
s there is the pension contribution rate p, and the private pension
benefit formula f(W, H, t, P) replaces the Social Security benefit

and

H*(t), in addition to being functions of a, W, and e, may also

be considered as functions of the contribution rates s and p

and the

vectors S and P which determine the nature of the benefit formula.

Implications for Estimation.
The optima]. path of labor supply H*(t) provides a basis for the

retirement equations estimated in the next section. The path is a
function of wages, the individual characteristics which cause utility
functions to vary from person to person, the specific job environment
facing the individual, and the contribution rates and benefit formulae
for Social Security and

ment, partial

path
of

pension

plans. By defining complete retire-

retirement, and full-time work in terms of the labor supply

H* (t), the retirement status of an individual can be made a function

these same variables.1 In a model with a single job, for instance,

partial retirement might be defined as the reduction of labor supply
below full-time work, and complete retirement might be defined as the

cessation of labor supply. In terms of H*(t), partial retirement would
occur if

O<H*(t)<1, and

complete

retirement would occur when

H*(t) = 0.

1The arguments of the reduced form relations would not be
altered
even if one were to modify the life cycly model to meet objections as
to its utility in explaining
savings and consumption behavior such as
those raised by Kurz (1981).

20

In a model with two jobs, partial retirement might be alternatively defined
to occur when the individual leaves the main job and enters the transition
job.

It should be clear that

these

definitions contain

arbitrariness, a problem which is compounded if only

with flexible functional forms and let the data tell us about the shape
of the function are required in this problem. One relatively easy-t0

(1975). Another technique which probably does

Two of the studies noted above utilize a dependent variable that
consists of the probability of falling in one of three states—full
retirement, partial retirement and non-retirement.
(Boskin and Hurd and
Zabalza, Pissarjdes and Barton.) However, both studies are based on
models which incorporate a utility function specified not over the

lifetime, but for a single period.
2

We recognize that a number of these variables may be endogenous
to the analysis. These include the two wages, pension or social security
coverage, mandatory retirement provision on the job, and health status.
A complete life cycle model might explain each of these in terms of the
full opportunity set available to the individual and expected productivity

over the life cycle, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.

Unfortunately the PSID, which doescontain information on the ability
workers to reduce hours, is inadequate in other ways, e.g., there are' few
older workers and no information on mandatory retirement. It is possible
using the data in the Retirement History Survey to impute, in a crude way,
the value of pensions. But no information is available in the Retirement
History Survey on the crucially important effect of additional earnings on
the marginal value of pension wealth, or on whether part—time work on the

of

job will affect adversely the level of earnings used to calculate
pension benefits. For a discussion of the relation between the marginal
val of the life—time pension stream and the increment in lifetime income

this standardized wage variable is therefore cons intent with the

theory developed above, in which labor supply at any moment influenced
by the course of events over the entire life cycle.
It was recognized that the imputation procedure might be subject
to selectivity bias, and a test for selectivity bias was carried out.
Essentially, we estimated a reduced form equation explaining the

probability

of full or part—time work and included a cateqorica3 variable based on
this probability in the wage equations. The test did indicate that: self—
selection was present in the wage equations, hut: corrections for this

problem had Only a very minor effect on the estimated parameters of the

retirement equation —

changing parameter estimates by only

a few tenths of a percentage point. Accordi.nqly, the reported results
do not standardize for the effects of selectivity bias.1 Additional
details of the procedure to correct for selectivity bias are found in
Gustman arid Steinmeier (1981).

decline is that the probability of not retiring falls with age even for
those who do not face mandatory retirement, so that the older the worker,
the smaller is the difference in this probability associated with mandatory

retirement. As would be expected, the probability of partially retiring
in the main job is also lower for those who have already faced mandatory

Dichotomous Dependent Variables
To answer

the last of the questions we posed above, we turn now to

the implications of our findings for retirement studies which utilize a

dependent variable which is dichotomous —

retired

or not retired. A

problem arises for such studies because there are only two retirement
categories, with no clear cut criteria for deciding whether the partially

retired should be classified as retired or not. The obvious question is
thether findings are

retired

affected

by the choice of

which

category the partially

are placed in. This question can be answered by comparing the

changes in the probabilities reported in the bottom panel of Table 5

with the negative of those in the top panel. The bottom panel indicates
the

responsiveness of the probability of being

retired

to variation in

the independent variables, where the partially retired are not counted
in the retired group. The top panel indicates the reponsiveness of the
probability of full—time work to variation inthe iiidependent variables, and

hence the negative of these figures indicates the responsiveness of the

probability of retirement to variation in independent variables, where
in this case the partially retired are counted as retired.
It

is readily apparent from these figures that the choice of

definition,
or

i.e. whether the partially retired

are classified as retired

not retired, may have a substantial impact on the measured effects

of the explanatory variables on retirement probabilities. For example,
a higher wage in the non-retirement job reduces the probability of

This means that the

that table are not necessarily the responses

would expect from each individual in

the sample. While we do not

report in detail the effects of these interactions, some major effects
should be mentioned.

1. There is a significant interaction

between the pension variable

and the wage offer in the main job. Among those with no pension, a
higher wage in the main job reduces slightly both the probability of

complete retirement and the probability of partially retiring outside

the main job. Among those with a pension, a higher wage in the main job
increases by as much as twenty percentage points the probability of

complete retirement, and it reduces the probability of partially retiring
outside the main job substantially more than for those with no pension.

37

the other side of this interaction, low wage workers who are
covered by a pension are more likely to retire partially outside of the

main job than are those who are not covered. Among

high

wage workers,

those covered by a pension are less likely to retire partially outside

of their main job than are those with no pension. Instead, among high
wage workers those with a pension are even more likely to retire fully.

2. Health status and private pension coverage exhibit a significant
interaction effect. Poor health reduces the probability of working full
time more for those with no pension than for those with a pension. Among
those who are healthy, pension coverage reduces the probability of working
full-time more than for those who are unhealthy.
3.

Pension coverage and

mandatory

retirement provisions exhibit

a significant interaction effect. For example, among

who do not

Also,

individuals

are less likely to keep working full—time if they are covered by a
pension than if they are not, and the negative effect of pension coverage
is even stronger among those who will face mandatory retirement on their
main job than it is among those who will not.

IV Conclusion
This paper has considered the role of partial retirement in the
analysis

of retirement behavior. It has been structured

to provide

38

answers to six questions posed at the outset. These answers are
summarized in the following conclusions:

(1) Descriptive statistics

to partial retirement demonstrate that partial retirement is
indeed an important phenomenon. (2) Some individuals partially retire
in their main job but a relatively larger number partially retire outside

pertaining

of

their main job.

(3) Individuals face a number of different opportunity

sets. Most are not free to reduce hours in their main jobs. Differing
opportunities for work on a full-time or part-time basis in the main job
and for employment outside of the main job may be included in the
specification of the relevant structural equations of a life cycle retirement model by appropriate modifications of the lifetime budget constraint
and/or modifications of the form of the utility function.

(4) The

probability of partial retirement, especially of partial retirement
outside of the main job, is related significantly to indicators of
coverage from pension programs, mandatory retirement provisions, wage
offers in main and partial retirement jobs, health, family status, and
of course age.

(5) For those who are not forced out of their main job

by poor health or by mandatory retirement provisions,

or who are not

attracted out by pension provisions, partial retirement
outside the main job is an important phenomenon.

both within and

The numerical importance

of partial retirement outside of the main job for this group calls into
question results based on models which make no allowance for this phenomenon.

parameter estimates in studies of retirement behavior which use a

dichotomous dependent variable are sensitive to the way the partially

retired are classified — as retired or not retired.

we cannot determine the effects of the major changes in retirement policy
which have recently been proposed, such as changes in the ages of normal

and early retirement under social security, changes in the permissible
age' for mandatory retirement, and changes in the structure and coverage of

private pension programs. If, on the other hand, the parameters of the
utility function and. their distributions were known, we then would be in

a position to simulate the effects of programs with rules that would

result in kinks and bends in the budget line that have not as yet been
encountered. However, if parameters estimates obtained from a structural
model are to be reliable enough for use in policy analysis, the structural
model must be specified correctly. This requires a full understanding of
the opportunity set available to each individual. According to the
evidence developed here, this opportunity set differs among individuals,
especially the opportunities for partial retirement. n understanding
of how and why these opportunities differ is a key requirement for any
structural analysis of retirement behavior.
