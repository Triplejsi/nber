Low Cost Student Labor:
The Use and Effects of the Subminimum Wage Provisions
for Full—time Students

ABS TRACT

Section 14(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act permits certain classes
of employers to pay full—time students a wage fifteen percent below the

minimum wage. This study develops a new data base from administrative
records, our own survey of participating company and establishment managers,
and published information on local labor markets to investigate employer
responses to a subminimum wage program.

Our analysis of the full—time student certification program has

yielded four general conclusions. First, while the most important users
of the program are institutions of higher education, certain non—educational
employers in the retail and service sectors employ a sufficiently large
and increasing number of students below the minimum wage to suggest that
the program has considerable attractiveness in the private sector. Second,
area labor market conditions are a major determinant of which establishments with permits to pay students subminimum wages in fact make use of

the program and the extent of that use. Establishments in areas characterized by high wages and low levels of unemployment, implying high

costs in employing or locating substitute labor, make more use of student
subminimum workers than establishments in areas with lower costs for

substitute labor. The magnitude of the effect of area wage is, however,
sensitive to the precise specification of the full—time student employment
equation and the variable used to measure area wage. Although this sensitivity leads to variations in the estimation of the elasticity of
substitution between student and other labor, reasonable estimates of this

elasticity range from .5 to 1.0. Among company characteristics, unionism
reduces program usage, while certain company incentives promote use of

the program. Finally, restrictions in the law placed on hours worked at
the subminimum appear to be a major reason for failure to employ students
under this program.

I. Introduction
What happens when a subminimum wage is permitted for certain groups
of workers in an economy covered by minimum wage?

This question has recently achieved prominence in the United
States as a result of suggestions that a youth subminimum provision

to be added to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Despite widespread

public

discussion of the youth subxninlmum and an enormous literature on the mini-

mum wage, relatively little attention has been given to the existence
of a subminimum for one group of youth workers (students) in the current
1!
law.
Under Section 14(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act certain classes
of employers subject to the minimum wage provisions of the Act are eligible
to pay full—time students less than the minimum wage otherwise applicable

in their establishments. For many years, the law was such that relatively
few establishments made use of the student subminimum provision. Changes
in the law in 1966, and further changes in 1974 and 1977, however, have
led to an enormous increase in the use of the student subminimum.

What can be learned from the experience with the student sub—
minimum about employer response to reduced wages for special groups of

workers? What factors have led some employers to make more extensive use
of the student subminimum than do other employers? What implications
can be drawn for a general youth subminimum?
This study develops a new data base for analysis of the student
subminimum and uses this data to attempt to answer the preceding questions.
As a useable data set relating to the subminimum did not exist when we

began our work, considerable effort went into data development. We added
to existing administrative records the results of our own telephone survey
of firms and published information on local labor markets, so as to have

Information on the economically interesting variables. The strategy of
developing data beyond that on administrative records for the purpose of

—2—

program analysis was necessary due to the lack of important economic

variables in administrative records. Our success in data development
suggests that this strategy may be useful in analysis of other programs
as well.

Our analysis has yielded four general conclusions regarding experience with the student subminimum to the minimum wage.

1) While the most important users of the program are institutions
of higher education, private non—educational employers, notably department
stores, variety stores, and to a lesser extent food and apparel stores
and theatre chains employ a sufficiently large and increasing number of
students below the minimum to suggest that the program has considerable

attractiveness In the private sector. As the student minimum provisions
have become increasingly lenient in recent years, the number of establishments obtaining permits to pay students below minimum wages rose from

2,756 in 1962—1966 to 5,063 in 1967—1974 to 25,985 in 1975—1979. Exclusive
of institutions of higher education (not permitted to use the law until
1974) the number of hours covered by the student subininimum increased

from 12,067,000 to 76,102,000 between 1974 and 1979. Among non—educational
users, a substantial proportion of employee hours (10.5% in 1979) are worked

by students at below minimum wages. Even with the sizeable expansion
and extensive use of students in college and universities, however, no
more than 3—4% of employed students were employed at the subminimum wage

in 1979. Thus the program appears to be an important economic factor for
those employers using it but to have only a modest impact on the overall
student market.

2) Area labor market conditions are a major determinant of which
establishments with permits to pay students subininimum wages in fact make

use of the program and the extent of that use. Establishments in areas

—3—

characterized by high wages and therefore high costs of substitute labor
make more use of student subminimum workers than establishments in areas

with low local wage levels. The magnitude of this effect is, however,
sensitive to the precise specification of the FTS employment equation
and the variable used to measure ttarea wage", giving a wide range of estimated

elasticities. Consistent with the direction of this result, areas with
low levels of unemployment, indicating relatively higher costs in locating
and attracting alternative workers, make more extensive use of the program.
On the supply side, employment of students at the subminimum is diminished
significantly by high alternative wages for young workers.

3) The characteristics of companies also affects program usage,
with the presence of unions significantly reducing FTS

employment. Company

incentives to promote use of the program appear to have a positive effect
on usage while less direct reward systems linked to payroll costs or to

profit sharing schemes do not increase program use. Part of the ineffectiveness of such programs is the result of establishments in companies with
such policies being unaware of their existence.

4) A major reason for failure to employ FTSs relates to the
restrictions placed on hours worked at the subminimum, both for the establish-

ment as a whole and for the individual students. Of the 225 establishments
we interviewed by mail, 29% cited these hour restrictions as the most
important reason for limited program use.

The remainder of this paper describes the data and analysis on

which these conclusions are based. Section II provides a description of
the student subminimum provisions in the minimum wage law and of the size

of the program under study. Section III develops the research design and
model that guides the analysis, and gives a brief description of the data

developed. Section IV gives our econometric results and Section V concludes
with an interpretation of the meaning and implications of these results.

II. The Subminirnum Wage for Full—time Students

In this section we describe briefly the nature of the student
subininimum provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act and set out the basic
facts regarding current size of the program.

The Law
Section 14(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act currently provides
that certain classes of employers subject to the minimum wage provisions
of the Act are eligible to pay full—time students less than the minimum

wage otherwise applicable in their establishments. The provisions of
Section 14(b) are governed by Chapter 5, Part 519 of the Code of Federal
Regulations of the Employment Standards Administration (ESA), Wage and

Hour Division of the Department of Labor. The current scope of Section 14(b)
is delineated by the specific language of the Section, the ESA regulations,
2/

and the scope of the coverage of the minimum wage law itself.
From the ESA regulations, a "full—time student" (FTS) eligible
for employment at the subminimum is defined as:
a student who receives primarily daytime instruction at the
physical location of a bona fide educational institution in
accordance with the institution's accepted definition of a
full—time student.
The major classes of employers that are covered by the minimum

wage law that may pay FTSs below the statutory minimum are: (1) retail and
service industry establishments, (2) agricultural sector establishments,

and (3) institutions of higher education. The differential provided
for in this program has consistently been governed by the provision that the
full—time student wage may not be less than 85% of the statutory minimum
3/
wage.

—5—

Employers covered by the subminimum fall into one of three classes,
each having different limits on the employer's use of the program. First,

any employer may employ six or fewer FTSs. Second, certain employers

may employ

more than six FTSs, with the total number of hours of the FTS work force
at the establishment not exceeding 10% of the total hours of all employees

during any month. Finally, some employers are permitted FTS hours up
to a specified percentage (exceeding 10%) of total employee hours. Employers
may be subject to a higher percentage limit if they demonstrate with records

that in the year preceding the application or certification in the program,
the proportion of student hours of employment to total hours of all employees

exceeded 10% at this, or a comparable establishment. This proportion
is nearly always based on the "practice of similar establishments" of the
same employers, or other employers in the same industry rather than records

from that particular establishment. Once a firm is in the over 10% category,
it remains in that category regardless of program use.
Table 1, based on published data, shows that about 45% of retail

and service establishments in the program are in the greater than 10%
category. These establishments cover about two—thirds of all student
subminimum hours, and include most large, multi—establishment companies

which use the program. In establishments in the less than 10% category,
5% of hours worked are worked by students paid below minimum wage. In
establishments in the greater than 10% category, the comparable fraction
is 15%.

The way the program operates establishments in any category are
permitted to hire students at the subminimum up to the specified maximum
fraction of hours (or up to six students), whereupon they would be obligated

to pay additional students at the minimum wage. Companies can be expected
to seek permits with specified maximums above their normal anticipated

usage. This in fact appears to be the case.

—7—

There are two other general restrictions on the hours FTSs may work

that apply across the three different categories of FTS employers. Whether
the employer Is in the six or fewer, less than 10%, or over 10% category,

he must in some way meet the condition that the employment of FTSs at the
subminimuin wage "will not reduce the full—time employment opportunities

of other persons". Generally, this requirement is satisfied by the employer
attesting to this fact in his application. Since employment of FTSs serves
as a substitute for other forms of labor, we regard this provision as a

"dead letter". Secondly, there are hours restrictions for any individual
FTS. While classes are in session an FTS may be paid the subminimum no
more than 20 hours per week, and while classes are not in session the individual limit is 40 hours per week.

Establishments which violate the provisions of the act are liable
to pay workers "back—pay" and instances of such orders can be cited.
In our discussion with Regional Administrators of the program,

however, there was no case in which establishments were prosecuted for
violating the nonsubstitution stipulation.

Growth of the Program
The FTS program began in 1961 as a result of concern about the
possibly adverse effect on employment of students caused by the extension
of the FLSA to an additiona]J 3.6 million employees, most of whom were

employed in retail or service establishments. The 1977 provisions described
earlier are the result of several changes in the law, generally in the
direction of encouraging use of the subminimum, the major exception being
a 1966 decrease in the maximum hours FTS employees can work during the
school year fromthat mandated in the initial legislation to 20 hours (see

table 2). As a result of the changes In the law the number of certifications
granted and students employed under this program has increased significantly.

Columns 1—3 of Table 3 document the sizeable growth of the FTS

program in the period covered. It shows a major jump in program usage in
1974—1975 and minor jumps in 1967 and 1978 as a result of the changes in

the law in 1966, 1974 and 1977. The contraction in the extent of the
program from 1976 to 1977 is in part due to the mid—1976 Supreme Court
4/

decision, Nationaj

ue of Cities vs. Usery,

which held that state

and municipal employees that were brought under the FLSA with the 1974

amendments should properly be exempt from minimum wage provisions. To
get a notion of magnitude of the impact of the program on the student
job market, population and labor force participation rates, column 3

gives estimates of total student employment. Roughly 3% of all student
employment is accounted for by the program.

In sum, from modest beginnings the student subminimum has become
a non—negligible part of the minimum wage system in the United States.
While only a small proportion of employed students are paid the subminimum,
in establishments using the program it is of sizeable import.

III. Research Design and Data Descrjption
Employment of full—time student labor under the subminimum provision,
like employment of other workers, is determined by demand and supply forces.
Demand for FTS labor will depend on the cost of such labor relative to
other inputs, the output of the firms with certificates, and the specific

technological and institutional characteristics of the firms. Supply of
FTS labor will depend on the alternatives available to students in the
local labor market.

To analyze the demand and supply determinants of full—time student
labor under the student subminimum one needs data on the number of FTS

workers and on the various demand and supply factors. As there did not

did not exist, prior to our study a data set with the requisite information,
we devoted a good deal of effort to obtaining the information needed for
analysis of the student subminimum.

The primary sources of our data set are the administration records

on employer application for certification under the program. As described
in detail in the data appendix, we obtained a sample of 7,874 establishments
from the administrative records, selecting those in companies that had
ten or more establishments enrolled in the program and that were in the

over 10% certificate class of users. We obtained information on the number
of FTS hours and related information on these establishments for the period
1971—1978, as indicated in table 4.

The administrative records lacked information on the characteristics
of companies, wages of non—FTS labor and other aspects of the local labor

market in which an establishment is found. To obtain data on these determinants
of FTS—labor we went to two other sources.

Data on the characteristics of the companies with FTS certificates we
obtained by a telephone survey of the more than 200 parent companies to

which our establishments belonged. As table 4 shows, we obtained information
from the telephone survey on two key institutional factors which can be
expected to influence employment of FTS labor, along with related variables:
unionism and explicit corporate policy toward employment of FTS labor.

We expect unionism to reduce usage of the FTS program, in order to protect
the wage scale and jobs of covered labor. With respect to corporate policy

we hypothesize that companies which either reward or pressure managers for
cost reductions through employment of FTSs can be expected to hire more

than companies which do not have such policies. Our questionnaire provides
two pieces of information on corporate policy regarding FTS employment.
The first piece of information deals with whether the company put any

pressures on the managers to use the program either through direct encouragement of program or managerial policies to hold down labor costs.

The second asked whether the managers' compensation was in any way tied

to their performance (profits, sales or costs). Using both of these
measures, we hoped to account for different levels of company pressure
on managers to cost minimize by using the program.

Information on local labor market conditions which might be expected to influence FTS employment, Including the level of wages of po—

tentialsubstjtuteworkers and the level of wages available to teenagers
in an area we obtained from published sources. As our wage measures we
took manufacturing wages in an area for the years covered from the BLS,
and mean annual earnings for prime age (30—34 year old) workers and mean
annual earnings for 16—19 year old workers for 1969, as reported in the

Census of Population. Manufacturing wages have the advantage of being
available on an annual basis; the Census data have the advantage of referring
to the entire labor market and give us our only feasible measure of alternatives

available to young as opposed to older workers. We also obtained data on
area unemployment rates for the various areas.

We expect the area labor market variables to affect usage of students
under the subminimum in accord with the demand—supply framework sketched

out at the outset. Area wages (manufacturing average hourly earnings or
prime age worker annual earnings) are expected to be positively related
to the student subminimum hours as firms substitute students in favor of

higher priced alternative labor. Area unemployment rates can be expected,
by a similar logic, to have a negative effect on the employment of

students at the subminimum. The higher the area unemployment rate, the
greater is the likely availability of substitute labor and thus the less

the incentive to employ the students. Finally the economic opportunities
for teenagers In an area, reflected in the earnings of 16—19 year olds,

-4—
is expected to influence employment of FTSs by altering the supply of

students. The better the opportunities elsewhere the smaller will be
the number accepting below minimum wage jobs.

The final result of the data collection is a data set containing
over 20,000 establishment years from 1971 to 1979 with information on
program usage (both hours worked and estimated number of students hired),
local labor market conditions, and some data on the parent company.

Table 5 compares the size of our sample to that of the greater
than 10% group from which the sample was drawn and to the total group

of program participants from retail and service establishments. As can be
seen, our sample includes about 30—40% of student hours in the greater
than 10% group and 20—25% of all student hours in the industries covered.

As retail and service trade represents 25% of all students hired under the
program, our sample covers about 5% of the total FTS employment under the
student subminimum.

Table 6 decomposes the 1978 observations in our sample by industry.
What is important is the concentration of FTS bodies in department stores,

who appear to be the major users of the program. The other important user
is the variety, hardware, and drug store industry. It should be noted
that this distribution relates only to establishments in our sample and
thus to those, in the greater than 10% category.

Analytic framework
While the data set has both time series and cross—section variation,

in this study we focus exclusively on the cross—section variation. We do this
for two reasons: first, because our company information and our information
on the earnings of adult prime age and youth workers in a local labor market

exist solely on a cross—section basis; second, because the limited years
covered and the concurrence of changes in the mininum wage over the period covered
and of changes in the provisions for the student subminimum makes it
exceedingly difficult to determine the effect of changes in the minimum

in a time series. Note that by focusing on the cross—sectional data we

eliminate most variation in the student subminimum itself: unless

companies
5'

choose otherwise they pay 85% of the same minimum wage by the law.

This

does not, however, mean that we cannot make inferences about establishment

responses to changes in the subminimum wage. Since labor demand decisions
depend on relative factor costs and student supply decisions depend on
comparisons of the subniinimum with alternative wages, we can interpret

coefficients on other wage variables as reflecting the impact of the fixed
subminimum versus the variation in the other wages across areas.
A small formal model
To provide a more formal framework for ensuing analyses, let

L =
S

S

=

demand for FTS labor with corresponding elasticity of a,

supply of FTS labor with corresponding elasticity of c,

W = the

fixed wage for students,

X = the

level of demand curve for FTS labor,

WN = wage of non—FTS labor (proxied in our empirical analysis by

the area manufacturing wage or average annual earnings of
prime age workers)i and

L.

-

= non-FTS hours of employment.

-

Now let dots above variables reflect in derivatives, so that L and S

are demand and supply changes respectively, and W = 0 (since the student
wage is fixed). The relative demand for student labor can then be expressed
as:

SLNSWN)L
If

supply factors do not constrain the employment of FTS workers,

so that firms face an infinitely elastic schedule at the fixed price, W,
and if output is fixed (X =
(2)

0),

employment will be:

—18—

Equation (2) expresses an isoquant relationship for the trade—off between
two factors of production, FTS labor and non—FTS labor, given a constant
elasticity of substitution between the two, where the "market" wage of the
FTS input is held fixed at the subminimum.

When

the

availability of students at W is insufficient to meet

demand, the analysis is more complex as supply factors will also enter

the employment determination equation. Thererare two basic ways in which
to model this situation: in the first, the supply constraint is assumed
to be effective, at least in some labor markets, so that firms are unable
to hire the number of students desired at the subminimum; in the second,

certain nonwage costs and adjustments are assumed to equilibrate the market.

Panel A of figure 1 depicts the first situation. In the region
where supply and demand cross before the fixed subminimum wage (W), the
supply constraint produces employment below that predicted by the demand

curve. In the region where the schedules cross after ' by contrast,
employment is determined by the demand model (1) and (2).

With a national

minimum, it is likely that in some markets establishments will be supply
constrained whereas others will not be so constrained, depending on the
6/

earnings opportunities available to students outside the subminimum sector.
Panel B represents what we believe to be a more realistic model,
in which firms may respond to supply constraints through either raising
the subminiinum or engaging in costly search for students (which shifts

the supply curve) or in reducing hiring standards. With respect to the
first form of adjustment, while the majority of the thirty—nine companies

responding to question hg in the company survey ("Hourly Wage Paid to
FTSs?") paid exactly 15% below the minimum wage, seven companies did indicate paying FTSs a wage that is below the federal minimum yet greater
than 85% of the minimum wage.

Another response is to continue to hire students but to pay them

at or above the minimum wage. Student employees then move into the category of non—FTS labor. If the employer does not differentiate in the wages
paid to students and responds to a supply constraint in this manner, he
will either report no FTS hours of employment under the program or drop

out of the program altogether. While our sample is not designed to examine
the latter possibility, 28 percent of the establishment years included in
the sample are from establishments enrolled in the program but without any

student hours of employment paid at subminimum wages. For such establishments that have invested in enrolling in the program, but have no FTS
hours of employment, we expected measures of student supply to be particularly important considerations.

A third response for employers is to invest more resources in
locating student labor willing to work at the subrninimum wage. In this
way, the cost of student labor facing employers consists of two components:
the dollars paid to the FTS labor and the incremental costs incurred by
employers to locate this labor.

Whichever response dominates, the implication is that supply

We model this situation by adding an additional cost term to our

IV. Econometric Analysis of Participat ion and Use of Student Subminimum
This section presents the statistical results of our analysis
of our establishnent data set.

The analysis shows that consistent with

our model, employment depends on both the demand and supply side forces
in the local labor markets. The impact Of wages of other workers on employment of FTSs is positive but is extremely sensitive to changes in the speci-

fication of the employment equation. Average teenage earnings have a
sizeable negative impact. Area unemployment also has a negative impact
on FTS employment. We also find that several establishment characteristics
influence employment of FTSs, with unionized establishments in particular
using relatively less FTS labor than other establishments.

Establishments

whose companies actively encourage their establishments to use the program
show greater usage, though more general incentives to cut costs or raise
profits (such as profit sharing plans) did not increase program use. These
same factors determine both whether or not an establishment uses its permit
and the FTS employment among users.

—22—

Analysis
We analyze the effect of explanatory' variables on program usage using

two samples from our establishment data set: a sample consisting of all
establishments, including those that do not have any FTS students, and
a sample restricted to establishments that in fact use their permits.
Within each sample we also analyze a subsample consisting of those establishments in SNSAs for which we had local labor"market information from

the 1970 Census. With the all—establishment sample, we analyze the number
of FTS hours worked and the ratio of FTS to non—FTS hours worked, without
correcting (say via a Tobit analysis) for the fact that a significant

number of observations are clumped at zero hours. We also run linear
probability and probit equations for whether or not an establishment in

fact hires any FTS labor. With the sample of establishments which use some
FTS labor, we estimate equations relating the ln of FTS hours worked and
the in of FTS hours divided by non—FTS hours worked to the dependent variables.
For several of the variables from our company survey, there were

a sizeable number of missing observations. Rather than deleting observations
and running into problems of sample selectivity due to missing observations,

we included special dummy variables for missing observations. As we have
done this only for variables that are categorical, we are simply establishing
a new category and thus face no major econometric problems as a result.
In addition to the variables discussed in the previous section,

we include three other sets of "controls". First, we controlled for
year, as changes in the law might affect program use.

Second, we con—

trolled for industry (e.g., theatre and food store), to hold fixed for
technological differences in the ability to utilize the program. Third,
we controlled for the region in which an establishment was located. Initially, we anticipated region would be an innocuous variable but it turned

out to have an important effect in one set of calculations, for reasons
we do not understand.

—23—

Results: Determinants of Student Hours in Full Sample
The major results of the econometric analysis are given in Table 7
which records the results of least squares regression of FTS hours on the

postulated determinants. These results are reported for the entire sample
of establishments, including those which lack some information about the
8/

local labor market.

Columns 1—4 report calculations using average hourly

earnings in manufacturing as the indicator of the cost of substitute
labor in the area while columns 5—6 report calculations using the annual
earnings of prime age workers as the indicator of the cost of substitute

labor. As the calculations include some establishments with zero FTS
hours, we do not use the log transformation of the dependent variable.
The basic model includes establishment characteristics and demand side

variables. To these are added supply side variables, as well ascontrols
for Census region.

The first set of explanatory variables tested are designed to

identify the establishments' demand for FTS labor. As can be seen from
the first lines of the table, a higher manufacturing wage rate increases

program use, and a higher area unemployment rate lowers program use. As
the area wage rises and unemployment falls, it becomes more expensive
to hire regular workers because they are no longer available at the mini—

mum wage. If the alternative, better paying jobs are not open to full—
time students, they may still be willing to work at the subminimum. Thus,
the price of student labor has fallen relative to regular labor, and more

student labor will be used implying that student labor is a good but far
9/
from perfect substitute for non—student labor.
Note, however, the significant variation in the magnitude of the estimated wage effect, depending

on the inclusion of regional controls: without region, the coefficient
on log wage with manufacturing hourly earnings is on the order of 2.1

to 2.6; with region, the coefficient drops to .35 to .82, significant

given the number of observations but considerably smaller. In the calculations using the prime age earnings in the SMSA the results are quite

different. In a sample consisting solely of establishments for which
Census SMSA data are available we obtain comparable earnings coefficients

with and without region controls. In the full sample where we "filled"
in the missing earnings by instrumenting the prime age earnings on the
10 /

manufacturing

earnings,

we obtain large coefficients but here the

magnitude drops noticeably with he addition of region controls. We tried
to find an explanation for the significant region effects, (the coefficients

showd that employment of the FTS labor is greater in the North Central, followed

by the West, and is least in the South) but failed. We do not have a
satisfactory explanation for this or for why the area manufacturing wage
is so sensitive to it.

The results with our supply side indicator of alternative earnings
available to young workers are more stable, with the teenage earnings

variable obtaining coefficients on the order of —2.1 to —3.0 in all cases.
In the model presented in the previous section, the coefficient on the
teenage earnings should be similar to that on the cost of substitute labor,
and this is the case in some but not all of the calculations, as can be
seen in the table.

Considering establishment (and company) characteristics, the major

determinant of program usage is unionization, which, as expected, greatly

reduces usage. Smaller establishments (measured on annual sales) also

use less FTS labor, which is also expected. On the other hand, variables
to control for difficulty in finding non—FTSs at the minimum do not work
well, with no clear pattern emerging.

The results from the analysis of company policies designed (or
expected) to encourage program use suggest that only policies directed
at the FTS program itself are effective in raising usage.

General policies

—27—

to

reward good performance, through bonuses or promotion, tend if anything

to reduce usage when introduced along with variables measuring direct
encouragement.

One possible explanation is that companies may set up

these plans, but not have them perceived by the managers. Some support
for this is found in our limited sample of establishment data; in cases
where establishment managers said there was no link between their compensation and performance as managers, 45 % of the company representatives

had said there was such a link. Similarly, 25% of the company representatives
said they pressured managers to use the program when the establishment
managers had reported no such pressure.

Finally, the establishment managers may

pursue

goals other than

maximum profits: if they prefer working with non—students they may not
hire FTSs, even if hiring FTSs would reduce labor costs and increase
profits.

Detrininants of Whether an Establishment Uses Its Permit or Not
Because a sizeable number of establishments which can hire FTSs
do not do so, it is of interest to examine the factors that influence

whether a company uses its permit, as well as the total FTS hours. Accordingly, we have estimated linear and probit probability models designed to
explain use of permits.

The linear probability analysis is given in columns 1—3 of Table 8;

the probit analysis is given in columns 4—6. Both sets of equations yield results
consistent with those given earlier. Column 7 shows what happens when the linear
analysis is done for the SNSA subsample, using the log prime age earning variable,

rather than the area wage. Most independent variables obtain qualitatively
similar coefficients to those in Table 7, as higher unemployment rates,

higher teenage earnings, and unionism all discourage usage, while pressure

to use the program encourages usage. It is perhaps more instructive to
focus on the differences between these results and those of Table 7.

First, once region controls are entered, the BLS manufacturing wage has no

significant impact on usage1 suggesting a smaller role for alternative
cost factors

here. However, the prime age earnings used in the column

7 equation shows a significant impact on wage in the presence of region

controls, just as it did in Table 7. In addition, the impacts of unionization and teenage earnings are larger here when compared to the impacts
of other variables than they were in the results presented in Table 7.
This is appropriate as these variables measure constraints (one institutional—
and one supply—oriented) on the establishment's ability to find and hire
FTSs.

In short, while there are some differences in the magnitude of
impacts, the same set of variables affect the 0—1 program use as affected
overall hours with the same sensitivity of the coefficient on manufacturing
wages to inclusion of regression controls.

Determinants of Student Hours: Users Sample Only
We turn next from analysis of the entire sample of establishments
to the roughly 3/4ths who in fact use their permits and employ student

labor at below minimum wage. For this sample our dependent variables are
estimated in natural logarithms, which makes it easier to read off the

elasticities on which economists focus. The results of these calculations
are summarized in Table 9.

The results from column (1) indicate that without supply or region
controls a sizeable impact of area wage on FTS employment is found, indicating

a demand elasticity on the order of .6 to .7. Controls for supply do
not change the result appreciably, but region controls do reduce the

estimated elasticity to about .1. Without any explanation for the impact
of regional controls, we are left with two rather different estimates.

When we recalculate the estimates using the annual earnings of prime age
workers for the area wage variable, we obtain the results in columns 3

and 4. Similar to the results of Table 7 , the impact of this measure
on FTS employment is greater than the impact of area manufacturing wage.

As the coefficients on the other variables are similar to those
in previous tables, no further discussion of them is needed.

Finally, columns 5 and 6 turn to the determinants of the ln of the
ratio of FTS to non—FTS hours with supply variable excluded, which brings
us closer to the elasticity of substitution concept in models (1) and (2).
The results here are quite similar to those in which we allow the coefficient
on in non—FTS hours to diverge from unity in the previous columns.

Reconciling estimates
The preceding statistical analyses yield relatively strong and
similar results across regressions for all but one of the variables studied.
Unfortunately, the variable for which results were not stable is the sub-

stitute wage variable: the manufacturing area wage falls sharply with
inclusion of regional controls, while the prime—age earnings variable

obtains consistently higher coefficients. As a result we have sets of
estimates of the effect of the cost of substitute labor on employment

of FTS workers which range from quite large to relatively modest. In terms
of our full model (Section IV, equation 5), the coefficient on the log
earnings of the teenagers should be the same as that on the wage variable.
It generally falls between the estimated coefficients for the other two

wage series, and varies less with the inclusion of region controls. This
suggests that constraining the coefficient on teenage wage to be equal

to that on adult wage might be appropriate. The results from this constrained estimation are presented in Table 10.

As expected, we find much less sensitivity to the inclusion of

region controls with the constraint. The constraint also does not substantially affect the coefficients on the other variables, which are not

discussed here. Looking at the full model from Section IV again, we see

that the demand elasticity may be calculated as the ratio of the wage
coefficient to the coefficient on nori—FTS hours. Using the

manufacturing

wage as our wage figure we obtain from column 3, which excludes region
controls, a substitution elasticity of 1.2 (.561.47);

from column 4

we estimate an elasticity of .46 (.22/.48). With the prime age earnings
measure and region controls, we get a figure of 2.4 (1.15/.48). Although
the estimates we have obtained are somewhat sensitive to region controls
and sample changes, we conclude that there is a definite response of FTS
employment to the wages of substitute labor, with the elasticity likely
to fall between .5 and 1.
Implications

Given the estimates in Section IV, what can be said about the
impact of the student subminimum on hours worked by the covered group?
What can be said about the impact of the student subminimum on hours
worked by non—FTS workers?
If we are willing to accept the supply and demand model of equation (5),
we can at least get a crude notion of the elasticity of substitution
between FTS labor and other labor and thus of the impact of the program.
In this section we so interpret the estimated response parameters and use
them to evaluate the impact of the program on hours worked by the two

groups. Our calculations suggest that the subminimum for students has

generated FS hours at eligible firms. Our calculations also suggest that
the subminimum has reduced hours of non—FTS workers. The exact magnitude
of this effect depends critically on the model used to determine the effect——
specifically whether or not region variables are included In the analysis
and the variable usedifto measure area wages.

Since the scale effect of lower wages would be to increase employ—
ment, our estimates presumably understate the increase in FTS hours and

overestimate the decrease in non—FTS hours. We use crude data on the scale
effect to get an idea of the extent of this additional employment effect.

—34—

Elasticity model
First, we express the linkage between the elasticity of substitution and the elasticity of demand for FTS and non—FTS labor for the
case in which there are no supply constraints using the same notation
developed for the models previously described:

EquationS (9) and (10) can be used to estimate the impact of wage
changes due to the subminimum on hours worked of student and nonstudent labor,
given estimated ratios of expenditures on the two forms of labor and estimated
elasticities of substitution.
Table 3.1 contains the relevant information on the expenditures on

the two types of labor estimated from our establishment survey.

To estimate

expenditures on FTS labor, we multiplied FTS hours by the subminimum wage.

To estimate expenditures on non—FTS labor we multiplied non-FTS hours by the
area wage facing the establishment and reduced the amount by the ratio of
the average hourly earnings of retail trade nonsupervisory workers to the
average hourly earnings of manufacturing workers in 1977, as reported in

Employment and Earnins, March 1978 (the retail trade average was $3.83;
the manufacturing average was $5.63, giving a ratio of .68).

We report results for the entire period covered by our data and

for the latest full year for which we have data, 1978. We report results
for the entire sample and for users only.

We find that full—time student labor has a cost share of 4% to 10%
depending on the group and time covered.
Table 12 combines these figures with three alternate values of
a from Table 10 to test the impact of different elasticities on changes in
FTS and non—FTS hours:

(1) a low estimate of .5 using column 3, (2) a

medium estimate of 1.2 using column 4, and (3) a high estimate of 2.4

using column 6. In each case the values are obtained by
solving equation (5) for a, by dividing the coefficient on the cost of
alternative labor by the coefficient on the non—FTS hours variable.

Lines 1 and 4 record the elasticities of fixed output labor demand implied
by the estimates for FTS and non—FTS workers respectively, using equations

(10) and (11). Since the FTS share in costs is relatively modest, the
elasticity in line 1 far exceeds that in line 4. Lines 2 and 5 multiply
the relevant elasticities by the .15 reduction in wages to obtain estimates

of the change in in man hours worked by the two groups. According to
these calculations, the effect of the subminimum on employment of FTS—

type labor strongly depends on the estimated a. For the smallest value for
a in Table 12 (.5),

the effect of the 15% reduction in the minimum wage

on employment of FTS labor is 7%. Using the largest value for a (2.4)

this employment effect is 34%. Regardless of the assumed a, the decrease
in non—FTS employment is less than two percent.

Since FTS hours are a modest share of total hours, however, these
sometimes large differential percentage changes in employment

for the two

groups translate into more modest differences in actual hours of employ-

ment. According to the figures in line 3, hours worked per establishment
by FTS—type labor increased froin248 to1194 using the smallest and largest

estimates of a respectively. For non—FTS hours, the decrease ranges from
156 to 745 hours per establishment for the low and high values of a, re-

spectively. Using our middle estimate of a (1.2) we find an increase of
FTS hours of 597, partly offset by a decline in non—FTS hours of 374.

Full Demand Effect

To estimate the total impact of the youth subminimum on hours
worked, it is necessary to add in the scale effect and any substitution

between capital and the like. We focus here on estimates of the scale
effect. We obtained from Mary Corcoran of the Institute of Social Research an estimated elasticity of the demand for retail trade activities.

This elasticity was calculated by a survey of establishments that asked them

their perception of the elasticity. It suggests a moderate scale effect
of 1.0. If we take the FTS share of labor as 5% of labor cost, and use
national income statistics to estimate labor's share of national income
in retail trade, we obtain an estimate of the impact of the reduction

in the wage of students on cost. According to the national income statistics
(Survey of Current Business, July 1979) compensation of labor in retail
trade was $113 billion; national income in the sector was $185 billion,

giving a share of .61. Hence, our estimate of the scale effect is
.05(.15)(.6l) = .0046.

By the estimated elasticity of demand, the re-

sultant scale effect is .46%. A .46% increase in the average hours of
employment in an establishment (approximately 45,000 in our sample) would

translate into an employment scale effect of 200 hours. If this number

—39-.

is reasonable, the scale effect is potentially an important employment
effect equivalent in magnitude to the

estimates for the decrease in

non—FTS hours presented in Table 12.

Substitution of Whom for Whom
It would, for policy purposes, be interesting to know whether

the non—FTS people displaced are nonstudent teenagers or "adults". If it
turns out to be the former, one would be inclined to guess that a general
teen differential would have less effect than if there was substantial

FTS teen/adult substitution.
To get a handle on the substitution question, we re—interviewed

six major corporations who had participated in our initial survey. We
asked, "If the subminimum wage provision were not part of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, would the work that is now being done by the full—time
students:

(1) not be done at all?

(2) be done by other staff members without hiring any new people?
(3) or would have hired someone to do this work, and if so, from
what age group?"
The predominant answer was that students would have been hired
regardless of the provision, though one establishment said they would have

divided up the work among existing employees. Hence, for what it is worth,
we feel that much of the substitution may be between student labor and
other youth labor.

For policy purposes it would also be of value to learn about the

views of managers toward the FTS program. Accordingly, we obtained the
permission of some companies to contact individual establishments. We
asked each establishment for information on hours per week worked by both
regular employees and full—time students similar to the information asked

of the companies. We also asked for a count of full—time, part—time, and
full—time—student employees, for a qualitative measure of the establish—

—40—

ment's likely response to different changes in the law and the reasons for
under—utilization of the certificate by the establishment.

Because

this data comes from the establishment manager who is usually responsible
for the hiring decisions, it provides a valuable perspective on the operation
of the FTS program.

Table 13 presents some of the results from the establishment
questionnaire regarding reasons for under or nonutilization of the program
and responses to changes in the program.

All establishments which did not use the maximum allowed hours at

the subminimum (and only 14% reportedusing the maximum) were asked how

important each of ten possible reasonsfor underutilization were. These
responses are presented in panel A. The difficulty of substituting FTSs
for other workers is apparent in the two reasons cited most often as "very"

or "somewhat" important: "we need some nonstudents to work when FTSs cannot
(due to school commitments)" mentioned by 78% and "we need adult workers

for stability and continuity of our work force" mentioned by 72%. We also
see that this difference between FTSs and other workers is one of substitution, not a strict difference in the productivity of the two groups, as

only 26% cited "full—time students are unsatisfactory workers; we prefer

adult workers" as areason for underutilization.
That employment of FTS labor Is influenced in part by supply is
indicated by the fact that 46% of respondents said that "we cannot find

full—time students willing to work at a subminimum wage" was an important

reason for underutilization. "Our company policy is to pay all workers
at least the minimum wage" was also mentioned by 54%. State restrictions
on program use were cited by fewer than one—third of the respondents.

Unionism was not accorded an important role, suggesting that the union
impact operates largely on whether or not a company uses the program at
all.

The managers were also asked what was the most important reason

for their underutilization of the program. Relatively few responded to
this question, and those that did cited a wide variety of reasons, not

all appearing on this list. However, of the questions on this list, difficulty of finding students willing to work at the subminimum was mentioned
27 times and the need for adult workers for stability and continuity was

mentioned 22 times. No other reason on the list was mentioned more than
eight times. This points out the impact of a limited supply of workers at
the subminimum wage: it does not affect as many establishments as the problem
of substituting FTSs for other workers, but for those affected it is
important.

In addition to these questions on current program use, the managers
were asked whether each of six hypothetical changes in the program regulations

would lead to a "substantial", "limited", or "no" increase in

their use of the program. These responses are also presented in Panel B.
The two most often mentioned are "remove the limits on hours an FTS can work
in a given week", mentioned by 71% and "remove the restriction on percentage
of total hours allowed to be paid at the subminimum wage" mentioned by

72%. The latter restriction could be related to the month—by—month limits
on the percentage of subminimum hours allowed: even if the establishment
is not always at the maximum, it might be at certain times of the year.

By reducing these restrictions, managers perceive that their ability

to substitute FTSs for other workers would increase. Broadening the class
of eligible workers was somewhat less important: 62% cited "permit any
teenager, not just FTSs, to be paid the submininium wage". Removing the
state restrictions was mentioned by 59%, and removing the prohibition

on displacing adult workers by only 42%. Compatible with our finding that
the demand for FTS labor is affected by relative wages, 50 percent said
that reducing the FTS wage by 50 cents would increase their use of the
program.

—43-.

The managers were asked which of these changes would have the
greatest impact, providing another measure of the importance of the changes.
Removal of the limit of 20 hours per week worked at the subminimum is
cited as most important by 29%, while the overall establishment ceiling was

mentioned by only 13%. The reduction in FTS wages also affects some establishments' strongly, with 24% saying it was the most important change listed.
Allowing any teenager to be paid at the subminimum wage was most important
to 20%, while state restrictions and non—displacement of adult workers
were rarely considered most important.

We also asked the establishment managers a series of questions on
the incentives provided to them by the company to use the program. Their

responses were matched against those given by the company. We found
some disagreement between the company and establishment responses: in
cases where the establishment reported no rewards for good performance,

30 percent of the companies reported some rewards. This disagreement
between company and establishment perceptions is less pronounced for

pressures specifically directed at increasing program usage. In 19
percent of the cases for which the establishment reported no pressure

to use the program, some pressure was reported by the company. This
sort of misperception would lead our estimates of the impact of
company policies to be an underestimate of the impact of fully recog-

nized policy. The better performance of the more direct pressures may
in part be due to better communication of the specific policies by
companies to their establishments.

There is also disagreement between establishments and companies

on the difficulty of finding reliable workers at the minimum wage. Only 5%
of managers, but 55% of companies, said it was "easy" (though 36% of mangers

said it was "not too difficult"). Only 3% of the companies, but 18% of
the managers said it was "very difficult". These differences are in part
due to the 40% of the companies that answered "it varies (between establish—

—44 *

ments)",

but companies in general seem to have an exaggerated idea of the

ease of finding reliable workers at the minimum wage. This provides some
support for our hypothesis that, at least in some areas, non—FTS workers are
relatively difficult to find at the minimum wage, which would increase the
attractiveness of hiring FTS workers at the subminimum.
Finally, we asked the managers "did participation in the FTS Program
influence your establishment to expand total employment by more than might

otherwise have occured?" If it had, they were asked to indicate the number
of additional workers hired. Thirty percent answered that employment
had increased. For these establishments, on average, five or six
additional workers were hired as a result of the program, according

to establishment managers. This compares to an average total employment
of just over 24 employees per establishment in the sample. This again
indicates that the reduction in the wage for this group of workers has
had an effect on FTS employment.

These results from the establishment questionnaires support our
previous conclusions that students (or at least full—time students under

the current program) are imperfect substitutes for regular workers. This
is partly due to their student status, which carries higher turnover rates

and less flexible work schedules. It is also due to program restrictions
on both individual and aggregated subminimum hours. There may be paperwork
costs associated with the program, but since all these establishments are
already involved in the program we have no means to test for the importance

of these costs. Naturally, we would assume that the existence of such
costs would make students even more difficult to substitute for regular
workers, so that larger changes in relative wages would be needed to induce
the firms to expand student employment.

—45—

Biases and Problems With the Analysis
Our analysis is subject to several problems which should be

brought forth. First, our sample dealt solely with firms who were in
the lO-I-% category, who are FTS intensive. We suspect (although it

does not follow inevitably) that these firms also find it easier to substitute FTSs for other workers —— one reason that other firms are not in this
category would be that they find such substitution more difficult than the

firms in our sample. Second, to the extent that some establishments are
at their certification ceiling, then the number of FTSs they are hiring is
less than the cost—minimizing number, and the estimated "elasticity of

substitution" is not as large as the "true" elasticity. With our data,
we are unable to gauge the relative importance of these biases.

Implications for a General Youth Sulrninimum

Our

findings

suggest a responsiveness of employment to the FTS

program to relative wages. What then can

be

said about a general youth

subminimurn?

Several features of the FTS program suggest that generalizations

are difficult. On the one hand, the FTS program is limited to certain
sectors of the economy where a priori, one might expect greater ease of
substitution between youth and other workers —-

the

retail/service

sector is one with relatively many unskilled workers. We also selected
significantly large users of FTS labor, for which our estimates of substi-

tution might be expected to be especially high. On the other hand,
as noted, one of the major deterrents to substitution is the difficulty of
accomodating the peculiar time schedules of students and the time constraints

of the program. Nonstudent youth might be easier to substitute for older

—46—

workers. Indeed, many managers mentioned that allowing them to hire any
teenager, not just a student, at the subminimum would induce a substantial

change in program use. This suggests that there would be a greater response
by employers to a youth subminimuin than our data suggest. However,
noristudent youth may not be as willing to work at the suhninimwn as
students.

Finally, the ability to draw generalizations about a general
youth suhiinimum directly from the results presented here is limited
by the sensitivity of the effect of area wages on FTS employment to
the various specifications, particularly in the absence of any satisfactory explanation for the effect of region controls on certain
wage coefficients.

Appendix A: Development of the Data Set
Our study was obligated to create its own data base in order to

analyze the student subminimum. The design by which we collected data
was motivated by and ultimately determined our research analysis. As
noted in Section III, we obtained data from three basic soirces:
—

administrative

—

our own telephone survey of over 200 such employers

—

published

records on employers certified to hire FTSs

data on area labor market conditions.

This appendix provides a detailed description of the process by
which we collected data and the resultant data set.

Administrative Record Data
Our primary source of information on use of the program was the
Department of Labor's file of employer applications for certification

under the program. Every year each establishment in the program must submit a renewal application ,including the number of hours paid to all employees
in the previous year, and the number of hours paid at the subminimum wage.
One copy of the application is kept by the Regional Office (which handles

the day—to—day administration of the program) and one copy is forwarded
to the National Office in Washington, D.C. to be placed in the national

file. (See Table A—i for a copy of this form).
This data is aggregated into a quarterly report on program usage
by each Regional Office, from which the National Office prepares quarterly

and annual totals for the nation as a whole. These reports represented
the only previously existing information on program use, and are in too

aggregate a form for detailed analysis. Nonetheless, we used this data

—48--

for preliminary investigation of how usage has changed over time, and also
to give us some idea of the scope of program usage.
From the first it was clear that we would have to use the appli-

cation files to develop a sample of program users. An early decision was

whether to use the files at the Regional or National level. The Regional
files maintain separate folders for each establishment, regardless of the
certificate class (6 or fewer, 10 percent, or over 10 percent) containing

all past applications for that establishment. However, using Regional
files would require visits to several cities to develop a comprehensive
national data base. The National files contain all past applications for
the entire country, but separate folders are only n1aintained for establish-

ments in the over 10% class. These folders are arranged in order by parent
company, which aids in analyzing differences between companies. Because
of the difficulty involved in visits to different Regional offices, we
decided to use the National files and restrict our sample to users in the

over 10% class. We considered only retail and service establishments, since
agricultural establishments represent little of overall usage and institutions of higher education have special motivations for hiring their own

stu-

dents.

Even this restriction of the sample was not quite enough to provide

a data set of manageable size, so we further restricted the sample to those
establishments in companies that had ten or more establishments enrolled in

the program. One

reason

for choosing this restriction was to simplify col—

lection of data from the parent companies. A further reason was that an
earlier study done in 1969 by the Department of Labor suggested that nearly
all of the aggregate hours worked under the program were accounted for by

—49—

the largest 10 or 20 multi—establishment companies (most of which are now

in the over 10% class). We finally obtained a sample of 7,874 establishments in the over 10% class, belonging to fewer than 200 parent companies.

From the files in Washington, D.C., we collected a history of each
establishment's use of the program: total and FTS hours from each year's

renewal form (up to 12). We also obtained a few minor pieces of information, including sales volume (one of three categories), zip code for identifying geographic location so that we could later add data on local labor
market conditions, the addresses of the establishment and parent company,
and the name and telephone number of the person responsible for the appli-

cation (typically the personnel manager of the parent company). It was this
information which enabled us to proceed with further data collection.
Of our sample of 7874 establishments that were in the program in

1974, 2915 were no longer in the program by 1979. The establishments
are included in our analysis f or every year in which we have data, but no

correction is made for their dropping out.

Our Telephone Sury
From the information on application forms we obtained, as noted

earlier, the name and address of persons responsible for the program. To
obtain additional information about companies using the program we decided
to conduct a telephone survey of the responsible officials.

Before contacting any of the companies or establishments from our
sample, we used the application file in the Boston Regional Office to
identify several users of the

program in the local area. This set of com-

panies and establishments was used to test several preliminary versions of

the questionnaire before national use. We also received many helpful
suggestions from the users on alternative questions to ask. Finally, this
procedure gave us some early indication of what answers to expect from the
larger sample.

During the second stage of data collection on the national level, each ccm—

pany was contacted about the study by telephone. They were asked a series of questions designed to provide us with information about the company's use of the program, focusing especially on the average hours per week and weeks per year worked

by regular and full—time student workers and the reasons for differences in use

across establishments. The earlier questions were intended to let us
estimate the number of students actually employed under the program. We
attempted to collect a history of program usage from the companies, including number of students hired as well as number of hours worked, but this

proved too time consuming for the companies to complete. Of the initial
7,874 establishments, 5,557 were in companies from which we collected data.
The remaining companies were either uncooperative or impossible to trace.

Data on Labor Market Conditions

Some data on local labor market conditions were added to the data
set. The SMSA and state were identified using the zip code of the establish-.

ment. Then the area unemployment and manufacturing wage rates for 1971 to
1978 were added to each establishment's record. If the establishment was
not in an SMSA, the value for the balance of the state outside of SMSAs was

used. This data was available for nearly all of the establishments in the
data set. The area unemployment rates were obtained from the Employment
and Training Report of the President, 1973—78. The manufacturing area
wage rates were obtained from Employment and Earnings, May 1972—79.

Note that because only manufacturing wages are available on a detailed local labor market basis, we have used these wages rather than the

potentially more appropriate retail trade wages. To check on the possible
problem due to use of manufacturing wages on our measure of local market

conditions, we used data from the 1970 Census of Population state books,
to see how the two measures vary together on a geographic basis. We took
a weighted average of the annual median earnings of men and women year—round,
full—time workers in the two sectors, using as weights the fraction who were

male or female, and regressed the log of the manufacturing wage, so
calculated, on the log of the retail trade wage. The results show the two
wages move together to a significant extent: the simple correlation between
the two series across

the states is .87. The regression coefficient of

in manufacturing wages on ln retail trade wages is 1.11 with a standard

error of .10. This suggests that the area wage we used overstates the wages
paid by retail trade establishments policy by a roughly constant proportion.

Because of the close link between the two series, results based on the

—54..-

more appropriate but unavailable retail trade series are likely to

yield results much like those we obtained. If we regard the manufacturing
wage as a proxy with error for the retail trade wage, our regressions are
likely to understate the true responsiveness to wages by the usual measure-

ment error arguments. However, it is likely that the difference between the
manufacturing and retail trade wages reflect labor market conditions that

are correlated with our other variables. Hence we do not apply the measurement error argument to our estimates. If we did, we would strengthen
our findings of sizeable response to wages.
Additional labor market conditions for 113 SMSAs were collected

from 1970 Census of Population publications. As an alternative measure
for area wages, the mean annual earnings of prime age (30 to 34 year old) workers

was added to the data set. Also added were the mean annual earnings
for 16 to 19 year olds who report earnings, the size of the 16 to 19
year old student population, and overall SMSA population.

These vari-

ables were added using the establishment zip code; however, since
balance-of-state values for observations not in SMSAs were not available from these sources, these data are used in the analyses for the
sample of establishments in SMSAs, and for the full sample of establishments using dummy variables to indicate the establishments not in SMSAS
for which there are missing values.

Establishment Data
Finally, we contacted the individual establishments.

We asked each

establishment for information on hours per week worked by both regular employ-

ees and full—time students similar to the information asked of the companies.
We also asked for a count of full—time, part—time, and full—time—student em-

ployees, for a qualitative measure of the establishment's likely response to

—55—

different changes in the law and the reasons for under—utilization of the

certificate by the establishment. The questionnaire is available on request.
In order to obtain the best possible response rate from establishments, we sent copies of the establishment questionnaire to the parent com-

panies for their approval. After they approved it, they sent us a written
approval for distribution with the questionnaire, or sent a memoranda to
their establishments directing them to complete the questionnaire and re-

turn the completed forms to us. We obtained information on 316 establishments. Of these, 225 have been matched with the administrative data (some
of the remainder are new establishments or ones not enrolled in the program).

Because of the small sample of establishments, most of our analysis has been
done using administrative and company data, with the establishment data used
primarily for checking consistency with the company data.

The final result of the data collection is a data set containing
over 20,000 establishment years from 1971 to 1979 with information on

program usage (both houts worked and estimated number of students hired),
local labor market conditions, and some data on the parent company.

The minimum wage has changed frequently in the last 20 years:

to $1.15 (on 9/61), $1.25 (on 9/63), $1.40 (on 2/67), $1.60 (on 2/68),
$2.00 (on 5/74), $2.10 (on 1/75), $2.30 (on 1/76), $2.65 (on 1/78),

$2.90 (on 1/79), $3.10 (on 1/80), and $3.35 (on 1/81). The FTS subminimum
has always been exactly 85% of the minimum wage.

Thus it went from $.98

per hour in 1961 to $2.85 in 1981.

5/

A small number (7) of companies in our survey did report paying

above the 85% of the minimum but below the minimum, see p. 18.
6/

Indeed, our establishment survey results in Table 13 show that

21% of respondents said that an important reason for under—utilizing the
program was that they could not find students willing to work at the sub—

minimum. Another 33% said this was somewhat important.

That leaves, however,

roughly half (46%) of employers who did not feel so constrained.

The assumption that supply elasticities are the same for C and W

is made purely for convenience.
8/

We obtained similar results In calculations in which we excluded

observations in which data was missing. For the analysis which Includes
observations with missing local labor market information, we used dummy
variables to indicate whether the information was missing and replaced
the missing value with the mean value from those observations for which
the value was present.
9/

The reason why more student labor is not used under all circum-

stances could be that the students' unavailability during school hours
and during other school activities makes scheduling workers more difficult,
while the students' higher turnover might make them less desirable or at
least require some nonstudents to provide stability to the work place.

While a few students might be hired under any circumstances, there might
be a substantial wage differential before the establishment is willing to

greatly increase its use of students. This result does not imply that
students are poorer workers in general (such an assumption was not sup-

ported by our company interviews), but have a less than infinite elasticity
of substitution with other workers.
10/

A regrdssion was done 'onthe SMSA subsample of log prime age earnings

on log area wage as well as the other independent variables used in the

Table 7 regression. The coefficients from that regression were used to
generate a predicted log prime age earnings value for the entire sample,
which was then used in columns 5 and 6 of Table 7 as a substitute for the
log area wage.
