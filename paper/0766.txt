Exchange

Rate Determination and the Demand for Money

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the conventional monetary equation of exchange

rate determination.

Under certain exogeneity conditions, one can write

the price level, at home and abroad, as the ratio of the nominal money

supply to the demand for real money balances. Then, since the exchange
rate is the domestic price of foreign exchange, one can equate the exchange

rate to the ratio of domestic to foreign prices. This then allows one
to write, and estimate, the exchange rate as a function of the money supply

differential, income differential and interest rate differential. If
the domestic and foreign money demand errors are autocorrelated, and if
deviations from purchasing power parity are autocorrelated, tests based

on the above model may be invalid. Only if all autoregressive parameters
are equal will test results be valid. A full information maximum likelihood
procedure is used to estimate and test the assumptions necessary for the

conventional procedure to be correct. Finally, two alternative models of
exchange rate determination are considered to illustrate the importance
of introducing the error terms at the beginning of the analysis.

Conventional models of the monetary approach to exchange rate deter—
mination assume a demand for money function for each country, with the same

parameters, and that purchasing power parity holds.' These two assumptions,
along with a semi—log functional form for money demand, allows one to write
the exchange rate as a function of the money supply differential, income differential and interest rate differential, with an error term added at the end:

In particular, we derive equations (la) and (lb) from a general model that
begins with specifying a conventional domestic and foreign money demand function
and allowing for deviations from purchasing power parity to be autoregressive.

We see, therefore, that for the general model (equations (2) and (3)),te
implied exchange rate equation (equation (5)) is quite complex. Equation (5)
*
includes a lagged dependent variable, second order lags of p, Pt and the
exogenous variables, nonlinear restrictions and a moving average error term.

would yield inconsistent para-

A special case of this model, often assumed by researchers, is when
the parameters of the money demand function in both countries are equal:
p = p

There are several situations in which equation (9) will hold. Table I lists
the four assumptions on

when deviations from ?YP are random (0=0). Then, if we set y=p (where p is
the autoregressive parameter in the money demand function) and set

linear combination of the money demand errpr variances, a (where e =

is a special case of the first) is when pm' holds as an identity (0=0 and
=

cep

0).

Then, if we set y=p and a equal to a different linear combination

of variances and covariances, equation (9) will hold. The third case is when

the deviations from ppp are AR(l) (0#0). Then, if we set yp=0 (where 0 is
the autoregressive parameter in the Ppp equation), and a2 equal to a still

different linear combination of the underlying stochastic specification,

equation (9) will hold. A fourth case is when the money demand functions are

not autoregressive (p0). Then, if we set y=O and

equal to the expression in

Table 1, equation (9) will hold. Therefore, if the deviations from PPP are not
random (see Frenkel (1981)) and we are willing to assume a priori that all autoregressive coefficients are equal (p=p*=9) and money demand parameters are
*

equal (=8 ), then

estimating the standard equation ((la) and (lc)) is appropriate.

However, to test these assumption one must consider a simultaneous estimation

procedure. Estimating equation (5) by nonlinear least squares, assuming w is
white noise, and testing S=B* and p=p* is incorrect, since

Equation system (10) was estimated using quarterly data, from 1973—3 to

1979—4. Four currencies, relative to the dollar were used — the U.K. pound,
the German mark, the Swedish kronor and the Canadian dollar (see Data Appendix

for more details). The period was chosen due to a possible structural change
in the international monetary system in the first quarter of 1973, arising from
the collapse of the EEC agreement to stabilize the dollar value of their cur-

rencies. The system was estimated using the FIML procedure in Version 3.3 of

TSP. The results are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Table 6 summarizes the
results of testing (l) through

and Table 7 presents an estimate of the

correlation natrix of the residuals.

Several results can be seen in Tables 2 to 6. For the U.K., the income
elasticity of the demand for dollars was significantly negative for Model 1,
but significantly positive for Models 2 to 5.

In addition the domestic auto-

regressive parameter, p, was negative (equal to —.138) for Model 1, but positive

for Models 2 to 5. A problem arose in estimating the model with Germany. The
log likelihood value for the restricted Model 2 was greater than the log likelihood

value for the unrestricted Model 1. For Canada, the income elasticity of the
demand for U.S. dollars was negative. The autoregressive parameter in the PPP
equation, for Canada and Sweden, 0, was (insignificantly) greater than 1.0, which
indicates nonstationarity.5 (Consequently the test results should be viewed with
caution.)

Table 7 presents estimates of the correlation matrix of residuals for Model
1, derived from

in equation (lOd). We notice that for Germany, Canada and

Sweden the correlation between domestic and foreign money demand residuals is quite
large —

.859, .708, .903, respectively. In general, the correlation between PPP

residuals and money demand residuals is small and negative.

As is evident from the previous sections, the final version (reduced fm:n)
of the exchange rate equation depends on certain assumptions about money demand

parameters and properties of error terms. In fact, the assumption that the
parameters of the domestic and foreign money demand is not made simply for
expository purposes —

it

is made so that one can obtain consistent estimates

of the model. In addition, the hypothesis is not always accepted.

III. Alternative Exchange Rate Models
This paper has argued that it is essential to specify the error processes
at the initial stage of writing the money demand functions, and then deducing

the error process of the exchange rate equation. Two other models of exchange
rates can also be considered. In the first alternative model, Bilson (1978,
pp. 89—90) begins by assuming a partial adjustment model and autoregressive

It is straightforward to verify that we can write the exchange rate equation

It is clear thatw is an MA(i)

process. First, we notice that estimating

equation (13a) by OLS would yield inconsistent estimates due to the presence of

a lagged dependent variable and an MA(l) error term (w is correlated with
0, then the error term

If we assumed that PPP held identically, so that

in (13b) could be written as w =

In

this case, OLS estimation of

equation (13a) would yield consistent estimates. However, Bilson (1978)
estimates the following equation, by CORC:

CORC applied to equation (l4a) is inconsistent, since

will, in general,

be correlated with (m_m), if (nt_m*) is autoregressive. In addition, applying the CORe procedure to an equation with a lagged dependent variable may be
misleading since there nay be more than one estimate of p.6

In this case, only p, the autoregressive parameter, is significant.
Another alternative exchange rate model begins by assuming a partial
adjustment to the long run exchange rate s (see Frenkel (1978) ,

p.

In

this model we assume that the domestic and foreign money demand functions are

given by equations (ba) and (lob). To obtain the PPP equation, we assume

We see that the long run elasticity, b, is close to one, but imprecisely estimated.

The short run elasticity, b, is equal to .534. The income elasticity and interest
semi—elasticity are of the "right" sign, but imprecisely estimated.

IV. Summy

In

this paper we have reexamined the estimation of monetary exchange rate

equations. Beginning with conventional money demand functions and assuming

—21—

deviations from purchasing power parity are serially correlated (AR(l)), we

derived a reduced form exchange rate equation. Without further assumptions,
OLS (or nonlinear least squares) estimation is inconsistent. To derive the
conventional exchange rate equation, the most plausible set of assumptions
are that the parameters of domestic and foreign money demand functions are

the same. In this case estimation of the conventional equation will yield
consistent estimates, however the standard errors are incorrect. To obtain
correct standard errors from the conventional equation, one must assume, in
addition, that the autoregressive parameters in the money demand equations

and the PPP equation are equal. Only for Germany does this hypothesis appear
warranted, for the U.K., Sweden and Canada, the hypothesis is rejected.

Next, we looked at two different models of exchange rates. In one model,
we assume partial adjustment in the money demand function. In the other model,

we assume partial adjustment in the PPP equation. Two different exchange rate
equations were then derived and estimated. However, the estimates in both
alternative models were imprecise.

See, for example, Bilson (1978) or Dornbusch (1980).

2.

Frenkel (1981, pp. 698—699) finds that the deviations from PPP appear to
follow an AR(l) Process (p about .90) for the Pound, Franc and DM for the
period June 1973 to July 1979.

3.

It is true that OLS estimation of (72) will yield consistent estimates of
(under the assumption that x is exogenous). However, the standard
errors will be biased.

4.

Initial values for Model 1 were taken from OLS estimates of (lOa) and a

regression of (s —

on t—l Pt_i +

Pj)

Initial estimates

for models 2 to 5 were taken from the. final estimates from Models 1 to 4,
respectively.
5.

However, when the model was reestimated, using different initial values,
p was less than 1.0. The results were approximately the same.

6.

Betancourt and Kelyian (1981) show that there may be several estimates of
p when estimating a model with a lagged dependent variable and AR(1) error
by CORC (due to multiple roots). However, Dufour and Gaudy (1981) point
out that this will occur with probability zero. However, from a practical
point of view, one must worry about multiple roots since they do appear in
practice (Betancourt and Kelyian (1981), pp. 1076—77).
