Prices and Terms of Trade for Developed—
Country Exports of Manufactured Goods

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to contribute some new measurements
to the discussion of trends in the terms of trade between manufactured
goods exports of developed countries and primary product exports of

developing countries. The new measures are manufactured goods price
indexes that are derived from price data rather than from unit value
data and include some corrections for quality change.
Our calculations indicate that the prices of manufactured goods
exported by developed countries to developing countries have risen over
twenty years or so by 75 per cent, as compared to the l4) per cent shom

by tne generally used UN unit value indexes. The decline in terms of
trade for these goods relative to primary products has been almost
50 per cent over this period.
Over

the

manufactured
as

last

hundred years, fluctuations in the

terms of trade of

goods relative to primary products have been

very wide,

far as we can tell from the inadequate measures we have. Impressions

about trends have been highly dependent on choices of beginning and end

years. There is very little evidence for a long—run trend in either
direction.

Irving II. kravis
Robert L. Lipsey
The subject of terms of trade between i:ianufactured goods and primary

prouucts has a long history, and opinions

on the

direction of trends in

them nave gone through several cycles. Recently, until the last few years,
the majority opinion, especially in ueveloping countries and iii

agencies

representing their views, has been that manufactured goods have generally

risen in price over a century or so. This was true despite the fact that
such a rise would have violently contradicted one of the most firmly held

and basic beliefs of classical economics. That was that as a consequence
of diminishing returns——of rising population pressing against a constant

supply of resources, especially land——there must be in the long run a rise
in primary goods prices, especially agricultural prices, relative to prices

of manufactured goods. For example:
The tendency, then, being to a perpetual increase in the

productive power of labour in manufactures, while In agriculture
and mining there is a conflict between two tendencies, the one
towards an increase of productive power, the other towards a

diminution of it, the cost of p:oduction being lessened by every
improvement in the processes, and augmented by every addition to
population; it follows that the exchange value of manufactured
articles, compared with the products of agriculture and of mines,

have, as population and industry advance, a certain and decided

tendency to fall." (Miii, 1848, Book IV, Ch. II.)

—2
Tue classical view was tile dominant one, particularly in Great Iritain.
It was emphasized in times of rising raw materials prices, as in Jevoris

(1866), Keynes (1912), and Robertson (1915), and subsided when prices

declined, as in the late 19th century and after World War 1.1
The opposite picture as to the facts of the case was drawn a
century later by Folke Hilgerdt, in Industrialization and Foreign Trade,

which concluded that in the 60 years before 1938, primary product prices
had fallen relative to prices of manufactures and that "the general
trend of the relative movements. .. .of the prices of these two classes

of goods can scarcely be doubted."

What is particularly astonishing about this conclusion is that
after over a century of confident theorizing that exactly the oDnosite
trend was inevitable and a historical fact, Hilgerdt offered this

conclusion without any reference to the contradiction of classical
doctrine.

The theme of relatively declining primary goods prices was then
taken up in a long series of documents, many published by the United

Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and written by, or under
the direction of Raul Prebisch, director of ECLA and later of UNCTAD.

Among them were Relative Prices of Exrorts and Imnorts ofnderdevç
Countries (1949) and The_Economic Development of Latin America and Its

Principal

Problems (1950) and. an article by Hans Singer on "The Distribu-

tion of Gains between Investing and Borrowing Countries," American Economic
Review, May 1950. This doctrine, and the explanations given for it,

became known as the Singer—Prebisch thesis, despite its origins with
I-iilgerdt who really never developed the theme or gave it the importance

that was later attributed to it.

A few dissenters, such as Haberler and Viner, were never convinced
by Flilgerdt's data or the UN line in general, although they had no

counter—evidence to offer. Several pointed to the likelihood that price
indexes for manufactured goods, and therefore for exports of industrial
countries, suffered from upward bias due to the neglect of quality change

and the underrepresentation of new commodities. Export prices for automobiles, for example, might not take into account gains in horsepower,
the shift to power brakes and steering, anti—pollution devices, etc.
If this were the case, the improvement in terms of trade would be exaggerated since the export price indexes for LDCTs, or for primary products,
were not subject to the same biases.
The issue has continued to be argued back and forth in the journals
and in several books, and with interest recently renewed in connection
with proposals for commodity price indexation, and some progress has

resulted from the reworking of the historical data.2 However, almost

fl these studies have relied on similar basic data: unit value indexes
tor prices of manufactured and primary products exports. The defects of
these data, especially with respect to manufactured goods, are well

known,3 and most authors tip their hats to them and then proceed to use

the data anyway for lack of good alternatives, however, over the last
few decades, some improved data for prices have become available.
Our purpose in this paper is to make a contribution to the progress

of this discussion in several ways. First we discuss briefly some issues
relating to methods of calculating price movements for groups of countries.
Then we present some price indexes for manufactured products exported by
developed countries for the period since 1953 that do not depend at all

on the use of unit values from trade statistics. We examine the diver—
gence of the more commonly used unit value indexes from these price indexes,

with respect to the implications for recent trends in the
terms of trade. We offer some assessment of the impact of quality changes

particularly

on price measures for manufactures and relate these to terms of trade
movements.

Finally, for the

sake of providing a rough perspective on

term changes we reluctantly resort to unit value indexes

for the

three quarters of a century prior to the early 1950's when our own price
series begin.
Price Indexes for

Deve1ped Country

Exports of Manufactures

There

are several basic ingredients for our indexes, which we summa—

rie iere and cescribe

more fully in the appendix. The

first are our

own international price indexes for metals, metal products, machinery,
and transport equipment, for the United States, the United Kingdom,
Germany, and Japan, covering 1953—1964.

The second are the export

indexes developed over the last twenty years or more, mainly by

and Lipsey (1971).

the U.S., Germany, and Japan, the latter two comprehensive, the first
starting with the same coverage as our indexes and gradually increasing

coverage over time. The third element of our indexes is more fragmentary
export price data published by the U.K., Sweden, and the Netherlands,

the last gradually increasing in scope over the years. The fourth type
of data is producer price indexes and/or wholesale price indexes for
all

the countries included here. The fifth type is hedonic price indexes

for

a few types of machinery and transport equipment. These are used in

two ways. The first is to fill in prices for some commodities for hich no
official published indexes exist. The second is as a substitute for
conventional price series in a very rough attempt at adjustment for
quality change where we consider it appropriate and important.

These various sources of data of course overlap extensively, and
it is necessary for us to assign price series to the index by a system
of priorities, determined by our views as to the appropriateness of each

type of data as measures of export prices. The highest priority is
given to our own series, with interpolations based on the
other types of data as explained for the case of Germany in Kravis and

Lipsey (1972). The second priority is to official export price series,
the third to producer or wholesale prices, and the fourth to the

hedonic price indexes. Although we
more

not

consider

the hedonic price series

appropriate for our purposes than the conventional series we have

given them priority because we wished to produce an index from

something close to conventional data. However, we have also calculated
an alternative index in which hedonic price series are given priority,
and we consider that to be the best estimate we can make of the movement
of prices of manufactured goods.

—6—

Designing

a World or Regional Price Index

Aside from the selection of basic price data, the most important
choice is that of a weighting system, a topic on which we have experimented

a little and plan to study further. The decision on a weighting system
is apart from that on base years, for which we use 1963 here, although
we intend to experiment also with a 1975 base.
The principal version of a manufactures price index used here,
which we will refer to as Type A, weights the export price series by

the

1963 values of exports by all developed countries to all developing coun-

tries. This is done for each country's prices at the four—digit SITC
level, to produce country indexes with common weights, and then the
country indexes are combined using the values of each country's exports of
all manufactured products to LDC's to form a general DC export price index.

One difficulty with this scheme is that it requires sufficient coverage

of all manufactures to permit the calculation of an overall index. If a
country's price data are too skimpy for that, they do not appear in the
total index even though they may be sufficient for some groups and even
though the country may be an important exporter in some groups.
A second manufactures price index, shown in the Appendix, which we

refer to as Type B, weights each export price series by the 1963 value

of that country's exports of that product to developing countries. The
country aggregate price index is, as in the Type A price index, weighted by
each country's exports of all manufactures to developing countries.

Although these are the only indexes of manufactures export prices

presented here, we plan to calculate several others. In general, they

for

the use of each country's own weights to form the index numbers
segments of manufactures (e.g., one—digit or two—digit SITC categories)

and

the weighting across countries at levels below the total of all manu-

involve

factures.

The maximum use of the available price data would be made by weighting
each price observation by the value of exports of that commodity by that
country to developing countries (Type E).

The importance of these choices arises from the fact that each involves
not .'iy weighting but also different assumptions about the nature of the
commodities priced at the most detailed level and about price relationships.

The reason is that each involves different ways of filling in missing price

observations. The justification for starting with the calculation of country
indexes is the assumption that missing prices tend to behave in a similar

manner to the average of other prices in the same country for commodities

in the same 3—digit, 2—digit, or 1—digit commodity classes. These methods

--8—

therefore ignore the behavior of other countries' prices for the same
commodity, a difficult assumption to accept for anyone who believes the
law of one price has any validity at all. In contrast, trie methods that
start with the calculation of indexes for all countries at the 4—digit
SITC level come closer to acceptance of the law of one price, since they

assume that one country's price for a commodity tends to move with the

average of other countries' prices for the same commodity. However, they
therefore assume that there is no country—specific effect on a price change.
Thus a currency revaluation has no effect on the export price of the

revaluing country in comparison to that of others, a proposition we have
found to be frequently contradicted in our studies of international price
behavior.

Since neither of these two extreme assumptions seems really acceptable

we plan eventually to drop them both by using a method that incorporates

both country and commodity effects in estimating each missing price. The
method is a variant of one developed by Summers (1973) for the estimation

of inter-country price level comparisons. It involves fitting an equation
to each block of country and commodity price observations, the block being

defined by the full list of commodities and countries or by the countries
and some level of commodities, such as all those in a two—digit SITC class.

The equation contains dummy variables for both country and commodity and
therefore permits the data to determine the degrees to which the two
characteristics influence the estimated price.

Notes to TABLE 1
NBER Price Index
This is a six—country composite, aggregation within countries by
OECD export weights and between countries by value of exports of manu—
factures to developing countries.
The calculation of the index is described as Type A in the text.
The six countries covered are the United States, the United Kingdom,
Germany, Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands. The last two are missing
from the indexes for the years before 1956, because data were completely
lacking or too thin and the Netherlands indexes do not begin until
1962. The indexes for 1975—77 are based on less complete data than those
for earlier years.

exporting countries are included because they are the only ones for

which we have sufficient coverage to produce indexes for total manufac-

turing. The aggregate index was quite stable over most of the period,
with only two changes of more than 3 per cent before 1970 and an average
change of only about one—half of one per cent per year between 1957 and

1967. In the 1970's, however, the increases became much larger, averaging almost 10 per cent per year. After rising only from 92 to 108
between 1953 and 1969, the index then jumped to over 200 by 1977.

We

also

calculated a Type B price index for the same six countries.

In this index the country indexes were aggregated with weights based on
each country's exports to developing countries in 1963 rather than those
of all countries combined, but the country indexes were combined in the

same way as for the Type A index. To the extent that the 1963 weights
reflected the previous ten years' price history, and elasticities of
substitution were greater than one, we might expect that this index would
have fallen relative to the Type A index, because a country would have a
heavier weight (larger exports) for a product in which its prices had

fallen relative to the other countries. However, the two indexes stayed
very close together between 1953 and 1963 and changed by identical amounts

over that period as a whole. After that the Type B index tended to rise
relative to the Type A index, with the changes, never more than about a

half a percentage point different in any one year, cumulating to an

increase 5 per cent greater by 1977. In other words, higher than average
country export weights in 1963 were correlated with larger than average
price increases after that.

- ha
We

-

compare our Type A price index in Table 1 with two versions of the

UN unit value index, the most frequently used currently available indicator

of export price movements for manufactured goods. One of the UN series is
the published export unit value index for total manufactured goods exports

of developed market economies (Column 2). The second UN index (Column 3)
is one we calculated from UN data for the unit values of exports by
developed countries to developing countries for SITC 5, 7, and 6 plus 8,

which we combined using 1963 export weights. The second UN index is a little
closer in coverage to our own index, in the sense that ours is weighted by
the values of exports by developed countries to developing countries although
the prices we use are not specific to trade with developing countries.
Despite these adjustments, it is virtually impossible to be sure what

accounts for the differences between the UN indexes and ours. Not only
are the UN indexes based on unit value data rather than price data, but the
coverage of countries is somewhat wider, the index number formula is differ-

ent, and the weighting is different. The wider coverage of the UN indexes
is not a likely explanation for the divergences between our index and
theirs because the additional countries are minor exporters of manufactured

goods. The effects of the differences in weighting and index number
formulas are more difficult to guess at without a close analysis, but the

— 12

--

fact that ours is a Laspeyres index on a 1963 base is likely to make it rise

more, rather than less, rapidly than the UN indexes in the later period of
rising prices. 6
Whatever the reasons for the differences, we find that both UN indexes,
after being quite close to the NBER series through the mid—1960's, rose
considerably more during the following period of rapid price change.

Furthermore the restriction of the UN series to exports to developing
countries and the weighting at the 1—digit level by 1963 exports to match
that of the NBER series (Col. 3) moved the UN series further away from,

rather than closer to, the NBER index. For example, over the period from
1967 to 1977, at the beginning of which all three series were very close,
the NBER series rose by 98 per cent, the total UN series by 118 per cent,

and the UN series on exports to LDC's by 129 per cent. In the last five
years the NBER index rose by 61 per cent, the full UN series by 74 per

cent, and the UN index for exports to LDC's by 86 per cent. Thus we find
indications that the unit value indexes exaggerate the increase in manufactured goods prices and that the exaggeration is largest during periods

of rapid price change. We suspect, although we cannot prove it, that the
differences are due to the use of unit values rather than to differences
in index number formulas or weighting.7

6

This is not necessarily the case, however. For sor.ie discussion and
examples see Hansen and Lucas (1981) and Lipsey (1963).
7

An odd feature of the unit value series we constructed from UN
series for exports by developed countries to developing countries is the
sharp decline, by about 7 per cent, in 1968. The NBER index shows a
slight decline that year and the overall UN index none at all. The most

13

In an earlier study (Kravis and Lipsey, 1971) we compared our
indexes for machinery and transport equipment from 1953 to 1964 with
the corresponding export unit value indexes published by the United

Nations. We concluded there that at least in these products, the unit
value indexes were biased upwards to a substantial degree. That rela—
tionship persists in the indexes used here, but it is offset in the
aggregate by a much larger decline in the unit value index than in the
price index for chemicals, especially between 1957 and 1961.
The Treatment of Missing Prices
Each type of index involves some assumptions about missing price change

observations. The Type A index used here assumes that a missing price change,
in a country for which we have other price data, resembles the changes in
prices

of other commodities in the same commodity group in that country. We

make no use, in this index, of information about prices of the same commodity

in other countries. For countries other than the six included in the
Type A index, however, we
resemble

likely reason for the fall is the devaluation of the L in late 1967 which
showed up in annual price indexes in 1968. That devaluation affects all
the indexes, of course, but the coverage of the indexes for exports by
destination may be lower than that of the aggregate index and the British
prices may therefore have a much heavier weight in these indexes. We
have no direct evidence for this explanation but it appears to be the most
likely one.

— 14 —

One test of the various possible assumptions is to compare, for the

prices that are available, the variance across countries with the variance

within countries. We made such a comparison using price changes at
the 4—digit SITC level for the U.S., Germany, and Jarian, calculating

variances among 4—digit subgroups within 1—digit classes

country

in each

and variances among 1—digit classes across countries. At this

level, at least, we

found the

within—class variances in a country to be

smaller than toe variances among countries for the class. Thus if
either country alone or commodity alone had to be used as the criterion
for assigning missing price observations, country would be a bctter
choice.

result is somewhat surprising considering that we are dealing

This

with tradable goods, for which the law of one price is often assumed to
hold. The importance of country as a variable determining price
behavior

is shown in another

way

by a comparison of country price

indexes, in Table 2. In these indexes the weights are identical for
all six countries; the differences between them are therefore differences
in price movements, rather than in the weighting of identical price
movements.8

For

most of the period, roughly through the end of the 1960's,

country differences in price movements were fairly small. The largest
exceptions could be associated with changes in exchange rates such as
the upward revaluation of the DM in 1961 (affecting 1961/1960 and 1962/61)

8

That

is not strictly true because the absence of price data for a
commodity removes that commodity from the weights. However, these are
countries for which the price data are fairly complete.

and the devaluation of the b in 1967 (affecting both 1967/66 and 1968/67,

but mainly the latter).9 During the 1970's, a period of much larger and
more frequent exchange rate changes, the range of variation among countries was much greater, the extreme case being the range of over 23 per-

centage points in 1973/72. The average range during the 1950's and 1960's
was 3.8 percentage points outside of the years with currency revaluations
and 7.6 points in the years with revaluations, while it was over 12 per

cent during the 1970's. Both the visible relation of the price indexes
to specific currency revaluations during the 1960's and the wide range

of country price changes during the 1970's, despite the fact that an
identical set of weights has been imposed on all the countries, show
that exchange rate changes were not simply offsetting current relative

price movements, even for export commodities. The dissimilarity of the
country price indexes also means that any formula for estimating missing
price observations that relied on the law of one price or even on the
similarity

account,
Quality

of price movements, without taking country differences into

would probably be highly inaccurate.

bias in faiufactures Price Indexts

One of the comments frequently made in the debate about trends in

the terms of trade of manufactures relative to primary products has been
that the standard price indexes for manufactures are biased upwards by
their neglect of quality change, while those for primary products are

not subject to the same bias. There has, however, been virtually no
evidence on this subject beyond our own earlier comparison of the NBER

9

The other wide variance, in 1958/57, was not associated with any
exchange rate movement but with the steep drop in Japanese prices. This
was an extreme case of what appears to have been fairly regular behavior
of Japanese export prices: a strong response to U.S. recessions which
involved a decline in export prices or a decline relative to domestic
prices.

— 17 —

price

series with UN unit value indexes.10 In that case, however, there

were so many possible sources of divergence between the two that it was
impossible to isolate the effects of quality change.
The alleged bias in manufactured goods price indexes can be divided

into two parts. One is the difference we would find between a unit value
Index and an identically weighted index constructed using conventional

specification pricing. The difference between the two would measure the
effects of shifts in composition within commodity groups. That difference
might represent a shift to higher or lower quality but could also represent any other change in characteristics that involved higher or lower
average values per ton or per unit.

The second element of the supposed bias is the incompleteness of
allowance for quality change even in indexes based on specification pricing.

The quality change might take place in a characteristic of the commodity
not part of the specification or, probably more important, the specification
pricing method may not properly account for the change in price that takes

place with the introduction of a new product, as in the substitution of
jet aircraft engines for piston engines or the substitution of newer types
of computers for older ones.
Here we do have some direct evidence on the second type of bias,
certainly on its direction and to some extent on its size in manufactured

goods price indexes. In our indexes for the United States for SITC 7 we
have made the experiment of replacing a number of individual conventional
price indexes at the four—digit SITC level by series that have been adjusted

10
Kravis and Lipsey (1971), Chapter 8.

— 17a —

for

quality changes and also of incorporating such adjusted series where

there were no conventional series at all. The difference between the
adjusted and unadjusted series should almost certainly be a minimum esti—

mate of the bias from this source for several reasons. One is that the
'conventional' series already included a small amount of quality adjustment
for items in SITC 7 between 1953 and 1964, where such adjustments were

carried out in Kravls and Lipsey (1971). Other indexes for manufactured
goods would not include such adjustments. Secondly, the corrections were
performed for only eleven subgroups, all in SITC 7, accounting for about
15 per cent of exports of all manufactures and less than a third of SITC 7

exports by developed countries to developing countries. Third, we restricted
the substitutions to cases where the series to be used clearly involved a

specific quality adjustment, and did not use alternative series for which
the adjustments involved other types of corrections, such as the more
rapid introduction of new products or differences in the type of outlet
from which prices were secured.

-. 18

—

The results of these quality corrections are shown in Table 3. The
adjusted series showed changes in manufactured goods prices that were
lower (smaller increases or larger decreases) than those in the conven--

tional series in all but two years. Over the whole period through 1976
for which we have made this calculation, the adjusted index rose 77 per

cent as compared to 105 per cent for the conventional index. We would
thus estimate the bias from neglect of quality change to be more than 25

per cent over the period as a whole. The average difference was over
1/2 of a per cent per year.

Prices of Primary Products

Although most of the controversy about measurement has centered on
the manufactured products side, there is also a considerable variance in
measures of primary products prices probably not entirely due to differ-

ences in coverage. The strong commercial and financial interests in
primary product trade and the relative homogeneity of the products has
led to the publication in countries of both origin and destination of
prices for well specified product variants by both official and journalistic

sources. International agencies, including the UN and IMF, have taken

vantage of the existence of these materials to form export price indexes
-.t primary products that go back to the 1950's. We have not developed
—'ur own price indexes for primary products and simply report here some

results using these widely available measures, with a small amount of
reweighting to match our manufactured goods price indexes.

As in the case of manufactured goods, both unit value indexes and

price indexes can be calculated. The unit value indexes, the ones most
frequently compared with the corresponding manufactures series, are regularly reported by the UN and are presumably almost universal in coverage.

For price indexes, the problems posed in their construction are less
formidable than those for manufactures, but still not negligible. Both
the UN and the IMF indexes aim at worldwide coverage of price movements

and are Type E measures. A Type B index may be advantageous for primary
product prices if they come close to obeying the law of one price, at

least with respect to price changes. If, for example, Brazilian iron ore
and coffee export prices each moved very similarly to prices of the same
commodities abroad but changed relative to each other, a Type E index
might be more appropriate than the Type A index we have used for manufac—

tures. The UN index is broader in commodity coverage, including dairy
products, forest products and fuels, none of which Is in the flIF index.

Also with 61 primary commodities and 6 nonferrous metals the UN index can
obtain fuller coverage for sectors included in both indexes: for example,
it includes bananas, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, apples, tomatoes, onions
and pepper whereas the only fruit or vegetable in the IMF index is bananas.
Both indexes are computed with a Laspeyres formula, the UN using country

and commodity export weights. The UN series starts with 1950 and is a
series of linked indexes with the early years employing 1953 export weights
and the most recent years those of 1975.

The

flif series begins with 1957

.nd is based on 1968—70. Both indexes aim at export prices but rely on a
mixture of export, import and domestic price series.
Table 4 summarizes the primary goods price measures and compares them

with unit values, both including and excluding fuels. The chief differences in the behavior of the IMP and UN price indexes, each taken in Its

most comprehensive form, is attributable to the inclusion of fuel in the
TIN index and its exclusIon from that of the IMP. Given the huge increases

for Foods and beverages (SITC 0 and 1), Raw materials except foods
(SITC 2 and 4) and Fuels (SITC 3) were combined by us using the
average of 1960 and 1965 weights. For the index excluding fuels
the weights were 53.2 per cent for SITC 0 and 1 and 46.8 per cent
for SITC 2 and 4. For the index of all primary products the weights
were 34.9 per cent for SITC 0 and 1, 30.6 per cent for SITC 2 and 4,
and 34.5 per cent for SITC 3.

in

petroleum prices beginning in 1973, it is not surprising that the UN

shows the overall index at 406 in 1977 while the overall [HF index is

only 280. When petroleum is excluded, the UN 1977 index is 269, not
far from the INF index and even a little below it. Before 1970, when
fuel prices did not behave so exceptionally, the two indexes do not dis—

agree on the broad development of primary product prices. From 1957 to
1970 the annual index numbers in each series moved up and down without
a clear trend and never strayed outside of a 10 per cent range on either
side of the mean for the period.

From the comparison between the most comprehensive price index
(Col. 4) and unit value index (Col. 2) we find no support for the idea
suggested by Spraos (1980) that unit value indexes for primary goods
Pxports are as likely to suffer from upward bias due to quality change as
those for manufactured goods.

[f they do, they should tend to increase

relative to indexes based on price data, but no such tendency is visible

here; the trends are very similar. We cannot conclude that the unit
value indexes are not biased, since there are other differences between
the two types of indexes, such as in coverage and weighting and in the
reference dates of the prices being reported that we have not corrected

for. However, we can say that these indexes, both produced by the UN,
show no evidence of upward bias in unit value indexes for primary commodities.

Terms of Trade
Since we have our own price measures only for manufactured goods the

best measures of the terms of trade we can calculate are based on the
comparison of these with the UN and DIF price indexes for primary products.

— 24

We can then compare these with the corresponding estimates of terms of
trade changes based on unit values in both numerator and denominator.
Terms of trade. measures for developed—country manufactured products

relative to developing—country primary products based on price, rather than

unit value, data appear in Table 5. The terms of trade moved in favor of
manufactures between 1953 and the end of the 1960's or 1970. The manufac—
tures—primary product terms of trade (Col. 3) rose gradually but fairly

steadily, from 83 in 1953 to 105 in 1967 and 1968 and to 106 in 1970 (with

1963=100). This gain of 28 per cent was, however, quickly dissipated in
the ensuing years; by 1974 the index was down to 48, its lowest point in

our table, and it was only 51 in 1977. When the price of petroleum is
excluded from primary products, the index of the terms of trade between
manufactures and primary products (Col. 2) rises until 1972, but it then

declines by a third between 1972 and 1977. Thus the decline in manufac—
tures terms of trade in the 1970's was far from being a result solely of

rising oil prices, however, the comparison with primary products excluding
crude petroleum shows manufactured goods terms of trade in 1973—77 only
10 per cent below 1953—57 while the comparison with all primary products
shows them more than a third lower In the latter period.

We mentioned earlier the suspicion that the commonly used manufactured—
goods unit value and price indexes might have been biased by the failure to
take account of quality improvement in manufactures and we presented what
we thought to be a minimum estimate of such bias for the United States.

An approximation of the probable effect of such bias on our terms of trade
calculation may be based on the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted
price Indexes for U.S. manufactures by assuming that the quality adjustment

estimated for the United States in Table 3 may be applied proportionately
to our "world" (six—country composite) price index for manufactures.

That approximation, shown in column (4), suggests that the period of rising

terms of trade for manufactures was very brief: mainly from 1953 to the
early 1960's. In fact, aside from a couple of higher levels in 1961 and
1962, the terms of trade of manufactures by this measure, were virtually

unchanged from 1958—59 through l96970. After that they fell very sharply
as did the uncorrected indexes. Thus the main effect of the quality correction is to substantially dampen, but not completely offset, the decline in

the

terms of trade for primary products between 1953 and 1970.

It has

little impact on our impression of later developments.

The effect on terms—of trade calculations of using unit values instead
of prices can be observed by comparing Table 5 with Table 6, which presents

some unit value measures. The comparison is summarized in the text table,
below. It shows that between 1953 and 1976 the price data, even without

any correction for quality change in manufactures, indicate a decrease
in the terms of trade of manufactures relative to all primary products
(36 per cent) almost a quarter greater than that suggested by the unit

values (28 per cent). With that correction for quality change the price
data suggest a fall in manufactures terms of trade (45 per cent) more

than 50 per cent greater. The difference between price and unit value
measures of terms of trade is even larger for primary products other than

fuels. The unit values show a substantial rise in the terms of trade
of manufactures while the price indexes show a fall.

The direction of terms—of-trade changes an investigator finds is

sensitive to the period of his study. If we had stopped our calculations
at 1970 we would have found increases in the terms of trade for manufac—
tured goods whether we measured them by prices or by unit values and with

or without fuels included among primary products. however, quality-corrected
measures of the terms of trade of manufactures would have shown only about

half as large a gain as the other indexes. The direction of this apparent
bias due to the neglect of quality change in manufactures seems to be
impervious to changes in the span of years examined.
Historical Perspective

In view of the many historical generalizations that have been made
about the terms of trade between manufactured goods and primary products,
it is of some interest to try to place the experience of the past 25 years

or so in historical perspective. Unfortunately, the tools for doing so
are even cruder than the series we have used for the recent past. All of
the available series, at least for manufactures, have as their basic irigredi-

ients the same unit value data, and differ only in weighting, in product

— 29

—

and geographical coverage, in the degree of disaggregation used in calculation, and in the years at which various versions of the series were linked.
To the extent that there are biases or inaccuracies in unit value series,

as we have suggested, they are incorporated in those we must rely on for
earlier years.

The unit value measures in Table 7 seem to be the closest we can
come to the concepts we use for later years with respect to commodity

and country coverage. They are unit value indexes derived from Kindleberger
(1956) and from Maizels (1963). Those from Kindleberger are for Industrial
Europe's

exports of manufactured products to areas outside Europe and the

United States and for Industrial Europe's imports of
tobacco

food, drink, and

and raw materials from the same areas. They are for six widely

spaced years from 1872—1952 and use end—year trade weights for each period.

We used estimates for the same weights in combining them for Table 7.
The indexes

world

from Naizels (1963) are for exports of manufactures to the

by European countries, the United States, Canada, Japan, and India.

The Maizels indexes cover a set of periods similar to Kindleberger's but

beginning only in 1899. They were published with both end—year and
beginning—year weights for each period but we have used only

for comparability

the former

with the Kindleberger indexes for primary products.

As compared with other available indexes, both of these have the advan-

tage of covering a long span of years using a common method of calculation
across both periods and countries, as far as that could be done with the data

as published. The Kindleberger indexes refer specifically to manufactures
exports by developed countries to developing countries and developing—country

exports of primary products to developed countries. The Maizels indexes
are more like our own in that they are for exports to the world, assuming

in effect that price movements are the same across all destinations for a

For a discussion and justification of this assumption see
Maizels (1957).

of the Kindleberger indexes, aside from the probably excessive
degree of aggregation discussed by both Kindleberger and Maizels,
are the omission of the United States as an exporter and the
fact that the primary product prices include freight, since they

are derived from import values. Although Maizels includes India
as an exporter, its weight is too low to have any substantial
effect on the index for all manufactures.

The picture of trends in terms of trade shown by the two
indexes from 1900 to the beginning of our series in 1953 is
similar. The terms of trade between manufactured goods and

primary products were roughly the same in 1953 as in 1900, but

the Kindleberger series showed much wider fluctuations. In
addition the Kindleberger series indicated little change in the
terms of trade of manufactured products between 1872, when they
began, and 1900, and thus no real trend between 1872 and 1953.

Perhaps the main point to be emphasized is the very wide
range of the fluctuations of the terms of trade and, as a
consequence, the dependence of any impression about trends on

the choice of beginning and end years. For example, 1938, the
final year of Hilgerdt's League of Nations study,12 was the

most unfavorable for primary products in the

12

League of Nations (1945).

— 31 —

whole period after 1872, and it is not surprising that he found a long
term downward trend in primary product prices. The early 1950's, on the
other hand, followed a large recovery of primary product prices, and a

period of worry about raw material shortages. It is thus not surprising
that studies of terms of trade since the early 1950's tended, until recently,
to again find downward trends in relative prices of primary products.
Similarly, it is understandable that around the World War I years, the
long—term trend was thought by many to favor primary producers.

Conclusion
These calculations indicate that the prices of manufactured
goods exported by developed countries to developing countries

have risen over twenty years or so by considerably less than is shown by

the generally used UN unit value indexes: something like 75 per cent
rather than 140 per cent. Furthermore, the decline in terms of trade for
these goods relative to primary

substantially

products has been almost 50 per cent.

greater than one might calculate from unit value indexes,

which suggest a fall of only about one third.
The difference between our estimate of the decline between 1953
and 1976 in the terms of trade of manufactures relative to primary products
(45 per cent) and that based on unit values (28 per cent) is composed of

several elements. Mostly they are aspects of the manufactured goods price
measurement, which has been the focus of our research, although if a
different time span were used, there would be some larger effect of our

use of prices instead of unit values for primary products. One component
is some mixture of differences in index number formulas, country coverage,

— 32 —

and the use of price data rather than unit values, of which we think the

last

is the main influence. That part accounted for about half of the

difference. The second half was the result of a minimum estimate of
quality bias in the manufactured goods price index.

These are all rough calculations, sensitive to choices of end-years

and other factors. We plan further refinement of them, but so far they
do suggest the likelihood that the usual estimates of the rise in rnanufac—

tured goods prices and the terms of trade of manufactured goods relative
to primary products are seriously biased upwards.

It is important to remind ourselves in all these discussions of the
terms of trade that, as has often been pointed Out, and despite the apparent implications that have been drawn, the net barter terms of trade is
not a welfare measure, and that its divergence from a welfare measure is

particularly great over long periods. The reason we would emphasize is
that long—term changes are dominated by shifts in supply: major changes
in productivity which make the net barter terms of trade depart from the
single factoral terms of trade, which could make a stronger claim to be

welfare measures. However, both of these measures suffer from the added
defect that they ignore quantity changes and would treat as "favorable,"
for example, a rise in export price which drives the exporter almost, but
not completely, out of export markets.

Perhaps the only safe conclusion about very long—run trends in either direc-

tion is that the evidence for their existence is weak. There is very little
foundation for historical "laws" that specify the inevitability of movements
in either direction in the terms of trade between these two sets of

products. If a speculation is to be provided, the safest one would appear
to be that any apparent trend is likely to be reversed. The serious
content of this uhlawtT is to remind us of the self—limiting feature inherent

in sustained shifts in the relative price movements of any pair of broad

categories of goods. The relative prices of computers can, of course,
sink very low and that of petroleum can go very high. However, when one
whole class of goods such as primary products is compared with another such
as manufactures——both having very varied and widely spread uses throughout
the world economy——supply and demand factors tend to operate so as to limit

the extent and duration of relative price shifts. Eventually producers are
driven off and/or drawn in while consumers are affected oppositely, and
eventually relative price movements shift in the opposite direction.

— 33 —

Laws of improving or worsening terms of trade for manufactures or for
primary products are usually based on two dangerous suppositions:

1. It is possible to predict the relative behavior of demand and
supply for the two groups of products; and 2. Responses to the changes
in these relative demand and supply conditions will take the form of

permanent price shifts rather than quantity shifts. Over the long run
quantities can change a lot, and trends turn out to be fitted to arbitrary
points in long, irregular, and probably unpredictable cycles.

Sources of Data

The set of price data we gave priority to are the international
price Indexes for metals, metal products, machinery, and transport equip—
ment for the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan, 1953, 1957, and 1961—64,

from Kravis and Lipsey (1971). These were interpolated by various other
series, mainly the types mentioned below, as described in Kravis and

Lipsey (1972), to give continuous series for the period from 1953 through

1964. The second priority was given to the official export price indexes

appear in Statistisches Bundesamt, Preise, L8hne, Wirtschaftsrechnungen,

Reihe 1, PreIse und Preisindizes fUr AussenhandelsgUter. A brief descrip-

tion

is given in Angermann (1980), and in articles in Wirtschaft und

Statistik such as Rostin (1974). The Japanese export price data are
published in the Price Indexes Annual, earlier the Export andt Price

Indexes Annual, of the Bank of Japan. The U.S. export price data are from

— 35 —

For the U.K. there are virtually no export price data outside the
period of the price competitiveness study. The exception is a set of
export price indexes for products in SITC 7 for 1976 through 1979, part
of an experimental program that was later discontinued.

For Canada, our data consist entirely of domestic prices: wholesale
price indexes at a detailed level from tapes provided by Statistics
Canada.

Domestic price data for the U.S. were price series at the most

detailed level from a BLS Wholesale Price Index tape. For the U.K., some
individual series were collected from publications of the Board of Trade

and the Department of Trade and Industry. However, the U.K. does not
publish individual series for most machinery or "engineering" groups.

For these, we used a set of indexes at the two—digit SITC level calculated
for us by the Board of Trade from detailed price data using OECD weights

we supplied. For later years, we could not obtain these series and were
obliged to use a similar set of two—digit indexes calculated by the
Department of Trade and Industry based on U.K. export weights.

The German domestic price indexes are individual series published in
Preise, L3hne, Wirtschaftsrechnungen, Reihe 3, Preise und Preisindizes fUr
industrielle Produkte, Index der Erzeugerpreise and Reihe 8, Index
der Grosshandelsverkaufspreise (Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden).

The Japanese domestic price indexes are also individual series from
the Price Indexes Annual and the Wholesale Price Indexes Annual published
by the Bank of Japan.

— 36 —

The other main set of data are the

hedonic

price indexes substituted

for conventional price series in our calculation of the quality—adjusted

price index. These indexes are from a number of sources but were, with
one exception, collected by Robert J. Gordon for his manuscript on The

Measurement of Durable Goods Prices. The

other

index that was used was for

aircraft, taken from Robert J. Gordon, "Energy Efficiency, User Cost Change,

and the

Neasurement

of Durable Goods Prices," NBER Working Paper No. 408,

November 1979. The hedonic price indexes were for the following SITC subgroups, with weights as indicated.
