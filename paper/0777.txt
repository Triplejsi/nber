ATRACT

AGENCY, DELAYED CO!ENSATION AND THE STRUCTURE OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION

by
Jonathan Eaton

and

Harvey S.

Rosen

In this paper we examine the factors affecting the structure

of executives' compensation packages. We focus particularly on the role of
various types of delayed compensation as means of "bonding" executives to
their firms.

The basic problem is to design a compensation package that rewards

actions that are in the long—run interest of the stockhblders. Firms must
take into account (1) their ability to discern unfortunate circumstances
from mismanagement; (2) the extent to which a compensation package forces

the executive to face risks beyond his control; and (3) the willingness of
a given executive to bear this risk.

We use our theory to interpret some executive compensation data from

the early 1970's. The results are generally in line with the theoretical
predictions.

"A mental midget can tell whether top management deserves a bonus
based on current profits. It is much harder to figure out whether
top management has positioned the company well for the long run."
(Thurow [1981].)

Introduction

1.

Recently, executive incentive structures have become a matter of public

concern. The comments in a New York Times

article entitled

"Overhauling

Business Management" are typical: "American ianagers are too worried about short term profits ... A lOt of American companies know they have

America's

old

machines ... But the manager figures he'll keep the old machines as long

as they still run, make a big profit one year, and take that record as an advertisement to get a job elsewhere." (L,ohr [1981, p. 42].) Such inappropriate
incentives are often linked to the 'productivity crisis."
Clearly, it is in the interest of firms that their managers be concerned

with long run profits. Frequently, however, the long run implications of an
executive's job performance cannot be assessed until after the executive has

terminated his relationship with the company. To relate an executive's reward
more closely to his performance, firms can delay a large component of compensation until

becomes dependent upon indicators of performance.
Of course, other factors may also affect the extent to which delayed

compensation is used. Tax considerations, for example, may play an important
role. If the tax rate on unearned income is lower for the firm than for
the individual executive, there may be art advantage to postponing

compensation.1

The firm may also have better access to capital

markets.

In this paper we examine the various factors affecting the structure of

executives' compensation packages. We focus on the role of various types of
delayed compensation as means of "bonding" executives to their firms.

The

theoretical framework is established in Part 2. We show how the
preferences of firm owners and executives interact to determine the form of

the equilibrium compensation package. An important aspect of the theory is

to allow for the possibility of

The model leads us to expect certain

empirical regularities in the way that compensation packages are related to

characteristics of firms and executives. In Part 3, these are explored using
data on a sample of top ranking American executives from the early 1970's. A
concluding section contains a summary and suggestions for future research.

i

The extent to which tax considerations, rather than monitoring

problems, determine the firm's decision to delay compensation

has been a subject of debate. Miller and Scholes [19801 argue that tax
considerations dominate, while Lazear 11981) takes the contrary view.

A Theoretical Framework

We use a simple two—period odel

to explain the essential features of

the process that determines the

composition of the executive's compensation
package. In the first period the
executive expends effort in managing the
firm arid receives a
salary as compensation. In the second period he is re-

tired, and consumes his savings and

delayed compensation. The stockholders

are assumed to be unable to observe his effort contemporaneously,
and hence

cannot make salary contingent on performance. In the second period firm

owners do receive information on

may then provide additional compensation

on their perception of his performance.

determining a "market locus" of the type discussed by Rosen [l974J.

Because the optimal package depends upon a complex interaction of
firm and executive characteristics, explicit solutions for the compensa-

tion scheme are difficult to obtain for very general cases. We provide,
instead, a qualitative discussion of how various firm and executive
4

characteristics are likely to affect aspects of compensation. Then, in
Section 2.4, we derive an explicit solution for a particular example.

Other things equal, a firm will prefer to delay a larger share of

comjention when future indicators of executive performance are more
reliable than those presently available. We thus anticipate that delayed
compensation will be used more when monitoring costs are high in the
present relative to the future.
To minimize expected compensation costs the firm will, ceteris paribus,
tie compensation to indicators that are relatively risk free. This is because tying compensation to a "noisy" indicator exposes the executive to.
greater income variability.

Given our assumption on the concavity of the

utility function, the expected level of compensation must then be higher

to attract a given executive. This line of reasoning suggests that future
firm value is less likely to be used as a performance indicator the more it
is influenced by factors beyond the executive's control. Future firm value
will, of course, be used more as a performance indicator when direct measures

unavailable.
A compensation package that exposes an executive to risk beyond his

control will be especially undesirable to an executive who is risk averse.
Since younger executives have a longer period over which to pool risk,
they should be more willing to receive compensation in risky forms.

We

thus anticipate t' younger executives' compensation will come in forms that

preferences, and the optimal compensation package.

npirical Analysis
In this Section we use our theory to analyze compensation data for a

group of high ranking American executives during 1970-73. To do so, we must
first recognize that actual compensation practices are considerably more

complicated and varied than suggested in the theoretical discussion. As
Lewellen [1968] notes, probably the minimum number of meaningful compensation types is four:

salary and bonus, pensions,

deferred compensation, and stock options. A method must be devised to measure
the values of each of these components in comparable units. The other major
problem in exploring the theory's empirical implications is the selection of

a relevant set of company characteristics. These characteristics are supposed
to measure the extent to which:

(a) the executive's activities can be monitored,

and (b) the firm's performance is subject to risk beyond the executive's control.

In Section 3.1 the variables used are described.

_ln Section 3.2 we

specify an econometric model. The results are presented in Section 3.3.

3.1 Data
We first discuss the components of executive pay, and then
turn to the characteristics of their companies.

total compensation. In order to compare the pension, deferred compensation,

income equivalents —-

". . .the

amounts of immediate cash income that would be

as valuable, after taxes, to the executive recipients under consideration"

11973, p. 160]. We discuss briefly below each form of compensation.

Salary and Bonuses
Salary and bonuses are aggregate direct current remuneration and comprise

on average 64% of the value of total compensation in our sample. All such
payments are taxable to the individual at ordinary personal income tax rates
when received, and are prominently reported on corporate proxy statements. To
compute their after tax value is not straightforward, because information is
needed on deductions, and income from sources other than the corporate employer.

Using Internal Revenue Service data, Lewellen determines the average ratio o
exemptions and deductions to gross income for individuals in each tax bracket
and assumes that each executive takes exemptions and deductions as the average

person in his income bracket. "Outside income" is essentially impossible to
establish with any certainty.

Lewellen assumes that such income equals 15% of

direct current remuneration.

8

Data on two of the executives were incomplete, so our sample was reduced from

110 to 108 observations.

— 14 -

The estimates of the executives' marginal tax rates are probably not very
sensitive to these assumptions. The average salary plus bonuses in our sample
exceeds $100,000. By virtue of corporate remuneration alone, most of the
executives were probably subject to the maximum

tax

on earned incorne,regardleSS

of assumptions on income from other sources.

Pensions
A pension gives an executive the right to receive a series of periodic
payments of a given (nominal) size beginning at the future retirement date

and continuing throughout his lifetime. An important institutional fact is
that pension benefits for executives are made on the same basis as for other
employees (Lewellen [1972, p. 121]).

Indeed, consistency in the benefit

formulas is one of the key conditions for tax qualification of a plan.

Other

types of deferred compensation which are discussed below offer considerably

more flexibility. In our sample, on average pensions account for about 15% of
9

the value of the compensation package.

9

Leweilen computes the after tax current equivalent of a pension as the

size of the annual premium the executive would have to pay were he to
purchase from an insurance company a retirement annuity equal in value and

similar in form to his pension promise. Each increase or decrease in benefits
is regarded as a separate pension award whose current equivalent begins at the

time the award is made, and continues thereafter up to the executive's anticipated
retirement age. It is assumed that the executive does not anticipate resigning
from the company. On this possibly controversial assumption, Lewellen notes, "Although almost everyone can point to an example of a corporate officer who was either
lured away from or priced out of his job, the conclusion suggested by an examination
of proxy statements is that such occurences are quite infrequent when viewed in re-

lation to the entire senior managerial group." [1968, p. 25].

promise benefits at or after retirement. They

comprise about 13% of the total compensation package, on average. One
type of arrangement that is often used guarantees the executive a defined

benefit sum, the difference between that figure and any payments received

prior to his death being payable to his estate. In return for such promises,
certain restrictions are usually imposed on the executive's activities. The
Internal Revenue Service has ruled that as long as such restrictions are part
of the contract, so that forfeiture is possible in principle, the post—retire-

ment payments are not taxable until received. Thus, to the extent that
marginal

tax

rates differ during the working life and at retirement, there

is an element of tax arbitrage in deferred compensation schemes.

— 16 -

Deferred
and

thrift

compensation takes a variety of forms, including profit-sharing

plans, as well as individual contractual schemes. Hence, deferred

compensation schemes are likely to be more closely tailored to the circumstances

of particular executives than are pension plans. With respect to the extent to
which they are stock based, deferred compensation packages are quite heterogeneous.
For example, the investment vehicles for thrift plans can vary from a imixed

portfolio of fixed income securities to one consisting solely of the firm's

stock. Unfortunately, in our data we are not able to distinguish between
those components of deferred compensation whose value are stock determined,
10
and those that are not.

When deferred compensation is defined in terms of benefits and is
vested, from the executive's viewpoint it is a close substitute to a

pension and will be desired for similar reasons. Occasionally, payment
is made contingent upon certain well-defined actions on the part of the

executive, such as staying with the firm a certain period or not working

for a competitor. A firm is likely to find deferred compensation
packages of this type attractive when there are a few easily monitored
potential future actions by the executive that it wishes to discourage.

It provides a means of providing a disincentive without subjecting the
executive to vai±ation in his income beyond his control. However, other
types of deferred compensation are tied to the value of the firm's stock.
These are similar, for our purposes, to stock options, which we discuss next.

10

-—

For purposes of computing the after-tax current equivalent of deferred

compensation schemes, Lewellen assumes that the most appropriate practical
alternative to a deferred pay contract is simply an addition to the executive's

salary that is equally attractive in terms of its after—tax present value. In
contrast, for pensions the equivalence criterion was the premium on an annuity.

This distinction is a consequence of the fact that deferred compensation arrangements tend to be less centered on mortality considerations than are pensions.

- 17

Stock Options
A stock option granted by a corporation to an executive is an agreement
that he may purchase from the firm, at any time within a stated period, a
given number of shares of its stock at a price specified on the date of grant-

ing. In the early 1970's, the tax rules stuJated that under certain conditions,11
the difference between the purchase price and later resale could be taxed at

capital gains rates.12 The specific elements of option agreements tend to vary
across firms and executives. For example, there may be implicit or explicit
restrictions placed on the resale of the stock acquired under the option. Stock
options account for about 8% of the value of total compensation in our sample.

Stock options relate the executive's income most directly to what the
stockholders care about, the value of the firm, but have the disadvantage of

exposing the executive to risk beyond his control. They are likely to be
favored by firms whose executives have wide latitude in the performance of

their duties and are difficult to monitor closely. Options will be most
attractive to executives who are relatively unaverse to risk, and the stock
value of whose firms is relatively unaffected by random variables beyond
the executive's control.

11 For example, the option must be non-transferable, must be exercised
within a certain number of years after it is granted, etc.

12 During our sample period, the maximum

capital

gains tax rate was 35%.

13 Lewellen values the option as a function of the difference between the
option price to which the executive is entitled and the market price when

the option is exercised. In order to account for the possibility that the
executive may die before the option is granted, standard mortality tables
are used to compute actuarial equivalents of the payments.

Company Characteristics
Information on company characteristics such as size and complexity is

required in order to explain patterns of executive compensation. Specifically,
we need data that indicate the uncertainty and complexity of the environment
in which the executive is operating, because these will determine the import-

ance of bonding considerations in the construction of the pay package. The

Obviously, these are imperfect indicators of the complexity of the environ-

ment in which the executive operates. For example, it would be possible to compute
more sophisticated measures of riskiness, taking advantage of the theory of Eff i-

cient markets. However, given that the reliability and robustness of such measures
are open to question (see, e.g., Cragg and Malkiel [1979]), this tack did not
seem worthwhile.

are dummy variables for rank;15 the y's are parameters, and

is a

random error.

Wriat predictions does theory give concerning the signs of the '"s ? For

the coefficients on the AGE variables, the story is fairly straightforward.
Because older executives are likely to have a lower discount rate, they should
value

post-retirment income more than their younger counterparts. Furthermore,

older executives are expected to be more averse to income variation —— they
have

less time for the "law of averages" to assert itself. Hence, the share

of pensions, which come in the future and are relatively safe, is expected to

increase with age. On the other hand, we expect the share of stock options,
the more risky type of compensation, to decline with age. In the absence of
information on tbe,specific nature of deferred compensation contracts, we can
make

no predictions with respect to how

their share will vary with age.

Predicting the signs on the firm characteristics is more problematic.
The difficulty is that we do not know a priori which characteristics are
indicative primarily of situations in which monitoring problems are important,

and those which reflect environments in which firms are subject to a lot of

exogenous risk. For example, if it were known that firms with high research
and development expenses tended to have volatile profits for exogenous

reasons, our theory would predict a negative sign for R. in the stock
options equation.'6 However, because we do not have any basis for classifying

15 RK. is the ith_ranking executive in terms of total compensation; the
omitted category is the fifth rank.

16 As noted in Section 2.3, firms with high exogenous risk should not tie
compensation too closely to firm performance.

— 21 —

the

firm characteristics inth "monitoring" or "exogenous risk" categories,

no such predictions can be made. Hence, the signs on the firm characteristics
cannot be used to "test" our theory.

Instead, the theory is employed to

interpret the coefficients and investigate whether

any interesting patterns

emerge.

Each of the four share equations is estimated by ordinary least squares.
Because the shares must add up to unity, certain cross equation restrictions

on the coefficients are implied. However, when the same regressors (including
a constant term) are used in each equation, ordinary least squares estimation
guarantees that the constraints are satisfied.
Before presenting the results, several points need to be made regarding
the basic estimating equation:

1. Although there are four years of data for each executive, observations
are not entered on an annual basis. Ratbar, we average the values of the
variables over time, arid enter the means. The theory is not intended to ex-

plain year-to—year fluctuations in compensation shares. Rather, it is
supposed to explain "permanent" traits of the compensation package as a
function of characteristics of the executive and of the firm. For the sake
of comparison, we estimated (3.1) with each of the yearly observations

entered separately. There are no important substantive differences. (These
results are available upon request.)

2. It may be the case that compensation practices differ systematical—
ly across industries. To explore this possibility, the firms were grouped

— 22

—

17
into six industrial categories,

and a set of regressions estimated with a

dummy variable for each category. The main qualitative results are not
changed very much by their inclusion. It is interesting to note, however,
some systematic differences that arise in compensation packages in different
industries.

3. The executive's marginal income tax rate is not included as an explanatory variable. As suggested earlier, the incomes of the individuals

in

the sample are so high that

and

most of them were paying the maximum

tax rate,
18

hence there was insufficient variation to obtain meaningful results.

3.3 Results
The basic results are reported in Table I. We first consider the signs

on A ,

W

,

L

,

and

V ,

the

measures of firm size and complexity. A number of

interesting patterns are present. The shares of salary—bonus and pensions
are smaller for those companies in which advertising, total assets, labor

17 The categories are described in Appendix A.
18 In a set of equations not reported here, we included total comDensation
as a regressor, on the assumption that it might indicate the executive's

ability to benefit from tax arbitrage over time. Given this interpretation,
income has the expected sign: positive for deferred compensation and stock
options, and negative for the other types. However, such results must be interpreted with caution, because total compensation is determined jointly with

its composition, and is therefore endogenous. See Masson 11971] for an empirical study of the determinants of the total level of executive compensation.

— 23 —

force,

and the variance of return are high; but larger for those firms in

which research arid development expenditures are high. Just the opposite is
the case in the share equations for deferred compensation and stock options. In
the context of our theory, these results suggest that high research and develop-

ment expenditures are associated with environments in which firm managers
face considerable amounts of exogenous uncertainty.

On the other hand,

when total assets, labor force, and advertising expenditures are large, it
appears that monitoring considerations are more important than exogenous

risk. Similarly, a high variance of return appears to be associated with
firms where monitoring executives is difficult.
With respect to impact of age on the compensation structure., we ex-

pected that stock options should become less attractive as the executive

ages and pensions more attractive. According to the results in column (4),
starting in their mid 50's, executives receive a declining pcoportion of

their incomes in the form of stock options. According to column (2), the
proportion of income in pensions increases throughout the executive's working life.

(The negative sign on the quadratic term does not dominate until

age 70.)

The coefficients on the rank dummies reveal a tendency for the higher
ranking executives to receive a greater proportion of their compensation in

stock options. We conjecture that this is because the higher the individual's
rank, the more important his job, and the greater the necessity to bond him to

the firm. In some experiments not reported here, we allowed for a set of
full interactions between rank and the other variables, but no interesting
patterns emerged.

We turn now to the effects of

controlling for industrial

category. These results are reported in Table II, in which

INDi is a dummy for the th industrial group listed in Appendix A. As
suggested by comparing the R2's of Table II with those of Table I, inclusion of the industry duniinies contributes

significantly to the explanatory

power of the equations. Generally, however, the main qualitative features
of Table I remain intact. The coefficients on W ,

signs, but in a few cases those on A and L

R

and

V

keep the same

change. The "outliers" with

respect to compensation practices appear to be the electronics industry (IND4),
with.a very high reliance on stock options, and

the

motor vehicles and

parts

industry (IND5) with a commensurately large use of current forms of compensation.

Conclusion
Designing an executive compensation package that rewards actions that

are in the long-run interest of the stockholders is a complex problem. Firms
must take into consideration (1) their ability to discern unfortunate circurnstances from mismanagement; (2) the extent to which a compensation package

forces the executive to face risks beyond his control; and (3) the willingness

of a particular executive to bear this risk. Our

theoretical analysis suggest-

ed several criteria that are likely to affect the composition of an executive

compensation scheme: the age of the executive, firm characteristics

affecting

the ability of the firm to monitor executive behavior and the extent to which
the firm faces a high degree of exogenous uncertainty. We found that relatively
safe forms of delayed compensation (pensions) were more intensively used for

older executives, who value a high level of delayed compensation more but are less
tolerant of uncertainty about this income.

Younger executives, on the other hand,

were more likely to receive compensation in the form of stock
options.
Salary and bonus and pensions were used more in firms with fewer

workers, low assets, less advertising expenditure and a low variance of

rate of return. If our theory is correct, these characteristics are
indicative of situations in which monitoring costs are relatively low. A

high level of expenditure on research and development also led to a heavier

reliance on these forms of compensation. Our explanation is that firms in
which research and development is significant tend to be subject to large

exoyenous uncertainties. In such firms, linking executive compensation too
much to firm performance exposes the executive to substantial risk. The
risk premium required to offset this risk limits the extent to which
it makes sense for the firm to bond the executive's interests to its own.

A maintained hypothesis in our analysis has been that firms establish
compensation schemes optimally given their own characteristics and those

of their executives. it would be useful to examine the effects of
alternative compensation schemes on firm performance.

For example, to

what extent does increased use of stock options improve firm performance?

Other firm characteristics must be held constant, of course.
We conclude by noting that we have examined the issue of executive
compensation in a particular cultural context, and have considered a

limited array of mechanisms to reward executives. An interesting topic for
research would be a cross—country examination of executive compensation and
performance that takes into account different tenure structures and attitudes

toward executive-firm relations. Perhaps these have allowed a greater bonding
of interests between executive and firm without a conconmitant increase in the
executives

exposure to risk.
