Central Planning and Monetarism: Fellow Travellers?

ABSTRACT

We discuss the monetary institutions

and macroeconomics of centrally

planned economies (CPEs); objectives and techniques of monetary control;
the relevance to CPEs of the

neutrality property, the natural rate hypothesis,

and the quantity theory; the roles of stock .and flow variables and the
stability of asset demand and expenditure

functions; the relation between

monetary policy, fiscal policy and incomes policy in CPEs; the CPE equivalent of a floating exchange rate and its implications for monetary
policy;
and "super crowding out."

Many considerations suggest that monetarism

as theory and policy might be more applicable under central planning than
it is in market economies.

Central Planning and Monetarism:

The essential characteristic of

central planning, or of a centrally planned
economy (CPE), is the detailed allocation

and services among producing and

monetarists travel together, and how far?

Are monetarist principles applicable

under central planning? Are there similarities
central planners and that of market economy

between the macroeconomics of

monetarists, between their attitudes

and intellectual predispositions?

A final disclaimer: when discussing

the macroeconomics or monetary econo-

mics of central planning, I am not in general referring to Marxist monetary
theory, whether applied to a CPE or a market economy. I am certainly not ask-

ing whether Marx's monetary theory

is monetarist, although this too is by no

means an absurd question.
Until quite recently, there was very

are entirely determined by supply—side forces (Goldmann, 1964).
Resistance to a theoretical and applied

macroeconomics of CPEs arises from

several distinct arguments, none of which I find convincing. First is the

belief that if all quantities are planned and determined at the disaggregated,
microeconomic level, macroeconomics simply cannot matter. But the planners
themselves do not accept this, and

they rightly carry out macroeconomic and

financial planning, because at least

some macroeconomic aggregates, like house-

holds' money balances, do play a role which cannot be planned centrally at the
micro level.

A second reason for ignoring

macroeconomics, or at least monetary economics,

in CPEs is the widespread, long—standing

belief that demand always exceeds sup—

ply under central planning, so supply must determine everything. For the household sector, I have challenged the factual premise on a wide variety of empirical grounds (1974, 1977) and, with David Winter, on econometric evidence (1980).
Those who start from this assumption often find it hard to implement

consistently

(Green and Higgins, 1977, reviewed in Portes, 1979a).
It has also been contended that it is

strictly impossible to deal with

macroeconomic aggregates in CPEs, because relative prices are so distorted, and
in practice the aggregates are meaningless, because any total of expenditures
will include many items bought only because the buyers could not find what
they
really wanted. Such "forced substitution" is

a consequence of both excess
aggregate demand and distorted relative prices (Kornai, 1981). We find, how-

ever, that

there will still be a natural correspondence between what is happen-

ing at the microeconomic level and what is measured

by macroeconomic aggregates

(Portes and Winter, 1980). Aggregation over quantity—constrained micro markets,
some in excess demand and others in excess

supply, can yield smooth behaviour

and well—defined macro variables (Nuellbauer, 1978).

We can now consider how
monetarist thought might apply to the macroeconomics
of central planning.
We may start
conveniently with the general
monetarist proposition for market economies
that money is neutral. One form of this is familiarly expressed by the notion
that "money is a veil":

is employed. The objective of monetary policy in CPEs is the control of inflationary pressures.
In a properly functioning market economy, too,
employment is strictly superfluous, on a

at the "natural rate"). In

these circumstances, monetary policy should not seek to affect real variables,
but

rather to adjust to them, in a CPE, or to avoid perturbing them from their

long—run paths, in a market economy.

In both cases, provided these fundamental

criteria are met, monetary policy has of course a legitimate independent role
in pursuing the authorities' objectives for

nominal variables such as the price

level. With a vertical Phillips curve, macroeconomic policy

should be concerned

with inflation, leaving the reduction of the natural rate of unemployment to
micro economic measures.

All this is a straightforward coincidence of views. Note, however, that

this aspect of monetarism is in the market economies based on the belief that
markets work, that decentralised allocation can ensure

coherence, even eff i—

ciency, but in the CPEs based on the belief that planning and centralized signals work, so monetary regulation need not be used to adjust for any mistakes.

which
share the title of the
Quantity Theory of Money. One is that V is stable, at
least in the medium to long
run, so that changes in N will be the principal causes of changes in Y, subject perhaps to
long and variable lags. A second is
the strict version of the

neutrality property: if V and y are determined by

can say more.

Milton Friedman once set

up a model which, he argued, was Common to mone—

was missing one equation to make it complete, or

the different between monetarists and

Keynesians was that for the missing

more stable——given the much simpler institutional and asset structures.*
A strong similarity in analytical method emerges from the observation that
monetarists center attention on stocks of assets more than on flows of expendi-

tures or receipts. Central planners, too, emphasize in their analyses the stocks
of currency and savings deposits held by the public, as well as inventories held
by distributive trade enterprises, and ratios of these stocks to retail trade
turnover, rather than any marginal propensities.
It has often been regarded as a basic tenet of monetarism that the stock

demand for money function is more stable than the Keynesian flow consumption

expenditure function. In a CPE, if we take household money to include both
currency and savings deposits, then the absence of other financial assets and

debts means that the two functions are virtually equivalent: Savings equals
the increment to money stocks.

It might nevertheless be argued that in a CPE the demand for money is more

fundamental, or more stable, for at least two reasons: The rate of interest
paid on savings deposits does not vary in the short run; and prices are quite

stable, so price expectations are not volatile. Nor are quantity expectations,
either of employment or of aggregate consumption goods supplies.

Thus although

the planners are concerned about temonetary overhang" and the possibility that

in some crisis households may suddenly and massively seek to convert their money
savings into goods, in fact this does not appear to happen.** Their concern may
perhaps be traced to another residual influence of Marxist monetary theory,

as a principal tenet of monetarism that the demand for

money IS relatively insensitive to the

rate of interest. Though this is now a

less important part of the

monetarist story, we should note that it is easily
applicable to CPEs. Here the
monetary control mechanism has
never given any
role to the interest rate.
Although household saving or portfolio allocation
behaviour might well vary with the interest rate, this is
impossible to establish empirically, because the planners have altered
the interest rate so seldom (and then in discrete
steps, and Practically always upwards) since the mid—
1950s. They do not use the interest rate as a
macroeconomic control variable,
either in relation to
households, or to affect
aggregate enterprise investment
demand, or aggregate inventory
holdings. And the interest rate does not vary
without an explicit planners'
decision: it is not a flexible
price in any market. Clearly, therefore, the central planners would
follow market economy
monetarists in regarding the
price of money as the inverse of

because the U.S.S.R. is the world's second—largest

gold producer. But neither a

foreigner nor a resident of any CPE could redeem rubles or zlotys or lei, however earned, for gold, at either the official or the market rate. Nor could a
holder of the domestic currency buy dollars or sterling, except possibly in very
limited quantities for authorized tourism.
This is not to say that convertible currencies are

valueless in the CPEs——

quite the contrary, as Mr. Honecker is said to have confirmed on his trip to

West Germany, which he found really just like the East: he could buy anything

there for Westmarks. Nevertheless, to go to a fixed exchange rate system, with
consequent direct relations between domestic and foreign prices and money supplies, would be totally incompatible with central planning. Despite their
acknowledgements to David Hume, in practice most

monetarists have also favoured

floating rates.

Central to the debate between monetarists

and non—monetarists in the 1970s

was the issue of "crowding out", which supplanted earlier arguments over the

—17—

relative size and stability of
tions and changes in

the effects on nominal income

of monetary injec-

autonomous expenditures. Monetarists assert that govern-

ment expenditure ultimately "crowds

equivalent volume of private

out" (displaces or substitutes for) an

expenditure, through some combination of interest

rate and price level changes.

The consequence is that at least in the long
run,
fiscal policy cannot affect output.
In the centrally planned

economy, with full employment and

central physical

allocation of resources, it is evident that an increase in
the state sector's
use of output (say for investment
or military expenditure) must entail an equivalent reduction in the household sector's use (consumption)

The only exception

could be when the planners

adjust net exports, but although there is some evidence they do this in the short
run, it is not likely to be a feasible shift of

wages constant, a shift in output away from consumption causes excess demand for
consumer goods, which discourages labour supply.
As workers find they
cannot spend as much as they would
like, they will react
at least partly by working less. The result will be
a fall in output, hence in
the amount available for
consumption, hence perhaps a further fall in labour
supply, until this "supply multiplier"
process comes to rest (Barro and Gross—
man, 1974; Portes, 1981).
If however excess demand means that some individuals

are now unable to pur-

chase particular goods or services which they find

sufficiently important, they
may offer (instead of money) goods

or services at their disposal which are also

in short supply. Thus I may offer to fix your car if

monetarist is the policy recommendation

following an increase in the oil price

for a major oil importer.

The monetarist would argue that this will require a
reduction in real income and the real value of
money holdings, so that the nominal stock of money should
certainly not be increased; while a non—monetarist
would argue that the oil price rise will have the
deflationary effect of an
indirect tax increase,
so that monetary policy should

be expansionary. On this

Let us return to the roles of fiscal and

monetary Policies in a closed
economy. The monetarist would say, in view of the relation between
money stock
and nominal income, the
stability of the demand for
money relative to consumption behaviour, and tcrowding out", that fiscal
policy has no independent status
and should adjust to
monetary targets. In fact, fiscal
policy is implied by
these targets and by the
government budget constraint, given a stable private
sector demand for money. Thus
the nionetarist experiment in the U.K. has stressed
the (empirically weak) relationship between the
government deficit, its borrowing
requirement, and the monetary
aggregates.

more straightforw to place

the responsibility for

directly on the bank, where it belongs (since an excessive
increase in the money
supply to households can be identified
with an excessive increase
in credits to
enterprises, net of their deposits with
the bank).

—20—

Monetarism has long been associated with the case against "fine—tuning" the

economy, using an activist or

discretionary monetary policy.

Friedman's

early arguments rested on the authorities' lack of knowledge about the mechanism
of transmission of monetary effects, the lags, etc., so that the private sector
would be more stable if monetary policy were simply

to follow a fixed rule. A

more recent justification of a similar conclusion is the argument from the supposed rationality of private sector expectations:

that agents use information

efficiently in making their forecasts about the economy and taking decisions
based on them, and that such information must include' knowledge of any systematic policy pursued by the authorities.

If so, it is argued, the path of real

antioutput is affected only by changes in the money supply which agents cannot
cipate, and so cannot be part of a systematic policy.
For the CPE, we have already seen that

the planners do not want or need an

active monetary policy, in the sense of one which seeks to influence output or

employment. Hence the rule that the state budget should balance, so that any
change in household cash will be the mirror image of a change in enterprises'

aggregate net liabilities to the monobank. This in turn should be consistent
with the material balances and wage plans.

The planners know, of course, that there will be some overshooting (and
hence bank overfinancing of enterprises), and that they must compensate by some

conscious underplanning of wages. The hypothesis that expectations are formed
rationally is perhaps more plausible in
because the planners' policy rules are

the CPE than in the market economy,

better defined, better known to agents;

and their policies change less often.
Thus, a wide range of considerations suggest

that monetarism as theory and

policy might work better in CPE circumstances, with soviet—style financial

—21—

Institutions, than it does in

our developed market economies. Our monetary
system is excessively
intricate, and this makes
monetarist regularjti8 less regular
than they might be. These complexities
appear to come at a high cost with relatively little benefit.
Certainly bankers,
Particularly central bankers, could
easily adjust to the changed
circumstances. Indeed, the two major classes of
economic agents whose behaviour
seems system_invariant
are central bankers and

peasants. Soviet bankers
