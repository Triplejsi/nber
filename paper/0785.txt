October 1981

Real Versus Financial Openness Under
Alternative Exchange Rate Regimes

ABSTRACT

A simple analytical framework is used to consider alternative exchange
rate regimes and their bearing on macroeconomic management of a semi—

industrial economy. The emphasis is on the implications of different

degrees of capital mobility. One

of

the topics taken up is the conflict

between the role of the real exchange rate as a signalling device for
long—run resource allocation and the problem of real exchange rate appreciation accompanying the opening up of an economy to short—term capital

inflow. Also discussed is the related choice of exchange rate policy as
an anti—inflation device.

Introduction1
The semi-industrialized economy to be discussed here mainly imports

raw

materials

and capital goods and is past the stage of using quantita-

tive restrictions for import substitution of consumer goods.

Traditionally

it depended mainly on primary exports and is now rapidly moving into
industrial exports.

While it nay still have a multiple protective tariff

system and thus be more 'closed' in the real sense than some optimum degree
of free trade might dictate, it will rely quite heavily on the use of the
formal

exchange rate system to handle current account problems.

The typical problem for such an economy, unless it happens to be an

oil exporter, is

over time in face of a large structural deficit, as part of its

long-run trade and development strategy.
Under reasonable assumptions it will be an optimal strategy for this
economy to borrow abroad to finance a large deficit in the early stages of
industrialization, use these funds to develop its exports, providing the
internal rate of return lies above the marginal social cost of foreign
borrowing.

Subsequently it will pay back these loans as the economy approaches
In the course of the growth process the real effective ex-

change rate will usually be required to grow over time, and it should do so
at a rate that equals the difference between the internal and external real
rate of return to capital (see Bruno 1976).

This statement must be modified

(or when the country's relative export price in world

markets) is sufficiently high to make actual growth in the real exchange
rate unnecessary.

These

affect long—run borrowing, domestic savings and investment

policies as well as the real exchange rate as an allocative device.
Problems occur when short-term market prices do not give the 'correct'
long-run allocation signals for producers or consumers.

Two major sources

for such discrepancy may arise in the present context, both working in the
same direction.

The world financial market may temporarily register very

low (or even negative) real rates of interest for short and medium run
loans2, as it has done for some time in the 1970s and until very recently.

The other, often more important, problem is that domestic stabilization
policy with its associated restrictive monetary policy, may cause the real
marginal cost of domestic credit to rise considerably above the desired
long-run rate.

Either one of these or.a combined opening up of the gap

between the two interest rate signals will, in the absence of other inter-

vention, cause

substantial short-run capital inflows and a real appreciation

of the exchange rate, depressing manufacturing exports and profits, an
experience recently shared by a number of countries in the Latin American
Continent3 and elsewhere.

Prolonged periods of real exchange appreciation accompanying short-run
capital

inflow, when

the long-run horizon dictates the converse, may not be

from the point of

view

of financial portfolio allocations. These

are easily reversed at the cost of a phone call.

They may, however, be

costly in terms of irreversible production and invesijient decisions, which
by nature have long gestation periods.

This argument, of course, depends

on some myopia in the expectation formation process of investors. Given

the market inperfections in a typical semi-industrialized country this is
a reasonable assumption

to make.

This type of conflict between short-term and long-term asset pricing

of goods across borders and the efficiency advantages to be reaped from
reducing intervention in the free flow of real trade.

Financial openness

has to do with the substitutability of foreign and domestic financial assets
and the extent of interference with free capital mobility.

Since the ex-

change rate enters the pricing of both tradeable assets and tradeable goods
conflicts of price signalling may occur when financial openness is pursued
along with real openness.

We

shall

assume here that the problem of relating long-term borrowing

(and investment) to the development strategy has somehow been taken care of
and we may, for our purposes, consider the long-run capital imports as largely
determined outside the present framework.

This leaves the question of

openness toward the world financial market for short-run capital movements.
Also, how does financial, as distinct from real, openness relate to the

operation of the economy under alternativ exchange rate regimes?
After laying out a simple analytical framework (Section II) we shall

Money and other assets
There are three kinds of privately-held assets in the system in

addition to the capital stock: government bonds (B9) carrying a nominal
interest rate i, domestic money (M), and a foreign currency denominated
asset (Z).

The latter could, in principle, include paper money, an interest-

bearing asset (net of debt and carrying an interest rate i*), or inventories
of imported goods.

For simplicity, we shall ignore the foreign interest

rate and only take into account the expected rate of devaluation

The result is

a more intensive fall in reserves than would otherwise take place, signalling
a larger devaluation than may objectively be required.

This can be illustrated as follows: given the expectation of a
devaluation, a new temporary equilibrium could take place at the point H.
One way of exactly reaching H could be a nominal devaluation from A to G
keeping M constant, followed by a price increase (due to an inflationary
gap in the goods market) which is represented by an inward move along a 450
vector from G to H.

So far we have ignored changes in nominal money which can he assumed

nay

This brings us to the sc-cord dynamic process which

take place simultaneously with the previously described one.

Let us

go back to the point A when foreign exchange reserves start falling.

Unless sterilized, there will be a fall in M which in Figure 2 would show
as a horizontal leftward move from A towards D.

Excess supply and unemploy-

ment develop unless prices (and wages) are downward flexible.

Again, a

possible move under price fleibi1ity would be a fall in M by the amount
DA and a reduction of prices along a 450 vector from D to E.

If expecta-

tions of a devaluation are kept at zero, the BoP would have reached temporary
equilibrium at E without a devaluation but through a monetary squeeze and
a forced deflation.

If prices are inflexible, the monetary contraction and the deepening
slump could in principle continue until an unemployment equilibrium is
reached at F.'4

It is the capital flows in response to the interest rate

gap15 that will finance the basic deficit.

Obviously, this is neither a

sustainable nor a socially desirable equilibrium.

What usually happens is

that the internal pressure on the monetary authorities makes for monetary
expansion to counterbalance the loss of reserves.
The counterpart of this phenomenon, after an excessive devaluation, is
the reverse upward pressure on the money supply coming from the renewed
capital inflow and the rising reserves.

The pressure to keep real money

and credit high (e.g. for investment) may cause a continued inflationary
process driving down the real exchange rate to a renewed BoP deficit, unless
the devaluation is coupled

with the appropriate measures that will shift QQ

outwards.16

If exchange controls are tight ( 0) and

the original level of real

balances is desired,an equilibrium devaluation could be reached at C providing there is a sufficient accompanying budget cut to move the QQ line
through that point.

If controls are not tight and there are capital flows,

temporary equilibrium could be reached at N, say, with a smaller budget
cut and smaller real devaluation.

This, however, can only be temporary

since the current account deficit will gradually erode foreign exchange assets
and require further cuts in the budget deficit, and an additional increase
in c/p to make room for the expanded production of tradeable goods, as IT'
gradually shifts up.

Only a larger budget cut to QQ' (and/or larger drop

in the real wage, coupled with a rise in m and q) can keep all markets in
new current-account equilibrium at the point B.

The main problems that arise in the operation of a fixed peg which is

Countries hardly ever operate a uniform tariff rate on imports. However,
a close substitute for the above idea is a flat export subsidy based on value

apparent advantage of mini-devaluations may paradoxically sometimes also be
a source of major weakness.

In a government-deficit and inflation-prone

economy the operation of the exchange rate is delegated to a ministerial or

It helps to discuss first the case of a flexible rate

In Figure 3 this can be shown by noting

that the imposition of a tax (T) on capital imports is the same as raising

the expected cost of foreign borrowing and thus causing the asset market

Exchange Rate Adjustnent and Inflation: Accommodation versus

This brings up the case in which short-

run stabilization may take the lead over long-run objectives in exchange
rate pricing.

Specifically, should the rate of devaluation always be made

to accommodate (or overtake) the inflation rate for the sake of the long-run
external balance?

Or are there situations in which it pays to moderate

exchange rate changes as a short-run stabilization device even at the cost

of a real loss of reserves?
For simplicity we shall conduct the discussion in terms of steadystate rates of change, p and e, and assume consistency of expectations,

A crawl that achieves steady state equilibrium under these assumptions

More restrictive internal policies (showing

correspondingly reduced inflation rate (cf. point C with A).

From here on the analysis is the same.

Strictly speaking equilibrium will probably take place at a point

real ages these problcms are clearly accentuated.
