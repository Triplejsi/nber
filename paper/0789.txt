DOES ANTICIPATED AGGREGATE DEMAND POLICY MATTER?
FURTHER ECONOMETRIC EVIDENCE

Abstract

A heated debate has arisen
Macro Rational Expections (MRE)

over what Modigliani has dubbed the

hypothesis. This hypothesis embodies two

component hypotheses: 1) rational expectations and 2) short—run neutrality
——i.e., that anticipated changes in aggregate demand will have already been
taken into account in economic

agents' behavior and will thus evoke no out-

put or employment response. Together these

component hypotheses imply that

deterministic feedback policy rules will have no effect on business
cycle

fluctuations. The irrelevance of these types of policy rules is inconsistent with much previous macro

theorizing as well as with the views of

policymakers. It is thus an extremely

controversial proposition which

requires a wide range of empirical research.
This paper is a sequel to a previous paper by the author. That
paper developed a methodology for testing the MRE hypothesis and found that
anticipated money growth does matter to the business cycle. This paper
extends the analyses to cases where the rate of nominal GNP growth or the
inflation rate, rather than money growth, is the aggregate demand variable.

The empirical results are also negative on the MRE hypothesis and its
corresponding policy ineffectiveness proposition.

ses imply that deterministic feedback

policy rules will have no effect

on business cycle fluctuations. The irrelevance of these types of
policy
rules is inconsistent with much
previous macro theorizing as well as with
the views of policymakers. It is thus an extremely controversial proposition which requires a wide range of empirical research.'
This paper is a sequel to a previous paper by the author. That paper
developed a methodology for testing the MitE hypothesis and applied it to

the case which has received the

most attention, where money growth is the

aggregate demand policy variable. However, other research has focused on
cases where the rate of nominal GNP growth2 or the inflation rate,3 rather
than money growth, is the aggregate demand variable. The results in these
cases have been mixed in their support of the

MRE hypothesis and further

evidence seems necessary if we are to come closer to a resolution of the

debate. This has led to this paper's

empirical analysis of whether antici-

pated values of these aggregate demand variables matter.

II. THE METhODOLOGY
The methodology for the empirical analysis to follow is only outlined

briefly here. My earlier paper has a more extensive treatment of the
methodology and the reader is referred there for more details.

c, and the
right—hand side variables is necessary in order to identify the 8—coefficients.
The usual assumption, and the one that is
used in the tests here as well as
In previous empirical work on this subject, holds that all the
right—hand
side variables are exogenous and hence are uncorrelated with the
error term.
This assumptjon,that (4) is a true reduced form,implies that least
squares

yield consistent estimates of the t3's.
The above assumption is more tenuous for the analysis in

than was true for previous work
where money growth is taken as the aggregate
demand policy variable.

Although the exogeneity of money growth in

output or unemployment equations is by no means uncontroversial,
economists are more willing to assume the exogeneity of
money growth than the

exogeneity of nominal GNP growth or inflation

There are two methods that have been used to estimate the equation (4)
model. Barro (1977) uses a two—step procedure where the forecasting equation

(OLS) over the sample period and
used as the unanticipated aggre-

In the models estimated here,

the number Of lags in the unemploy-

ment or output equations is so

large that spurious rejections might occur because the small sample distributions of the test statistics differ substantially

from the asymptotic distributions. In order to be certain that any rejections
of the MRE hypothesis are valid, the models discussed in the text are estimated
with the smoothness restriction that the coefficients of the unanticipated
and anticipated aggregate demand variables lie along a fourth order polynomial

with an endpoint constraint. This particular polynomial distributed lag (PDL)
specification was chosen because it is rarely rejected by the data,8 it makes
interpretation of the coefficients easier, and it has the advantage of using

up few degrees of freedom. As the comparison of the text and Appendix II
indicate, use of the PDL restriction leads to similar

statistical inference
on the validity of the MRE hypothesis, so we can be confident that there
are
no spurious rejections of the MRE hypothesis

because of small sample bias.

Granger and Newbold (1974) have pointed out the danger of conductjna
inference in a regression model where

the serial correlation of the error

term is ignored. To avoid this "spurious

regression" phenomenon i the out-

put and unemployment equations a correction for serial correlation is
necessary
that results in white noise residuals. Here the error term
of (4) and (6)
is assumed to be a fourth—order AR

process because fourth—order autoregressions

are usually successful in eliminating serial correlation from quarterly,

macro time series. This serial correlation correction is indeed Successful
in reducing the residuals to white noise.

Specification Issues

It is difficult on theoretical

grounds to exclude any piece of informa-

tion available at time t—l as a useful predictor of a policy variable.
Policymakers might react to this information even though there is no theoreti—
cal model that suggests that this should

occur. Thus it might end up being a

8

useful predictor of policy and should be included in the Z—vector in (2).
This reasoning suggests that an atheoretical statistical procedure based
on the predictive content of information is the appropriate way to specify

the variables belonging in the forecasting equatiofl)0 The procedure used

here and in my previous work amounts to running multivariate, Granger

tests. The policy variable X, is regressed on its own

four

lagged values

(again to insure white noise residuals) as well as on four lagged values
of a wide ranging set of macro variables, such as:

M2 growth rate, the inflation rate, nominal

GISt?

the quarterly Ml or

growth, the unemployment

rate, the treasury bill rate, the growth rate of real government expenditure, the high employment surplus,
the balance of payments on current

the growth rate of the federal debt and

account. The four lagged values of

each of the variables are retained in the equation only if they are

jointly significant at the five percent level. One advantage of this procedure is that it imposes discipline on the researcher that prevents his
searching over forecasting equation specifications

that lead to results

confirming his priors.

Earlier research on the MRE hypothesis with an equation (4) model
[for example, Robert Barro (1977, 1978), Robert Barro and Mark Rush,

Jean Grossman and Leonardo Leiderman] has used a fairly short lag
length——two years or less——on the anticipated and unanticipated X

variables. This paper looks at longer lag lengths for two reasons.
Experimenting with plausible, less

restrictive models that have

longer lag lengths is an appropriate strategy

for analyzing the robust-

ness of results because this only has the disadvantage of a potential
decrease in the power of tests but will not result in incorrect test

statistics.12 In addition estimates in this paper and in Robert
Gordon find that unanticipated aggregate demand variables lagged as

9

far back as twenty quarters

are significantly correlated with output
and unemployment.

III. THE RESULTS
The estimated models in the text use seasonally adjusted,
postwar
quarterly data over the 1954—76 period and

the methodology Outlined

in the previous section. The sample starts with the first quarter of
1954
because this was the earliest
possible start date when models with long
lags are estimated. The data are discussed
in more detail in the data
appendix. In pursuit of information

paper with nominal GNP growth and

variable. The natural level of unem-

y, is estimated here as a simple time trend as in

Barro (1978). A more complicated Barro

(1977) specification has been

avoided because, as is Indicated by David Small and Barro (1979), its
validity is doubtful.

The first step in pursuing the MRE tests is to specify the
variables
entering the forecasting equations for nominal GNP growth and inflation.
The multivariate, Granger procedure Outlined in the previous
section yields
the following specifications.

Overall then, the Lucas supply model estimated here is not successful.

IV. CONCLUSION
The empirical evidence here does not support the proposition implied
by the MRE hypothesis that only
unanticipated aggregate demand policy matters.
This is consistent with the findings in my earlier paper. With the
aggregate demand policy variable

specified to be either nominal GNP growth

or inflation, anticipated policy seems to matter a lot. Anticipated

Furthermore, these rejections are

frequently at exceedingly small marginal significance

value of the likelihood ratio

statistic under the null hypothesis of neutrality is only 1 in 200,000.
The hypothesis of rational expectations, the other element in the

MRE hypothesis, fares much better in the empirical tests here. Although the
rationality hypothesis does not come out unscathedthere is one rejection
at the five percent level, but just

barely—--it is not rejected in any other

tests in the text at the 5% level.1

Rejections of the joint hypothesis of

rationality and neutrality are thus seen to occur primarily because of the
rejections of neutrality rather than

rationality. This result might give

some encouragement to those who are willing to assume rationality of expecta-

tions in constructing their macro models, yet

are unwilling to assert the

short—run neutrality of policy.

There is one qualification of the
cussion. This paper has followed
using the identifying assumption

true

results that warrants further dis-

previous research in this area by

that the output and unemployment equations

reduced forms. However, with inflation or nominal GNP growth as

the aggregate demand variable,

this assumption is not without suspicion.

It is not clear whether the invalidity of this assumption might lead to
in
rejections of the MRE hypothesis even if it were true. Some caution

interpreting these results is therefore warranted.
along with my earlier paper does cast

However, this work

doubt on previous evidence that is

cited as supporting the view that only unanticipated macro policy is
relevant to the business cycle.

FOOTNOTES

*Associate Professor, Department of Economics, University of
Chicago and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research.
I thank an anonymous referee; the participants in the money workshops at
the University of Chicago and the University of Virginia for their helpful
comments; and the National Science Foundation for research support. The
usual disclaimer applies.
1Some of the recent work on this proposition is as follows:

Robert Barro (1977, 1978, 1979), Robert Barro and Mark Rush, Jean Grossman,
David Germany and S. Srivastava, Robert Gordon, Leonardo Leiderman,and
David Small.
2Jean Grossman and Robert Gordon.

3momas Sargent (1976a) and Ray Fair.
4Note that the endogeneity of the aggregate demand variable does
not necessarily produce invalid test statistics for this model. For example,

In th case where only contemporaneous M_Me enters In equation (4), test
statistics are valid even if the exogeneity of X is assumed when this is

untrue. See Andrew Abel and the author. However, it

is not clear that

this desirable result——that the above assumption does not matter to the

tests of Interest here——carries over to the case where lagged M_Me enter
equation

(4).

5Because of the observational equivalence problem Grossman cannot,
and does not, test using Barro's (1977) procedure whether the anticipated

nominal GNP growth variables significantly add to the explanatory power

of his equation (4) model. Instead Grossman reports results supporting the
MRE hypothesis which rely on flimsy grounds for identification, namely the
assumption that the lag length on nominal GNP growth cuts off at six quarters.

F2

6Goldfeld—Quandt tests do not reveal the presence of hetero—

scedasticity within the (2) and (4) equations estimated here and it is only
necessary to correct for it across equations,as in my earlier paper.
7The constrained—system is estimated with iterated non—linear least

squares and it thus approaches full information maximum likelihood (FIML).

The unconstrained system is estimated using the variance—covariance matrix
estimate from the constrained system in order to correct for one small sample

problem. This results in a likelihood ratio statistic that is slightly
more conservative: i.e., it will be less likely to reject the null hypothesis. See my earlier paper for a more detailed explanation of why this
procedure was followed.
8The PDL constraints are not rejected in models where inflation is

the aggregate demand, X variable. For example, in model 6.1 x2(14) = 20.54
and in model 6.2 x2(l4) =

10.62:

the critical x2(14) at 5% is 23.7. The

PDL constraints receive less support in the models using nominal GNP as the

X variable. They are not rejected for the 2.1 output model at the 5% level,

but are nearly so: x(l7) = 26.95, while the critical 2(l7) at 5% is
27.6. However, they are rejected at the 1% level in the unemployment equation:
=

34.91, while the critical 2(l7) at 1% is 33.4. I did pursue

experiments with an 8th order PDL to see if this would fit the data sub-

stantially better, but it did not. Although this rejection of the PDL con—
straints is bothersome, the fact that the unrestricted models in Appendix
II yield such similar results to those in Tables 2 and 3 indicates that
imposing or not imposing the PDL constraints does not change any conclusions.
9The Durbin—Watson statistics for

range from 1.82 to 2.15, none

of which indicates the presence of first—order serial correlation. Furthermore, the Ljung and Box adjusted Q—statistics for the first twieve auto—
correlations of

cannot reject the null hypothesis that these autocorrela—

F3

tions are zero. The Q(12) statistics range from 5.84 to 15.0, while the
critical Q(12) at 5% is 15.5.
10See Thomas Sargent (1981).

Note that a stepwise regression procedure might miss significant
explanatory variables because of the order that it chooses to run the

regressions. Thus some judgment must be exercised in conducting a more
general search to find a specification that includes any variables with
significant explanatory power.

12Because rejections of the null hypothesis are less likely when
the power of the test is reduced by the addition of irrelevant variables,
a rejection at a standard significance level in a less restrictive model
is even stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

13Chow tests which split the sample in equal halves indicate that
the nominal GNP growth forecasting equation does have the desirable property

that the stability of the coefficients cannot be rejected. F(9,74) = .60
while the critical F at 5% is 2.0. However, stability of the coefficients
of the inflation equation is rejected: F(13,66) =

3.40 while the critical

F at 5% is 1.9.

14The F tests here are not meant to describe what regressions

were run in order to achieve the final specification. They only show
how much marginal explanatory power each variable has, once the first

specification was decided upon. The specification was approached by running
regressions with many more variables than in (7) or (8) and paring the
specification down by eliminating variables with little explanatory power,
as well as building up the specification from regressions with fewer ex-

planatory variables. In cases where two variables were so highly correlated
that each but not both had significant explanatory power, the one that

F4

produced a lower standard error of
this is the choice of M2 over Ml

the equation was chosen. An example of

growth in both equations (7) and (8).

15As in my earlier paper, the long lags for the
unanticipated

and anticipated nominal GNP variables are critical to the negative find-

ings in the MRE hypothesis. For

example, an output model with only seven

lags of nominal GNP growth with the

lag coefficients freely estimated does

not reject the joint hypothesis: x2(15) = 23.07 while the critical

at 5% is 25.0. As explained in

my earlier paper, this failure to

reject is probably due to misspecifying the lag length as too short.
16Although these rejections are Consistent with the rsults
using
money growth in my earlier paper, they are

substantially stronger.

One possible explanation for this finding is that the higher correlation
of this aggregate demand variable with

output or unemployment leads to

tests with greater power.

17As reported in footnote 13, the stability over time of
the coefficients of the inflation forecasting
should be somewhat more cautious in

make use of this equation. However, as discussed in my earlier paper,
the specification of the forecasting equation is probably not a critical

issue in the findings because the

specification of the forecasting equation is probably not severe,
