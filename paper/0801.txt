MACROECONOMIC DETERI'{INANTS OF REAL EXCHANGE RATES

Abstract

This paper presents a model that integrates money, relative prices, and the current account balance as factors explaining movements in nominal (effective) exchange rates.
Thus money and the current account are the proximate determinants of changes in real (effective) rates. The basic model
is first analyzed under static expectations. It is an extension of Branson (1977) to include explicitly exogenous disturbances to the current account. Next, rational expectations
are introduced, and it is shown that the nominal (and real)
rate should be expected to jump instantaneously in response to
new information or "innovations" in money, the current account,
and relative prices.
The model is applied to the quarterly data on effective
exchange rates, relative prices, money and the current account
for four countries——the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Japan——
since 1973. First the time—series properties of the data are
described. All are approximately first—order autocorrelations
except all relative prices and Japan's effective exchange rate
and current account balance. These are second—order autocor—
relations. Then vector autoregressions (VARs) are estimated
among the four variables for each country. The residuals from
these equations are the "innovations" in the data——the current
movements not predicted by the past. The correlations amongst
these innovations are consistent with the theory.
Thus the broad conclusion from the paper is that the theoretical model which integrates money, the balance on current
account and relative prices, is consistent with movements in
these variables since 1973. Real exchange rates adjust to real
disturbances in the current account, and time—series innovations
in the current account seem to signal the need for adjustment.

I. Introduction and Summary
In 1973 the international monetary system began a period of Continuous

movement of exchange rates among major currencies. Rather than moving
smoothly following the paths of relative national price levels, exchange

rates have exhibited the volatile movements that are generally associated

with asset market prices. This has been amply documented by Jacob Frenkel
(l98la,b). Sharp movements of the exchange rate relative to relative price
levels are fluctuations in "real exchange rates."

This term is defined here

to mean the nominal exchange rate adjusted for relative price movements.
During the period since 1973 theory about the determinants of exchange

rate fluctuations has undergone a transformation. We began with alternative
models in which rates moved to clear the current account balance (the "elasticities" approach) or responded to movements in relative money stocks (the

"monetary" approach). These have been integrated into a more general framework in which exchange rates are determined in the short run by conditions
of asset—market equilibrium, in the same way as asset prices or interest rates,

and in the long run by real conditions affecting the current account.
This integrated theoretical view is expressed, for example, in Dornbusch

(1980). In this view, monetary disturbances generally do not change the
equilibrium real exchange rate, but real disturbances to the current account

do. This theoretical view has been accepted widely enough that the OECD
Economic Outlook reports it as the conventional wisdom:

The main economic variables generally thought to explain exchange
rates are monetary conditions (and especially interest rate differentials), current account developments, and relative price performance. But over recent months the influence of inflation differentials has been uncharacteristically small, or operated with
considerable delay, the dominant role being played by monetary
conditions and current account developments.—'

—'OECD, Economic Outlook no. 29, July 1981, p. 59.

Since the variables cited in the quote are generally thought to determine

movements in exchange rate, one would expect new information about these
variables to move exchange rates in the short run through expectations.

Some

initial evidence that "news" or "innovations" in the relevant variables moves
exchange rates is reported in Dornbusch (1980) and Frenkel (198lb). More
evidence is presented in section VI below.

This paper presents a model that integrates money, relative prices,
and the current account balance as factors explaining movements in nominal

(effective) exchange rates. Thus money and the current account are the
proximate determinants of changes in real (effective) rates. In section II
we present the basic model with static expectations.

account.—' The result is gradual adjustment of the real exchange rate fol-

lowing a current account disturbance. In section III we introduce (rational)
expectations, and see that the nominal (and real) rate should be expected to

jump instantaneously in response to new information or "innovations" in
money, the current account, and relative prices.
In sections IV —

since 1973. Section IV describes

the time—series properties of the data. All are approximately first—order
autocorrelatiOnS except all relative prices and Japan's effective exchange

rate and current account balance. These are second—order autocorrelationS.
We see in section V that purchasing power parity

does not hold in the short

run. This confirms evidence presented, for example, by Frenkel (1981a).
—'Readers familiar with that model can easily skip the first seven pages
of section II.

Finally, in section VI we see the results of estimation of vector

autoregressions (VARs) among the four variables for each country. The
residuals from these equations are the "innovations" in the data ——

the

current movements not predicted by the past. The correlations amongst
these Innovations provide a test of the theory; we would expect a systematic relationship between innovations in money, current account balance,

relative prices and the effective exchange rate. These correlations are

shown in Tables 10 and 11. They are generally consistent with the theory
of sections II and III.

Thus the broad conclusion from the paper is that the theoretical consensus expressed by the OECD, which integrates money, the balance on current
account and relative prices, is consistent with movements in these variables

since 1973. Real exchange rates adjust to real disturbances in the current
account, and time—series innovations in the current account seem to signal
the need for adjustment.

II. The Asset—Market Model with Static Expectations.
II.A.

Introduction

The literature of the 1970s has identified three macroeconomic vari-

ables that influence movements in exchange rates. These are money supplies, relative price levels, and current—account balances. Here I develop a representative model that explicitly includes all three elements.
We begin by specifying the underlying economic structure with static ex-

pectations. Then in section III below rational expectations concerning
movements in the exchange rate are introduced.
The model is an extension of the asset—market model sketched in
Bransori (1975), and developed in full in Branson (1977, 1979a). There the

focus was on the roles of relative prices and asset markets, mainly in

the short run. Here the model is extended to study the effects of underlying "real" disturbances influencing the current account balance, with
price dynamics specified explicitly.

II.B. Asset—market equilibrium in the short run.
To make the analysis manageable, let us consider one country in a

many—country world. We can aggregate the assets available in this country into a domestic money stock M, which is a nonearning asset, net holdings of domestically—issued assets B,

which are denominated in home cur-

rency, and net holdings of foreign—issued assets F, which are denominated

in foreign exchange.—' B (for bonds) is essentially government debt held
/Since the analysis here applies to any single country in the international financial system, I use the terms 'home' and 'foreign' to denote
the country being discussed and the rest of the system, respectively. At

by the domestic private sector. F (for foreign assets) is the net claims
on foreigners held by the domestic private sector. The current account
in the balance of payments gives the rate of accumulation of F over time.

The rate of accumulation of B is new government debt issue sold to the
private sector, and the rate of accumulation of N is given by home central
bank (Fed) purchases of government debt.

The rate of return on F is given by ,

fixed

in the world capital

market, plus the expected rate of increase in the exchange rate, .

The rate of return on B is the domestic interest rate r, to be determined in domestic financial markets. Total private—sector wealth, at any
point in time, is given by W = M + B + eF, so here the exchange rate e,
in home currency per unit of foreign exchange (e.g. $0.50 per DN), trans-

lates the foreign—exchange value of F into home currency.
The total supplies of the three assets, N, B and F, to domestic

holders are given at each point in time. Each can be accumulated only
over time through foreign or domestic investment.—' These interact with
demands for the three assets in determining equilibrium values for the

home interest rate r and exchange rate e. The demand for each asset

—'Since F is home claims on foreigners less home liabilities to foreigners, an asset swap which exchanges a claim and a liability with a foreign
asset—holder is a transaction within F, changing claims and liabilities
by the same amount. This transaction would leave F and B unchanged.
The reason for using this particular aggregation will become clear when
we study dynamic adjustment below. Basically, we want to define net foreign assets consistently with the balance of payments and national income
and product accounts, which record the capital account balance as the
change in U.S. private holdings of net foreign assets. The assumptions
outlined above make N and B non—traded assets. This implies that the
total stocks of N, B, and F in domestic portfolios are given at any point
in time.

independent equations in e and r,

given the balance sheet constraint. Any pair of (l)—(3),

substituted from (4), can be used to determine short—run equilibrium
values for e and r.

In this section the assumption of static expectations means ê = 0.
In section III we will see the important difference that expectations
make for the dynamic path to the long—run equilibrium.

We can study short—run equilibrium determination of the exchange
rate and the interest rate holding r + ê constant, using Figure 1.
There we show the pairs of interest rate r and exchange rate e that alternatively hold the demand for money equal to its supply (MM), the de-

mand for domestic assets equal to their supply (BB), and the demand for

foreign assets equal to their supply (FF). To obtain the slopes of MM
and BB, consider what happens as e rises. This increases the home cur-

rency value of wealthW, increasing the demand for both N and B. As
the demand for money rises, the equilibrium r that maintains demand for
money equal to the fixed supply rises, giving the positive slope to MM.

As the demand for domestic assets rises, this pulls up their price, de-

pressing the equilibrium interest rate. This gives the negative slope
to BB.

For the slope of FF, consider what happens as the home rate of re-

turn r rises. As the domestic r rises, the demand for foreign assets
falls, and e falls as asset—holders attempt to sell F. This gives FF a
negative slope. Since a given increase in r reduces the demand for F by

less than it increases the demand for B, a smaller drop in the exchange
rate is required to restore equilibrium in the foreign asset market than

would restore equilibrium in the domestic asset market. This makes BB
steeper than FF.

Movements of equilibrium r and e can be analyzed by asking how the
market—equilibrium curves of Figure 1 shift as monetary policy or the

world rate + ê or F shift for example. This analysis can be done by
using any two of the three curves. Since the three assets sum to
total wealth, if a given change in e and r restores equilibriuu. in two

markets, it must in the third. Thus, since all three curves go through
the same equilibrium r, e point (the one that yields equilibrium in all
three markets simultaneously), we need to use only two to analyze changes

in short—run equilibrium; the third will follow imlicitly.
Short—run stability and comparative statics of the asset—market model

in (l)—(4) are discussed in detail in Branson (1979a). There we see the effects of changes in the stocks of N, B, or F on equilibrium e and r using

Figure 1.—I The comparative static results are summarized in Table 1.

The entries in Table 1 give the direction of change of the interest
rate and the exchange rate following (a) an increase in any one of the
asset stock, holding the others constant, in the first three columns, and
(b) an expansionary open—market operation, with N

exchanged for B or f or

F, in the last two columns. One important implication of Table 1 is that
an increase in the domestic money stock M, either through a budget deficit or an open—market operation, directly raises

the exchange rate e.

The increase in e is required for financial market equilibrium and should
come quickly before any effects on the price level are seen. Thus, in
the short run the exchange rate is determined by financial market equili-

brium, not only by relative prices. A second important implication of
Table 1 is that if the country is running a surplus on current account,
so that net foreign assets F are increasing, this tends to reduce the exchange rate; a deficit in current account, with F falling, raises the ex-

change rate. This is the key to dynamic adjustment of the exchange rate
as we move from short run to long run.

The short—run comparative statics of Table 1 yield an implicit reduced—form equation for the exchange rate:

II.C. Dynamics and Long-run Equilibrium
The Adjustment Mechanism

II.C.1

In the short run the exchange rate is determined by requirements
of asset—market equilibrium, giving existing stocks of money, domestic

assets, and foreign assets. But this is not the end of the story. The
value of the exchange rate at one point in time, t(O), given income, the
domestic price level, and other real variables, may yield a nonzero

balance on current account. With flexible exchange rates and no central bank intervention in foreign exchange markets, the sum of the balances on capital account and current account is identically zero. Thus,
a nonzero current account balance implies an equally nonzero capital ac-

count balance of the opposite sign. If the current account shows a surplus, the capital account is in deficit and the private sector is ac-

cumulating foreign assets; F is increasing. If the current account is
in deficit, F is decreasing. As F changes, the exchange rate changes
through the short—run mechanism of subsection B. Thus, if the initial value
of the exchange rate e(O), yields a nonzero current account balance, F
is either increasing or decreasing, moving e from e(O).

The point of

this section is to study the dynamic adjustment through the current account, and to show the condition under which it leads to a stable long—run

equilibrium value for e where the current account balance is zero and the
stock of net foreign assets is not changing.
In addition to the exchange—rate dynamics, the price level presumably
responds to changes in the domestic money stock, but with a lag. For
price dynamics, we follow Dornbusch (1976) in assuming slow adjustment

13.

of the price level to monetary shocks. We also assume that in the long
run, the price level changes proportionately to the money stock; the

economy is homogeneous in monetary variables. Rather than specify the
entire domestic economy, I will assume long—run homogeneity and gradual
adjustment of the price level.—'

—'Readers interested in the underlying model of the economy might
consult Branson (l979h, ch. 7).

The technical analysis of dynamic adjustment il1 be presented in
this subsection. Then in subsections II D and II E we will describe the
response of the system to monetary and real shocks.

The assumption on price dynamics is captured simply by

—'This is a formalization of the argument on price—level adjustment in
Branson (1977, l979a).

The other dynamic equation is provided by the balance—of—payments

identity. With no central bank intervention, and thus zero change in reserves, the capital account and current account must sum to zero:

OEX+rF-F

14.

Here X is net exports of goods, F is income on net foreign assets, and
dF/dt is the rate of accumulation of net foreign assets, the rate of

i

capital outflow. This gives us an expression for F:

FEX+rF
Net exports, in turn, depend on the real exchange rate e/p, and an

exogenous shift factor z. The real exchange rate here is the relative
price of foreign to home bundles of goods, ep/p, with the foreign price

level p set equal to unity. An assumption of purchasing—power—parity
(PPP) would impose constancy on e/p, as e follows exactly the path of

p/ .

This

assumption has not held in the 1970s, but we will see below

that it may be a reasonable description of the average long—run path of e.—

—'See Katseli (1979) and Frenkel (198la) for the breakdown of PPP in the
1970s.

The exogenous shift factor z represents real events such as changes
in tastes or technology, oil discoveries, etc., that increase net exports
(in foreign exchange terms) for a given value of e/p. Thus we write
X

= x(elp,z);

X

With the reduced—form expression for e and the exports function both

included, the dynamic equation for F is now

(7)

=

X[e(F,M;B)/p,z]

+ F

15.

The variable B is not of interest here. N and z are exogenous to the
dynamic system given by (6) and (7). F and p are the slowly—adjusting
state variables, and e can jump in the short—run in response to changes
in F and N.

II.C.2

Long—run Equilibrium

The long—run equilibrium Conditions are

and

= 0 in equations

(6) and (7). The implication for long—run movements in p have already
been assumed. The price level moves proportionately to changes in N.
The effect of an increase in z is more interesting. From (7), an

increase in z initially generates a current—account surplus, F > 0
As F accumulates, e falls as shown in the short—run comparative statics.
This reduces X and f' .

When X has fallen to its initial value, t

is

still positive, since F has increased. Therefore e must fall further,
until the reduction in X just outweighs the increase in F.

Thus

because income on foreign assets is part of the current—account balance,
the exchange rate must appreciate enough to offset the original increase
in z plus the increase in investment income due to accumulation of F
between equilibria.

16.

This

is

the "super Marshall—Lerner" condition in Branson (1977). Xe is
positive and eF is negative. Their product is the effect of F accumulation on X, through the normal Narshall—Lerner effect. This must be
large enough to offset the effect of rising F or F to ensure stability.
If this super Narshall—Lerner condition holds, this system moves
towards its long—run equilibrium monotonically after a disturbance to

N or z. This can be seen from the form of the stability matrix SM in (8).
The roots of the system that govern its dynamics are simply the diagonal

elements, both real and negative. This insures monotonic stability.—'

—'I did not see this when I said in Branson (1977, 1979a) that adjustment
is not necessarily inonotonic.

Thus the super—Narshall—Lerfler stability condition insures long—run

stability. Thus reassured, we can move on to describe adjustment in
reaction to monetary shocks on N or real shocks to z.

17.

II.D. The Effect of a Monetary Disturbance
The analysis of short—run comparative statics of section II.B
and of the dynamic adjustment in section II.C, can now be combined to

study the effect of monetary disturbances. We will follow the path of
adjustment of the exchange rate following a one—time shift arising in

the monetary sector. Such a disturbance could originate on the supply
side, owing to a shift in monetary policy or the supply behaviour of
the banking svsten, or on the demand side, owing to a shift in the

public's demand for money. A sudden decrease in the demand for money,
at initial values for exchange rates and interest rates, should produce
the same results as an increase in the supply of money, due to monetary

policy, for example. In the discussion below, we will focus on the example of an increase in the money supply (expansionary open—market

operation). The result would be equally applicable in the event of a
reduction in money demand.

We begin with the effects on the domestic price path of a monetary

shift. This is the underlying path about which the exchage rate is mo:—
ing as the current account adjusts. Then we move on to study the impact
and adjustment effects on the exchange rate, relative to the price path.

Following equation (6), the price level will rise in response to
the excess level of real balances, moving to a new equilibrium where the
price level has increased proportionately to the increase in the money

supply. This is shown in Figure 2. The domestic price level begins at
an initial equilibrium value p*(O), indexed to 1.0 at time t(0). It rises
**
to a new equilibrium value p , where dp/p dN/M. This is the price

path around which the exchange rate e adjusts.

Next we turn to the path of exchange-rate adjustment. We begin
with the system in full equilibrium, with the current account balance
zero, so that X(e/p,z)

—rF, with given initial stocks of M, B, and F.

We want to trace the path of the exchange rate following an initial in-

crease in the money supply, through an open—market operation. To avoid
the second—order complications that came from a reallocation of investment income on foreign assets between the private sector and the government if the open—market operation is done in the foreign exchange market,

we will focus on the case where AB = —LN: an open—market operation in

government debt. Again, the effects of a downward shift in the demand
for money would be the same. The result of a contraction of supply or
increase in demand would be symmetrically opposite.

The initial effect of the increase in the money stock is an upward

jump in the exchange rate, to maintain asset market equilibrium. This
is the increase shown in Table 1. Figure 3 shows the adjustment path of
the exchange rate, superimposed on the price path of Figure 2. Initially,
e* and

are normalized to 1.0. The increase in the money stock pushes

the exchange rate up to e1 instantaneously. The next step is to trace
the dynamic adjustment path as net foreign assets accumulate.

At e1 in Figure 3, the price ratio (e/P) has risen above the eIP*
value that gave F = 0 at the original value of F at time t(0). In the
initial equilibrium at t(O), the current account balance was zero.

After the increase in the money supply, with F still at F(O), the price
ratio rises to e1/P*) >

(e*/P*).

Assuming the Marshall—Lerner condition

holds, the movement on the price ratio increases net exports, so that the
current account becomes positive at t(0), and net foreign assets F be-

gins to accumulate. As F increases, e falls and X falls, following the
dynamic adjustment path discussed in section II.C, and shown in Figure 3.
With F accumulating, at a decreasing rate since the current account
surplus is shrinking, the exchange rate follows the e(t) path in Figure 3

converging toward the rising p(t) path. At the point t(i) where the
* *
paths cross, the price ratio elp is the same as the original e /p = 1.
This implies that at the crossing point t(i) where e(t) =

p(t),

net ex-

ports have fallen to their original value. But since F has accumulated
in the interval between t(0) and t(i), the current account balance is
positive at t(i) due to the increase in investment income from rF(O) to

rF(i). Thus, at t(i), where e(i) =

p(i),

F is still accumulating and e

must fall further. It falls until the price ratio e/p reaches the valu—
where X(e/p,z) = —rF once again. At that point the current account balance is zero, and the adjustment process is completed. There has been
an accumulation of foreign assets and a concomitant increase in investment income, and the ratio e/p has decreased so that the net export deficit just offsets the investment income in the balance on current account.

II.E. The Effect of a Real Disturbance (in z)
Let us now consider the effect of an increase in the current—account
balance due to exogenous real factors, represented by z in the net export

function. Beginning from an initial equilibrium, the current account
balance suddenly increases, making F positive.

Foreign assets accumu-

late, since the current—account surplus is net foreign investment.

The

accunnilation of F drives e down; the real exchange rate appreciates.

This in turn reduces the current account surplus.
Movement of e around the original (and unchanged)

equilibrium p

is shown in Figure 4. The increase in z at time t(O) makes F positive.
This causes e to begin to fall (an appreciation). At some point t(j), e
has fallen enough to restore X to its initial value, but because F has

accumulated, e must fall farther. It falls to the new value **
e where
the current—account balance is again zero. The appreciation of the real
exchange rate e/p must reduce X enough to offset the initial impulse
from Z plus the accumulation of F between equilibria.

II.F. Conclusions from the Theory with Static Expectations.
The patterns of relationships between the key variables as the

system is disturbed by random monetary and real shocks can be summarized

easily. Since we are assuming static expectations, it does not matter
whether disturbances are anticipated.

1. Monetary disturbances cause an initial jump in the
nominal and real exchange rates, which is reversed

as the accumulation dynamics take over. The long—run
effect of any single shock is a movement in the real
exchange rate e/p due to the change in the foreign as-

set position between equilibria. If monetary shocks
are repetitive and random, this will produce random
movement in the real exchange rate, related to F.

2. Real disturbances to the current account, represented
by z, will cause a gradual adjustment of e relative to

p, with static expectations. The adjustment must not
only offset the initial effect on X from dz, but also
offset the resulting accumulation of F.

If real dis-

turbances are repetitive and random, this will also
generate random movement in the real exchange rate.
3.

Current—account surpluses will generally be associated

with an appreciating currency, and deficits with a depreciating currency, under either source of disturbance.

26.

4. The PPP path /p will be the long—run average around
which the exchange rate e moves as the system is hit

by monetary or real disturbances. The PPP path does
not determine short—run movements in e, but may serve
as a

long—run anchor in the absence of "permanentt

structural change.

27.

III. Rational Expectations and the Current Account

III.A. Introduction
In section II we saw that with static expectations the nominal and
real exchange rates adjust gradually to a current—account disturbance.
The path of the exchange rate follows the accumulation path of net for-

eign assets. Technically, the exchange rate can be solved in short—run
equilibrium as a function of the levels of the asset stocks. This was
possible because the assumption of static expectations eliminates the
term in expected change in the exchange rate ê from the asset—demand
functions.

When we move to the assumption of rational expectations, we restore
the ê term, and obtain a separate equation for the path of the exchange

rate. This will result in a model with two dynamic equations——for F and
ê. The rational expectations assumption——here literally perfect foresight because the model is non—stochastic——imposes the condition that
the expected change in the rate is the actual change.
The main characteristic of the rational expectations version of the

model is that since the market looks ahead to the consequences of a current account disturbance, the exchange rate jumps at the time when the

change is perceived. Some of the gradual adjustment of e is pulled
forward into a jump in the present with rational expectations.
In the next subsection we go through the technical aspects of solu-

tion of the rational expectations version of the model. Then, using the
basic diagram in Figure 8 below, in subsection III.C we will discuss the

28.

implications of the model for the effects of current—account disturbances on the nominal and real exchange rates.

III.B. Solution of the Model
The model begins with the original equations for the financial
sector plus the dynamic adjustment equation

for $'.

These are repeated

here for convenient reference.

(1)

M =

m(r,

+ )W

(2)

B =

b(r,

r + e).W

(3) eF =

f(r,

+ e)

(4)
(7)

W=M+B+eF
=

X(e/p)

+ rF.

The dynamics with separate equations for ê and '

are sufficiently compli-

cated that in this section we will suspend the

equation and take p as

the
exogenous. This will permit us to focus on the relationship between

current—account and the exchange rate (real and nominal).
Solution of the model proceeds as follows.

First, the rational

expectations assumption is that ê is the rate of change of e. Then two
equations of (i)—(3), with wealth

substituted from (4) can be used to

solve for r and 8 as functions of N, W, eF. The ê and F equations then

are two dynamic equations in e
in these two variables.

and F that can be solved for the movement

29.

Divide equations (1) and (3) by W and differentiate totally, holding
r constant:

M

d(—) = m dr + m,de
W
r
e

d(L)
W =

f r dr

+ fdê
e

These can be solved in matrix form as:

r

(d

rme mrfê) Lm

f:J

The solution for dê is then
=

y {_md()

+

The coefficients of eF/W and M/W are the partial derivatives of the ê
adjustment function.

1>0;2<0.
This is the dynamic equation to be solved along with (5) for F to obtain
equilibrium e and F.

In the e, F space of Figure 5, the ê = 0 locus is a rectangular

hyperbola. This can be seen by observing that in q, eF enter multiplica—
tively (in W as well as the numerator eF), so changes in e and F that

hold the product eF constant will hold ê constant. Combinations of e and
F off the locus move e away from it, as the arrows show. for example,
since

e

The F = 0 locus in Figure 6 gives e, F pairs from equation (7) that

hold F constant. Total differentiation of (7) gives the slope

F=O

e

Combinations off the F = 0 locus move F away from it. In (7) we see that
an increase in F from a point on F = 0 results in F > 0.

The equilibrium is shown in Figure 7. With the F = 0 locus flatter
than ê =

0, the equilibrium is a sadd1epoint." There is one path into

the equilibrium point, shown as the dotted line. Any initial e, F choice
will lead away from equilibrium, as indicated in the figure. A basic
assumption in rational—expectations models is that following a disturbance
the market will pick the value for e that puts the system on the stable
path to the equilibrium.

If the F = 0 locus is steeper than ê =

0, the system is completely

unstable. The slope of F = 0 is _rIXe, and since

= 0 is a rectangular

hyperbola, its slope is given by
de

dFé=O

=_eF

Saddle—point equilibrium therefore requires

-< -.X
F

Since along t

e

= 0,

rF = X, this condition for stability in the rational—

expectations version of the model is the ordinary Marshall—Lerner condition,
>

1.

If this condition holds, following a disturbance the exchange

rate will initially move in the right direction.

31a

Now consider the effect of an increase in z, the real current—account
disturbance in (5) for f.

In

Figure 8 the rise in z shifts the f

0

locus down. Why? The rise in z requires an offsetting fall in e or F
in equation (5) to hold '

=0

.

The new long—run equilibrium is at point

E2, with a saddle path running to it as indicated by the dashed line. To
put the system immediately on that path with initial F0, the market appre—

dates the currency from E0 to point E1 in a jump.

Then the e, F dynamics

carry the system to E2, with F accumulating and e appreciating further.

33.

Referring back to the financial market equations (l)—(4), we see
that the jump in e reduces eF, while the expectation of further appreciation, ê <

0, reduces demand for eF. Thus the jump in e is needed

to maintain market equilibrium with (rational) expectations of appreciation of e in the adjustment process.

In the new long—run equilibrium e has fallen relative to p enough
to offset the effect of the exogenous disturbance z on net exports X
plus the increase in foreign earnings r(F2—F0).

Thus the real distur-

bance to the current account causes an adjustment in the real exchange
rate e/p that comes in an initial jump, then a continued gradual move—
inent to long—view equilibrium.

The same figure can be used to analyze the effects of an (exogenous)

change in the domestic price level p. A fall in p (relative to the foreign price level) will shift the P = 0 locus down by stimulating net ex-

ports. This will then give a

jump appreciation from E0 to E1,

and fur-

ther appreciation to E2. Again, the value of the real exchange rate at
is lower than it was at the initial equilibrium, in order to increase
the trade deficit enough to offset the rise in investment income
r(F2—F.).

III.C. Current Account Disturbances and Exchange Rate Fluctuati2
The important implication of the rational
the necessary precision with which the

expectations model is not

market chooses the saddle point

path. Rather, it is the result that disturbances with foreseeable implications for the exchange rate will cause

the rate to jump when the dis-

turbance appears. Thus in addition to jumps when unanticipated changes

34.

in monetary policy appear, their rate will jump in reaction to real
disturbances to the current—account balance.

This modifies the conclusion from section II concerning real dis-

turbances and the exchange rate. An unanticipated increase in the
current account balance creates an expectation of appreciation of the
nominal and real exchange rate to move the current account back to

equilibrium. The expectation itself causes a jump appreciation of the
nominal rate, which is also an appreciation of the real rate. After
the jump, there is further movement to long—run equilibrium.

Thus unanticipated changes in the current account balance, as well
as the money stock, are likely to generate jumps in the exchange rate.
In the case of the current account, the jump is not reversed, however.
If disturbances are random, we still expect the exchange rate to fluc-

tuate around the PPP path. This would make the real exchange rate roughly
follow a random walk. Jacob Frenkel (l981b) provides evidence supporting
this view.

In addition, major structural shifts in the world economy, such as
the recovery of Europe and Japan after World War II, or the rise of the

newly industrializing countries (NICs) in the developing world, would b—

expected to cause permanent shifts in the equilibrium real rate. In
Branson (1980) it is argued that the major real devaluation of the
U.S. dollar in the l970s resulted from the change in the structure of
the system as Europe and Japan recovered and grew relative to the U.S.

35.

IV.

IV.A.

The Data
Introduction.

The asset—market model of sections II and III implies that unanticipated movements in the money stock, the current—account

balance, and rela-

tive price levels will cause unanticipated jumps in the exchange rate. In
this and the following two sections of the paper, we show that the model is
consistent with the data on these variables for four major currencies——the
U.S. dollar, the Deutschemark, sterling, and the yen.

We study movements

in the effective exchange rate of each of these countries, as calculated
by the IMP. For each country, movements in the effective rate are related to

movements in Ml or M3, the balance on current account, and an index of

relative prices, measured by the Wholesale Price Index and weighted by the

IMF. The data are described in detail in Table 2.
The first step in analyzing the data is to investigate their time—

series properties. This provides a compact description of the "facts,'t and
an initial indication of whether the facts are roughly consistent with the

theory. The time—series analysis of the data is done in this section.
Then in section V we focus on the PPP relationship between relative prices

and exchange rates. In section VI we study systems of vector autoregressions, one for each country, to test the relations between unanticipated
changes, or "innovations," in the variables.

IV.B. Time Series Analysis.
In this section the autoregressive structure

of each time series is

described by regression equations of the form:

III. Data
1. All data are quarterly, from IMP sources (in most cases from IFS) and
cover 1973:IV to 1980:IV.

2. Exchange Rates: e is the log of the average effective exchange rate
during quarter t. The units are foreign currency per unit of domestic
currency. The index is based on a geometrically weighted average of
bilateral rates between the home and 13 other industrial countries.
The weights are the same as those used to calculated P/P.
Base:
1975 = 100. Source: IMF. Note that these are not the MERN rates published in IFS.

3. Relative Prices: The index is a log of the ratio of home to foreign
quarterly wholesale prices indices.
P is a composite and uses the
same weights as e does (see above). Base = 1975. Source: IMF. This
index is not the same as that published in the IFS. Our data is based
on indices in local (not a common) currency.

4. Money: This is the log of the end of the quarter money stock. Source:
IFS, line 34 ("money") for Ml, lines 34 and 35 ("money" + "quasi—money")

for M3.

5.

Current Account: This is the dollar value of the flow during the quarter
(not measured in logs). Source: IFS. Lines: 77aa (Merchandise: Exports,
fob); 77ab (Merchandise:Imports, fob); 77ac (Other Goods, Services, and
Income: Credits); 77ad (Other Goods, Services, and Income: Debits); 77ae
(Private Unrequited Transfers); 77ag (Official Unrequited Transfers).

whereX is the log of the time series under consideratiofl,Xt_± is its value
lagged i quarters, D1 is a seasonal dummy, and t is time. Equation (10)
is a univariate autoregression of the variable X on its own past values,
and the estimated values of the a coefficients give the pattern of response

of the time series to a disturbance u. The two cases that will appear in
is significant, and

our data are first—order autoregression, where only

second—order autoregression, where a, and a2 are significant.

One purpose

of the analysis is simply to describe the data; the second is to see if
the time—series structure of the exchange—rate data is consistent with that

of the money, current account, and relative price data.
For each variable we began with a regression on four lags, seasonal

dummies, and a time trend. We then shortened the lags by eliminating insignificant variables at the far end of the lag.
in Tables 3 through 6, one for each country.

The results are shown

Each column in the tables

shows the results of a regression of the indicated variable on lagged

values of itself. Coefficients of the time trend and seasonal dummies
are not shown. The regressions are performed

on quarterly data for the

period 1974—I to 1980—IV. The beginning date was chosen because it was
after the major period of disequilibrium adjustment

in 1971—73, including

the
a major real devaluation of the U.S. dollar [see Branson (1980fl, and

last date was the most recent for which

data were available when we began

the study in June 1981.

regressions for the log of the U.S. nominal effective exchange rate e,
weighted by the IMF, in foreign currency per dollar. The first column
shows the regression with four lags on the exchange rate; only the lag

at t—l is significant with a coefficient of 0.86. When the lags
at t—2 through t—4 are eliminated, the standard error of the estimated
equation falls a bit, and the coefficient of ei is 0.78. Thus the U.S.
effective rate, measured on a quarterly average, can be described as a

stable first—order autoregression (AR1). The

coefficient of 0.78 in e1

indicates that a given disturbance u will eventually disappear from the
time series as its effect is given by increasing powers of .78:

Le =

.78u;

Le+i =

.782u,

etc. The "half—life" of the disturbance is

just over 3 quarters.—'

The third and fourth columns of Table 3 show the results for the log
of the U.S. relative price index P/P.

This is an index of the U.S. WPI

relative to a weighted average of the WPI's of thirteen other industrial

countries. The variable P/eP is the IMF's measure of relative cost, published in the International Financial

Statistics. It is the inverse of the

"real exchange rate" of sections II and III.

The first regression for P/P in Table 3 gives significant coefficients

to the lags at t—l and t—2. Elimination of the longer lags results in the
second equation, with a standard error only slightly larger than the first.

_/The "half—life" is the time needed for the initial disturbance to be reduced to half its initial size. It can be computed from

in 0.5 —0.69 =
where

in this case is .078 and t is the half—life.

40.

The result for P/P is a second—order autoregression (AR2), with a stable
cyclical response to a disturbance.—'

The next two pairs of columns in Table 3 show the univariate auto-

regression results for the two U.S. money stocks. In both cases only the
lag at t—l is significant. Both are stable first—order autocorrelations
with half—lives of 1.5 and 3 quarters, respectively.
Finally, the last two columns in Table 3 show the autoregressions

for the current—account balance. These are run on the level of CAB,

rather than its log, since the time series passes through zero. The

result

is similar to that for the money stocks: a first—order autocor—

relation with a half—life of 3—1/2 quarters.
In the case of the U.S., then, money stocks, the balance on current

account, and the nominal effective exchange rate all follow stable AR1

processes, while the relative price series is a cyclical AR2. This suggests that the behavior of money stocks, the current—account balance, and
the exchange rate are consistent, at this level, with the theoretical

model of sections II and III. These variables all follow stable MU processes. However, the relationship between relative price levels and the
exchange rate is more complicated. The relative price series exhibits
cyclical behavior while the exchange rate is monotonically damped.

_/The characteristic equation is given by
— 1.36

+ 0.60 '"—2 = 0.

The roots of this equation are .68

0.77

=

0.61/2

.371, with a modulus of

41.

Thus there is not a one—to—one correspondence between price and exchange
rate fluctuations, even in the 1974—80 period.

IV.C.2. West Germany.
Table 4 shows the univariate autoregression results for Germany. The
format is exactly the same as for the U.S., so the discussion can be brief.

As in the U.S. case, the nominal effective rate, the money stocks,
and the balance on current account all follow ARI processes in Germany.

All but M3 are stable. German N3 has a lag coefficient of unity, indicating that it is a "random walk": the change in M3 is (roughly) white noise.

The German relative price series is AR2 with a stable cyclical response to

disturbances.—' Thus the German data are quite similar to the U.S.

IV.C.3. United Kingdom
The U.K. results are summarized in Table 5. Again, the results are
broadly similar to those for the U.S. and Germany, with one major excep-

tion. In the first regression for the current—account balance, there are
no significant lag terms. Thus the U.K. CAB is best described as random
around the path described by the trend and seasonal dummy terms. This suggests that innovations in the CAB in the U.K. should not be interpreted as
conveying information about future movements in the exchange rate.—' This
implication is reinforced by the vector autoregression results in section
VI below.

/Note that the German price equation would not invert due to multico—
linearity with more than two lags.
IA moving average specification of the equation for the U.K. CAB was also
experimented with, with no improvement in results. The U.K. CAB does
seem to be random about its trend.

Both the nominal effective rate and the Ml money stock in the U.K.
have coefficients of unity on the t—l lag, indicating that they follow a

random walk. The relative price series is again AR2, but with a stable
monotonic adjustment response to disturbances.

IV.C.4. Japan
The results for Japan are summarized in Table 6. There we see major
differences from the other three countries. The nominal effective exchange
rate, the relative price series, and the current—account balance are all

AR2 with stable cyclical response patterns. The two money stocks are AR1

with

unitary lag coefficients. Thus in the Japanese case the time—series

behavior of the exchange rate is consistent with that of relative prices
and the current account, but the exchange rate does not follow the random—
walk pattern of money.

IV.D. Summary on the Data
The univariate autoregressions of Tables 3 through 6 provide a use-

ful and compact description of the "facts." Comparing the country results,
we see several common points.

1. All weighted relative price series are second—order
autoregressions with stable responses to shocks. All
but the U.K. series are cyclical.

2. All the money stocks are first—order autoregressions, many
with unitary lag coefficients.

3. All the exchange rate and current—account series except
the Japanese are first—order autoregressions; the

Japanese are second—order. Thus movements in the exchange

V. Purchasing Power Parity
Before moving on to a vector autoregression analysis of the data for
the four countries, it is interesting to look directly at the relation—

ship between exchange rates and relative prices. The IMP data comparing
costs and prices provide us with effective exchange rates, e, and weighted

relative WPIs using the same weighting system. Thus we can report regressions testing whether exchange rates followed relative price paths for

the four countries in the 1974—80 period. These are summarized in Table 7.
In the table, we report regressions of the log of the effective rate
on a constant, a time trend, and the log of the effective relative WPI.

To allow for simultaneity between prices and exchange rates, the PIP
term was replaced by an instrumental variable estimate, and the equations
were adjusted for first—order serial correlation in the error terms.
If PPP held at all times, the coefficient of
and

time

would be zero,

that of P/P would be (—1) in Table 7. In no case does this pair of

conditions

hold. The closest case is the U.S., where the coefficient of

P/P is — 1.09, but that of time is marginally significant.

Even

ignoring the difference between the AR1 in the exchange rate and AR2
in P/P, PPP is violated in the U.S. case during 1974—80 by a divergent

trend between e and P/P. This could be due to measurement biases. In
Branson (1980), it was shown that the major jump in the real exchange
rate for the U.S. came in 1970—73; after 1974 a steady trend seems to be
the dominant factor.

A Cochrane—Orcutt iterative technique with a two—stage least—squares
estimation method was used; the instruments are lagged exchange rates,
and lag—one and lag—two PIP,aconstant, time, and seasonal dummies.

48.

In

the U.K. and Japan, the coefficients of P/P are well above unity,

and quite significantly so in the U.K. case. The U.K. also has a very
significant time trend. In Germany, neither the time trend nor P/P is
significant. This is consistent with Frenkel's (1981b) finding that the
real exchange rate is AR1.

The regressions of Table 7 thus suggest that since 1974 a deviation—
from—trend version of PPP may have held in the U.S., but that the relation-

ship did not hold in the other three countries. This is consistent with
the theoretical view of section II that the relative price path is at most
a long—run average through the path of nominal exchange rates, even in
periods of largely monetary disturbances.

49.

VI. Empirical Results Using Vector Autoregression
A useful technique for studying the relationships between the innovations in money, the current account balance, relative price levels and

the exchange rate is vector autoregression (VAR). Here each variable of
a system is regressed against the lagged values of all variables (including
itself) in the system, to extract any information existing in the move-

ments of these variables. The residuals from these "vector autoregressions"
are the innovations ——

the

unanticipated movements ——

in

the variables. We can

study the correlations of the residuals to see if they are consistent with the
hypotheses implied by the theory of section III. The vector autoregression
technique is introduced and justified by Sims (1980). A clear exposition

is presented in Sargent (1979). Interesting and instructive applications
are discussed in Taylor (logo), Ashenfelter and Card (1981), and Fischer
(1981).

Here I estimate systems of VARs for each of the four countries, the
U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan. Two systems are estimated for each country.
Both include the effective exchange rate e, the current account balance CAB, and
the effective relative price P/F; the difference

between the two is that one

includes Ml and the other M3. An obvious extension of the research would be
to include cross—country effects, particularly

of money stocks, but also the

other variables. The difficulty in proceeding in this direction comes from
the limited number of quarterly observations:

28 from 1974 I to 1980 IV.

Each VAR includes lagged values of four variables, a time trend, and three

seasonal dummies. In order to expand the analysis, I am presently moving to
a monthly data base.

Before estimating the VARs, one must consider the issue of the timing

of the data. The effective exchange rate can be computed from public

50.

information on a daily basis. In fact, a UK effective rate is published

daily in the Financial Times. Our data are averages during the quarter.
Money stock data are available on a weekly basis, so they are roughly

contemporaneous with the exchange rate data. Our money data are end—of—
period. We would expect from section II that the weekly changes in M would
generate nearly simultaneous movements in e.

Thus the innovation of the

average e over a quarter would be most closely connected in our data with
the innovation of the end—of—quarter money stock, which is the cumulation
of the weekly innovations.

The relative price data are quarterly averages of monthly data, which

become known soon after the month finishes. Thus in our data set, the innovation in e would be most closely connected to the innovation in
On the other hand, the data on the quarterly balance in current account

are not announced until well into the following quarter. Thus to the extent
that the innovation in CAB signals a change in the equilibrium real exchange
rate, it is the innovation in CABt

1

that moves e.

The VAR residuals to be correlated, then, are those of

CABt1. We will use a

e, Mt,

and

to designate residuals from the VARs. The variables

in each VAR system are listed in Table 9. The number of lags included in
each variable was determined by the univariate autogression of Tables 3

through 6. This constraint provides a convenient way to limit the number of
regressors and conserve degrees of freedom. A next step in research would be
to re—estimate the VAR systems with additional lags to see how much infor—
mation is lost by application of this constraint.

After the VAR systems are estimated, we correlate their residuals to

study the relationship among innovations. The correlations of the exchange—

rate residuals with those of the VARs for money, CAB, and relative prices

are shown in Tables 10 and 11 for the systems using Ml and M3 respectively.
Each rot..' in the tables gives the correlation coefficient r of the exchange—

rate VAR residual with the VAR residuals of the other three variables.

Given the definition of the effective exchange rate as foreign exchange per
unit of home currency, we expect the money correlations to be negative —— a
positive M innovation lends to a depreciation ——

the CAB correlations to be

positive,and the P/P correlations to be negative.

In Table 10, which presents the correlations using Ml, the first column shows the correlations of exchange rate and money stock residuals for

each country. We see that only for the U.S. is the sign of the correlation
negative. The positive correlations for the U.K. and Germany, and the near—
zero are for Japan, are consistent with "leaning—against—the—wind" policy
behavior, in which money growth slows when the currency depreciates, and

vice versa. This type of policy reaction was discussed in Branson (1976),
and policy reaction functions of this form were estimated for Germany by

Artus (1976) and by Branson, Haittunen and Masson (1977). So the positive
correlation in the German case is easy to understand. Similar policy behavior in Japan has been reported in Amano (1979), which could account for
the low Japanese Ml correlation. A U.K. policy of mo;iig tI'e minimum lending rates to defend the currency would also be consistent with the positive

U.K. Ml correlation in Table 10. When sterling depreciates, interest rates
are raised and the rate of money growth is reduced.

The pattern of money correlations in Tables 10 and 11 reflects an
asymmetry in policy behavior between the U.S. and the other three countries.
If U.S. monetary policy Is formulated with domestic targets in mind, then

U.S. money will be exogenous with respect to the exchange rate. This is
the model of sections II and III, and gives the negative correlation. But
monetary policy in the U.K., Germany, and Japan may be reacting to movements

in the exchange rate, which would give a positive correlation. Thus the re—
suits are consistent with a view that U.S. monetary policy drives exchange
rates, and the others react.

The CAB correlations should be positive, according to the theory of

section III. It should be noted that since we are correlating the VAR re-

siduals of e with CABt1, the positive correlation will not reflect "J—
curve" effects in which a current depreciation in e causes a reduction in

CAB due to low trade elasticities. The small negative correlation in the
case of the UK CAB is consistent with the univariate autoregression results
of Table 5. There we saw that the IlK CAB is approximately random about its
trend, so that innovations in CAB do not contain any information about future

movements in the real exchange rate. Thus the expected correlation for the
UK CAB should be zero, which it approximately is.
The P/P correlations should be negative from the theory of section III

where causation runs from P/P to e. However, they would also be negative if
causation ran from e to P/P through the price of traded goods. Empirical evidence on the importance of this link is presented in Bruno (1978). Thus the
negative correlations for P/P for the U.S., U.K., and Germany are consistent
with the theory of section III, but could also result from reverse causation.
Estimation of the relative strengths of the two effects will require more

sophisticated econometrics. The positive correlation in the Japanese case
is difficult to understand. The explanation may lie in the divergent behavior of export prices and the WPI in Japan, but analysis of that case will
also require further work.

55.

The correlation results of the systems using M3 are given in Table 11.

They are essentially the same as the Ml results of Table 10. The correlation of the U.K. current—account balance is nearly zero, but the positive
correlation for Japanese relative prices is larger than in Table 10.

In suumary, it appears that the VAR results are (perhaps surprisingly)

quite consistent with the theory of section III, which attempts to integrate
money, relative prices, and the current—account balance into one framework

explaining movements in exchange rates. The results are clearest for the
effects of CAB innovations on exchange rates, supporting Dornbusch (1980).
The money causation is less clear because of the plausibility of money
reacting continuously to movements in e as suggested in Branson (1976).

The relative price results are consistent with the theory but causation remains ambiguous due to dependence of domestic prices of traded goods on the

exchange rate as shown by Bruno (1978). Thus the empirical results provide
support for the theory, but there is much more econometric research to be
done.
