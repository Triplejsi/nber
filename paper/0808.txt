Union Effects: Wages, Turnover, and Job Training
ABS TRACT

This study explores the existence of a net union premium and of the

extent of rationing by quality of the resulting excess supply. The net
union premium was estimated by relating changes in wages to changes in
union status of the same worker in longitudinal panels (NLS and MID), and
by two

cross—section wage level regressions, a "prospective't and "retrospective"

which permit

more direct observation of selectivity in hiring. Over a

half of the cross—section differential of over 20% for the "same" (standardized) worker is a net union rent and much of the rest reflects a quality
adjustment in hiring, as measured by wages. This conclusion was less reliable
for older workers.
Subsequent analysis explores the effects of successful union wage
pressure on: quit rates, fringe benefits, wage profiles, and training.
The reduction in quit of union joiners depends on the size of the

net wage premium. Quit rate differentials are also positively related to
the gross, cross—section wage differentials within groups of workers,
classified by location and occupation, less so by industry.

In Section 4, it is hypothesized that the imposition of larger fixed
labor costs (such as fringes) helps to deter employers from preferring
reductions in hours to reductions in men, and it helps to stabilize employment in the face of fluctuating demand, by a more frequent use of overtime

and of temporary layoffs in the union sector. This hypothesis links the
size of fringe benefits to the union wage gain. An analysis of firms in
70 industries confirms this link.

Union pressure is exerted on the whole tenure profile of wages. The
explicit linking of wage levels to seniority reduces

investment

incentives for worker

in general (transferable) training. The total volume of training

is indeed reported to be smaller in union jobs, and this is consistent with
the flatter profile.

Union Effects: Wages, Turnover, and Job Training

Introduction

Growing numbers of empirical studies confirm the prevalence of the following
features which distinguish unionized from non—unionized labor markets:

(1) Higher

wages (2)A larger share of fringe benefits in total compensation (3) Lower quit

rates and lesser turnover, and (4) Flatter age—profiles of wages. These findings
appear to hold both in the aggregate, as when more unionized industries are

compared with less or non-unionized, and in micro-data where a variety of
variables are used to control for personal and, less frequently, firm characteristics which might affect these differences.

Traditionally, economists have been concerned with the relative wage and

much less the employment impact of unionism, just as they have been concerned
with price—quantity impacts of product monopolies. On the other hand, students
of industrial relations tend to emphasize non-wage aspects of unionism in the

work setting. Some time ago (1958) H.G. Lewis dichotomized aspects of unionism
into "monopolistic" and "competitive". In the first category are the imposition
of wages above competitive levels,either by union restriction of supply or by

threats of strikes implicit in collective bargaining. In the second are all those
activities of unions and work rules espoused by unions which need not be in-

consistent with competitive wage—setting. However, these "two faces" of unionism
do not correspond to wage and non—wage aspects of unionism: union induced non—
wage conditions may also impose higher costs on employers, inconsistent with competi-

tion. Conversely,unjon—nonunjon wage differentials need not reflect monopoly rents,

but may be merely compensatory, reflecting a faster and more regimented pace of
work (Duncan and Stafford, 1980) or higher quality of workers in unionized jobs.
The wage—push hypothesis receives almost little or no attention in analyses of other
features of unionized labor markets listed in the first paragraph. Thus with "voice", as a

substitute for "exit", unionized workers quit less frequently than others. With
longer expected stay, the probability of receiving initially non-vested pensions
increases, hence larger pensions (a major part of fringe benefits) are demanded

by union workers. Other explanations of larger union fringes run
democracy

which favors the older worker to union management of pension funds

of power. Finally, the flatter union wage profile is seen as
result of union egalitarian or bureaucratic compression of the wage structure.

Although some or all of these hypotheses may be valid, it is

to

the union wage pressure as a source, if not necessarily an exclusive one

of all of the features I have enumerated. It is the purpose of the present study
to test this proposition empirically.

1. Union Wage Gains
Before I proceed to explore the effects of union wage pressure on turnover, fringe
benefits, and wage profiles, it is necessary to establish that unions indeed

succeed in pushing their wages above competitive levels. A large literature
(see review by Parsley, 1980) answers this question positively, by observing
a differential in favor of union members after controlling for a large number

of worker personal characteristics in wage level regressions. However, unmeasured differences in labor quality may still be responsible for part or all

of the wage gap. The question is whether, indeed, the same worker, and not
merely his statistical surrogate, receives higher wages in union

union employment.

If the existence of a net union wage gain is confined in

this

fashion, we

would expect its size to be smaller than the cross—sectionally observed union

wage differential. This is because above equi1ibrimi wages imply queues on the
supply side which must be rationed.1 Only in the case of probabilistic rationing

reduce the increase in labor costs imposed by the union by systematic rationing,

that is by hiring more productive workers from the queue. The increase in labor
costs cannot, however, be completely offset in this fashion partly because the

marginal cost of screening for quality is positive and because of technological

constraints in the production function. Moreover, where unions have a voice in
hiring, as in the closed shop and in union hiring halls, there are no obvious
incentives for upgrading of labor quality, and rationing is largely probabilistic.

Rationing by price (in corrupt unions) or by discrimination and nepotism is outlawed, in principle, but its existence cannot be excluded.

The empirical analysis described below relies on observing wages received by
the same worker before and after his change of union status. This approach was

used most recently by Duncan and Stafford (1980)2and, thus far, most comprehensively

by Wesley Mellow (1981). Duncan and Stafford observed wage changes of a small
sample of union joiners between 1968 ar

In the work to be described I pooled the MID sample in order to relate annual
changes in wages of white men over the 10—year period 1968—1978 to changes in their

union status. Since the NLS panels contain information on union status

this single interval for the same analysis on the

two NLS panels of young white men (who were 17-27 years old in 1969) and older
white men (who were 48—64 in 1969). The MID contains all ages, but as in the NLS,
I limited the sample to non—students and to a maximum age of 64. For (partial)
comparability with the NLS, I also stratified the MID panel into young (less than
30) and older (30—64) stthsamples.

did not use the less adequate telephone survey of 1970 which also contained
questions on union status.

The statistical analysis relies on wage functions, where the dependent
variable is the logarithm of hourly earnings, and the independent variables
are education (Ed), experience (x)
(T)

and its square (x2), length of job tenure

and its square (T2), marital status (Mar), health status (Hith), local (Lun)

and national unemployment rate (Nun) .

These

are the "standardizing" variables.

The main focus is on the additional (dmmiy) variables tJij, where i and j index

the first and second period, and have values
and

1, union membership. Thus Uoo means non—union both years, U01 = union

joiner (between the first and second survey), U = union

leaver, and U11 =

union stayer. These four union status categories were also cross-classified
by mover-stayer status, and for movers by form of separation (quit, layoff)
and whether moved within or between industries.
Wage level equations were used separately for the first and second year

bracketing the changes.1 Both equations contain the same union dtmmies. Thus
in "year 1" equations, the dimimies indicate prospective changes (or continuation)

of union status, while in "year 2" they indicate recent change. Both are useful
in exploring selectivity in hiring. The specification of wage change equations
is derived by taking first-differences of the variables in the level equations.

Thus the experience variable becomes tx

T equals 1 for job stayers but becomes negative (—T, where T is length of job
tenure on the preceding job). Correspondingly, T2 is positive for stayers,
but is negative and equals

for movers. Standardization for tenure is

important: since wages grow with tenure (exoerience held fixed), wage change
estimates from regressions which omit tenure depend on how long recent movers

stayed on the previous job. Put another way, estimates which omit tenure indicate
the immediate wage change in moving from one job to another, while the present

specification estimates the wage change from the prior to the current job, at

comparable tenure levels. This is, clearly, a more appropriate measure of returns
to job mobility, or to change in union status.

Although the pooling of ten periods provides an effectively much larger
sample

of the MID observations, the smaller NLS sample

is in

some respects

superior: fewer observations are lost due to incomplete responses,

and hourly

refers to the current job rather than to the calendar year as in the MID.
The NLS also contains an alternative union status definition in addition to
wage

bargaining (CB).

union status changed between surveys, which were

taken

the second quarter of each year. Wage changes, however, refer to calendar

years. Since we bracketed status changers by adjacent years, if the reported
wages are indeed weighted annual figures, they could underestimate the true

change by is much as 33%. We checked on the degree of bias in several periods
(1976, 1977, 1978) when the question on wages was asked for the current job.

The so estimated bias was on average 21%. The bias could be removed by
leaving out two years between "year 1" and "year 2". But this would have

Table 1 shows sample means (i.e. proportions) of the union status categories
for the young and old men panels by alternative definition of union status in NLS

in 1969. A somewhat larger proportion (33.2%
by collective bargaining

and 39% respectively) were covered

what puzzling statistic is the number of union status changers who do not change
jobs (firms) -—

it is as large as the number of union joiners who are movers

The preponderance of stayers who are

union status changers is even stronger in MID, in which the proportion of all
movers appears to be smaller than in the NLS.

bargaining coverage were asked whether they are union members.
The (CB) definition is available in MID only for a few periods, so it could
not be utilized in the pooled sample.

Although some stayers may become union members, after a short period in the union
shop, or by switching jobs within the firm, or by the firm becoming unionized,
the figures for job stayers who change union status appear to be inflated by

misreporting or misclassification. This is especially likely in the MID samples,
where wages of union status changers who are job stayers are about
(relative to the

base

the same

group) before and after the change, (see Table 5)

Table 2 presents estimates of the 1969 to 1971 wage changes in the NLS
by union change category, net of the other

variables

(these are shown

in Appendix

Table Al), classified by mobility status, age, and definition of union sector
(tJM: union membership, CB: coverage of wage by collective bargaining agreement).

Ntmbers in Table 2

are regression coefficients, with t-statjstjcs shown in

parentheses.

Using point estimates and the union membership criterion, young men who
joined unions by changing fixins

got

a 17.6% increase in wages, while older men

gained 7.4%. However, by the collective bargaining criterion, the gain was
similar for young and old (13.5% vs. 11.6%) .

The figures for the

older

men are

barely significant. The wage changes are adjusted for inflation and are net of
the wage change experienced by the base group of non—union stayers. Firm
stayers who report joining unions show smaller gains, with lesser statistical

significance. Although it may be advisable to discount (or ignore?) the
estimates for stayers, there is still a question whether the figures for job

movers should be viewed as the net union premium: even if they did not join a
union, young movers between non—union firms (U00) gained 3.5

to

6.4%.

If

such

gains measure the return on costs of mobility, the net profit of joining unions
by moving is reduced to between 7%

and 14% for the young movers, and is comparable

for the older union joiners although the statistical reliability of
for the older group is much weaker.

When the movers' separation is distinguished by quit and layoff (see
Table A3, upper panel), the gain from joining a union is about the same
regardless of manner of separation, though for movers within the nonunion sector (TJoo) the gain is a positive 5—6% for quitters and near zero

for those laid—off. These distinctions are not perceptible for the older
union joiners whose sample further divided into quit and layoff becomes

miniscule. However, old non—union movers (U00) experience zero gains in
quitting and significant losses by layoff.
In turn, when movers are distinguished by moves between or within in-

dustry (Table A3, lower panel), (at the 2-digit level), gains to young union

joiners were observed only for inter-industry movers. They are not significant
for within-industry movers, but the latter comprise no more than 20% of

young movers who join unions, Again, no significant differences can be
observed in the small samples of older movers.
Movers who left unions (U10 in Table 2) suffered losses which exceeded

the gains of movers who joined unions. The losses were even greater when the
separation from the union job was by layoff, and when the move was between

industries. Again less confidence should be attached to such findings for

the older men. If the

of union leavers is to be viewed as another

it

is not clear why it is

so much larger than the positive measure. The discrepancy may reflect further

sorting by layoff from union firms, but the basis for such speculation is weak.

the cider men's gain of 4% is not statistically significant. The average
gain for all is 9%. This reduces to 6% for the young and less than 5% for
all, if the union premium is viewed as net of the return to mobility into a

non-union job. However, when the moves of union joiners are classified by quit
and by layoff, (Table A4, upper panel), the gain by quitting was significantly

larger: 19.8% for the younger and 11.8% for the older group. The non—union
quitters had gains of 12.4% and 4.6% respectively. A net premium which would
take into account the returns to mobility makes the net differential about 7%

for quitters in both age groups. Again, as in the NLS, the gain for union

than i.mion joiners gain in the NLS. In

the MID sample, only union leavers over 30 who were laid off lose as much or more than

joiners gain. There is no evidence of losses for the younger union leavers.

2. Cross—Section Differentials and Selectivity in Hiring
Tables 4 (for NLS) and S (for MID) present coefficients on union status
dummies in two crdss—section wage regressions, year 1, prior to the change in

union status, and year 2 after the change.Thus for job movers the coefficient on U1 in
th&'prospective"regression (year 1) estimates the wage of prospective movers from
non—union to union jobs (e.g. a coefficient of 1.2 means 1.2% points larger than
the wage of the base group = nonunion stayers). The coefficient of U01 in the
"retrospective"regression (year 2) estimates the wage on the new union job of
these recent union joiners, again relative to the base group in year 2,
If the existence of a union premium induces employers to select more pro—
ductive labor, we would expect prospective union joiners to have

higher

wages in

the prior, nonunion job than other nonunion workers. We have to be careful,
however, to compare wages of new hires into union jobs with wages of new hires

into non-union jobs: employers select among new hires. Thus the difference
between the coefficients of U01 and U00 of job movers

in the prospective regression

(year 1) measures the upgrading in hiring into union jobs. Although
union joiners had a prior non—union wage about the same as the base group of nonunion stayers, their wages were significantly higher (about 10%) than the prior

non—union wage of new hires into non—union jobs. This selectivity differential
appears to be similar for the young and old NLS samoles and is roughly comparable

conclusion

and U of MD movers (Table 5)

into

that workers newly hired

union jobs had, on

average, higher wages on the preceding job in the non-union sector than non-

union workers hired into non—union jobs. The difference is smaller in the

3ut

Michigan Panel than it was in the NLS.

this is a result of two

opposite

differentials by age. The young workers hired into union jobs had 8% higher

than the prospective non—union hires, a figure cormarab1e to the selec-

The

The first

term

on the left hand side is the cross—sectional union—nonunion wage

differential for new hires, the second term measures upgrading in union hiring,
and the right hand term is the implicit union wage premium

with

returns on costs of mobility netted out.

The interpretation expressed on the left hand

of

-

side

of (1) justifies the use

the second term on the right hand side: Emphasis on new hires coming from the non-

union sector; where wages may be assumed to reflect the marginal value product,

justifies the netting out of returns to mobility of workers moving within the
non—union sector only.

Column(l) of Table 6 shows the cross—section union non-union differential

for new hires. Column (2) shows the selectivity (upgrading) differential, which

is a component of the union—nonunion wage gap (1). Column (3) is the difference
between (1) and (2), the implicit net union wage premium obtained by new hires.

For comparison, Column (4) shows the net union wage premium estimated from the

wage—change

regressions, and Column (5), the cross—section union—nonunion wage

differential among stayers (coefficients of U11 of stayers in year 2) ,

which

comes closest to the usual regression estimates of the union—nonunion differential
in

the cross—section.

Judging by the first two columns of Table 6, selectivity in hiring, as measured
by prior wages, accounts for almost one half of the union-nonunion wage differential
among young new hires in the IlLS, but less in the MID. The time-series estimates of
the net wage premium (col. 4) are comparable to the implicit cross-section estimates
(col. 3) in NLS, but they are smaller in the MID. For the older group in MID,
selectivity into the union (ccl. 2) appears to be perverse, that is negative.

The analysis sunnnarized in Table 6 contains several innovations:

relies on estimates of wage changes of workers whose union status

appear to be less reliable and show small or no effects. Previous studies

which do not contain information on job mobility, therefore, probably attenuate the
effects of unions on wages.

(2) Information on mobility also permits more direct

estimates of selectivity in hiring, as shown in col. 2 of Table 6.

(3) Firlly,

the information on tenure makes possible estimates of gains from mobility as upward
shifts of the whole tenure profile of wages from the old to the new job.

Usually

observed instantaneous wage changes may be negative, as is often found, but the

1
longer run effects obtained in the present analysis are more likely to be positive.
As to ninerical results, it appears that estimates of net union gains in wages,
as seen in new hires, range from 7 to 15% in the NLS and from 3 to 14% in the MID.

Since the latter is biased downward, upward adjustments would put the central tendency

of both NIS and MID a little over 10%. Selectivity accounts for almost as much in
the NLS and the young workers in MID, but not so in the over 30 group in MID.
1

Even though superior as measures of gains from mobility, the shifts in tenure
wage profiles are not fully commensurate with gains in present values. It
can be shown that in order to secure the same gain in the present value of wages,
moves after longer tenure require a larger shift in the tenure profile on the
new job. This was confirmed empirically by positive and significant coefficients
on a job change x prior tenure interaction variable in the wage change estimates
(nct included in the present study).

-21—

3.. Turnover in

Union Employment

If the wage received in union employment exceeds the worker's opportunity

wage in non—union employment, he is less likely to quit a union job than a nonunion

job.

As Table 7 indicates, quit rates in the union sector are about half as large
as in the non—union sector for young workers and are about one third as large
for men over 30 (in MID), and one seventh for men over 48 (in NLS)

The differences

are smaller for separations, since layoffs are somewhat larger in the union, at
least in the NLS.

Although one third of the white male workers are unionized (somewhat less
among the young), less than 10% of non-unionized job seekers find employment
in the union sector, while a half of the 9oung and two—thirds of the older unionized

job movers find employment in the union sector. Since these statistics apply
to "unstandardized" workers, they may reflect differences in tastes and in

geography, industry, and occupation. At face value, at any rate, the differences

are consistent with our findings: non-union workers could get a bigger wage g.n
by moving to union jobs, but are evidently prevented by fewer vacancies and non—
probabilistic rationing (stricter hiring standards, nepotism, etc.) resulting from

the wage premium in the union sector. Union workers, however, can gain from mobility
within the union sector, but face a wage loss when they leave the union sector.
(Tables 2 and 3 above). Thus they tend not to leave the firm unless there is a
1

good chance of landing another union job.

11f the existence of grievance procedures ("voice" instead of "exit") were
the major force that ties groups of workers with similar preferences to a
rirm, we would expect lesser quit from firms with such labor relations.
But, in the absence of a wage remium in unionized firms, those who senarate
rrom sucn zrms would be 1arely indifferent whether they moved to a union
or non—union firm, It is, incidentally, not clear why grievance crocedures
cannot exst need be or less effective in non-unionized firms, if reduction
ln turnover reduces labor costs.

If

unionization reduces job mobility, this rEduction should be observed

on the same individual by comparing his mobility before and after joining a

union firm. And if the wage premium gained by moving to a union firm matters,
the reduction in mobility should be greater the greater the wage gain.
According to Table 9, young NLS men who joined unions between 1969 and 1971 iai,e

prior quit frequency (in 1967—1969) which was not smaller than the quit of other non—

unionized workers at that time.1 This is based on regressions with quit as a
dependent variable (0,1) and 1969 values of the same standardizing variables

as used in the wage level regressions. However, the frequency of quit was
lower by about 13% points in 1971-1973 after joining a union (coefficient of

the interval 1969—1971, This reduction is as

A comparable analysis was performed on the full D Sample (including
movers and stayers) using all ages and changes in quit ( Q) as the dependent
variable which assntes values (--1, 0, +1)

.

Again

the standardizing variables

were the same as in the1n wage equations, The results are shown in col. (1)
of Table 9.

Union joiners experienced significant reductions in quit rates compared

to all other groups. Larger wage gains (for all movers and stayers) also re—

duced quits in the next period. Here we do not distinguish wage gains of union
joiners from those of everyone else.

To observe this distinction we restricted the sample to job movers (about
two—thirds

of the sample had at least one move during the 10—year panel period),

We constructed a mobility index CM), which is a count of numbers of firms

in

which the person worked up to the current job (i.e. number of separations + 1)

divided by the time interval over which mobility was recorded. The denominator
of the index is the interval since entry into the labor force, or since 1958,

if entry into the labor force was before this date.

Wage changes associated

with job moves were recorded separately for union joiners and for others
between 1968 and 1973, and their effects estimated on the change in M (and
in ln M) between the move and 1973, the last year of the panel.

A preliminary cross-section analysis (Table AS, panel (a)) showed that the
mobility rate (N and inN) declines with experience in a decelerating fashion, is

reduced by education, marital status, union status, and by economy wide unemploy—
ment.

The dependent variable (AM, or inN) in col. 2 and 3 of Table 9 is the
difference between the index in 1978 and the first move observed between 1968
and 1973 (inclusive) for non-union people (for most of them this was not the
first move,since they moved also before 1968) or the move at which they joined

a union. The union dummy U01 distinguishes union joiners from non—union movers
and wage gains of joiners ( mW01) are distinguished from wage gain of non--

union movers •

The

standardizing variables are in the form of differences between

1978 and levels at the time of the move, Dumtijes were added to

entry into the labor force before 1968, and 1958, and

account

for

years observed in the

panel.

The results show that union joiners reduce their mobility more

the

wage gain from joining a union. A similar,

but much smaller,

the larger

and barely

significant, effect is observed for wage gains of movers in the

sector.

This is true whether the index or the changes in wages are logarithmic or
arithxnetjca 1.

The weak effect of an episode of mobility among non—union jobs is not
surprising: unless the rate of return on the cost of moving is unusually high,

there are no disincentives to future job search, However, the larger the
wage premium for union joiners the greater the potential loss from future

mobility. This reasoning applies more clearly to quit behavior, but the
effects on total separations, if weaker, are similar.

—28—

Whether

mere unionization without a wage premiimi produces a reduction in

mobility is not as clear in Table 9. The union dtmuny has a strong effect on

the change in the logarithmic, but not arithmetical, mobility index. It is
also strong in Ccl. (1) where the wage gain of union joiners was not separated from

others. Undoubtedly it represents a response to other union benefits, in fringes and
in working conditions, including the more certain advantages of seniority.
Nevertheless, our findings support the inference that the union wage gain is not

merely a compensatory differential for quality of labor, or costs of mobility, or for
inferior conditions in union jobs. Union rents appear to be real, although
relatively small (closer to 10% than to 20%).
Although cross—section union—nonunion wage differentials (gross) overstate

the

size of the (net) union premium, it may be useful to explore their

effects on differentials

that the

in quit rates in the cross—section, on the asstnption

are estimates of within-group union—nonunion (relative) wage

differentials (estimates shown in Table A6). In the second step we included industry
(or other groups), and a union dummy as well as its cross—product with the estimated
union-nonunion wage differentials (ft. from

the wage regressions) in quit regressions.

We ruled out groups

for which we had too few (less than 20) observations in

the

union or nonunion

sector. Thus we utilized 22 industries, 31 states, and 27 occupational
categories (Table A6).

The intra—group union—nonunion wage differentials 3. amounted, on average,
to 15—20%. They ranged from 0 to over 40% and were most prominent (larger and
more significant) in the occupational category, less so within states, and
least within industries.

Table 10 which reports the results of step 2, shows respectively the effects

of union status (U), and of wage differentials (2)
on differences
the

various

in quit

rates between unionized and non—unionized workers within

groups of workers. Effects of wage differentials are not significant

within industries ( at a level higher than 1-digit, for workers with the same
measiired characteristics ,

but

they are significant within regions and occupations.

Union status alone (the U dummy) is sufficient to affect the

intra—iridustry differences,

but plays no role other than via wage differentials inside occupations. Both

variables are significant within states. Note also that U is significant in all three
groups, when /3

is dropped, and conversely.

—31.-

4. Fringe Benefits and Hours of Work
If numbers employed (N) and hours per worker (H) are viewed as separate
factors of production, cost minimizing employers will determine their demand for
N and H at the point where the ratio of marginal factor costs is equal to the

ratio of marginal productivities, that is to the solpe of the optimal production
isoquant.
Following Rosen (1968) ,

the

equilibrium marginal factor cost ratio is.:1

(1) MCNH ÷F(r+q)
N
MCH

where

F is the fixed cost of employment per worker, amortized per period by r,

the interest cost of capital and by q, the worker quit probability which depreciates
the capital sum creating a capital loss Fq per period.

To the extent that F is positive an increase in the wage rate W reduces the
factor cost ratio shifting the relative demand away from hours toward numbers.2
In the minimum wage case it may be argued that F is significant at most in terms
of

training

expenses, but that minimum wages tend to reduce or eliminate such

expenses, so that the predicted effects on hours may be observed only in the
short run before the adjustment is coinpleted,or it may be indeterminate.

analysis of substitution beeen H and N ignores scale effects. The
qualitative conclusions, however, remain valid so long as the elasticity
of demand for numbers (N) with respect to wages (including fringes) is
less than unitary.

—32—

In contrast to the minimum wage, union

pressure on wages extends to most components of the wage package.
Indeed, union push on components other

than

directly paid out wages appear to

be even stronger. Union fringe benefits exceed non-union benefits not only
in dollar value but also as a proportion of the wage package (about 30%). A

number of possible explanations have been conjectured, running from union demo—

crasy

which favors the older worker to union management of pension funds as an

instrument of power. One economic argument relies on reduced turnover, which
is a result of union wage push and of other gains. In the presence of incomplete vesting of pensions in the worker, longer tenure of union members

means that the probability of ultimately receiving the pension is higher in

union

1

than in non—union jobs. Hence the incentive to push for larger pensions

(Freeman, 1978). But why increase fringe benefits by a larger percentage than
the increase in the paid out wage? One reason is the higher marginal income
tax rate, if the income elasticity of worker demand for fringes is otherwise

The analysis of effects of wage push on hours may provide one rationale for
union pressure on fringes: an increase in union wages W, with F unchanged, would

1For the same reasons, more vesting is less costly to union than non-union employers.
2They found that fringe benefitswere substantially larger for union workers whose
total compensation (wages + fringe) was the same as the total compensation of
non—union workers.

—33—

In

explain

contrast to hypotheses which rely on non-wage aspects of unionism to
the larger ratio of fringe benefits to paid out wages in union employ-

ment, this analysis predicts a positive link between the percent union wage

premium and the relative increase in fringe benefits (F). Moreover, the percent increase in F is expected to exceed the percent increase
in the wage, since the larger the latter, the bigger is the decrease in the

rate.

quit

Thus unions which achieve the biggest gain in paid out wages would

also want the largest proportion of their total compensation in fringe benefits.
This proposition is tested on a sample of over 4,000 firms in 70 (2.-digit)

industries. Average paid out wages in union firms were 21% higher than in nonunion firms

within

the industry (a simple average of 70 wage ratios), while

average fringe benefits were 60% higher. The first regression (t.able II, Panel A)

relates the ratios of fringes

industry to ratios of money wages,standardizing for age of employees, size of
firm,

region, and union coverage of the industry.

As predicted, the coefficient on the wage ratio in Table 11 is significantly
larger than unity (1.62). This implies that a 10% increase

in the union wage

premium would create a 16% increase in the union—nonunion ratio of fringe benefits.
This ratio was, on average, 32% in the unstandardized data.

In

the data analyzed in Table 11 the value of union fringes is 80% higher than

of nonunion fringes, while wages are 30% higher. Asuxning t1 t the net union effect
is a half of this figure (i.e. 15%) , and that quit rates are half as large in the

nonunion sector (as observed in Table 7), we can calculate the required ratio of
fixed costs

which would remove employer incentives to cut hours schedules

The actual ratio of fringe benefits is larger (1.80) , presmiably because fringes
represent only a part, although a major one, of fixad labor costs.
An important consequence of higher fixed costs (in hiring and in fringes)

imposed on union employers is greater stability of employment——reduced

fluctuations in N, when labor demand fluctuates (see Rosen, 1968). As a
result, the major means of adjustment to fuictuating demand in union employment
are the use of overtime when labor is short and the use of temporary layoffs (recall

unemployment) in slack times. Temporary layoff is favored by union workers, as it
implies lesser income loss than corresponding reductions in weekly hours, because

of unemployment compensation and other unemployment benefits (see b). For their
part, employers can expect less attrition, since temporarily laid off union
workers are less likely to look for other jobs than comparable non—union workers.

over zero for those over 48 in NLS (Table 4). The implication is that the typical

although higher in level is flatter than the

non—union profile. This difference has been found in other studies and

been ascribed to union policy of compressing wage differentials across firms

and workers, who may differ in sex, education, race, and age.
The policy of wage compression has been attrthuted to union pursuit of

equity, to administrative convenience in collective bargaining, and to union
efforts

to reduce competition from lower wage firms. However, a more direct

explanation of flatter wage profiles involves union emphasis on wage progression

by seniority rules: Within the firm,

Such provisions limit the supply of trained

transferable training. Consequently, incentives for general (transferable)
training are reduced for union workers, both because such training is not
adequately

rewarded within the union firm, and because union workers are less

likely to move in the first place.

This helps to explain the declining with age proportion of job movers who

be steeper than in non—union firms.

This is, indeed, found in Table 12, where the

coefficient

on tenure in

the union wage equation is no smaller than in the non-union equation. Table 12

is restricted to MID data because estimates of experience and tenure coefficients in NLS

are sensitive to truncation by

age.

The non—union tenure coefficient in the wage

level equation (left—hand panel) is smaller in col. (3),

where an attempt was

made to adjust the estimate for heterogenity bias2by introducing the (prior)

mobility rate variable. This variable (M) has a negative and significant effect in the
non-union equation, where it also reduces the tenure coefficient, but has no effect
in the

union equation. The right-hand panel of the Table shows separate wage

growth equations for union and

nonunion workers. The

less significant.

The experience coefficient is much smaller in the union equation. Thus
the flatness of gross union wage profiles (by age, or experience) when tenure

is ignored, or by tenure when experience (or age) is ignored is due solely to
lesser worker investments in general training.

flatter gross union profile also suggests that the total volume of trainsmaller in union firms. In principle, this need not be the case, since the

wage profile measures returns to workers, but not returns on costs
borne by employers. The reluctance of union workers to quit should provide
incentives for union employers to invest in specific training of their workers,

since the risk of a capital loss by worker quit is smaller. Union workers have
a corresponding insurance against capital losses only to the extent that seniority
rules reduce layoffs .This is true at higher levels of seniority at the expense

of low—tenured workers. Thus, in contrast to the usual (competitive) analysis
(Becker,

1975) where

and

layoffs - are a result of

investments in specific hi.nan capital shared by workers and employers, such

investments are the result, rather than cause, of turnover patterns induced

might expect employer investments in specific
training of union workers to exceed the corresponding investments of non—union
Because

we

employers. But the fact that permanent layoff rates of union workers are no
smaller than in the non—union sector raises doubts about such expectations.
However, higher rates of union layoffs concentrated at low tenure levels may

both reflect additional screening of new hires and may be a substitute form

of adjustment for reduced quit)

If the

volimte of specific training is not

clearly larger in union firms, total training,including the general component,
is likely to be smaller. This is apparently confirmed by the more direct
evidence on reported training, to which we proceed:

and Kahn find that unionismiñreases permanent layoffs among the your,
not among the old NLS. Our own research (not presented here) shows that while
quits and layoffs decline with tenure at about the same rate for non—union workers,
layoffs decline more steeply thap quits for union workers.

In the NLS,training was reported in response to questions: Do you receive or

use additional training (other

than

school training) on your

job?

In MID,

different questions were used in different surveys; the most appropriate for

our purposes is the question asked in 1976—1978: "Are you learning skills on
the current job which could lead to a better job or to promotion?"
In a recent paper (Mincer and Leighton, 1981) these questions were used

to explore the effects of minimum wage laws on training on the job. Training
so reported was used as a dependent variable1 in the NLS and MID equations
(the same set of independent variables was used as in the wage equations)

A union dtnmy

included

in those equations was significantly negative in all

periods in the MID and in the older NLS

sample.

In the current study, we further classified the union status variable
as

joiners (U01),

of

training

leavers (U), and stayers (U11), and explored the incidence

before and after the change of union status.

In the LS samDles

(Table 13,(A) ) the old union

stayers

and union joiners

show significantly less training than non—union stayers. The signs on coefficients
of the young union joiners are negative, not significant before joining and almost

significant after, Old union leavers show positive, but not significant coefficients.
The MID results (Table 13(B) ) similarly show significantly less training
among union stayers (U11). They also show that less training is required on union

jobs, though not as a precondition for hiring (coefficient U1 is not significant
in year 1, Panel C). The coefficients of union joiners are negative and riot significant before but significant after joining the union (year 1 and year 2 regressions).
Infereritielly, they received more training than union stayers before the start of the

union job. Conversely, union leavers appear to receive more training than before
on the non-union job to which they moved.
lAs an independent variable, the trathirig dumnies are positve and significant
in both wage level and wage growth equations (not reported here).

The findings on workers who changed union status are not very sQcure, but
they suggest that selectivity in hiring msy involve prior training (in addition
to some cencentration of it at the outset of some of the union jobs, such as in

crafts). This may explain the results for the very young NLS workers where
union effects on training were not significant.

The finding that union workers receive less training on the job than nonunion workers is also confirmed in the Michigan Time Study, as reported by

Duncan and Stafford (1980). They report that while non-union work s spend,
on average 6.1 hours per week on job training, comparable union workers spend
4.2 weekly hours on such trainirj.

Summary

Amourig a

number of features that distinguish unionized from non-unionized

labor markets, at least four have been repeatedly observed in empirical studies:
(1) Higher wages, (2) Larger fringes, more than in proportion to wages, (3) Lesser
turnover, reflecting lesser quit, though not less layoffs, and (4) Flatter age—
wage profiles. Although the labor monopoly hypothesis has been used (and disputed)
as an explanation of higher union wages, it does not receive much, if any,
attention in analyses of the other features.

This study explores the existence of a net union premium and of the extent

of rationing by quality of the resulting excess supply. The net union premium
was estimated in Section 1 by relating changes in wages to changes in union status
of the saute worker in longitudinal panels (NLS and :11D) .

In

Section 2, two cross—

section wage level regressions, a "prospective" and "retrospective1' permit more

direct observation of selectivity in hiring. Over a

differitial

half of the cross—section

of over 20% for the 'same" (standardized) worker is a net union rent and

much of the rest reflects a quality adjustment in hiring, as measured by wages.
This conclusion was less reliable for

older workers.

—43—

The next step (Section 3)was to

ascertain

whether the net: union

is responsible, together with other advantages

and

secured

by

wage premium

the union such as Lringes

seniority rules, for the lesser turnover, especially quit of union workers.

The answer is positive: the reduction in quit depends on the size of the net
wage premium in an individual analysis, and is also positively related to the
gross, cross—section wage differentials within groups of workers,alassifi.ed by

location and occupation, though not by industry. Frfnges and seniority rules,

or-other union advantages did not explicitly enter this analysis hut they are
likely to be embodied in the union memnk:sbip variable,

union sector. This hypothesis links the size of fringe benefits to th' union

In sum, total training is likely to be less frequent in union firm; an this is
confirmed by direct responses in survey r'porLs.
