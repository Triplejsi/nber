The Changing Economic Value of Higher Education
in Developed Economies
A Report to the 0.E.C.D.

ABSTRACT

This

paper analyses the changing economic value of higher education

in the major 0.E.C.D. countries. The first part of the study examines
data on earnings by education or earnings in occupations composed of per-

sons with different educational attainments. A second part looks at unemployment rates and the occupations attained by college graduates. Both
the relative earnings data and the unemployment and occupational attainment
data suggest that the heralded decline in the economic

education

value of higher

in the U.S. is not a unique North American phenomenon, but rather,

a general development throughout the developed world, On the basis of
evidence on elasticities of substitution and the observed growth in the
supply of college graduates the paper suggests that the decline in the
premium to the educated reflects movement along a reasonably well—defined
demand for graduates schedule due to the growth of the college and university
systems of the various countries.

One of the distinctive aspects of modern economic growth has been

increased investments in higher education. During the 1950s and l960s college

and

university systems expanded throughout the developed world, fueled by the

belief that education offered a sizeable economic return to the individual and
was an important means of societal growth. With rare exception, policymakers
and analysts viewed higher education as a major road to economic well—being and
in some instances as a panacea to social problems, including reduction of income

'"

inequality. Resources flowed into higher education in unprecedented amounts.

sities came to employ more persons and to account for a larger share of gross
national product than the steel or automobile industries.1 Spurrea by a relati—
vely high rate of return and good job opportunities, an

increasing pro1ortion of

young persons chose to enroll for hiher education.
The 1970s witnessed a marked chane in the economic position of the
highly educated through most of the western world. The

enrollments levelled off or

relative to the relevant age group. While the timing and magnitude of

change differ among countries, there was a general reversal of the boom of

previous decades.
This paper examines the quantitative dimensions of the changing economic
status of the highly educated, and considers the economic forces that appear to

underlie the changes. Section I analyzes several indicators of the state of the

countries the earnings of graduate workers relative
to nongraduates, where these are not available or sparse, the earnings in occugraduate market in several

pations where graduates predominate to those where they do not, unemployment

rates for graduates; and the composition of jobs obtained by graduates. It

—2—
finds noticeable declines in the earnings of graduates relative to other

workers, reductions in the proportion of graduates in jobs traditionally filled
by college—level workers, and noticeable increases in graduate unemployment.
Section II seeks to explain the observed changes in terms of a relatively
simple supply—demand model of the graduates market in which the increase in
relative supply of graduates exceeding increases in relative demanu reduce the

economic advantage of college or university traininb. In addition, some consideration is given to the alternative hypothesis that the decline in the university premium is due to trade union or governmental efforts maintain the earnings of the less educated in a period of slow economic growth.

I. Quantitative Dimensions

of

Change

A sizeable and growing body of evidence has found that the economic
position of hiahly educated workers, particularly recent or young graduates,
underwent significant deterioration relative to that of other workers in the

U.S. in the 1970s. Is this pattern of a declining premium to higher education
also true of other developed countries, or is it a development distinct to the
U.S.?

To answer the question, this section examines evidence on the earnings

of educated workers relative to less educated workers or on the earnings of
workers in occupations composed largely of graduates to those in other
occupations, on graduate unemployment, and the type of jobs obtained by gra-

duates in a large number of developed countries. While the quality of the data
and the timing of changes differs from country to country, the evidence presents
overwhelming support for the proposition that the_economic_advantages of higher

education declined throughout the developed_world in the period_studied. In a

—3—

of the countries moreover, the bulk of the decline occurred in the

majority

early part of the decade, with the position of graduates more or less stabilizing toward

the end of the l9IUs.

Table 1 summarizes

relates the
report

the earnings data. Where possible the information

earnings of college graduates to nongraduates, but in some cases, I

ratios of incomes in occupations where graduates predominate to those

in occupations where they do not. This assumes that at least some inferences
can be made about education premium from occupational earnings patterns. In

several cases the published data show breaks or jumps due to changes in defini-

tions or methods of computing averages. Where this occurs I report both fiaures

and infer changes in ratios over the entire perioo from the sum of the two
changes.

The precise definition of earnings or incomes differs across

countries; fringe benefits, which have become an increasingly important part of
the returns to labor in recent years, are generally excluded, and aLl of the

data relate to before—tax earnings. Exclusion of fringes

undoubtedLy biases the

figures, though its effect on changes in ratios is ecjuivocal. On the one hand,
fringes tend to be a higher proportion of pay among the higher paid; on the

other hand, the fringes of the manuaL workers have increased greatly in recent
years, with many fringes traditionally given to the higher—level workers now

given to other workers in enterprises. Overall, because the major changes found
in the data are quite sizeabie, I doubt that lack of data on fringes seriously
distorts the pattern.

One other aspect of the data deserves attention. Sometimes the figures
reported relate to workers of al.L ages, at other times, they refer to starting

wages or the wages of young workers. While it would have been desireahie to

—4—

obtain consistent figures for each country, I was limited by the published

data sources. Analyses of U.S. figures show larger declines in the relative
earnings of younger graduates than of older graduates, which suggests that

the decline in relative earnings was concentrated among new graduates. If
this is generally the case, the data for all workers in several other
countries understates the dimensions of the decline among the graduates of
the 1970s.

With this brief discussion of the data and calculations behind us,

let us now examine the figures in Table 1, country by country, beginning
with the English—speaking nations where migration might be expected to cause
similar patterns of change.

English—speaking countries

For the United_States, Table 1 shows declines in the income of
college graduates relative to high school graduates of sizeable magnitude
from 1969 to 1974, followed by rough stability in the ensuing period, with

some increases and some decreases in the ratios. In all cases, however,
the end of decade income ratios lie far below the ratios at the outset of

the decade. The biggest declines occur for younger workers and for those
with doctoral degrees. Detailed analyses of these patterns of changes
suggest that they translate into declines in rates of return of 3—4 per-

centage points, from the 10%—liZ levels of the late 1960s to perhaps 7%
in the 1970s.2

The figures for Australia in Table 1 reveal a similar pattern of

declining advantage to the college educated. In this case I have incomes
for university degree holders and for all persons without degrees. Since the
latter includes persons who have not graduates secondary school, the ratios
tend to be higher than those for the U.S. With respect to the trends of

interest what stands out in the data is the sizeable percentage point decline
in the advantage for the more highly educated, with greater declines in the

first half of the decade for all but the 45—54 year olds. In contrast
to the U.S. data, the magnitudes of the changes in Australia show possibly
greater deterioration in the relative position of older graduates than
of younger graduates.

The next country in the table is Canada for which the data relate
the income of university graduates to the income of various groups of less

educated workers, overall, and by age. Because of changes in definitions in
the published figures I compare 1969 to 1974 and 1975 to 1978 separately
and obtain changes over the whole period by summing the 1969—74 and 1975—78

changes. While magnitudes of change differ among age groups, with the
24—34 group showing much smaller drops in relative income than is found in

the U.S. or Australia, the overall pattern is consistent. As in those
countries, the relative earnings of college graduates fell in the period
under study, by large amounts.

The evidence for the United Kingdom on educational groups in (a) and
(b) is based on the ratios of starting salary from the Leeds University

survey to the average earnings of other workers. The drop from 1968 to
1974 is uniform and large, with the institutionally—induced change in youth
apprentice rates severely reducing the advantage of graduates over youths.3
The decline is particularly marked for those in the Arts and Social Sciences
and for female graduates and, because of declines in the nonmanual to manual
income ratios for the United Kingdom, are exceptionally large relative to the

inceoms of manual workers. From 1974 to 1978 there is a general but modest
rise in the ratios, a pattern which is more consistent than that found
in the U.S. The occupation data in lines 5—7 show comparab].e trends for

various groups of highly qualified workers. Note that in these comparisons
the base group are nonmanual workers. Contrasts with manual workers would
reveal much more striking declines.

—16—

Japan
Figures for Japan in lines (a) 1—3, taken from a University of Wisconsin
dissertation, show a pattern of decline in the relative earnings of graduates by
age which began in the mid—1950s and proceeded through the early 1970s, of a
magnitude similar to that obtained in the more recent decade for the English—

speaking countries. The data also show a more pronounced drop in relative incomes for younger as opposed to older graduates, similar to that found in the
U.S., U.K., and Canada.

Lines (b)1 and (b)2 carry the analysis through 191b. They give the
ratios of average earnings of college graduates to elementary and high school

graduates. These figures provide further evidence of a fall off in the relative
pay of college graduates in Japan, with an overall drop of about 10 percentage
points for both men and women.

Continental Europe

The remaining countries in Table 1 are on the continent of Europe. I
had greater probleras obtaining data for the continental countries than for

others and have been forced to rely in several cases on earnings by occupation

rather than by education. To the extent that, as seems reasonable, part of the
fall in the economic advantage to the highly educated takes the form of a
downgrading in occupations (this is definitely the case in the U.S. and Japan),
the occupation data will understate the actual deterioration in the position of
graduates.

—11—
Possible understatement notwithstandin5,, the evidence in Taule 1 shows

that for an countries there is a large droj in the income of those in jobs
reuirina more education relative to workers in jobs requiring less education.
The French data, in particular, show a marked fall in the advantage of
executives and managers compared to nonmanual 'employees' and manual workers and

a sizeable but less marked dro in the earnings of technical workers relative to

manual workers. Consistent with the pattern found in the English—speakin
countries, moreover, most of the decline in the ratios occurs in the first part
of the l9IIJs, from 1969 to 1916. Lines (c) 1 and 2 for France present data on

educational differentials themselves, but for an eary period. They reveal a
fall off in the advantage to bachelor's graduates but not to hiher degree recipients in the 1960s.

Two sets of figures are given for Italy: (a) ratios of average
earnings of university graduates to elementary and secondary school graduates
and (b) ratios of the starting wages of public sector executives to other

workers in the public sector. The college earnings data show an enormous decline in the relative earnings of graduates from advantages far
exceeding those in the U.S. in 1967 to figures comparable to those in the U.S.

by 1977. The public sector differentials reveal a similar pattern.
For Denmark the data are limited to part of the work force: central
government employees coverec by collective bargaining coritracts.They have the

disadvantage of providing no information on the private sector but the advantage

of relating to the academic degree recipients of concern. The figures tell a

story: in Denmark

in the other countries we have examined, the relative earnings of the more educated fell.
clear

The

of

as

final country in the table is Germany, where the

data relate the pay

technical employees with higher qualifications to that of employees with

lower q_ualifications. The figures show a sizeabLe drop for the hihest group

relative to the lowest and more modest declines for the highest relative to

other groups. As in Japan, however, the drop appears to have begun in the l9bUs
rather than in the 1910s.
The conclusion that in Continental Europe, as in the English-speakiflb
countries and Japan, there was a marked fall in the relative income of the
highly educated in the periods covered is inescapable.

Interpretation
The Table 1 data support the following claim: In the English_speaking
countries, in Japan, and in the Western European countries, the relative earnings of highly educated workers or of those in occupations dominated by the

highly educated fall sharply in the l9TQs. In most of the countries, moreover,
the declines appear to be greater in the early part of the 1970s than in the
latter part, possibly because of the potentially lar,er impact of the slowdown

in the world econon in the latter years on less educated workers. It is of
some interest to note that evidence on nonmanuaJ to manual differentials or on

skill differentials amon nnual workers also have followed such a pattern. In
six of the seven Common Market countries for which data are available from
Eurostat, the nonmanual to manual worker earnings ratio fell, with the greatest

decline in the early part of the decade.5 Marsden's 1981 analysis of pay differentials in Britain, West Germany, France, and Italy provides additional sup-

port for our analysis. He concludes that

'there is evidence of a similar long—

term reduction in the differential for higher—paid nonxianual occupations' in all
of those countries with some indication that the decline showed at the end of

the 1910s (p. 309). While declines in higher paid nonmanual worker earnings to

—19—

manual worker earnings do not necessarily imply declines in the relative pay of
graduates, such a pattern is consistent with the evidence in Table 1 about the
rewards to higher education.

Unemployment and non-price indicators
Market adjustments to changes in the supply—demand balance involve more
than simply

movement of relative prices. If

the economic position of the highly

educated deteriorated, as indicated by the wage data in Table 1, we might aLso

expect

unemployment and nonprice indicators of economic status to show co-

parable

declines as well.6
Table 2

summarizes available data regarding the types

of jobs obtained

by graduates and various indicators of unemployment. Measures of the proportion
of graduates in 'college—level' occupations proviae a statistic that is easier
to intetpret than unemployment rates, as declines in the proportion in jobs traditionally requiring a degree can be taken at face value as indicative of a

deterioration in market conditions, Because unemployment varies cyclically,
particularly for manual workers, on the other hand, comparisons of the rates for

both college graduates and less educated workers are complicated: the ratio of
the rates may decline, while the difference may widen for cyclical rather than

reasons of structural change in the market. One way of dealing with this
problem is to regress the unemployment rate of graduates on the unemployment

rate for other workers and examine deviations from the regression line. I have
made such calculations for the U.S. but not for other countries.
The U.S. data in lines 1 and 2 highlight one of the most important

aspects of the declining market for graauates in that country: the decline in
the percentage of graduates finding employment in the job areas normally held by

college graduates, the one—digit professional and technical category. When one

—20-.

focuses Ofl

the

marginal as opposed to the average likelihood of obtaining

professional, technical and kindred jobs, the story of deterioration is even
stronger.

From 1962

to

1965, the number of college graduates in the labor

force grew by 14,011,000, whereas the number of graduates with professional jobs

grew by 2,915,000 —

implyinb

that 131o of the additional college workers got pro-

fessional employment. From 1969 to 197b, by contrast, when the number of graduates grew by 5,096,000, the number obtaining professional jobs grew by just
3,751,000 — a

146%

rate

of employment in the professions. From 1976 to 1979, the

number of graduates increased by 3,106,205, while the number working as pro
fessionals increased by 1,627,000 — a 1414% rate of enloyment in the

professions.T
The U.S. unemployment rates show a noticeable increase in the rate for
graduates, but as noted earlier this could represent either a structural change

or a normal cyclic pattern. To see whether the period under study deviates from
earlier periods I regressed the rate of unemployment of collebe graduates on the

rate for hih school graduates and the rate of unemployment of professional
workers on the rate of unemployment for blue collar workers. Figure 1 shows the
results. As can be seen by the dark areas, there does appear to be a structural
change,

with graduate (professional) employment worse relative to high

collar) unemployment than in

the

past.

The Canadian data show similar patterns of change,
unemployment rate rising sharply, from less than

falling

with the graduates'

to 14.1% in

1911 but then

to 3.14% in 1917. As the nongraduate rate also rises substantively, it

is unclear if the orseriing in the position of graduates is more or less than

would be expected under pre_1910s conditions. If the U.S. patterns are any
indication, the graduates' situation would appear to have worsened.

The story for the United Kingdom is similar, with the evidence in line 1

showing a definite worsening in the ease with which first degree recipients find

jobs: the proportion still seeking employment in December of the year was 3% in
1962, in 1979 it was still 11%, whereas the rate of total unemployment rose more

modestly. In 1962 the ratio of the percentage of first degree university graduates
still seeking permanent employment to the total unemployment rate was 1.4; the

figure rose to 1.9 by 1969 and was still at that level in 1979. However, our
data do not extend to the recent doubling of total unemployment in the British
economy.

The limited figures I have obtained for Japan show a drop in the proportion of graduates in professional and technical jobs, though in Japan, unlike
the U.S., the majority of graduates are employed in managerial and clerical
rather than professional jobs.

Turning to the European continent, the Belgium data are perhaps the most
striking as they show a tripling in the proportion of the unemployed persons
receiving unemployment compensation accounted for by those with university
education, an increase that has to far exceed the increase in the university
share of the work force over the period.

The figures for Denmark show sizeable rates of unemployment for selected

groups of highly qualified workers, except engineers. Compared to the average
rate in the country, the figures reveal higher rates for graduates of arts and
sciences and academics, a pattern consistent with data for the U.S. which
suggest a greater worsening in the market for academic fields.8

The Italian data by education which I have obtained do not give normal

rates of unemployment. They distinguish between graduates looking for their
first job, the experienced unemployed, and the employed. I use the fitures to
calculate three types of statistics. The ratio of graduates looking for first
jobs to degrees granted in line 1 for Italy is an indicator of the difficulties

new graduates may have in obtaining work. As the data compared are different

(graduates seeking first job will include those from previous years' classes),
the magnitude should not be taken as an unemployment rate, as normally

defined.

The trend, however, is sufficiently striking to suggest a distinct worsening in
the position of graduates, consistent with reports of major problems in the

Italian marketplace. Line 2 records the percentage of the experienced
unemployed who are graduates. It shows that university graduates have more than
tripled their share of unemployment in the period 1970—1979 froiri 0.7% to 2.6%;

since the graduate share of the work force has not come close to tripling (from

the relevant unemployment rates, where the number of persons seeking

first jobs are included in both the numerator and denominator of the statistic.

These data show a rate for graduates in excess of that for the entire work force
in the decade.

In France the data for unemployment rates by occupation show noticeable
increases in the rates for professionals and executives and for middle level

executives. Whether these increases are more/less/about what would be expected
on the basis of past patterns of cyclic change we have not deterrnineu.

In Germany the proportion of the unemployed in scientific and technical occupa—
tions rose by nearly 80% in the space of just seven years.

Overall, while the data in Table 2 suffer from various problems of non—
comparablity across countries, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that
the unemployment of graduates and their employment prospects worsened in the

1970s, probably though not definitely, to a greater than normal extent during an

economic slowdown. Since the 1970s were a period of sluggish economic growth,
however, it is important to recognize that the unemployment of the nongraduate
labor force tended to increase more in percentage points than did the graduate
unemployment rate.

—30-

11. EconOmic Determinants of Change
What factors exLain the observed declines in the economic position of
highly educated workers in the O.h.C.D.

countries shown in tables 1 and 2?

in this section I seek to explain the observed patterns in terms of
changes in the relative supply and demand for graduates, with the

principal

moving force being the rapid expansion of higher education of the l960s. I
develop a small supply—demand model designed to pin down the key forces at work

and

examine empirical evidence regarding the magnitude of the relevant paratue—

ters of change. Finally, i consider one possible alternative explanation of
change:

that the decline in the relative position of graduates stems not from

the increased supply of graduates but rather from trade union and governmental
policies which maintained the position of less

educated workers in the face of

an overall drop in the market for labor of various types.

The supply-demand framework
Let X =

rate

of change in the location of the demand curve for univer-

sity graduates relative to the demand for other workers; S =

rate

of change in

the position of the supply of university graduates relative to other workers;
o =

the

elasticity of demand for university graduates relative to other workers

which in the current context can be represented by the elasticity of
substitutiOn, c =

the

elasticity of supply of university graduates defined

"relative to the number of potential students.
Then the change in relative demand for graduates will be:

(1) E=X-OW
where E =

rate

of change in relative employment of graduates arid

W =

rate

of

change in relative pay of graduates. The change in the relative supply of gram-

—31—
duates will be:

(2) Es =
where Es

S

+

eW

relative supply.

Assume, for simplicity, that the labor market clears, so that E = Es.
Then the economic advantage received by college graduates will depend on the
shift (s, x) and slope (e, a) parameters as follows:

(3) W=(x—s)/(c+a)
Equation (3) shows, that when shifts in supply for educated labor exceed

shifts in demand, relative wages will fall. The extent of the fall is conditioned by the elasticity of substitution between more and less qualified labor

and the elasticity of supply. Figure 2 shows graphically how the effect of
changes in supply and demand depends critically on the relevant elasticities.
Taking the demand side first, panel A distinguishes between the extreme case in
which the elasticity of substitution between more/less educated workers is inf i—

nite and the case in which it has a more modest value. In the infinite elastic
case, changes in the demand for and supply of educated labor have no effect on

relative wages. Turning to supply, panel B shows a similar situation with an
infinite and noninfinite elasticity of supply. It makes the point that if
investments in human capital are perfectly elastic at a going rate of return, as
is often implicitly assumed in human capital models, then relative wages are
fixed at a level solely suppJ' determined.

What has happened to the four determinants in the period studied?

labor market (which, of course, differed somewhat in timing across countries)
and the increased propensity of young persons to enroll in higher educational

programs over the period. Because of the time lag between decisions to enroll
in university and graduation and entr,y into the job market, we take the increase

in the supply of graduates due to the enrollment expansion of the 1960s as a
shift in supply (s) in the 1970s.
Table 3 presents comparable international data which document this well—

known phenomenon and provide some magnitude of the changes. It shows that bet—
ween 1960 and 1910 the absolute and relative number of persons entering universities (and thus graduating in the l970s) doubled or even tripled in many

countries. Data for a limited number of countries for which I have figures on
graduates confirm that the tremendous increase in enrollments showed up in gra-

duates in the l9TOs. Between 1970 and 1916 in the U.S. the ratio of 25—34 year
old college to high school graduates rose from .38 to .57 —— a50% rise.9 In the

U.K., the number of degrees granted 20—24 year olds rose from .ii6 to .i44 from
1970 to 1975,10 while in Japan the number of new college graduates relative to
new high school graduates increased by over 5O, from .24 in 1970 to .37' in

1975.11 Any economic explanation of the declining economic value of higher education will rest heavily on the striking increase in supply in the period.

Shifts in Demand
In the absence of detailed country studies of the employment of gra-

duates by sectors and of sectoral rates of growth, along the lines of the fixed
coefficient model often used by governmental forecasters, it is difficult to say
much about the demand side for the bulk ci' the countries. On the basis of
detailed analyses of the U.S. and general knowledge of development elsewhere,

in the econo—
however, it is possible to rule out an explanation of the decline

demand
mic premiUJTl to high levels of education in terms of a decline in relative

for

graduates.

Relative demand for graduates appears to have increased in the

period, though at declining rates over time, as the technologically intensive
industries and education and the government sectors——all of which employ large

proportions of graduates——grew, often rapidly. That demand increased does not,
of course, imply that the pattern of demand shifts did not contribute to
observed changes in the relative incomes of graduates, for had it increased more
rapidly, the observed decline would have been more modest.

Elasticity of Subst itut ion

As shown in (3), one of the key parameters in determining the extent to
which increases in supply of graduates relative to demand redace relative wages

is the elasticity of substitution between more and less educated workers. What
do .re knoi about the magnitude of this parameter?

In the 1960s, several analysts concluded that the key elasticity was
The

quite high, sufficiently large to yield a roughly horizontal demand curve.

basic

mode of analysis was to regress the relevant income ratios on relative

quantities, and certain control variables, assuming that relative quantities are

predetermined by past supply decisions. The first three stu.dies listed in Table
1 summarize the results of this work. Using a small sample of countries, Bowles

obtained a value of o of over 200. With a sample of 28 states from the United
States, Dougherty obtained a more moderate but still very high estimate of over

8. Since the impact of changes in the relative supplies on relative wages
depends inversely on the elasticity of substitution, the value of 8 implies only

modest impacts of chanbes in relative supply on wages: an increase of, saj,

countries of concern. Since the relative income of graduates reneained const'snt

or increased in the 1950s and 19b0s, despite the increased supply of graduates,
these estimates were accepted as beinb rou,,hb in accord with reaLity anti taken,
by some, as reruting the "fixed coefficient" model of demand used by the

0.I.C.D., amou others, to analyse the grauuate and skiLled worker market.

In the 1970s, concurrent with the observed decline in the relative position or graduates, new estimates based on better data and models provided a very

different picture of the relevant ebisticity. Tinbergen amplified the country
and state models to deal with the likely interaction of supply and denisrad in

determining relative wages and quantities, and obtained quite different reouLts
trots Bowles and Dougherty. His el.asticitteu ranged from about 1/2 to 2.00.

L

used time series data for the United States to determine the iqiact of growth in
the relative number of raduates on relative earuinss arid obtained est1nateu of
a similar magnitude, ranging from I to 2.6. Helat Lveij moderate results were
also obtained between more and Less educated workers by Layard and )illon. By

the mid—lyTOs the value of the substitution elasticity parameter appeared to be

on the order of 1 to 2, which is of a magnitude that permits sizeable increases
in supply relative to demand to reduce the premium to highly educated workers.

Elasticity of supply
The second key parameter in equation (3) is the elasticity of the supply
of students to universities. While research on this topic did not begin in ear-

nest until

the mid—l970s, we have at this point several studies, which though

For the U.S., moreover, there is survey evidence whIch suggests that,

contrary to the traditional views of educators, students are hihly aware of,
and responsive to economic rewards. earty 50 percent of freshmen surveyed by
the

American Council of Education in 1971 agreed, for example, that a major

reason for going to college was that it would enabLe them to get a better

job.12 Nearly one—third cited "aole to make more money" as a verj important
reason for going to colleme. Similar results are obtained with questions
relating to choice of career. My 1969 survey of college students showed that
their expectations of salaries and of lifetime income profiles over fields
mirrored actual market circumstances.13
If there is indeed a non—negligible supply response to economic
opportunities, one would expect, at the least a slowdown in the growth of

enrollments relative to the relevant population in the 1910s. Columns 3) and
5—6 of Table 3 and figures 3 and )4 examine this expectation. The columns in the

table contrast percentage changes in the enrollments and in ratios in the

1960—1910 period to the 1970—76 period. In each countr' the rate of

increase

enrollments decelerates; in all but one the ratio of enrollments declines

becoming negative in the U.S. and France and droing to below 1.07a in the

—40--

Netherlands, Belgium and Canada.

The figures give more detailed time series information for the U.S. and

U.K. It shows the drop off in enrollments in the U.S. in the 1970s, concentrated among men, and reveals a similar fall in the U.K. toward the end of

the period, concentrated among women. Note that the figures for the U.K.
show a decline in the proportion enrolled in the period covered, in contrast

to the O.E.C.D. figures. One reason for this divergence is that the O.E.C.D.
figures refer to university—type higher education whereas the participation
rates in Figure 4 refer to all higher education, including teacher training
where enrollments have been dropping especially rapidly.

We conclude that there is a substantial elasticity of supply with
respect to salaries but that the elasticity is far from the infinite value
which would rule out a supply—demand explanation of observed changes.

of a sizeable shift in supply of graduates, which exceeded the increase in

demand, in conjunction with elasticities of substitution on the order

Are the developments of the 1910s a permanent or a transitory

On the supply side, demographic forces and the reduced propensity

to enroll in higher education shown in Table 3 suggest that the principal cause

decade.

of young graduates and raising their wages. In other o.h.C.D. countries the

demographic

end of

patterns will produce declines in the number of young

persons at the

the 1980s, suggesting that any improvement in the position of graduates

will not

begin until then. The demographic chauge is likely to have less impact

on nongraduate workers because they tend to be more ready substitutes for older

than are new university—trained personnel. In other countries, the
demographic swings are less dramatic, suggesting more modest chauges in the
workers

in ensuing periods. On the demand side, it is difficult to forecast how
technology and related factors will shift relative demand schedules. Diverse
market

forecasts, based on varying assumptions about future economic developments,

suggest no extraordinary change in relative demands, which leaves the shifts in
supply as the main moving force in the market.
While there may be some upswing and while there is unlikely to be any

further deterioration in the relative economic position of graduates, at least
in the l980s, I do not believe the market will rebound in general to such an
extent as to restore pre—1910s graduate/nongraduate differentials.
In this regard, it is of some value to contrast the position of hi0hly

educated workers across countries. Mi else the same, if the relative earnings
