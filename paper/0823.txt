December 1981

The Lender of Last Resort and the
Run on the Savings and Loans

ABSTRACT

Speculative runs on asset price fixing schemes are most often
attributed either to an inexplicable mass hysteria or to a sudden,

unpredictable random disturbance. Such attribution places runs and
panics outside of the realm of scientific inquiry. Alternatively, in
this paper I define the notion of a run as a discontinuous shift in
portfolio asset holdings brought about by a belief in the end of the

price fixing regime. I also argue that runs are foreseeable events and
employ the current difficulties of S & L's to serve as an extended
example which emphasizes such predictability.

As a result of the current high long—term interest rates, savings
institutions have reached the point of substantial insolvency, evaluating

their assets at market prices. While it is well-known that these
institutions are in severe financial difficulty, their depositors have

not yet attempted to transfer substantial funds to the close substitutes

provided by the commercial banks. Such a failure to take this reasonable
precaution must stem from depositorst confidence that, to prevent an
impairment, the government, in the form of the FSLIC, the FHLB, the
Treasury and the Federal Reserve, will make good at least those losses

already incurred. Given that this confidence is founded on the anticipated
actions of a hierarchical regulatory maze, the extent of whose resource
commitment to the savings institutions is murky, it .is uncertain how

much more capital loss can be sustained before the depositors respond.
Although depositors apparently believe that the government's resource
commitment has not yet been reached, further large capital losses may
impel them to attempt to remove massive amounts of deposits if they
believe that the government is not prepared to provide further support.
In this paper, I will study the nature and timing of a predictable
run by the depositors of SEL's in an environment of accelerating inflation.

Since, as they are currently managed, the SgL'S are creatures that can
survive only in a stable price environment, a run by depositors is
inevitable unless the government guarantees the SF,L's entire mortgage

portfolio. The run will cause the S&L's either to disappear or to
convert themselves into institutions like commercial banks or money market
funds. As long as the government, as a. lenJer of last resort, is willing

—2—

to restore the SgL's asset losses contingent upon a run, the run need

not imply a financial collapse of the SL's; the S&L's are merely
intermediaries which transfer the collapse to the government.

In this paper the government wears two hats. On the one hand
it generates an accelerating inflation as a manifestation of its entire

array of policy decisions. On the other hand, it guarantees to a limited
extent the assets of SL's in performing its duty as lender of last
resort. Since the inflation generated by government policies triggers
the run and forces a large transfer of real resources away from the
government, this transfer can be interpreted as a penalty paid by the

government for having created the accelerating inflation. The existence
of the S&L institution, which incurs growing capital losses under
accelerating inflation, together with a government deposit guarantee

serves as a restraint on inflationary government policies. If the
government raises the rate of inflation too much, the additional benefits
gained from the inflation are offset to some extent by its losses as

lender of last resort. Therefore, if the government raises inflation
rates sufficiently to cause a run on SgL's, then a possible inference
is that the government is willing to incur this one time loss in order
to gain the greater benefits associated with yet higher inflation rates.
In this case the SE,L institution continues to exist only as an ephemeral

manifestation of a transitional process; the S&L's as long-term lenders
are anachronisms from a stable price regime which will predictably
disappear after .a switch to an accelerating inflation.

—3—

The paper is divided into four sections. In section I, I present
a general discussion of the notion of a run on a financial institution
and define the difference among bubbles, runs, panics, and collapses.
In addition, I discuss the idea of a forseeable run on S&L's which will

be fleshed out formally later in the paper. In section II, I display
evidence relating to the current state of S&L's and to the restrictions

on their behavior which have produced their current difficulties. In
section III, I construct a formal example to demonstrate how to determine
the predictable time of an S&L run and to explore some other predictable

phenomena, such as downward shifts in rates of inflation, which materialize

when the run occurs. Section IV contains some concluding comments.

I. Predictable Runs and Collapses
The notion of a run always evokes images of a panic or mass
hysteria that destroys a financial institution which, in the absence

of such crowdaction, would be perfectly sound.1 In this context a
run must be a sudden, unanticipated event which catches by surprise
both the institution and the financial markets upon which it is forced

to dump its assets. However, recent developments of the rational
expectations concept have led to a conclusion that a run may be not

only perfectly rational but also perfectly predictable. In this section
I will discuss informally the general set of ideas that underly the
possibility of a predictable run, tracing its development in the
literature.

will

also distinguish among various terms associated

economic crises such as "panic", "bubble", and "collapse".

-

Finally,

I will present a verbal discussion of the model which serves

later to illustrate a run on the Savings and Loans.

(a) Differentiating among Runs, Collapses, Panics, and Bubbles
All of these concepts traditionally have been treated as manifestations of the same basic phenomenon: the outburst of an inexplicable
mass hysteria among economic agents of strength sufficient exactly to

realize that catastrophe that agents fear. Since they are inexplicable,
they have been interpreted as random disturbances to an economic system's
institutions, which are quite stable in their absence.

However, since runs and collapses can now be treated, at least

technically, as forseeable events, they can be distinguished from purely

unpredictable expectational exhilarations. To begin this distinction,
a run is defined as a speculative attack on an asset price fixing scheme
which causes a discontinuous asset shift in private agents' portfolios.
The run occurs because of agents' belief that the nature of the price
fixing regime will change, thereby causing a discontinuous shift in

asset rates of return. Examples of runs are speculative attacks on a
gold standard or a bank run. Note that the definition does not require
that the actual fixing of asset prices ends with the run but only that
the rules delineating the behavior of the price fixing institution are

expected to change. Indeed, in this paper's S&L example a run will not
terminate the fixed price between deposits and currency; it will only

extinguish further obligations of the lender of last resort. In a
model without perfect foresight, such a belief in institutional change,

—5—

depending on mistaken perceptions of how the price fixing institution
will respond, may be unjustified; so the fixed price regime may remain

unaltered after a run. In a model with perfect foresight, the belief
will be correct.
Agentst rational expectations of future events always may contain
an arbitrary, self-generating element in addition to anticipated future

movements of market fundamentals.2 If such arbitrary expectational
components enter asset price solutions, then asset prices are driven

in part by a "bubble". A run may be based purely on market fundamentals,
on agents' perception that the nature of the forcing variables driving
the economic system precludes the permanent existence of the current

price fixing regime. However, it may also occur because an arbitrary
expectation of price movement drives asset prices sufficiently also

to preclude the permanent existence of the price fixing regime.3 Thus,
an expectational bubble may generate a run, but a run can be caused by
a more general class of phenomena.

In a stochastic model, the moment of the run will not be perfectly
foreseen; in this case there may be discontinuous shifts in asset prices

and unanticipated capital losses or gains on some assets. Since a loss
can be avoided and a gain realized by agents' being the last to trade
at the old fixed price, the run will be characterized by an unplanned
rush or "panic" in which each agent leaps into a disorderly queue to

trade at the old price. The word "panic" can then be used to characterize
a run whose timing was not perfectly foreseen. If the end of the old
fixed price institution is perfectly foreseen, then there will be no

—6--

unruly mob associated with the discontinuous portfolio shift. The asset
exchange will be carefully arranged in an orderly manner far in advance

of the event. For example, a run on a banking system insured by a
central bank as lender of last resort will be a completely choreographed
pas de deux, with the central bank and the typical depositor performing
their assigned roles with perfect timing, terminating in the orderly
though sudden acquisition of the banks' assets by the central bankS
Again, the notion of a run is general; its chief characteristic is a
discontinuous asset shift which may occur either with a disorderly
panic or with the most decorous ceremony.
Finally, runs are often associated with a collapse of the institution

subjected to speculative attack. The collapse may assume the form of a
sudden shift in reserves from the price fixing institution to the public,

as would occur in a run on a gold standard or fixed exchange rate. The
institution's reservescan be said to collapse; however, this is offset

by the public's expansion of its reserves. On the other hand, the run
may cause a reduction of some of the economy's assets. For example, a
run on an uninsured banking system may force a destruction of deposits

and of the money stock. In each case, however, the run produces a
discontinuous decline in the asset holdings of the institution directly

under

attack.

If the price fixing institution is insured by another agent, then
the run is indirectly an attack on the agent providing the insurance.
The attacked institution becomes an agent of the speculators and merely

transmits the attack to the insurer. The insurer, not the insured
institution, suffers the collapse in its assets.

—7—

(b) Runs as Predictable Regime Switches
Models of predictable runs form a subclass of the set of models
of predictable regime switches which are now well-known in the rational

expectations literature. The first explicit model of a future regime
switch is that of Sargent and Wallace (1973) in which a forward-looking

solution determines the price level in a Cagan-type money market. Since
the model is based on a continuous-time, perfect-foresight environment,

a future anticipated discontinuity in the money stock will not cause any

discontinuities in the anticipated (and actual) price level path. In
Sargent and Wallace, the regime switch consists of a future jump in money
at an exogenously given time and magnitude.

While models of the timing of predictable runs and collapses

heavily exploit the forward solution and the implied continuity of
the anticipated price path, they drop the exogeneity of the regime

change's timingand magnitude. The time of the run is the time of the
regime change, and the run produces exactly that discontinuity in private
asset holding which makes feasible a change in regime while maintaining

market equilibrium and price continuity. Alternatively stated, a
regime switch occurs only in the contingency of a run; without a run
the old regime would remain in effect.

Salant and Henderson (1978) developed the prototype run model
in studying a predictable speculative attack on a government scheme

to fix the relative gold price. The fixed price system shatters,
conditional on a run on the government's gold stocks, into a new regime

which allows gold's price to float. The run causes a discontinuity

—8—

in the government's and private sector's gold holdings without price

discontinuity. Because real capital gains to hoarding gold are suddenly
available in the new regime, agents rationally demand this discontinuous

increase in their holdings, Krugman (1973), studying a run—induced
switch from a fixed to a flexible exchange rate system, employed a

similar methodology. Again, a discontinuous shift jn reserve holdings
is exactly the requirement to preserve exchange rate continuity at the

transition time between the two regimes. In exploring the collapse of
a gold standard, Flood and Garber (1981a) extended this methodology to
a two-asset model in which gold has monetary uses.

Endogenous runs need not occur only in the context of a government

price fixing scheme. A bank which attempts to fix the currency value

of its deposits may also be run by its depositors. In Flood and Garber
(1981b), a banking system suffering nominal capital losses in a deflationary
situation eventually refuses to maintain sufficient assets to meet its

nominal liabilities. At this point the depositors, faced with incipient
capital losses, run the banking system and force a collapse in the money

supply. However, the time of the bank run is independent of some reserve
pool, unlike the gold and exchange fixing schemes. Rather, the movement
of the nominal interest rate through a floor, signalling that bank owners
are unwilling to maintain properly the banks' nominal asset value, triggers
the run.

In summary, all models of foreseeable runs contain a set of common

features. They are continuous-time, rational expectations models, so
the anticipated paths of assei prices are continuous. They involve a

—9-

scheme to fix the relative price of at least a pair of assets, and the
run occurs simultaneously with the end of the old price fixing scheme.
At the time of the run there is a discontinuous shift in the amount of

various assets held in the public's portfolio. Some assets either are
destroyed as in an uninsured bank run or are increased discontinuously

as in a run on an institution insured by a lender of last resort. At
the time of the run there is a discontinuous shift in some assets' rates

of return, which produces the shift in portfolio holdings. Also contem—
poraneously with the run, a shift in the policy or institutional regime
occurs which changes the dynamic laws of motion of the economic system,
thereby producing the discontinuity of asset returns; the switch in
regime is always contingent upon the occurence of the run.

(c) The Run on Savings and Loans
I will now present a verbal outline of a model exemplifying a run
on S&L's, which, due both to direct restrictions and to tax advantages,
hold the bulk of their assets in long-term, fixed-interest mortgages.
In 'a stable price era, most of these assets will earn approximately the

same coupon rate of interest, reflecting an historic belief in low and

steady future nominal interest rates. However, if a permanent regime
of accelerating inflation unexpectedly replaces the stable price regime,

the market value of S&L's assets at the time of the change will decline
sharply, perhaps enough to produce a negative market net worth.
Without government deposit guarantees, the depositors would
immediately run the SEL's, attempting to avoid the capital loss implied

—1.0—

by negative net worth. Unable to meet depositors' demands, the S&L's
would be closed by their regulatory authority, ultimately to pay out

the market value of the remaining assets. Also, share values in the
non-mutual S&Lts would collapse to zero.

However, if the government guarantees deposits, there will be no
run because depositors incur no capital loss and the rate of return on

deposits remains attractive. Since no run occurs and since the book
value accounting violates no regulatory restrictions, the S&L's can

remain in operation. They may even earn accounting profits on their
operation to be paid out as dividends, thereby allowing their share
prices to remain positive.5

To provide a sufficient ccndition for a run on SL's, however,
I will assume that the government limits the amount which it will pay

out to rescue S&L depositors. I will also assume that the accelerating
inflation eventually drives SE,L market capital losses high enough so

that this limit is attained in finite time. The limit may be simply
a given nominal amount. More likely, it may be a proportion of the

nominal deposits. 6

.

Finally, it may be some given real amount. In

this paper I will select the proportion of deposits as the limit purely

because it allows some easy manipulations in the formal example presented
below.

Once the maximum government support level is reached, any new

capital loss will accrue to the S&L depositors. Before this time,
the rates of return on S&L deposits, by regulation always slightly
higher than those paid on commercial bank time deposits and somewhat in line with interest paid on money market funds, are sufficient

—11—

to prevent a deposit outflow to these institutions. However, when SL
depositors suddenly must add their capital loss to their interest
receipts, there is a discontinuous fall in the rate of return on SCLJ

deposits. This produces an attempt to shift deposits to other institutions, which, holding short term assets, do not face these capital

losses. The sudden attempt to shift deposits precipitates the run,
forcing the government to make good the SaWs capital losses.

After the run the S&Ws may disappear, their depositors transferring
their funds to commercial banks. Alternatively, they may continue to
exist, providing that they are permitted to shift their portfolio
exclusively to short term assets or, equivalently, to turn over continuously

their entire portfolio of long term assets.7 I will assume that the
latter change in S&L behavior occurs with the run so that I can avoid
analyzing the effect of deposit shifts on high-powered money demand.

The government has a number of means to finance this rescue. The
central bank, acting as the lender of last resort, may buy the S&L assets
at book value less book net worth, sell them at market value, and absorb
the difference through a creation of high-powered money which monetizes

the entire government obligation. Since agents would foresee the
discontinuous increase in high-powered money at the time of the run,
this policy would cause prices and nominal interest rates to rise at
an exponentially increasing rate prior to the run with the inflation
rate dropping discontinuously when the run occurs, as in Sargent and

Wallace (1973). In turn, this policy would affect the time of the run.
Alternatively, the government may present the S&Ws with Treasury

—12—

securities equal in value to the difference between the book and market

value of S&L assets, less net worth. If this additional government debt
is not monetized in the future, the price path prior to the run is driven
only by the original underlying inflationary policy; and there will be
no discontinuity in short term inflation rates when the run materializes.
To the extent that the central bank gradually monetizes this debt, there
will be a foreseeable shift to a yet more inflationary monetary process
when the run occurs, again causing a simultaneous, discontinuous fall
in the inflation rate.

I will assume in this paper that the lender of last resort is the
central bank; when a run materializes, the central bank will bail out
depositors by discontinuously increasing the high-powered money stock.
This assumption stems from my belief that a run by depositors is exactly
that sort of event which galvanizes the central bank to fulfill its

responsibility as lender of last resort. In the most recent U.S.
example, the Federal Reserve delayed categorizing the bank failures
of the early 1930's as a systematic crisis, preferring to consider the
failing banks as unsoundly managed and therefore deserving of failure.
The latitude for such discretion severly narrowed with the banking

collapse of 1933. The Federal Reserve, demoralized by the universal
acceptance of the Friedman-Schwartz (1963) censure of its actions in
the 1930's, will be the institution most likely to leap to the rescue
of S&L depositors in order to minimize the possibility of future censure.
Of course, if the rescue originates from this monetary source the run
will occur much earlier and the discontinuous shift in inflation rates

will be much greater than if the Treasury finances the rescue. However,
the Federal Reserve could force the Treasury to bear the costs of the
bail-out by sterilizing it with open-market sales of Treasury securities;

such a possibility will be contained in the formal model.

II.

The Current Situation of the Savings Institutions
In this section I shall present data indicating the current state

of the Savings and Loans, comparing it to those of the commercial and

mutual banks. In addition I shall discuss the nature of the insurance
and regulatory scheme constraining the SgL's, focusing on the state of
the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance

Corporation balance sheets. Finally, I will provide a discussion of
some possible schemes for protecting S&L deposits and maintaining the

existence of S&L's, These serve as alternatives to the pure money
creation scheme which I study in Section Ill's dynamic model.

(a) Balance Sheets of Depository Institutions
Table I contains data on the evolution of SL and mutual savings
bank balance sheets since 1978, measured at book value. About 80% of
SEL assets consist of long-term, fixed interest mortgages while mutuals

hold 60% of assets in mortgages.9 Part of the remaining S&L assets are
more liquid, comprised of cash, demand deposits, short term government
securities, time deposits in commercial banks, and banker's acceptances.
S&L's are required by the FHLB to hold a minimum percentage of these

assets against deposits of maturity less than one year. Other assets
consist of real estate holdings, stock in the FHLB, and reserves at

the FSLIC, Savings capital is the term for deposits in the S&L's.
The other important liability categories are borrowings from the FHLB

and Net Worth. Note that FHLB advances increased by 200% between
December, 1978 and August 1981, the bulk of the increase occuring in

Nevertheless, at a 16% discount rate the book value of these mortgages

exceeds the market value by $149 billion. The book value of S&L liabilities
also overstates their market value because some deposits are made for a

number of years at fixed rates. However, since the liabilities are of
much shorter duration than the assets (see Table IV), the market value
of the liabilities must exceed that of assets by an order of magnitude

given by the $149 billion figure at current long term rates. In addition
to the market value of financial assets and liabilities, there is also
a market value associated with the S&L's as going concerns which should

be added to the other assets in determining the degree of SL insolvency
at market prices. One may place either a fairly high or fairly low value
on this component of S&L assets, depending on what remains of the SaLts

monopoly position in the new regulatory environment. Regardless of the
going concern value, however, it is difficult to escape the conclusion
that the $33 billion S&L book net worth in 1980 overstates the market
net worth by upwards of $100 billion, and long term interest rates have
since risen above 16%..

heavy savings withdrawals. Therefore, the assets of the FHLB consist
almost entirely of advances to S&L's, a category which has substantially
increased in the last fewyears.12 The primary liabilities which finance

the advances are the consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, which are FHLBB debt instruments sold to private agents at

market rates. In emergencies, the U.S. Treasury is empowered to purchase

$ billion of

FHLBB obligations. In addition, the Federal Open Market

Committee of the Federal Reserve is empowered to purchase and sell the

debt issue of federal agencies such as the FHLBB. Thus, indirectly
through the FHLB, the Federal Reserve is the only immediate lender of last

resort to the S&L's)3 The Federal Reserve can also lend directly to SgL's.
The FSLIC completely insures S&L deposits against loss up to

$100,000. When an S&L becomes insolvent (in book value terms) the
FSLIC manages the liquidation, merger, or recovery of the SFL,

perhaps

infusing it with some of its assets to assure no loss to depositors.

As of March, 1981, its assets equalled $6.7 billion, the bulk held

in U.S. government securities. The FSLIC can borrow up to $750 million
from the Treasury, assess premiums against its members, and require
deposits from its members of 1% of their savings deposits.

There are some restrictions on S&L behavior which are of immediate

relevance to the model in the next section. The FSLIC classifies an
S&L as a problem institution if it is insolvent or projected soon to

be insolvent in book value terms, not in market value terms. Thus,
an S&L which is obviously insolvent in market terms is permitted to
continue unhindered operations as long as its book net worth does not

—24—

fall too low. In addition, not accounting for current capital losses,
it may earn large book profits and therefore pay dividends to its share-

holders even though its market net worth is negative. This provides an
incentive for a stock S&L which is insolvent at market value to lock
itself in to its portfolio of long—term mortgages, never turning them

over, lest it impair its book net worth.1 To the extent that the
managements of the mutual S&L's claim the residual book profits, they
would behave the same as the owners of stock S&L's.

Only the FSLIC is obligated to protect the deposits of S&L's.
As an insurance company it can readily meet this obligation if a single

S&L becomes insolvent. However, in the case of the current systematic
insolvency, the FSLIC, whose resources are obviously insufficient,

cannot be the institution sustaining the S&L's. There must be a belief
of S&L depositors that the next higher level of regulators, the Federal

Reserve and the Treasury, will guarantee S&L deposits. Though no such
explicit guarantee exists, there are at least legal channels through
which primarily the Federal Reserve can provide substantial support
to the SaL's in a crisis.

(c) Alternate Means of Protecting S&L Deposits
A basic assumption behind the next section's model of an S&L
run is that the Federal Reserve will create a limited amount of high-

powered money to protect SL depositors when the run occurs. Of course,
a wide variety of alternate methods may materialize, some of which appear
to

preclude

a run entirely. In

this

section I will discuses afew such

—25—

alternatives and determine whether they will avoid a run, given the
definition of Section II.
I will assume throughout that the Federal Reserve maintains the
underlying policy of accelerating inflation which causes the insolvency

in the first place. If the Federal Reserve were suddenly to replace
the policy with one aimed at price stability, then the market value

of SL assets would jump upward to remove the insolvency problem.
Any cash flow problems which may remain through sluggish adjustment
of the public's expectations can be covered by temporary FHLB advances.
I will also assume in this section that the government explicitly

guarantees all of the SL deposits, thereby removing the depositors'
incentive to shift out of S&L's. Since there will never arise a need
for the government to infuse massive amounts of its liabilities into
the asset side of the SF,L's balance sheets, it appears that there
cannot be a run.

Even if the government guarantees all deposits, the SaL's must
eventually experience continual flow losses as the revenues generated
by their assets fall short of the interest payments to depositors.
If the government does not subsidize this shortfall, the depositors

will withdraw their funds, precipitating a run according to the definition

of Section II. The explicit guarantee is not sufficient to
preclude a run. The guarantee is not free; it imposes an obligation
of a continual and growing transfer from the government to depositors.
Hence, a sudden, explicit guarantee of all deposits is equivalent to

a sudden transfer of government securities to the S&L's. The only
question is the manner by which these securities are to be financed.

—26—

One method of finance which is possible under current legal
arrangements consists of the Federal Reserve's purchasing FHLBB

obligations. The FHLBB then will make advances to the S&L's which
are used to pay the interest to the depositors. If advances were
counted as liabilities of the SaL's, then this operation would appear
to an outsider as a Ponzi scheme since there would be no way to repay

the FHLB advances. In reality, these advanoes would not be S&L liabilities
but simply a measurement of the cumulated interest payments from the

government's security ransfer implicit in the deposit guarantee.
Under this method of finance, agents can foresee that the Federal
Reserve will shift from its underlying money generation policy to a
yet more inflationary policy when the S&L's cash flow problem materializes.
This expectation will influence the time paths of inflation and short
term interest rates, thereby affecting the timing of the cash flow
problem and of the regime shift.
Alternatively, interest payments to S&L depositors can be financed

by the Treasury. As long as this Treasury expenditure is not ultimately
financed by money creation, the paths of the inflation and short term
interest rates will be driven only by the underlying money creation

policy. However, the nature of the revenue raising method is important
in preventing a run. The tax levied to finance this extra expenditure

cannot be placed entirely on SL depositors. For example, financing
the interest payments through general revenues will not alter the return
on S&L deposits relative to those

in commercial banks. Similarly,

a tax

on all deposits and on money market funds also would not alter the return
on

S&L deposits relative to close substitutes.16

—27—

Since the government must somehow generate resources to guarantee

SL deposits, all of these mechanismsare quite similar. They prevent
a run by maintaining the return on SL deposits relative to those on
other liquid assets. Either the Federal Reserve or the Treasury must
generate the resources for this activity; and the source of these funds

will influence the time path of the inflation rate. In the next section
I present a formal model for determining the paths of the inflation and
short-term interest rates and the timing of a run under the regulatory
response which seems most likely, a limited bailout by the Federal Reserve.

III. An Example of a Run on the S&L's
This section contains a formal example to illustrate the foreseeable

S&L run concept discussed in previous sections, The model developed here

win be

purely monetary; since all events are predictable, monetary changes

wilL not affect real variables. Although a more general model might include
monetary-real interactions, the paper's emphasis centers on the nominal

affects of anticipated S&L runs, abstracting away from real affects. This
assumed separation of monetary from real phenomena will not affect qualitative results on the timing and nature of an anticipated run.

1hile I have assumed that agents have perfect foresight to analyze this
problem, a possible alternative is to assume that random, unanticipated

monetary regime changes may occasionally occur. For instance the world may
begin with a stable-price monetary regime in which S&Lts have a non-negative

net worth. An unanticipated shift to an accelerating monetary growth policy
will then cause a discontinuous fall in long-term bond prices, making the

—28—

S&L's insolvent. This locks SF,L's into holding their mortgage portfolio
and produces an eventual run, barring a shift to a less inflationary

monetary regime. In this light, the following analysis can be interpreted
as a study of the events in the money and SL deposit markets after an
unanticipated switch to an accelerating inflation and conditional on no
further basic monetary policy changes.

The basic model of the monetary sector used here is similar to that

in Flood and Garber (l981b). I will assume that the money supply M consists
of currency in circulation C and corrunerical bank deposits D* so that M = C ÷

D*. The demand for money is a function of the instantaneous nominal interest

rate and real income or wealth. Real variables will be assumed constant to
simplify the analysis; so the demand for money can be written as md_p =

— a,

a >

0,

where md and p are the logarithms of money demand and the

price level, respectively, and

is the time derivative of p.

is composed

in part of the constant real income and real rate of interest while a is a

semi-elasticity of demand. Defining m log M, the money market equilibrium
condition is

(1)

m-p-ap.
The money supply depends on the supply of monetary base and on agents'

portfolio decisions to hold cash ani demand deposits. Since a simple money
multiplier model will serve present ?urposes, I will assume that commercial

bank reserves R and currency holdings are a constant fraction o commercial
bank deposits, i.e., R =

and C 4D. Then letting H represent the

—29—

quantity of base money, D =

H/(÷c)

and M = rH where F

Throughout the analysis I will assume that the money multiplier remains

constant

17

SSL deposits are substitutes for deposits in commercial banks and

for short term loans. The lemand for SL deposits D will be proportional
to commercial bank deposits i.e., D = OD*.

The ratio 0 3hould be dependent

on the difference in the returns to S&L deposits, SL and to bank deposits,
i*. Without deposit capital losses, these rates are approximately equal so
o should be constant.'8 However, if S&L depositors suddenly face capital
losses on deposits, then there will be an incipient downward shift in 0.
The incipient change in 0 will prove crucial in generating an incipient
run on S&L deposits.

The asset side of commercial bank balance sheets consists of reserves

and short term nominal assets; the liabilities are deposits only.19 SgL's
will hold as assets only consols, each of which pays $1 per period; liabilities

consist only of deposits.20 Both commercial bank and SL income will be
expended on payments to depositors, operation costs, and payments to owners.
The interest forgone on reserve holdings and expended on operation costs will

reflect the services of these institutions as financial intermediaries.
The supply of monetary base depends on the actions of the central bank.
For whatever policy reasons, the central bank chooses a particular underlying

process for generating base money. To provide a sufficient condition to
trigger an SL run, the analysis will begin at a time at which the central
bank has already selected a path such that base money grows at an ever-

accelerating rate. Defining h

log H, the monetary base evolves according

to
(2)

h(t)

h(0) + S(exp {Xt} —

1)

—30—

where S, A > 0 and cX

<

1.

At t

0, base money is h(O); and for any t,

it grows at a percentage rate A6exp {At}. This money growth process is
deterministic and perfectly anticipated.

In addition to a central bank, there is a lender of last resort

whose function is to prevent the collapse of the banking system. This
institution may be either the central bank, the government, or a combination

of the two. To prevent collapses, the lender of last resort must ultimately
be prepared to guarantee banking institution deposits against loss, conditional on a systematic bank run.

I will assume that while the lender of

last resort is willing to sustain unlimited losses in protecting the
commercial banks, it refuses to restore S&L losses beyond a certain

proportion of the moretary base, a*H.21 While the quantity aH is the
amount transferred from the lender of last resort toSL depositors
when the run occurs, not all of aH will materialize as new base money.
A proportion

of this asset transfer will be new monetary base; the

remainder will assume the form of government debt financed by future
taxes.

Therefore, the base money supply process consists of two components,

the discontinuous jump, iaH, resulting from the activity of the lender of
last resort and the underlying process in (2) resulting from whatever other

motives which may influence the central bank's decisions. Defining
a

generating the monetary base is

The nominal market-valued capital loss on SL assets attains a*H(z)
at time z. Before z, depositors do not net current capital losses out of
their current interest returns because the lender of last resort incurs

the loss. After z depositors must subtract the new portfolio capital losses
from their returns, so there is a sudden, discontinuous decline in S&L net
returns relative to substitutes and a consequent desire to shift discontinu—

ously out of S&L deposits. The incipient shift forces the lender of last
resort to make good the cumulated losses, thereby shifting the high powered
money stock upward at time z.22 Given the time z of the run, the intuition
of the model is then quite similar to that arising in Sargent and Wallace

(1973) where there is a forseeable future money supply jump. Prior to z,
the price level grows at ever-accelerating rates, even beyond those dictated

by the currently observable money growth process. When the money discontinuity
occurs, a discontinuous decline in the inflation rate also materializes with
no price level discontinuity.
The central problem is to find conditions which determine the time of

the run. If the S&L's operate long enough, they will eventually reach .a
point when the income generated by their assets is insufficient to pay the

near-market rates demanded by their depositors. Since it is possible that
this shortfall emerges prior to the asset capital losses' reaching the
limit set by the lender of last resort, I will later discuss a means of

determining z -(ith this compliatict. Hwver, I will first analyze the
time of the run for the situation in which the system first reaches the
capital loss limit.

The procedure for finding z consists first of solving the money
market for the path of the instaneous inflation rate as a function of z.

—32—

From the inflation rates and the assumed constancy of the real rate, the
path of the instantaneous nominal interest rate is readily available through

the Fisher equation. By use of the instantaneous interest rates to discount
the future stream of consol coupon payments, the current market

price PB(t)

of consols can be found as a function of z. Together with the knowledge
of how S&L deposits and consol holdings evolve, PB(t) can be used to

determine the total cumulated S&L capital loss as a function of z.

z can

then be solved as the time that this cumulated loss equals the limit set

by the lender of last resort. Because of the nonlinearities involved, z
will emerge as a zero of a fairly complicated non—linear equation.

Equation (1) is a first-order differential equation in p. After some
calculation (see appendix), the forward solution, using the base money
generation process (3), can be determined as

At time t

rate of return is 1(t) =

At any time the market value of a consol is

By substituting for i(c) from the Fisher equation and for (c) from (5),
PB(t) can be written more explicitly; but sparing the reader the necessity

When the book value of S&L deposits D(z) less the market value of
assets PB(z).B(z) equals the lender of last resort's payout limit, the

run occurs. Therefore, z can be determined as the solution to D(z) —

PB(z)•B(z)

Evidently (8) is a single, very complicated equation in the unknown

z. It is not clear that a run will occur prior to the S&L's being unable
to generate income sufficient to pay depositors' interest. In particular,
if the lender of last resort is willing to make an unlimited guarantee of
depositor losses contingent on run, i.e., if p

<a,

then a run will never

erupt; for the market value of S&L assets cannot shrink to zero in finite
time.

Suppose now that the S&L's reach a point when income is insufficient
to service interest on deposits and that their capital loss has not reached

the maximum limit. If no other intervention occurs, then the interest rate
paid on SF,L deposits will decline relative to substitutes, generating an

outflow of SL deposits. The S&L's must sell off assets, causing a book
loss to materialize, impairing book net worth, and forcing a regulatory

intervention. As an alternative to prevent such disruptions and to avoid

such drastic actions, the regulatory authorities may lend the SL's the
difference between their interest payments and incomes. Since the SCL's
can never repay such loans they will continually grow through the addition

of new loans and the refinancing of old ones.23 Eventually, the cumulated
loans plus the capital loss on S&L assets will reach the limit set by

the lender of last resort. If the loan component of this sum is not
monetized prior to the run then the solutions for p and

Conclusion
This paper is intended as a study of a forseeable run on a financial

institution. The behavior of private agents and institutions has been
severely restricted so that the derivation of basic results can be achieved

using the simplest possible framework. In particular, real and monetary
phenomena have been separated; various assets are privately held in

constant proportions; SL's are prohibited from holding short term assets;
the regulatory authority imposes book value accounting; and the central
bank implements a monetary policy guaranteed to generate attacks on. the
syst em.

Of these restrictions, the central bank's monetary policy seems most

dubious in generating a run of the sort analyzed here, though current policy

may yet prove as inflationary as I assume. Some of the other assumptions,
such as constant asset proportions or S&L behavior, can be justified at

least partly by appeal to data or by regulatory constraints. The separation

-36—

of

real from monetary phenomena is consistent with the perfect foresight

assumption, given most currently fashionable business cycle models.
The result which deserves the central emphasis is the possibility

of perfectly anticipating a future run on a financial institution. To
demonstrate the predictability of a run in the S&L context is not startling,

considering current conditions. However, the notion of predictability is
general; models of anticipated runs can be built for a wide spectrum of

markets. Given such models it is possible to address the concept of a
run employing the legitimate techniques at the economistts disposal rather
than confessing the complete ignorance implicit in characterizing the
phenomenon as a panic or mass hysteria.

Notes

'For example, this seems to. be the justification for Friedman and

Schwartz's (1963) approbation of the establishment of the FDIC as a device
to protect the monetary system.
2Keynes' (1936) famous Chapter 12 discusses such arbitrary expectatjonal elements.

31n Flood and Garber (1981b, c), runs caused both by market fundamentals
and by bubbles are explored in the context of a bank run and of a run on a
fixed exchange rate system.

4However, they will be locked into their current assets. It may be
desirable to sell these assets at a loss so that their coupon payments

are not accounted as taxable profits. Unfortunately, such an action may
reduce book net worth below required levels, thereby forcing closure of
the bank and ending the dividend stream paid to its owners.

5Ultimately, the S&L's may experience a cash flow problem, as the low
coupon payments on old mortgages will prove insufficient to meet the rising

short term rates demanded by depositors. At this point, the SFL's may
receive loans from the government in the form of FHLB advances or tax

breaks to new depositors. The former is a Ponzi scheme with the proceeds
from the new liabilities being used to pay interest to old depositors.

Both should also be counted as part of the finite rescue effort of the

government. These schemes will be discussed more fully in Sections II
and III.

6The funds available to the FSLIC for rescuing troubled SL's are
a given proportion of nominal deposits.

—38—

7The turnover of long—term assets is required so that S&L's can

continuously realize their capital losses on their books. Without this
possibility, since the long—term rate is temporarily higher than the
short-term rate, there is an appearance of a taxable book profit.
Currently, the SE,L industry is changing its assets to instruments

with annually renegotiable interest rates. These are basically short-term
loans with an automatic roll-over provision.
8The Federal Reserve has limited latitide in forcing the Treasury

to finance the entire loss. The amount of Federal Reserve credit currently
is somewhat less than estimated S&L capital losses.
9

The S6L's hold the bulk of assets as mortgages due to a combination

of regulatory restrictions and tax advantages. For a discussion of the
tax treatment of SEL's, see Biederman and Tuccillo (1975) and Goodman (1980).

The stockassociations comprised l7 of the number of S&L's at the

end of 1979 with 25% of the assets. See U.S. League of Savings Associations
(1980, p. 51).

"The FSLIC requires reserves of 5% of total savings accounts. In
March, 1980, the FHLB was permitted to change the requirement in a range
of 3% to 6%.

'2Regulations of the FHLB adopted in May, 1980 limit an SL's borrowings
from the FHLB to 50% of the S&L's assets. See U.S. League of Sav5ngs
Associations, p. 101.

with some amount of legislative delay.

The Federal Reserve has recently begun making direct loans to thrift

Bulletin, September, 1981, pp. 709-711.

15See Guttentag and Herring (1981) for a case of an S&L which shifted
its. asset portfolio, improving its market net worth while reducing its
book net worth, thereby forcing itself into a merger.

16However, demand would shift toward currency to some extent. Financing
the protection of SSL depositors in this way could then cause a one-time,

discontinuous decline in the money supply at the time of the SL cash-flow
problem. In this case the inflation and interest rates would grow less
rapidly prior to the decline than in the case of general revenue financing.
17The constancy of r simplifies the nature of the differential

equations governing the price level. More generally,

should depend on

the relative rates of return between currency and commercial bank deposits.

However, since the data do not indicate much movement in r in the face of
large interest rate movements, there seems little to gain from adding this
complication.

8The

direct interest payments are regulated, with S&L's allowed to

pay slightly higher rates than commercial banks. Also, S&L rates on
many deposits move with money-market short rates.
19Commerical bank 'net worth can be ignored since commercial banks

will remain solvent throughout.
also hold some short assets, borrow from the FHLB, and have

some net worth. Since the bulk of SL assets are long-term, fixed-i'ate
mortgages, short assets will not be considered here. Also, I start the
world in a state in which SaL's have negative net worth, so book net worth

can be ignored. Finally, I will assume that the bail out takes the form
of a post-run asset infusion and treat advances only in the case that the

government subsidizes interest payments on SL deposits.

21The form of this limit is chosen purely for analytical convenience.
discussion assumes that there is a change in the nature of
S&L's after the run. If the SF,L's continued to hold long-term assets,
they would again eventually be unable to pay the appropriate short—term

interest rates to depositors, Hence, they would disappear with the run;
and the assets into which their former deposits were converted would affect

the analysis of the price paths. If instead SL's were allowed to hold only
short-term assets, then they become similar to commercial banks or moneymarket funds.

The arguments used in the text implicitly assume that SEWs

transform themselves into money-market funds; then no new base money

reserves are suddenly required against S&L deposits. On the other hand,
if SL's blend into corm-nercial banks, then the money multiplier and the

derived demand for base money shift after the run.
23Recall the rapid growth of FHLB advances to S&L's.
