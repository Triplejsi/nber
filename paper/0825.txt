The Impacts on Capital Allocation of Some
Aspects of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981
ABSTRACT

This paper

develops and employs

a

five-asset, four-household and

sector simulation model to measure the long-run impacts
of the major provisions of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 on
single-business

the allocation of a fixed capital stock among owner-occupied housing,
rental housing, and nonresidential capital. The specific provisions
analyzed are the increases in tax depreciation for nonresidential capital
and rental housing and the reduction in the maximum tax rate on unearned
income.

Our analysis suggests a 6 percent increase in nonresidential capital,
an 11 percent decline in owner-occupied housing and little change in
rental housing (the increase in the number of renters - - the homeownership
rate declines by l percentage points -- offsets a decline in the quantity
of rental services demanded per renter). In the absence of an increase

in aggregate saving, real pretax interest rates rise by nearly two
points. Corporate profit taxes decline by 60 percent, and
after-tax earnings rise by 25 percent. As a result of the Act, the net
percentage

(of depreciation) user costs for the three types of capital will almost
be equalized.

SOME

THE IMPACTS ON CAPITAL ALLOCATION OF
*
ASPECTS OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981

About four years ago, Hendershott and Hu computed net (of depreciation)
user costs of capital for several types of nonfinancial capital:

producers durables and structures of both corporations and unincorporated

businesses, rental housing, and owner-occupied housing.1 Owing to differences
in taxation and financing, the net user costs were lower for housing

(especially owner-occupied) than for industrial capital. Moreover, the
spread between the user costs on industrial (especially corporate) and

residential (especially owner-occupied) capital had risen between the

middle 1960s

and late 19708 in

response to the increase in inflation.

The net result was obviously 'toverinvestment" in owner-occupied housing in

the 1970s, although the extent of this was tempered by downpayment and

cash-flow constraints and mortgage capital gains.2 The obvious economic,
although not political, solution to this misallocation problem would be to
tax owner-occupied housing more heavily (e.g., tax imputed rents), thereby

raising its user cost relative to that of industrial capital.

Hendershott

and

Hu noted that the same effect on relative net user

costs could be achieved by taxing industrial capital less heavily;

instead of removing tax subsidies to housing, subsidies could be extended
to business capital, e.g., the employment of historic cost tax depreciation
while using accelerated depreciation schedules and allowing investment

tax credits. Businesses would bid for funds to finance capital expansion,
driving up real pretax interest

tax changes that would tend to equate the net user costs for the six

capital goods they studied.

2

The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 appears to be a major step
in this direction. The decrease in tax service lives for business capital
more than offsets the increase in the effective corporate tax rate
(at the current inflation rate) generated by historic cost depreciation

and LIFO inventory accounting. In addition, the cut in the maximum tax
rate on unearned income (and thus on equity cap±tal gains), the expansion
of IRA accounts and the eventual partial exclusion of interest income from

taxation

significantly raises the attractiveness of investment in assets

other than owner-occupied housing.

Nonresidential Capital and Output

Our economy contains two goods, housing and nonhousing. The nonhousing
good is produced by nonresidential corporate capital and labor via a Cobb-

Douglas production function

(1) Y=K'I
where Y is the level of nonhousing output; L is the labor force; and K is
the quantity of nonresidential capital employed which is determined by
equating the value of its marginal product to its user cost. Thus,

III.

The Demands for Housing Services

The specification of the demand for housing services and the rentalownership tenure choice deals simultaneously with the discrete and continuous

aspects of housing decisions. Following King (1981), we posit a translog
indirect utility function for the ith household in the jth class as

log Vjj =

where

is the price of the composite commodity, the

are positive constants,

reflects the effects of the idiosyncracies in tastes of the

and

household. Except for these idiosyncracies, the households within our
four income classes are identical.

The individual household is assumed to make

the

tenure choice that

maximizes its utility. Assuming the stochastic utility components, the
are independently and identically distributed with a double-exponential
distribution, the logarithm of the odds of households in the jth class
choosing to own rather than rent is

(log cr)2

where co and cr equal P/P°, depending on whether the household owns or
rents. (These c's are generally referred to as real user costs.) This
expression is known as the logit probability model [for more details

see Domeneich and Mcadden (1975)].
The data on the probability of homeownership are taken from the Annual

Survey

for the years

1973 to 1979. This study analyzes the tenure

decision for households over time by real income groups. The

and over 25,000. Tile probability, o, that a household in income c].ass

homeowners to the number of households in that income class.

The calculation of the user cost of capital of rental housing
utilized in the analysis is an extension of that described in Hendershott

and Shilling (1981). The extension consists of viewing the aptimal behavior
of art investor in rental housing as: 1) investing In rental housing until
the marginal product of capital equals the user cost, and 2) choosing an

optimal

holding

period in order to maximize wealth. The basis for determining

the real user cost of capital of rental housing then depends on maximizing

the present value of all

future expected cash flows generated over the

optimal holding period of the property or equivalently

minimizing the

user cost of capital with respect to the optimal holding period.

on rental housing is ambiguous. Given the small reduction in the

of rental housing relative to the significant rise in interest
rates, the user cost of rental housing will likely rise, lowering the demand
per renting unit. On the other hand, the user cost of rental housing
will likely fall relative to that of owner-occupied housing, causing a
taxation

shift in tenure tord rental housing.

22a

We wish to emphasize the strong assumption employed here that total

saving is unaffected by the cut in tax depreciation. Not only do households
not increase their saving in response to the increase in real rates of
return, but they fully offset the increase in business saving (retained

earnings). That is, households fully 'pierce the corporate veil." We
would

anticipate

thus a dampening

a significant increase in total private saving and

of

the tendency for interest rates to increase. Ignoring

the saving response allows us to concentrate on the allocative effects
of the tax changes.
The impact of a reduction in the taxation of' rental housing only seemn

clear. While this reduction, too, will raise interest rates, the user cost
of rental housing will fall, while those of owner-occupied housing and

nonresidential capital will rise. There will be less owner-occupied
housing, owing to both lower demand per unit and fewer owning units, and
less nonresidential capital.

Because a reduction in

lowers

the

demands for owner-occupied

housing, rental housing and nonresidential capital -

- all schedules

shift

to the left with the shift being greater for RES than for AOH and for CAP

than for RES. Interest rates will decline sufficiently to maintain total
demand for capital equal to the given stock. Unfortunately, the directional
impacts on the specific capital components cannot be ascertained from

Figure 1. This would, of course, lead one to suspect that these impacts
are not large.

Our presentation of the simulation results of the Tax Act is divided
into four parts in order to Illustrate both the impacts of the different

tax changes and the workings of the model. The first three parts deduce

in maximum tax rate on unearned

income, and

the

increase in tax depreciation of rental housing. The fourth part computes
the combined impact of these three changes.

Increase in Tax Depreciation of Nonresidential Capital
The simulation results reported in Tables 6 and 7 reflect the impact
of a shortening of tax service lives of corporate capital (an increase

in tax depreciation). More specifically, we lowered the real user cost
of corporate capital exogenaus].y so as to reflect passage of Jones-Conable

or the 10-5-3 depreciation tax lives. In earlier work, Sheng Hu and I
calculated that this legislation would lower the real user cost,
ceteris paribus, by 1 percentage points (Hendershott and Hu, 1981b, p. 99).

While a 15-5-3 depreciation schedule is less valuable to businesses than
10-5-3,

the

Recovery Tax Act has

some tax reduction features in addition

to the cut in the tax services lives. For example, the investment tax credit
for equipment was broadened, the credit being roughly doubled for equipment
with a useful life under 7 years •

The credit was also expanded to cover

facilities used for storage of petroleum and its primary products, and

the carryback period was extended to 15 years. In any event, we have
simply lowered the tax depreciation component of the real user cost by

latter shift being over 50 percent. While the ratio of the exempt

to taxable debt yields declines from 0.70 to 0.67, the spread between the

exempt and after-tax taxable debt yield rises for those in the highest

tax group. The net yield on rental housing also rises for this group.
The dollar movement into equities and out of housing and exempts is about

a wash for the three lower income groups, so changes in their debt holdings

28

are minor. The highest

income group, which

shifts into rental housing and

exempts as well as into equities, liquidates hO percent of its debt holdings.

Reduction in the Maximum Tax Rate on Unearned Income
The Tax Act lowers the maximum tax rate on unearned income from 70

to 50 percent. We assume that this translates into a reduction in the
average marginal tax rate for owners in the highest income class from

55 to 50 percent. For the tenth for the higher income class that rents,
the reduction is from 60 to 50 percent. The average tax rates on capital
income fall from 52.5 to 50 and 55

to

50, respectively.

The initial impact of this tax cut is on the highest income group
only; taxable debt instruments become more attractive and all other assets
relatively less attractive, housing investments owing to the reduced

tax saving on interest deductions. As a result, the taxable debt yield
declines. This induces all other household groups to shift out of debt
instruments and into the other assets. The necessary change in the debt
yield required to achieve the new equilibrium is small, however (a decline

of

21 basis

points),

and thus

the impact on capital allocation is minor.

Owner-occupied housing increases by $1.5

billion, and rental housing and

nonresidential capital decrease by $0.3 and $1.2 billion, respectively.
Nonetheless, some quite significant portfolio shifts occur. Table 9
presents the dollar value changes in asset holdings; mortgage debt (which
equals 80 percent of housing)

the

asset

is treated as

a negative asset in order that

changes sum to zero. To put these changes in perspective, the

percentage changes in holdings of equities are, from the lowest to the

highest income groups: 6,

after the impact of the Tax Act are reported. Ignoring risk considerations
and possible externalities, the net user costs should be equal across
all types of capital for capital to be allocated efficiently in the economy.

The Tax Act goes a fair distance toward achieving this equality. Prior
to the Act, the net user cost for corporate capital was 2 percentage
points above that for rental housing and 5

percentage points above the

weighted average net cost for owner-occupied housing. After allowing for
the impact of the Tax Act, the net costs for corporate capital and rental
housing are equal, and that for owner-occupied housing is only three

percentage

points less. When the

net cost for owner-occupied housing is

examined by income class, one sees that the net cost is significantly

below

those

of rental housing and corporate capital for the upper-middle

and high income classes only.

the stock of industrial capital and would dampen the decline

in the stock of residential capital. In fact, residential capital could
increase, although household consumption will surely

tilted from

capital (housing and durables) services to other services.

One other result is worthy of mention. When the cut in the maximum

tax

rate on unearned (capital) income is analyzed in isolation, total

household taxes on unearned income increase. The cut in the tax rate on
interest

from

fully-taxed debt instruments leads high income households

to shift from riskier, tax-sheltered investments into the more heavily

taxed debt instruments. As a result, their taxes are estimated to rise by
$2 billion (l9T7 dollars). Because the decline in taxes paid by other
households is slight, total household taxes rise.
