Productivity and R&D at the Firm Level

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the relationship between output, employment,

and physical and R&D capital, for a sample of 133 large U.S.firms covering

the years 1966 through 1977. In the cross sectional dimension, there is
a strong relationship between firm productivity and the level of its R&D

investments. In the time dimension, using deviations from firm means as
observations and unconstrained estimation, this relationship comes close

to vanishing. This may be due, in part, to the increase in collinearity
between trend, physical capital, and R&D capital in the within dimension,

leaving little independent variability there. When the coefficients of
the first two variables are constrained to reasonable values, the R&D

coefficient is both sizeable and significant. The possibility of simultaneity between output and employment decisions in the short run is also

investigated. Allowing for this via the use of a semi—reduced form equations
system yields rather high estimates of the importance of R&D capital relative

to physical capital. Our data do not allow us, however, to answer any detailed
questions about the lag structure of the effects of R&D on productivity. These
effects are apparently highly variable, both in timing and magnitude.

Productivity and R&D at

the

Firm Level

I. Motivation and Framework

A. [ntroduction
Because of worries about domestic inflation and declining international competitiveness there has been a growing concern about the recent
slowdowns in the growth of productivity and R&D, both on their own merit

and because of the presumed relationship between them. This paper addresses
the latter question, trying to assess the contribution of private R&D spending by firms to their own productivity performance, using observed differences
in both levels

and

growth rates of such firms.

There have been a number of studies of this topic at the industry
level, using aggregated data, hut ours is almost the first to use time--series

for a cross—section of individual firms, i.e.,

The only similar

study at the firm level is Griliches' (l9ROa) use of pooled N.S.F. and Census

data for 883 R&D performing companies over the 1957—65 period. This study
had

to rely on various proxies (and on corresponding ad—hoc assumptions)

for the measurement

of both

physical (C) and R&D (K) capital. Furthermore,

because of confidentiality requirements, the data were provided only in
moment—matrices form, 'hich made it impossible to control for outliers and
errors, and difficult to deal with the special econometric problems of
panel data.

In spite of these limitations, the results were very (and

—2—

somewhat surprisingly) encouraging, yielding an elasticity of output

with respect to R&D capital of about .06 in both the time—series and
cross—section dimensions of the data.

A major goal of our work was to confirm these findings using a
longer and more recent sample of firms, while paying more attention to the
definition and measurement of the particular variables and to the diffi-

culties of estimation and specification in panel data. In spite of
these efforts, under close scrutiny our results are somewhat disappointing.

This paper includes, therefore, two very different parts: Section II
documents the various estimates in detail while Section III attempts to
rationalize and to circumvent the problems that are evident in these esti-

mates. First, however, we shall set the stage in this introductory section
by explaining our data and our model. A more detailed description of
the variables used and a summary of results using alternative versions of
some of these variables can be found in the Appendix.

B.

The Data and Major Variables

We started with the information provided in the Standard and Poor's
Compustat Industrial Tape for 157 large companies which have been reporting
their R&D expenditures regularly since 1963 and were not missing more than

three years of data. Because of missing observations on employment and of
questionable data on other variables we had first to limit the sample to 133
firms (complete sample), and then, in response to merger problems, to restrict

it further to 133 firms (restricted sample). The treatment of mergers has

—3—

indeed an impact on our estimates. These two overlapping samples are
2

fully balanced over the 12—year period, 1966—1977.
Our sample is quite heterogeneous, covering most R&D performing manufacturing industries and including also a few non—manufacturing firms

(mainly in petroleum and non—ferrous mining). Since the number of firms is
too small to work with separate industries, we have dealt with the hetero-

geneity problem by dividing our sample into twogroups: Scientific firms ——

firms

in the Chemical, Drug, Computer, Electronic, and Instrument industries,

and Other Firms.

The measurement of the variables raises many conceptual issues as well

as practical difficulties. These problems have been discussed at some length
in Griliches (1979) and (l980a) and we shall only allude to the most important

ones in our context. We think of the unobservable research capital stock (K)
as a measure of the distributed lag effect of past R&D investments on productivity:

K. =

Ew R.
T i(t—T)'

it

there R is a deflated measure of R&D and the

T

subscripts t, (t—T), and i stand for current year, lagged year and firm
respectively.

Ideally, one would like to estimate the lag structure (wT)

from the data, or at least an average rate of R&D obsolescence and the average

time lag between R&D and productivity. Unfortunately, the data did not prove
to be informative enough. Various constructed lag measures and different
initial conditions made little difference to the final results. We focused,
therefore, on one of the better and most sensible looking measures based on
a constant rate of obsolescence of 15 percent per year and geometrically
declining weights

=

(l_S)T

We measure output by deflated sales (Q) and labor (L) by the total number

of employees. There is no information on value—added or the number of hours

—4—

worked in our data base. This raises, among other tiings, questions about
the role of materials (especially energy in the recent period) and about the
impact of fluctuations in labor and capacity utilization and the possibility
that ignoring these issues may bias our results —— see Section III where we

address these questions and the related question of returns to scale. Sales
are deflated by the relevant (at the two or three digit SIC level) National
Accounts price indexes.3 We assume that intrasectoral differences in price
movements reflect mostly quality changes in old products or the development

of new products. Accordingly, (and to the extent that this assumption holds)
we are in principle studying here the effects of both process and product—
oriented R&D investments.

Finally, we have used gross plant adjusted for inflation as our measure

of the physical capital stock (C). This variable (as in some of our previous
studies) performs reasonably well ——

however, it tends to be collinear over

time with the R&D capital stock K, especially for some sectors and subperiods.
We have tried various ways of adjusting gross plant for inflation and also
experimented with age of capital and net capital stock measures.

Since

random errors of measurement are another issue, we made various attempts to

deal with the errors in variables problem by going to 3—year averages. All
these experiments resulted in only minor perturbations to our estimates.

Table 1 provides general

information on our samples and variables

while more detail is given in the Appendix. Note the much more rapid productivity growth and the higher R&D intensiveness in the "scientific firms" subsample.

productivity growth (see Griliches, 1979 and 1980b), is the simple extended

are the parameters (elasticities) of

addition to the weights w1 or the rate of obsolescence

implicit in the construction of the R&D capital stock variable.

One could, of course, also consider more complicated functional forms

such as the CES or Translog functions. We felt, however, based on past
experience and also on some exploratory computations that this will not
really matter as far as our main purpose of estimating the output elasti-

cities of R&D and physical capital (a and y) or at least their relative
importance (a/y) is concerned. However, two related points are worth making.
First, an important implication of our model in the context of panel
data is that in the cross sectional dimension differences in levels explain
differences in levels, while in the time dimension differences in growth
rates explain differences in growth rates.

An alternative model would

allow y to vary across firms and impose the equality of marginal products
or rates of return across firms,

=

p, implying that the rate of growth in

—7 —

productivity

depends on the intensity of R&D investment (rewriting yk =

(BQ/K)(K/Q)(K/K)

= pK/Q =

p(R-K)/Q

R/Q for small

).

We

have not

pursued such an alternative here but we may consider it again in future
work.

Second, we also have the choice of assuming constant returns to scale

(CRS) in the Cobb—Douglas production function: c + + y + i

1, or not ——

which amounts to estimating the regression
= a + )t +

ct(cj_2)

+Y(k1_2) +

+ elt

with (ii—l) left free c'r set equal to zero. In our data the CRS assumption is

accepted in the cross sectional dimension but is rejected in the time dimension,

in favor of significantly decreasing returns to scale. Because of the large
effects of this restriction on our estimates of y we shall report both the
estimates obtained with and without imposing constant returns to scale.

A distinct issue, but which may also explain why not assuming constant
returns to scale and freeing the coefficient of labor in the regressions causes

a problem, is that of simultaneity. Actually, it seems to provide a better
explanation of our results than left—out variables or errors of measurement. We
have, therefore, estimated a two semi—reduced form equations model in which output and employment are determined simultaneously as function of R&D and physical
stocks, based on the assumption of short—run profit maximization and predetermined

capital inputs. These estimates yield plausible estimates of the relative influence of R&D and physical capital on productivity in both the cross—sectional

and time dimensions. We elaborate upon this line of research in Section III.
These different specification issues are, of course, related to the

assumptions made about the error term e. in the production function.
When working with panel data, it is usual to decompose the error term into

—8—

two independent terms;

=

u+

w1 , where u is a permanent

effect specific to the firm and w1 is a transitory effect. In our
context u1 may correspond to permanent differences in managerial

ability and economic environment, while w1 reflects short—run changes
in capacity utilization rates ——

in

addition to other sources

of perturbation. The habitual and convenient way to abstract from the

u.'s is to compute the within—firm regression using the deviations of
the observations from their specific firm—means: (y1. —

r.)__ which

is

equivalent to including firm dummy variables in the total regression using the
original observation

While the way to eliminate the w.'s (in a

large enough sample) is to compute the between—firm regression using the

firm—means (yb).

The least squares estimates of the total regression

are in fact matrix—weighted averages of the least—squares estimates of
the within and between regressions.

If most of the variability of the

data is between firms rather than within, as is the case here, the total
and between estimates will be very close.
Another manner of viewing the decomposition of the overall error
into permanent and transitory components and of interpreting the between
and the within estimates, is to consider them as providing cross—sectional
and time series estimates respectively.

consistent and similar if the

uS's

Both estimates will be
and the

w. 's are
it

uncorrelated with the explanatory variables. Very often, however, the
two are rather different, implying some sort of specification error.
This is, unfortunately, our case. Following the early work of Mundlak (1961)

and Hoch (1962), the general tendency is to hold the u.'s responsible for
the correlation with the explanatory v.ria1les, and assume that the Within

—9--.

estimates are the better, less biased ones.6

This leads to the discarding

of the information contained in the variability between firms which is predominant (at least in our samples), relying thereby only on the variability
within firms over time, which is much smaller and more sensitive to errors

of measurement. In fact, there are also good reasons for the w. 'S to
it

be correlated with the explanatory variables, and therefore, putting some-

what more faith in the between estimates. These reasons have been sketched
in Mairesse (1978); they will be considered further in Section III when we

discuss the potential influence of misspecifications on our results.

II. Overall and Detailed Estimates

A.

First Look At Results

Our first results were based on the complete sample of 133 firms for
the 1966—77 period and various variants of our variables, especially R&D capital.

Although the use of different measures had little effect, disappointing our
hope of learning much about the lag structure from these data, the actual estimates looked reasonably good even if far apart in the cross—section and time

dimensions. Table 2 gives the total, between, and within estimates (and also
the within estimates with year dummies instead of a time trend), using our
main variants for output, labor and physical and research capital, both

with and without the assumption of constant returns to scale. The total
estimates of the elasticities of physical and R&D capital
are about

.30 and

and

y

.06 respectively, similar to Griliches' (l980a) previous

estimates. The more purely cross—sectional between estimates are close to
the total estimates,

.32 and .07 respectively. This follows from the fact

that most of the relevant variability in our sample is between firms
(about 90 percent, see Table Al in the Appendix). The time—series within

estimates are, however, rather different: a being about .15, and

y

about .15 or .08 depending on whether constant returns to scale are
imposed or not. It is also clear that using separate year
dummy variables instead of a linear trend makes very little difference.

Unfortunately, these first results did not improve with further
analysis; on the contrary.

While the measurement of variables (within

the range of our experimentation) does not really matter, trying to allow

for sectoral and period differences and cleaning the sample of observations
contaminated by mergers degraded sharply our within estimates of the R&D

capital elasticity y. The pattern of results already evident in Table 2
is much amplified, especially in the time dimension: a tendency of the

estimates y's to be substantial, whenever the estimates a's seem too
low; and a tendency for them to diminish or even to collapse when constant

returns to scale are not imposed. We shall now document these different
problems in detail before considering their possible causes and solutions.

—12—

B. Alternative Variable Definitions and Sectoral Differences
One of the original aims of this study was to experiment with various

ways of defining and measuring physical and R&D capital. Using all the
information available to us we tried a number of different ways of measur-

ing these variables but to little effect. The resulting differences in
our estimates, even when they were "statistically significant," were

nonetheless quite small and not very meaningful. In particular, they did

not alter the order of magnitude of our two parameters of interest a and
y .

The various measures we tried turned out to be very good substitutes

for each other and the choice between them had little practical import.

Our final choices were based, therefore, primarily on a priori considera-

tions, external evidence, and convenience. The Appendix describes these
choices and some of our experiments.

Since our sample consisted of R&D performing firms in rather diverse
industries, it was also of interest to investigate the influence of sec—

toral (industrial) differences. Table 3 gives our main estimates separately
for firms in research—intensive industries, so—called scientific firms,
and the rest of our sample.
Dividing the sample into two allows for much of the heterogeneity,

bringing down the sum of square of errors (SSE) by about 20 percent for the
total regressions and 10 percent for the within regressions (with the division corresponding to very high F—ratios of about 100 and 70 respectively).

The two groups are indeed a priori very distinct: as a matter of fact the
average rate of productivity growth is about four times higher for the
scientific firms, while the average R&D to sales ratio is about twice as
high (see Table 1).

—13—

In

spite

of this sharp contrast, the differences in our estimates are

not that large ——

except for the estimated time—trend coefficients (rates

of technical progress X ).

The within estimates of

and y (and also

are, in fact, quite comparable, only the fit being much lower in the

"other firms" equation. Yet the total estimates of y are very large in the
scientific sectors and insignificant for the other sectors. Part of this
discrepancy can be accounted for by the higher estimates of

in the other

firms group.

Disaggregating to the sectoral level decreases the total and within SSE by

another 20 percent or so, The main effect is, however, to worsen the col—

linearity between R&D and physical capital in the within dimension. Some
of the within estimates actually fall apart: two extreme cases being the
computer industry with an estimated

of —0.06 and an estimated

0.50, and the instrument industry with an estimated ot

of

of

0.49 and an

estimated y of —0.32. Without a larger sample, we do not really have the
option of working at the detailed industrial level.

C. Differences between Sub—Periods

Current discussions of "the productivity slowdown" suggest that some
of it may be due not only to "the slowdown in R&D," but also to a significant decrease in the efficiency of recent R&D investments (Griliches, 1980b);

hence, our interest in whether we could find any evidence of a decrease in

the R&D capital elasticity y over time. Table 4 shows what happens (for
the scientific firms group) when we divide our data into two six—year sub—
8

periods, 1966—71 and 1972—77.

Table 5 explores the resulting differences

further by presenting the within estimates for the two subperiods s well as the

overall period and "between subperiods") and comparing the estimated Y

when

c. and X are constrained to .25 and .025 respectively. Table 5

also lists the rates of growth of the main variables, their within standard
deviations, and the decomposition of their within variability for the sub—
periods (the overall period and "between subperiods").
As might be expected, the total estimates differ only slightly, while

the within estimates change a lot. Yet the striking feature is not a de-

crease in the estimated y but rather in

.

The decomposition of

variance shows, however, that by breaking down our data into two subperiods

we keep only about half of the within variability in the overall period (the
other half being between subperiods). Our capital stock variables as well as
the time variable itself are slowly changing trend—like variables, and there

is not enough variability in them to allow us to estimates all of their

coefficients separately and precisely. What we get are relatively wide gyrations

in the estimated coefficients a, y,and A with some of them going down as the
others go up. If we impose a reasonable a priori value of a

.25, which corres-

ponds to estimating the impact of R&D capital on total factor productivity,

associated with a correspondingly large increase in A , from .003 to .034.

then the implied y is both reasonable and stable. Moreover,

the imposition of such constraints is not inconsistent with the data; while

the actual absolute deterioration in fit is rather small, the standard devia—

—19—

This may not be all that surprising considering the other major fact
that emerges from Table 5:

our "scientific firms" did not actually exper-

ience a productivity slowdown in 1972—77 relative to 1966—71 (as against the

experience of manufacturing as a whole). There was a slowdown in the growth
of both physical and R&D capital, but this was associated with an
tion in labor productivity growth and hence also in total factor productivity
growth.

(The latter rises from about 0.13 in the first period to about

3.6 percent in the second.)10

Given these facts it is not surprising that

correlation of productivity growth with capital input growth tends to vanish

leading to a collapse of the estimated a and y .

These strange events

are not limited to the firms in our sample, they actually happened also in
the science—based industries as a whole as can be seen by examining the ag-

gregate data collected by NSF and the BLS.11 (Average TFP growth in
"scientific" industries raises in these data from about .08 in 1966—71 to

3.7 percent in 1972—77.) If anything, the puzzle is why there was so little

"exogeneous" productivity growth in 1966—71? One

possible

answer would invoke

errors of measurement in the dating of physical and R&D investments (longer
lag structures); another might be based on different cyclical positions of

the endpoints of these two periods. In any case, since there is no evidence
that there has been a significant productivity slowdown in R&D intensive industries, it is unlikely that whatever slowdown did occur could be attributed
to the slowdown in R&D growth.12

E. The Problem of Mergers
Starting from our original sample of 157 firms, we first eliminated 24,

primarily because of missing observations (in the number of employees gener—
ally and in gross plant occasionally) or obvious large errors in the reported

numbers. In the case of one or two missing observations we "interpolated"
them. In some instances we managed to go back to the original source and
obtain the missing figure or correct an error. Fortunately, most firms did
not present such difficulties, and the construction of our "complete sample"

was straightforward enough. We were still left with the important issue of
mergers. About one firm out of five in our "complete" sample (as many as
20 among the 77 "scientific" firms) appeared to be affected (at least for

one year over the 1966—77 period) by considerable and generally simultaneous
"jumps" (80 percent or more year to year increases) in gross—plant, number

of employees, and sales. We have been able to check and convince ourselves
that most of these jumps do, in fact, result from mergers, although some may

be the result of very rapid growth. Since the problem was of such a magnitude
(as is bound to be the case in a panel of large companies over a number of
years), we had to be careful about it.

One way of dealing with this problem is simply to drop the offending

firms. This results in what we have called the "restricted" sample. An
alternative is to crease an "intermediate" sample in which a firm before and

after a major merger is considered to be two different "firms." If mergers
were occurring precisely in a given year, we would have as many observations
in the intermediate sample as in the complete one (and more "firms" but some
of them over shorter periods), and we would eliminate only the "variability"

—21—

aorresponding to the 'jumps." In fact, we lost a few observations because
some mergers affect our data for more than one year (primarily because we
chose gross—plant at the beginning of the year as our measure of capital for
the current year) or because they occur in the first or last three years of
the study period (since we decided not to have "firms" with less than three

years of data in the intermediate sample). Estimates for the restricted

sample

and its complement the "merger" sample are given in Table 6 for the scientific

firms group. (Esimates for the other group behave similarly, although there
were fewer mergers there.) Table 7 provides more detail, showing separately
the results for the complete, intermediate, and restricted samples and decom-

posing the merger group into "jm" and "nojump" periods. To facilitate
interpretation, it also presents estimates of y based on constraining

to .25 and A to .025, and lists the rate of growth, the standard deviations and the variance decomposition of the main variables)3

The total estimates (reported in Table 6) manifest their usual Stout--

ness, remaining practically unchanged whatever the sample. The within estimates are, on the contrary, very sensitive, and the estimated y collapses,

declining from 0.11 to 0.05 and —0.03 in the complete, intermediate, and
restricted samples respectively (even when constant returns to scale

are im-

posed). It is clear from Table 7 that the merger—firms are responsible for the
difference.

They correspond to a major part of the within variability of our

variables (much of it being due to the "jumps"). Moreover they seem to account
for the significant positive within estimates of

y'

in our complete sample,

especially through their "no—jumps" component. In other words, R&I) seems most
effective for firms growing rapidly through mergers, and both phenomena (mer-

gers and R&D growth) are apparently retated.

Merger firms have higher R&D than physical capital growth rates during
their non—merger ("no—jumps") periods, while the opposite is true for non—
merging ("restrictedt') firms. The labor productivity growth rates are about
equal for both, but they are much more closely related to R&D growth for the

merger firms. Actually there is not enough variability left to estimate the
separate contributions of the two capital and the time trend terms precisely.
If one imposes a

.25 and X =

.025 a priori, one gets back in the

restricted subsample a reasonable though still low estimate of y =

.05.

The intermediate sample, however, is the most relevant one from our point

of view, yielding a much higher I = .09, which can be interpreted as a weighted

average of about .2 for the merger firms and .05 for the rest.

14

Such a finding raises questions that deserve additional analysis:

Who are these "merger" firms and why would their R&D investment be more suc-

cessful? What kind of selectivity is at work here? How does one expand this
type of analysis to allow for different R&D related success rates by different

firms? A random coefficients model does not, at first thought, appear to be
the most appropriate way to go. Unfortunately, given the small size of our
sample, we cannot really pursue these questions further here.

Our tentative conclusion is that we should not exclude the merger

firms from our sample entirely. These are firms whose R&D has been apparently

very effective. Throwing them out would seriously bias our estimates of the
contribution of R&D to productivity downward.

—25—

III. Misspecification Biases or An Exercise in Rationalization

A. Three possible sources of bias
Our within estimates of the production function are unsatisfactory
in the sense they attribute unreasonably iow coefficients to the physical
and research capital variables and imply that most of our firms are handi-

capped by severely diminishing returns to scale. The simplest explanation
is to impute these "bad results" to a major misspecification of our model.
The trouble is that when we start thinking about possible misspecifications,

many come to mind. The most important appear to be: (1) the omission of
labor and capital intensity of utilization variables such as hours

of work per employee and hours of operation per machine; (2) the use of
gross output or sales rather than value added or alternatively the omission
of materials from the list of included factors; (3) overlooking the jointness

(simultaneity) in the determination of employment and output)5
These three misspecifications are similar in the sense that tney all
imply the failure of the ordinary least squares assumption of no

correlation between the included factors, c, 1, k and the disturbance e in
the production function, resulting in biases in our estimates of the elasticities of these factors (and in our estimate of the elasticity of scale).
In all three cases the correlation of the disturbance
variable

e

with the labor

is likely to be relatively high in the time dimension, affect—

ing especially our within estimates.

If we consider the "auxiliary" regression connecting e to C, 2,

k:

E(e) =

(where we suppress for simplicity the constant and trend terms by tak-

ing deviations of the variables from the appropriate means, i.e., respectively

—y1+y)

and

for the total and within regressions), the

specification biases in our estimatescan be written in the following general
form:

E(a—o) =

&

E(-) = bias

If we assume more specifically that the physical and research capital
variables

c and k are predetermined and that only the labor variable is

correlated with e, we can go one step further and formulate the biases in

c and y as proportional to the bias in

(see Griliches and Ringstad,

1971, Appendix C).

bias c = —(bias

)

= —(bias

)

bias

bk

There is no good reason why the coefficients bck and

b,k.c

should be both small, or one much smaller than the other, or very different

for the within and total estimates. One will expect them to be positive
and less than one, but large enough to result in a significant transmission

I

—27—

into downward biases in both &

of an upward bias in

and

.

One would

also expect the absolute biases in a and y to be of the same order
of magnitude and,therefore, to

than on &

have a much larger relative effect on

'

(assuming that the true y is small relatively to the true cx).

For example, a bias of —0.1 might reduce cx from a true .3 to .2 but

could wipe out y if its true value were .1.
We can actually estimate such bias transmission coefficients in our

sample. They are relatively large and of comparable magnitude, on the order

of .3 to

416

To the extent that the correlation between labor and the disturbance
in the production function is the main problem, we are left with the evaluation of the bias in labor elasticity and the question of whether we can
ascertain the within bias to be positive and sizeable in contrast to a small

tota1" bias. This is much more difficult and we have to consider specifically our three possible misspecifications. We shall say a few words about
the first two and then concentrate on the simultaneity issue. This issue
seems most important and we have been able to progress further towards its
solution by considering a simultaneous equations model composed of the
production function and a labor demand function, and by estimating what we
call the semi—reduced form equations for this model.

Consider first the omission of the hours worked per worker variable
h (or machine hours operated per machine) and let the "truet' model be:

q=ctc+(2,+h)+k+ c
where labor is measured by the total number of hours of work.

—28—

The disturbance in the estimated model is then e = £ + 13h,
we get for the labor elasticity bias:

bias (13) = b

=

e• ck

13b
.

and

ck

Cross sectionally hours per worker h should be roughly un—
correlated with any of the included variables c,

and

k

and hence

cause no bias in the between regression and also in the total regression
(which is similar since the between variances of the variables
dominate their total variance).

In the time dImension, however, short

run fluctuations in demand (say a business expansion) will be met partly by
modifying employment (hiring) and partly by changing hours of work (increase

in overtime). Hence bhk should be positive and rather large (perhaps
.5 or higher) and therefore the within estimate of 3 should be biased upward

and substantially so (perhaps by .6x.50.3). Considering then that the

within correlations of h with c and k are likely to be negligible, we
have seen that a significant downward bias should be transmitted to the within

estimates of c. and y (about

-.3 x .4 or —.3 x .3

—

.1).

The same type of analysis applies to the exclusion of materials as
a factor in the production function (or to not using value added but gross

output or sales to measure production). The total estimates of

and y should all move up roughly in Droportion to the elasticity
of materials

[by l/(l-)],

while the within estimates L ,

13

and y will be raised in lesser proportions, with the plausible result of a
negligible bias in the total and a large downward bias in the within estimates
of the scale elasticity.
Let the tttrue model be this time:

29 —

q=nc + +1k + m +

(i.e.,

E

a generalized Cobb—Douglas production function where materials come

in as another factor). Estimating a gross output equation ignoring
in

assumes implicitly that materials are used

in fixed proportion to output. This may be a belief about the technical
characteristics of the production processes (the form of the production function)
or the consequence of assuming that materials are purchased optimally and that
their price relative to the price of output remains roughly constant over firms

and over time. In any case omitting m where

it should be included means

that the error in the estimated model is e = +

3m,

resulting in the

following biases for our estimates:

Across firms, in the between dimension, it is quite likely that the sum of

Over time, however, it is more likely that material usage may change less
than proportionally, since it will respond incompletely or with lags to short

—30--

run output fluctuations. Hence, the sum of the b's might be much less
thar

one in the within dimension, causing the misleading appearance of

decreasing returns to scale. As a plausible example, we can take

bk = bk

0 and bk = .5

and if the true coefficients are a =

a =

we get the following within estimates when n

Turning to the problem of simultaneity and assuming that firms try to

maximize their profits in the short run, given their stocks of physical and
R&D capital, the true model will consist of a production function and a labor
demand function:
q = ac +

+ k + e

q +w+v
where w is the real
price of labor and v is a random optimization error. We can assume that
the errors in the two equations (e and v) are independent or more generally
that they are of the following form:

(e+f) and (v+f), where e and f

are respectively the parts of the disturbance in the production function which

are transmitted and are not transmitted to the labor variable. The OLS

is the ratio of the random transmitted variance in the production function

to the sum of itself and the independent variance in the labor equation.
Thus,to get some notion about the value of

R and the bias in

need to discuss the potential sources of variation in

,

we

e, v and w.

Schematically, we can think of the disturbance in the production function
as consisting of: (1) long term differences in factor productivity between

firms; (2) short run shifts in demand which are being met (partly) by changes
in (unmeasured) utilization of labor and capital; and (3) errors of measure-

in the deflators of output, errors arising from the use of gross rather
than net output concepts, and errors arising from the use of sales rather than

ment

output

concepts.

Only items (1) and (2) matter as far as the formulae are

concerned since (3) (errors of measurement) are not really transmitted to

labor. Moreover, only (1) matters in the cross—sectional (between) dimension
under the assumption that (2) cancels out over time, while only (2) matters
in the time (within) dimension.

Similarly, the independent variation in the labor equation can be
partitioned into:(4) the independent variation in real wage and (5) other

short run deviation from the profit maximizing level of employment due to

implicit contracts, shortages or mistaken expectations. It is probably the
case that most of the factor price variation to which firms respond is either

permanent and cross—sectional, or is common to all firms in the time dimension

and hence is captured by the time dummies or trend coefficients. Thus, we
anticipate that (4) manifests itself largely in the between dimension while
(5) is all that is left in the within dimension.

On the basis of the estimated variances and covariances of the residuals
for the semi—reduced form equations to be discussed below, we can give the

following illustrative orders of magnitude (for

would be respectively biased upward by

.04 and .20.

B. The semi—reduced form estimates
If one takes the simultaneity story seriously, it is not surprising
that the OLS within estimates of the production function are unreasonable. We
should be estimating a complete simultaneous equations system instead. We cannot
do that, unfortunately, lacking information on factor prices. But we can estimate
semi—reduced form equations (i.e., reduced form equations omitting factor price
variables) which may allow us to infer the relative size of our two parameters

of interest c and y
Let the true production function be (ignoring constants, time trends,
or year dummies)

q=cc +
where both c and k

+

yk+ 5m+e

are assumed to be predetermined and independent of e,

—33-

and

while q, ,

m are endogenous

jointly dependent variables.

Short run profit maximization ia competitive markets implies:

q—mp+E

q—=W+V

w and p are the real prices of labor and of materials respectively

where

and v and E

are

the associated optimization errors. Solving for q, , and m

yields:

q =

[c +

[ac + 1k + e —

(v)
(l-)
(w+v)

-

(p+E)]

(w+v) -

—

(l—)(p+Efl

Since materials and factor prices are unobserved in our data, we have to drop

the last equation and to lump w and p with the other error components
in these equations.

We are thus left with two semi—reduced form equations

for output and labor. Coming back for the sake of coherence to our previous
notations of the production function with m solved out [cL =

e =

e—5(p+E)/(1—ó)], we can rewrite these two equations more simply:
q =

=

(where

e' =

-j---

(ac + 1k) +

e'

(ac + 1k) +

v'

[e — 13(w+v)]

and

v' =

[e — (w+v)I

).

—34—

The semi—reduced form equation should provide unbiased estimates of
c/(1—1f)

and

'/(l—j3)

to the extent that factor prices w and p are more

or less uncorrelated with the capital variables c and k. This condition
seems quite plausible in the within dimension. There is little independent
variance left in

w and p in the within dimension after one takes out

their common time series components with time dummies or a trend variable.

In the between dimension, however, one would expect that w and p might

vary across firms and be positively correlated with c and k, leading to
downward biases in

/(l—) and y/(l—) in both equations (and more so

in the labor equation).
Tables 8, 9 and 10 present estimates of

such

semi—reduced form equations

comparable to the production function estimates reported in the earlier tables
2 to 7: total and within estimates for all firms and for scientific and other
firms separately; for the two subperiods 1966—71 and 1972—77 (and between
these two subperiods); for the restricted and merger samples (and the merger—

no—jump sample). Since the "theory" of the semi—reduced form equations implies
that corresponding coefficients should be the same in the two equations, we
present also the constrained system (SUR) estimates.
A first look at the results shows that they are in the right ballpark.

They are not very strikingly different in the two dimensions, and most remarkably, the within estimates of the research capital coefficient are quite

significant and rather large. Also, the corresponding estimates in the two

equations are rather close. Given the large number of degreof freedom a]1
differences are "statistically" significant, but constraining the coefficients
to be equal in the two equations results in a negligible loss of fit, changing

the system—wide R2 only in the third (or second) decimal place.

A more careful examination confirms, more or less, our previous

production function findings. The estimates for the two, scientific and

other firms, are close, given the collinearity between c and k which
causes the much lower within estimate of i/(l—13) for the other firm group

to be largely counterbalanced by the higher estimates of aI(l—). The
estimates for the two subperiods are also quite comparable, since the higher
within estimates of

y(l—B) for 1972—77 can be explained, similarly, by

the lower estimate of oj(l—B). Also, the merger firms do not seem to
behave as differently as it appeared earlier. The within estimates of

y/(l—) for the non—merger firms are significant, and the discrepancy between
the estimates for the two types of firms may also be due to the collinearity

between c and

k.

The remaining difficulty with our semi—reduced form estimates is their

absolute size. It is different from our.a priori expectations. If the true
coefficients of the production function were c =
and

=

.5,

or in value added terms c

.15,

.3, 3 = .6

13

.3,

Y

.05

and y = .1, the

semi—reduced form coefficients should be about .75 and .25 respectively.
The estimated physical capital coefficient is much smaller, being about .5
at best, while the estimated R&D coefficient is of the expected order of

magnitude but often higher. Although the total and within estimates do not
differ too strikingly, it should be noted that the estimated sum (ct+y)/(1—13)

is about .8 or .9 cross—sectionally and about .5 to

.7 in the time

dimension. This is quite similar to what happened also to our production
function returns to scale estimates.

We can think of two possible explanations for these shortfalls: (1)
errors in variables, and, (2) failure of the perfect competition assumption.

—39—

To the extent that errors in measurement are random over time (which
is a difficult position to maintain for stock variables), their effects can
be mitigated by averaging and by trying to increase the signal to noise ratio

in the affected variables. The between subperiods estimates given in Table 9
represent an attempt to accomplish this by using

differences between

two six year subperiod averages. It is clear from this attempt (and from
others not reported here) that averaging does not solve the problem of the

absolute magnitude of our estimates. Either our solution for the errors
of measurement is not effective (because the errors are correlated over
time) or the problem is due to something else entirely.

The perfect competition assumption is especially dubious for our

large firms and short run context. To explore the consequences of such a
misspecification, we have to expand our model by adding a demand equation:

=

where

ct.

+

z+

+ k.

+ E

is a permanent firm demand level variable

z is a common in-

dustry demand shifter, n is the relative price elasticity of demand (where the

price of the firm's products p is measured relative to the overall price
level in the industry) and

is the direct effect of R&D capital on the

demand for the firm's products.

Given this model, we reinterpret our output variable as sales (which

it really is), make price endogeneous, and use the demand equation to solve

it out of the system. This yields comparable semi—reduced form equations but
the coefficients are now

c(l+*)

and

—40—

for physical and research capital respectively. With n <

0,

the research

capital coefficient is seen to be a combination of both its production and
demand function shifting effects.
The introduction of the (1 + 1/fl)

terms into these coefficients pro-

vides an explanation for the ?shortfall? in our estimates. Assuming fl

=

—4,

i.e., that if a firm lowers the relative price of its product by 25 percent
it would double its market share, and

implies .4

=

.3,

=

.6,

y =

.1

and c =

.1,

and .18 as the respective coefficients in the semi—reduced forms.

That is not too far off and the assumptions are plausible enough but
that is about all that we can say. We shall need more data and more evidence
from other implications of such a model before we can put much faith in this
interpretation of our results.

IV. Summary and Conclusions
We have analyzed the relationship between output, employment, and
physical and R&D capital, for a sample of 133 large U.S. firms covering the

years 1966 through 1977. In the cross sectional dimension, there is a strong
relationship between firm productivity and the level of its R&D investments.

In the time dimension, using deviations from firm means as observations and
unconstrained estimation, this relationship comes close to vanishing. This
may be due, in part, to the increase in collinearity between the trend, physical

capital, and R&D capital in the within dimension. There is little independent
variability left there. When the coefficients of the first two variables are
constrained to reasonable values, the R&D coefficient is both sizeable and

significant. Another reason for these difficulties may be the simultaneity

—4 1—

of output and employment decisions in the short run. Allowing for such a
simultaneity yields rather high estimates of the importance of R&D capital

relative to physical capital. Our data do not allow us, however, to answer
any detailed questions about the lag structure of the effects of R&D on

productivity. These effects are apparently highly variable, both in timing
and magnitude.

-Al-

Appendix: Variables and Additional Results
In this appendix we present more information on our sample and
summarize the results of various additional computational experiments.
Table Al lists means, standard deviations, and growth rates for our
major variables, and indicates that most of the observed variance in the
data (90+ percent) is between firms, rather than within firms and across

time. It also underscores the fact that these firms are rather large, with
an average of more than 10,000 employees per firm.

Table A2 compares our main measure of physical capital stock C to

four alternatives C', CA, CN and CD. C is gross—plant adjusted for
inflation, which we assume to be proportional to a proper capital service

flow measure. Since our adjustment for inflation is based on a rough first—
order approximation, assuming a fixed service life, a linear depreciation

pattern, and an estimate of the age of capital (AA) from reported depreciation levels, we tried also different variants of it.

C' is one of

them, in which we assume the same average service life for plant and equip-

ment of 16 years for all our firms. The fit is somewhat improved, but the
changes in the estimates are only minor. Actually, using the reported gross—
plant figure without any adjustment does not make that much difference either.

CA is our C measure taken at the end of the year instead of the beginning

of the year. The fit is slightly improved and the within estimates of a
are increased a little. This could indicate that end of the year measures
are appropriate but ihay also reflect a simultaneity bias arising from

the contemporaneous feedback of changes in production on investment. CN and
CD are net plant and depreciation adjusted for inflation respectively. CN
can be advocated on the grounds that in some sense it allows for obsolescence

in principle to a service flow measure. CN results in a small decrease

CD results in an increase in both total and within estimates of c

We

have also run regressions including an

age of capital variable AA. While our estimates of c and y are not
affected but its inclusion, this variable in conjunction with our gross

capital measure C (but not so in conjunction with the net capital measure
CN) is clearly significant both in the cross—sectional and time dimensions,
tending to indicate a rate of embodied technical progress of 5.5 percent
per year (see Mairesse 1978).

Table A2 gives also the estimates obtained with an alternative measure

of deflated sales, QC, tentatively corrected for inventory change. The
correction, however, is problematic since it is based on all inventories
and not just

finished products. In any case QC performs much worse

both in terms of fit, and in terms of the order of magnitude of the within

estimates. Finally, we list also estimates based on three year averages of
the observations. While errors or measurement appear to be a priori an
important issue, and if they were random and uncorrelated, going to averages

should reduce the resulting biases, the changes are not striking and the

discrepancy between total and within estimates remains. Yet there is a
sizeable increase (about 20 percent) in the within estimate of

30 percent of the observed "within" variance in this ratio.

Because we did not want to give up the hope of gaining some evidence
on the lag structure of R&D effects, we experimented with a large number
of R&D capital stock measures, but mostly in vain. Table A3 compares K
the measure we finally settled on, based on a 15 percent depreciation rate,

to six rather different alternatives. KOO and K30 are computed similarly

to K, but assuming 0 and 30 percent per year obsolescence rates instead.

K' and K'OO differ from K and 1(00

respectively in assuming

that R&D vintages older than eight years are completely obsolete. Since
information on R&D is available only from 1958 on (i.e., for 8 years before 1966),

measures, the 1958 R&D capital levels are based on

extropolating R&D expenditures back to 1948, using the 1958 — 1963 individual firm R&D growth rate shrunk towards the overall industry rate.

Finally,

we have attempted. The P variables are the following proportion of past
R&D expenditures (over two years plus the tail) to total cumulated expendi-

tures (with a .15 rate of obsolescence):

(R3+ R4)/K,

(R7+ R8)/K,

(R5+R_6)/K,

As was the case fur the different physical capital measures, the
total estimates are almost unaffected by all this experimentation, while
the within estimates are more sensitive.

A first draft of this paper was presented at the 5th World Congress of the

Econometric Society at Aix—en—Provence, August, 1980. This work is part of
the National Bureau of Economic Research Program of Productivity and Techni-

cal Change Studies. We are Indebted to the National Science Foundation

1.

M. Ishaq Nadiri and his associates have done important related investi-

gations. In their work at the firm level they have estimated factor demand
equations (including demand for R&D) but did not pursue the direct estimation
of production functions (see, for example, Nadiri and Bitros, 1980).
2.

We also consider two corresponding subsamples (96 and 71) with no data

missing for the entire 18 years (1960—77) period. We focus in this paper on
the larger shorter samples because of potential errors in our R&D measures in

the earlier years. Most of the interpolation and doctoring of R&D expenditures
(for missing observations or changes in definition) occurred in the years before

1966. Also, we had to estimate an initial R&D capital stock level in 1958 by
making various and somewhat arbitrary assumptions whose impact vanishes by
1966.

3. At least two problems arise in applying these price indexes to our data.
First, our firms are diversified and a significant fraction of their output

does not fall within the industry to which they have been assigned. Second,
observations are based on the companies' fiscal years which often do not

coincide with price index calendar years. Experiments performed to investigate these problems indicated that our conclusions are not affected thereby.

We used 1978 Business Segment data to produce weighted price indexes for
about three—quarters of our sample, with the results changing only in the

second decimal place. Similarly, a separate smoothing of the price indexes,
to put them into fiscal year equivalents, have very little impact on the
final results.

4. An important practical advantage of this alternative approach is that
by assuming

c3

0 a priori it does not require the construction of an R&D

capital stock.

See Griliches (1973) and Terleckyj (1976) and

Griliches and Lichtenberg (this volume) for estimates based on this approach.

5. An independent year effect v (e. =

u

+ v + w.v) can also be taken

into account by adding time dummies instead of a time trend to the regression.

6. The model is then equivalent to the so—called "fixed effects model."

7. An intermediite step, without going fully to the sectoral level, is to
allow for spearate sectoral time—trends and intercepts while the total and
within estimates change only slightly for the scientific firms, the
total estimates of
tively,

and o. for the other group move up and down respec-

making them less different from those of the scientific group.

8. We also looked at the preceding six—year subperiod (1960—1965) for our

longer but smaller subsample of firms. The estimates are very similar to
those for 1966—71.

9. Our estimated regression standard errors are about .1 in the within
dimension, implying that we explain annual fluctuations in productivity up

to an error whose standard deviation is about 10 percent. Imposing the

a priori values of o and A

increases this error by less than 1 additional

percent.

10. This is computed from the average yearly rates of growth given in Table

5, using .65, .25, and .1 as relative weights for labor, physical capital,
and R&D capital respectively.

11. The data are taken from sources given in Griliches (l980b). The numbers
that correspond to those of Table 5 are:

Although the definitions and measures are quite different, and although our
firms are much faster growing than the scientific industries as a whole, the
growth patterns are very similar.

Three other possible misspecifications are the following: (4) ignoring

the possibility of random errors in our measures of labor and capital; (5)

assuming wrongly that firms operate in competitive markets; and, (6) ignoring

the peculiar selectivity of our sample. We shall allude briefly to

(4)

and (5) in what follows, but continue to ignore the selectivity issue,
postponing the investigation into this topic to a later study which will
be based on a much larger post—1972 sample.

Our second misspecification example, the omission of materials, does not

assume that c and k are predetermined and hence that the biases are only
due to the correlation of 9 and e; it provides, as we shall see below, a
rationalization of the decreasing returns to scale estimates in the within
dimension.
