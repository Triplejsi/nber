Dividend

Taxes, Corporate Investment, and "0"

ABSTRACT

Taxes on corporate distributions have traditionally been regarded

as a "double tax" on corporate income. This view implies that while the
total effective tax rate on corporate source income affects real economic
decisions, the distribution of this tax burden between the shareholders

and the corporation is irrelevant. Recent research has suggested an alternative to this traditional view. One explanation of why firms in the U.S.
pay dividends in spite of the heavy tax liabilities associated with this
form of distribution is that the stock market capitalizes the tax payments

associated with corporate distributions. This capitalization leaves investors indifferent at the margin between corporations paying our dividends

and retaining earnings. This alternative view holds that while changes in
the dividend tax rate will affect shareholder wealth, they will have no
impact on corporate investment decisions.
This paper

develops econometric tests which distinguish between these

two views of dividend taxation. By extending Tobin's "q" theory of investment to incorporate taxes at both the corporate and personal leves, the
implications of each view for corporate investment decisions can be derived.

The competing views may be tested by comparing the performance of investment

equations estimates under each theory's predictions. British time series
data are particularly appropriate for testing hypotheses about dividend
taxes because of the substantial postwar variation in effective tax rates

on corporate distributions. The econometric results suggest that dividend
taxes have important effects on investment decisions.

The influence of taxation on corporate investment decisions has been the

subject of numerous economic investigations. For the most part, these studies
have focused only on the effect of taxes levied at the corporate level,

examining the impact of changes in the corporate tax rate and depreciation

rules. The effects of reform in the taxation of corporate distributions have
received far less attention. This omission is significant since in Britain
during the last three decades the effective tax rate on corporate distributions has ranged between zero and thirty percent.

Taxes on corporate distributions have traditionally been regarded as a

in spite of the heavy tax liabilities associated with this form of distribution is that the stock market capitalizes the tax payments associated with

corporate distributions. This capitalization leaves investors.indifferent
at the margin between corporations paying out dividends and retaining

earnings. This alternative view holds that while changes in the dividend
tax rate will affect shareholder wealth, they will have no impact on corporate investment decisions.

This paper develops econometric tests which distinguish between these

are explored. The second section presents a version of the "q"

in the fourth section. A concluding section summarizes the findings and

I. Dividend Taxes and Corporate Distributions: Two Views

Analysis of the tax incentives for corporate distributions requires a
consistent framework for treating changes in both tax rates and tax systems.

We follow King (1977) in defining T as the rate of tax on undistributed
corporate profits, m as the marginal personal tax rate on dividend income,

and 8 as the shareholder's dividend receipts if the firm distributes one

pound of retained earnings.1 Therefore, if the firm distributes one pound
the shareholder receives (l—m)O pounds in after tax dividends. The effective rate of capita.l gains taxation is denoted by z.

It depends on both the

tax rate applicable to realized capital gains and the length of time between
accrual and realization of gains.

A corporation affects its shareholders' tax liabilities by choosing

whether to retain or to distribute corporate profits. The traditional view
implies that investors should not be indifferent to the firm's financial
policy. Since a pound retained yields (1—z). to the investor and a pound
distributed yields (l—m)O, only in the exceptional case when (l—z)

(l—m)O will

investors receive the same after tax return from retentions and distributions.2 For Britain, (l—z) > (l.-m)8 for the period 1947—58 and 1966—72.

Between 1959 and 1965, the two tax burdens were approximately equal. Since
1972, investors should have preferred dividends to capital gains since

under the current imputation system (1—z) < (l—m)O. Despite these tax
changes, British firms have continued simultaneously retaining earnings

1 King's (1977) definition of S corresponds to our S. Under the classical
system of company taxation, 0 = 1. Under the imputation system currently
used in Britain, 0 = (1 —

This is consistent with the "traditional" view but counter to the

and paying some of their profits as dividends (see Bank of England (1981)).
The payout ratio has not moved in the dramatic way which the simple tax
rule calculations would suggest.

The firms' apparent failure to optimize their financial policies with
respect to tax liabilities raises a difficult problem for investment theory.
A profit—maximizing firm should invest until the marginal return from addi-

tional investment equals the cost of capital. When the effective cost of
funds from different sources is unequal, the cost of capital becomes an

elusive concept. A firm's investment policy will depend upon its marginal
source of investment funds. The firm cannot be simultaneously indifferent
between investing a pound and reducing dividends, and between investing

a pound and issuing new equity. This is because the two financial actions
have different tax costs associated with them.

Different assumptions about the firm's marginal source of investment
finance have different implications for the investment consequences of

dividend taxes. The first approach, corresponding to the "traditional
view", argues that for some poorly understood reason firms act as if they
are required to distribute a substantial fraction of their real profits

in dividends. Subject to this constraint, the firm chooses an optimal investment plan and, when necessary, finances investment expenditures by

issuing new equity. In an all—equity economy, the firm's cost of capital is

demanded by investors.3 The (y) function captures the cost to the firm
of retaining earnings. It may be thought of as arising from considerations
of market signalling, or investor liquidity. Since lower payout ratios
induce investors to demand higher returns, '

is

negative. The firm chooses

its payout ratio to minimize the effective cost of capital. This means that

I

= 0, where y* is the optimal payout ratio. The firm's optimal invest—

ment policy should consist of equating the pretax return on capital and the
cost of capital. Since c depends on the tax rates, changes in either the
personal dividend tax rate (m) or the relative tax prices of dividends and
retentions (8) will affect investment policy.

This "traditional" model has several implications for the effects of

a change in the dividend tax rate. First, as dividend taxes increase the
dividend payout ratio should decline. The firm is equating the marginal
benefit from dividend payments, captured in the P function, with the marginal

cost of those payments. Since an increase in the dividend tax rate will
raise the marginal cost of these unmeasured benefits, the optimal payout

ratio should decline.5 A second implication of this model is that when the
dividend tax rate rises, equilibrium capital intensity will decline. Since
in equilibrium f'(k) = c we can solve for the change in the capital stock

Extension of the cost of capital expression to include the case of partial
debt finance is straightforward. If b is the ratio of the market value of
outstanding debt to the replacement value of the capital stock, then c' =
b(l—T)1 + (l—b)c, where c is taken from (1.1) and
is the nominal interest
rate. Debt finance is treated in more detail in Section II.
We consider "dividend tax" to mean the total (personal and corporate) tax
liabilities associated with the distribution of one pound of retained
earnings. This is (l—m)O.
Feidstein (1970, 1972) and King (1971, 1972) tested the hypothesis that the
payout ratio responded to changes in the effective dividend tax rate and
concluded that taxes did seem to affect firms' choice of dividend policy.
Their studies, however, did not focus primarily on the personal taxes
imposed on dividends.

The capital stock's response to changes in the dividend tax was calcu—
lated assuming that changes in the tax rate did not affect the pretax return

required by investors. An alternative extreme assumption is that capital
is supplied inelastically. The only effect of a dividend tax increase is a

reduction in the equilibrium rate of return, p. If capital was supplied
with some positive elasticity, then an increase in the dividend tax rate
would decrease both capital intensity and the rate of return.
Tlicre are two difficulties with this view of dividend taxes. First,

the theory provides no explanation for why firms pay dividends. Equivalently
stated there is no motivation for the 'Y(y) function. Edwards (1981) and
and Stiglitz (1980) have discussed some of the leading explanations,

-- 7

such as market signalling (Ross (1977) and Bhattacharya (1979)) and investor
clienteles (Feldstein and Green (1981)), and concluded that in almost every

case, there would exist a mechanism with a lower tax cost for
information or income from the firm to the shareholder.

transmitting

The payment of

dividends remains a puzzle in the "traditional" view. Second, the theory
implies that the marginal source of funds for new investment is either

new equity issues or reduced share repurchases. Since the latter are illegal
under Section 66 of the 1948 Companies Act, and most firms do not issue
new shares, the theory's premise seems unlikely.

The "new" view of dividend taxes, based on the notion of tax capitalization, was developed as a response to the problem of explaining why firms
pay dividends.6 The new view may be understood in terms of the above dis-

cussion as a different assumption about the firm's financial margin. The
dividend payout ratio is no longer fixed; dividends each period are determined as residual after desired new investment has been financed out of

retentions. If q represents the market's valuation of a pound of earnings
inside the firm, then the return to distributing earnings as dividends is

(l—m)9 and that from retentions is q(l—z). Firms will continue to invest
until investors are indifferent between paying out earnings and retaining

them. This means that q must equal

(1.4)

q* =

=

0.

Indeed in any model in which it is rational for firms to pay dividends,

this condition must hold. It implies that the marginal value to shareholders
of retentions equals that of dividends.
6

The tax capitalization hypothesis which underlies the new view was suggested
implicitly in the work of King (1977), and explicitly by Auerback (l979a,
1979b) and Bradford (1981).

The new view was developed to explain firm behavior when q* is less

than one. Values of q* > 1, as have prevailed in Britain since 1973, raise
some theoretical difficulties. Since dividends are tax favored, new share
issues are the preferred form of finance. A change in the dividend tax therefore affects on investment in the way we outlined for the traditional q* = 1
view.

The cost of equity capital in the "q*l" world is independent of
either the dividend payout ratio or the personal tax rate on dlv—

idends. Regardless of the firm's financial policy, the cost of capital is
c =

p/(l—z).

It is easy to verify that if the firm earns this return on its

investments, shareholders will receive their desired rate of return. Consider first a firm which distributes all its earnings in the form of dividends.
If the firm earns p/(l—z), it effectively pays Op/(1—z) in net dividends, on

which the shareholders are liable to taxes of mOp/(l—z). Therefore the
after tax return is (l—m)Op/(l—z). But since the price of a share is q*,
the rate of return is (l_m)pOI(l_z)q* =

p.

So by earning p/(l—z) the all—

dividends firm manages to provide its investors with their required rate of

return. Now consider the case of a firm which retains all its earnings.
If it earns p/(l—z) and retains this amount, then the value of a share rises

by (p/(l_z))q*. Investors pay capital gains tax on the value of this
increase, so they receive pq* after tax. The rate of return on this investment is just pq*/q* = p, so once again the investors are earning their

required rate of return. The dividend payout ratio is irrelevant to the
firm's cost of capital, and consequently to its investment plan.

Several other aspects of the q*l view deserve comment. First, provided
q*<l, firms never issue new shares. Firms are assumed to have sufficient

—9—
cash flow to pay for current investment and still pay some dividends.

Second, a change in dividend taxes leads to a recapitalization of the value

of corporate capital: this will reduce the value of stock market equity,
but will not affect the rate of return earned on shares. If the

desired wealth to income ratio is fixed, then an increase in the dividend
tax will actually increase equilibrium capital intensity by reducing the

market value of each physical unit of capital. Finally, permanent changes
in the dividend tax rate will have no effect on dividend policy. This is

because the firm's capital stock and investment, hence cash flow, are un-

affected by the dividend tax. Since dividend payments are the difference
between income and investment expenditure, they must also be unaffected by
the dividend tax.7

There are two principal difficulties with the capitalization model of

corporate investment. First, when q*<l, it predicts that firms should always
prefer acquiring new capital by taking over another company to purchasing

an equivalent amount of new capital. This is because the purchase price of
a new capital good is unity, but capital goods held by corporations are

valued at only (l—m)O/(l—z). Without limitations on takeovers, or other
devices for passing money to corporate shareholders without incurring dividend
tax liability, no equilibrium with q < 1 is sustainable. The second problem
with the capitalization theory is that it predicts volatile dividend payments
which will fall sharply when new opportunities make investment particularly

Suimners (1981) has observed that permanent changes in dividend tax rates
will have no effect, but temporary changes may have real consequences.
Timing of dividend payment is also considered by King (1974). Bradford (1981)
has generalized the dividend tax neutrality result and shown that in a
model with debt and equity finance, the debt—equity ratio is unaffected
by changes in the dividend tax rate.

desirable.

There seems to be little evidence that firms actually cut

dividends, and most research seems to support the notion of a rather
stable dividend payout ratio which managers set as a "target".8

Before discussing the two theories' implications for investment be-

havior, an important caveat is in order. There need not be a single

marginal source of finance for the entire economy. Different firms may
find it optimal to be on different margins9 and even within a single firm,

different forms of finance may be used on different projects. Therefore,
in the aggregate investment expenditures are likely to be financed partly

from new issues and partly from dividend cuts. Our empirical work attempts
to estimate the marginal funding shares which can be attributed to each
source.

These two views of dividend taxation have different implications for the

structure of investment relations based on Tobin's "q" theory. In a tax—
less world with homogeneous capital goods, Tobin (1969), following Keynes
(1936), explained that firms invest as long as each pound spent in acquiring new capital goods raises the market value of the firm by at least a

8

Anderson (1980) has conducted time series tests on the Lintner (1956)
"target payout ratio" hypothesis for Britain, and concluded that it explains the observed behavior of firms since 1963. For a general discussion of the difficulty of cutting dividends, see Brealey and Myers (1980,
Chapter 16).

Some firms may expect to experience negative profits in future years. If
this is true, many of the tax calculations which we perform are irrelevant: without taxable profits, the different rates of tax on different
sources of finance (to the firm) do not matter. This is just one explanation of why different firms might be observed to behave differently.

pound.

A number of empirical investigators10 have assumed that a good

approximation to the market value of an additional unit of capital is the

average market value of the existing capital stock. This amounts to
assuming that "average q", the ratio of the market value of the capital
stock to its replacement cost, is a good proxy for "marginal q".

Within this framework, it is natural to assume that the rate of

investment is an increasing function of "q". Given adjustment costs and
lags in decision making within the firm, one should not expect that all
investment opportunities which will increase market value by more than

their cost will be undertaken immediately. In fact, in the presence of
adjustment costs, firms will always choose to spread investment projects
over time.1'

In the traditional view of dividend taxes, the marginal pound which
is used to finance new investment comes from new equity issues, so the
firm will invest only if the ratio V/pK, where V is stock market value and
pK is the replacement value of the firm's existing capital stock, is greater
than unity. This means that the investment function takes the. form

Examples of U.S. investment studies based on the "q" model
include von Furstenberg (1977), Ciccolo (1975), Engle and Foley (1975),
and Summers (1981). Studies using British data include Jenkinson (1981)
and Oulton (1978, 1979).
This assumes, implicitly, that a convex adjustment cost function applies
to investment activities. For a discussion of the plausibility of this
assumption and some alternatives, see Rothschild (1971).

In

the q*l model, however, the marginal financial resources are obtained by

reducing dividend payments and the firm will therefore invest up to the point
at which the market value of an additional unit of capital, (l—m)O/(l—z),

II.

The Investment Function

In this section we develop a theory of the investment behavior of a
value—maximizing firm in an environment with stochastic adjustment costs.
The model is based on Summers' (1981) extension of Tobin's "q" investment

theory to incorporate personal taxes. This formulation is one of several
ways in which a q investment equation can be motivated on the basis of

optimizing behavior of firms. Derivations based on lags in delivery or
recognition imply relations very similar to those estimated here. The
validity of tests comparing models of dividend behavior does not depend upon
literal acceptance of the assumptions underlying the derivation presented

below. The model developed here does constitute a denial of Sargent's
(1976) claim that correlations between investment and q have no structural

significance. We begin by considering the investment decisions of a firm

which

behaves according to the capitalization hypothesis and constrast the

results with those obtained under the double tax view of dividend taxation.
Under the assumptions of the capitalization hypothesis, firms choose
to issue no new equity and are barred from repurchasing existing shares so
that prices are proportional to the outstanding value of a firm's equity.

We assume that equity holders require a fixed real after tax return p to

induce them to hold the outstanding equity. The sum of the expected net of
tax capital gains and dividend return on equity must equal p,12 so that
pV(t) =

where Dg(t) defines gross dividend payments by the firm and V(t) is the market

value of the firm's equity. Future dividends are uncertain because of tech—

nological shocks to the production and adjustment cost functions. Factor
price and tax uncertainty could be treated easily. The expectation in (2.1)
is taken over the random variables which generate these uncertainties. To
solve the differential equation (2 .1) for V(t), a transversality condition
must be imposed on the path of V.

Excluding the possibility that the

value of the firm becomes infinite in finite time by requiring

him Et {V(s) e_1)_t)} 0

enables us to solve the differential

equation (2.1) and find that:

(2.2)

V(t) = E

=

Dg(S) exp(-

S P(r)dr})dS

Note that the expectation in (2.2) is over the entire future path of random
variables which affect dividends.

The firm seeks to maximize (2.2) subject to constraints on its initial capital

stock and its investment program. We will assume that credit market constraints
do not permit the firm to finance more than a fraction b of its investment through

debt finance. This can be thought of as a measure of the firm's debt capacity.
In the model presented below, the firm will always choose to borrow as much as
possible, so b percent of all new investment finance comes from debt issues and
(1—b) from retained earnings.

Any theory of investment, as opposed to a theory of the optimal capital stock,

must explain why the firm does not instantaneously adjust its capital stock. We

— 16 —

assume that there are internal adjustment costs)3 The cost in terms of
managerial time and resources of installing new capital is assumed to rise
with the rate of capital accumulation.

We assume that the adjustment cost

function, (,E1) is convex, homogeneous in investment and capital, subject
to random shocks

and that (Ol) E 0. Under these conditions dividends

may be derived as after tax profits less investment expenses.

and hence ineligible for investment incentive treatment.14 We have assumed that
firms have positive profits at all times and are able to deduct depreciation

allowances from corporate taxes. This may be an unreasonable assumption for tha
last decade, and we discuss modifications in Section IV.
Equations (2.2) and (2.3) imply that

The operative distinction here is between internal adjustment costs, which
are resource costs to the firm induced by the decision to invest, and external
adjustment costs which correspond to an increase in the price of investment
goods as all firms attempt to invest more quickly. See Mussa (1977) for some
discussion of these issues.

l4 alternative assumption corresponding to external adjustment costs would
increase the price of investment goods to p+ (-Y} and then allow the adjustment
costs to be eligible for investment grants and depreciation allowances. This
approach, used by Hayashi (1981), generates a slightly different formulation
of the equilibrium q relationship and the investment function. When we used
this approach and tested the competing theories of dividend taxes, the results
were the same as those obtained using the internal adjustment cost formu1ation

This result has an easy intuitive interpretation. The shadow price of an
dditional unit of capital is equated to its marginal cost, in after tax
pounds. One implication of (2.7) is that there will be investment even if
the shadow price of capital goods is less than unity, because the tax system
reduces the effective price of new capital goods.

Equation (2.7) is of no operational significance as a theory of investment unless an observable counterpart to the shadow price A can be developed.
Hayashi (1981) has shown in a less complicated model how the shadow price and

the market valuation of existing capital are related. Our result extends
his by considering the case of uncertain future dividend streams, and the
role of taxes levied at the personal level.

The link between A and market value can be demonstrated as follows.
Note that V(t) —

B(t)

given in (2.4) is homogeneous in K(t); a doubling

of K(t), together with the optimal doubling of investment and labor in

every subsequent period, will double V(t)—B(t). This follows from the
assumption of constant returns to scale in the production function and

homogeneity of the adjustment cost function. It follows that (V'(t)—B(t))
=

ppK(t)

where V*(t) is the value of the stock market at time t when the

optimal investment plan is followed. The maximized value of the firm at
time t, minus the value of depreciation allowances on existing capital,

is proportional to the value of the initial capital stock. The maximum
principle implies that dV*(t)IdK(t) =

1(t);

this is just what is meant by

the assertion that 1(t) is the shadcw piCC of new investment, or "marginal

Econometric

issues, such as the independence of

and Q, are discussed at

that point.

Before discussing the investment function under the alternative "q=l"
or "double—tax" hypotheses, several features of the investment function in

(2.13) deserve comment. First, the specification incorporates future expectations. Robert Lucas (1976) has argued that econometric investment
'equations which do not incorporate rational adaptation to policy changes

cannot be used to predict the effects of such changes. The approach developed here is not subject to this objection because the parameters which
are estimated, 6 and fl, are technological. Since policy actions are

assumed to have no effect on the adjustment cost function the investment

equation will be unaffected by changes in policy expectations. The q
model impounds expectations of future tax policy changes in the V/pK term.
While the market's valuation of existing capital will be affected by the
investor's expectations about the future, only the current values of the
tax parameters and the current value of the stock market enter the esti-

mated investment function. Second, other approaches to estimating the
investment impact of personal taxes require us to specify the firm's cost

of capital; the "q" formulation does not. Since the investors' discount
rate o enters the cost of capital and is unobservable, efforts to define

the cost of capital are prone to error. The "q" approach avoids this
difficull ty.

The superiority of the "q" approach can be illustrated by comparing
our strategy for estimating the effects of investment incentives with
those based on the flexible accelerator approach pioneered by Hall and

— 21 —

Jorgenson (1967). Presumably, one important channel by which tax incentives
influence investment is by reducing capital costs leading firms to raise their

desired supply of output. In the q model, expectations of higher output and
profits are immediately incorporated in the marketTs valuation of corporate

capital. By comparison, this expected output effect is constrained to be
zero in the neoclassical investment formulation where investment is modelled

holding desired output constant. Moreover, expected future output is modelled
as a distributed lag forecast based on past output, so changes in the firm's
expectations about future output are not allowed to depend on tax policy.
The model which was developed above assumed that the firm was choosing

between paying dividends and investing. This is the margin which underlies
the capitalization hypothesis. Now, we consider the model of the firm
which supports the double tax view of dividend taxation and investment.
The firm is assumed to pay out a fixed fraction, y, of its real profits

in every period. In the notation of (2.4), the firm is distributing

(2.14)

y(l Dg

T)(pF{K,L,2}

- wL -

The firm chooses an optimal investment plan, hence an optimal capital stock
through time, and finances investment with new share issues whenever neces-

sary. If S is the value of new shares issued, then the equality of sources
and uses of financial capital implies

changes in their equity portfolio if
(2.16)

Notice that the capital gain component which current shareholders value
is not the total increase in the market value of the firm, but only that
part which is not attributable to new share issues.

Our tests of the two hypotheses about the financial margin at which firms
operate are based on comparisons between investment equations (2.13) and
(2.20).

Because all firms may not be on the same margin, the aggregate

function might be a weighted average of the "capitalization"

investment

and the "double tax" investment functions. In order to allow for this

possibility,
we specified an investment equation with a weight of c on (2.20) and
(1—ct) on (2.13). If Z =

The traditional view of the dividend tax is supported by estimates of a

is close to zero, then tax capitalization

would appear to be the more appropriate model. We estimate (2.21) and
perform this test in the fourth section of the paper.

Data

The principal data requirement for the estimation of the model developed
in the preceding section is the construction of time series for tax adjusted

Q, and the gross investment rate. This section describes the construction
of an annual time series for these variables —

British

Industrial and Commercial

companies covering the period 1950 — 1980.

A. Tax Adjusted Q
The vafues of the replacement cost of the capital stock, pk, the market
value of equity v1 and the debt capital ratio b, are drawn from the Bank of

ngland (1980) for the post—1963 period. Earlier data, on an annual basis,
were sometimes available from CSO. In other cases we extrapolated backwards
as described in an appendix. Information on the marginal rates of individual
income tax or dividends and capital gains (m and z) and the tax disincentive
to dividend payment ®, was obtained from King (1977) and King, Neldrett and
Poterba (1981).

The principal complexities came in the calculations of terms reflecting
the effects of depreciation allowances and investment inventives on old capital,

B, and new capital u. Estimates of u, using procedures similar to ours have
been presented by Meliss and Richardson for the post—1963 period. The only
previous attempt to calculate B was made by Oultori (1979) who assumed the

economy was in steady state through the period. Consistent estimates of B
and u can be derived for the entire post—war period from information on
tax depreciation rules.

— 25 —

British

tax law identifies three distinct types of investment: 1) buildings,

2) plant, machinery and most types of vehicles, and 3) automobiles. The last
two are treated in essentially identical fashion except for minor differences

in the rates of writing down allowances. For each type of investment, wecalcu—
lated the present value of depreciation allowances which the firm could expect

to accrue over the lifetime of the investment. For each year after the investment and until the capital goods were completely written down for tax purposes,
15
we determined the present value of the remaining future depreciation allowances.

By aggregating the value of the remaining allowances over vintages of capital, we
computed the total value of the remaining depreciation allowances on the existing
capital stock.

The treatment of investment incentives on buildings will be described first.
Building investment, denoted Ib(t), is eligible for a tax free investment grant

(z) and taxable initial (z) allowances and investment allowances (z) in the
year of construction. In subsequent years, buildings are depreciated on a
straight line, historic cost schedule at the rate of writing down allowances

(z). The present value of the investment incentives on a one pound investment
is

where i is the nominal interest rate on British government
rate becuase we are discounting a nominal stream of after—tax payments which is
essentially risk—free.

The expression for Ub describes the present value of the subsidies which a
firm can expect to receive when it considers investing in a new building. A
related concept is the present value, at time t, of the remaining depreciation

allowances (the "value of the depreciation bond") on investment put in place at

time s<t. This consists of the present value of the writing down allowances for
the Tb(s)_(t_s) years remaining in the taxable life of the building. The value
of these remaining allowances, RlD(s,t), is just

Both Ub and

are computed under the assumptions

that 1) the firm will always have positive profits, against

which to deduct the

investment allowances and 2) firms anticipate that the current corporate tax rate
will never change.
The tax treatment of plant, machinery, cars and other vehicle differs from

that for buildings in that the writing down allowances are granted on a declining

balance basis. The value of the plant which may be depreciated is the initial
cost of the plant minus the investment grant and the initial allowance. In the

above notation with subscript "p" for plant and machinery,

The expressions for cars, u and R(s,t), are exactly the same with z replacing
z. Following the Bank of England (1980), we truncated the infinite series in (3.3)
and (3.4) at a 33 year lifetime for plant and a 10 year lifetime for autos. Since
1972 the tax law has permitted the full expensing of investment in plant and
machinery. This corresponds to zd=l.0, and all of the investment incentives are
collected in the year when the plant is installed.

The computed values of u, Ub, and U enabled us to compute the effective
investment incentive which applied in each year since 1948. We did this by weighting the three investment credit series by the share of each type of gross invest-

ment)6 The resulting series, u, measures the reduction in the cost of new
investment goods which firms received because of investment incentives on a typical

pound of investment. The series peaked in 1977, when investment incentives
allowed firms to recoup 52.8 percent of investment costs. The full time series is
reported in Column I of Table One.
16

While the tax treatment of auto differs from that for other types of vehicles,
the available data on investment is typically divided into buildings, plant! machinery, and all vehicles. To obtain the present value of investment credits on
vehicles, we again followed the Bank of England (1980) and formed a weighted
average of u and u with weighys .24 and .76, respectively. These weights
approximately correpond to the share of autos in vehicle investment. Some sensitivity tests showed that our results are very insensitive to this weighting.

_28...

Our computations onR(s,t) for the three types of investment expenditures allow
us to determine the remaining value of the depreciation bond for all capital

installed after 1947. However, for the early post—war years, it is important to
know about investment before 1947. Unfortunately, information on the vintage
composition of the capital stock which was standing at the end of World War II is

We approximated the depreciation bond by assuming that the net

capital stock in 1948, K948, would depreciate at a constant exponential rate and
that companies would be permitted to deduct true economic depreciation on that

capital stock forever. The exponential decay rate was calculated to be .04 per
year using capital consumption and net capital stock data. Therefore, we computed

The actual values of this series are displayed in Column Two of Table One, and

there is quite a substantial amount of variation in the data. This suggests that
a computation based on steady states (i.e., Oulton (1979)) might be substantially

misleading. For 1980, a year when the total market valuation of equity and
preference shares was 81.94 billion pounds, the value of remaining depreciation
claims was 7.04 billion, or 8.6 percent of the market's valuation. Alternatively,
this may be thought of as 2.7 percent of the replacement value of the net capital
stock.

A practical problem in the constructicn of Q measures is the treatment of

inventories and work in progress. The definition of Q's denominator, the replacement value of the capital stock, is complicated by the presence of inven-

tories and work in progress. Two approaches to the treatment of inventories
were pursued. The first is to add together the replacement value of inventories
and the physical capital stock and consider this as a measure of the total

replacement value of the firm's physical assets. This approach, which we used,
requires computing

The alternative approach is to treat inventories

as liquid assets and to subtract their value from the numerator of Q and
—

compute

B— INV

This method of adjustment was also tried, and it yielded

investment equation results very similar to those obtained with the first

procedure. We report the series for

V-B
in Table One, Column 3. This
pK+INV

series has ranged from .11 to 1.00 during the last 30 years.

The Gross Investment Rate
The dependent variable in our specifications is the ratio of gross

investment to the net capital stock. Data on gross investment by ICCs is
available for the period since 1963. Before that, we extrapolated using
data from the Annual Abstract of Statistics on investment by quoted companies

and all non—nationalized companies. The net capital stock was computed in
a similar fashion, using data from the Bank of England (1980) for the period
since 1960 and Blue Book estimates of the net company sector capital stock

and net investment for the pre—1960 period. Our series for the investment
rate is shown in Column Six of Table One. The gross investment rate averages
7.5 for our sample period and peaks at 9.87 percent in 1964.

Results
This section describes our empirical tests of the double tax and capit-

alization models. The two theories of dividend taxation give rise to the
alternative empirical models of corporate investment behavior presented in

(2.13) and (2.20). These equations are reproduced below; (4.la) corresponds
to the capitalization view and (4.lb) is derived under the assumptions of
the traditional model.

The difference between Q and 5

is

that Q adjusts the market value of the firm's

equity to take account of future tax liabilities on the firm's dividends,
while Q ignores this adjustment.

Before turning to the empirical results, it is necessary to discuss

several issues connected with the estimation. The exogeneity of Q in (4.la)
is a delicate issue. There is no reason to believe that Q and

are

uncorrelated. Shocks to the adjustment cost function may affect market valu-

ation V, and therefore Q. This endogeneity is not likely to be severe since
the vast majority of the variance in Q arises from other sources. The left
out variable error formula implies that the bias in the OLS estimate of 3
is given by:

—

covc.

varQ
0

This implies that the bias is bounded by the variance ofc , which a. indicated
(5Q

below is negligible relative to the estimates of .

As a further precaution and

in order to treat errors in measurement V and K, many of the equations were

estimated using instrumental variables. The instruments were lagged values of
the tax rates which went into the construction of Q. There is no reason to
expect these variables to be correlated with technological shocks to the adjustment cost function.
A

Preliminary

experimentation revealed that

lagged

values of Q and Q entered

(.) with a very significant coefficient. While the theory developed in the
preceding section implies that lagged Q should have no impact on investment
given contemporaneous Q, lagged Q is included in all the estimated equations.
Its presence is justified by delivery and decision lags and by the possibility

of difficulties in data alignment. Inclusion of additional lagged values of Q

— 33 —

or

lagged values of the dependent variable did not improve the predictive power

of the equations after making autocorrelation corrections.

The residuals in (4.1) displayed substantial autocorrelation. The
equations were therefore re—estimated using a maximum likelihood procedure

to correct the second order serial correlation in the residuals. Examination
of the correllogram of the estimated residuals suggested that this was suf—

ficient to achieve efficiency. The instrumental variable estimates were
corrected foT autocorrelation by applying the non—linear two stage least
squares procedure of Amemiya (1974) to the quasi—differenced form of (4).
We present results for three sample periods in Table 2: (1) 1950—80,

which is the full period for which our data were available; (2) 1963—80, the
period for which Bank of England data were available and during which it
was not necessary to make extrapolations and interpolations; and (3)

1950—72. There are two reasons for terminating the sample in 1972; both
relate to the tax reform which took effect in 1973. First, 1972 is the
last year when q*<l and the pure capitalization hypothesis should apply.

Since 1973, q*>l and we have assumed that firms treat this as q*l. The
second reason for excluding the last eight years is that since 1973, many

firms have paid no corporate profits taxes. Therefore, it becomes necessary
to re—examine some of the calculations in Section II: in particular, firms
will face values of t=0 which implies u=0 and B=0.

If the firm pays no

taxes, depreciation allowances which can be written off against taxes are
of little value.'8

18

We have estimated equations for the whole sample in which we constrain
Tu=B=0 for the whole post—1972 period. This turns out to reduce the explanatory power of the equations and does not alter any of the basic results
which are reported here.

The results demonstrate the superiority of the Q specification based
on the "traditional view" of dividend taxation. It outperforms the equations
based on the capitalization hypothesis for all sample periods. The standard
error of estimate in the OLS equation is only 75 percent of that for the

alternative hypothesis. The "traditional view" specifications also provide
much better fits in the generalized least squares regressions, and the instrumental variable estimations.

A more formal comparison of the two hypotheses is possible. We begin
by reporting the likelihood ratios for the pairs of equations in Table 2.

These ratios represent the posterior odds ratio implied by Bayes' theorem

starting with a diffuse prior or the two hypotheses. That is, if one started
out assigning equal prior likelihoods to the estimated equations for two
hypotheses, and then used these equations together with standard rules of
inference, they represent the posterior odds ratio we would assign to the two

hypotheses.'9 In all cases, the likelihood of the "double tax" hypothesis
far exceeds that of the capitalization hypothesis. The worst case for the
traditional view suggests that it is almost six times more likely than the
new view.

An alternative and perhaps more informative way of comparing the two

hypotheses is through a specification test. Pesaran (1974) has shown that
the Cox specification test takes a particularly simple form in the case of two

non—vested linear models. The test requires that one of the hypotheses be
chosen as the null. The Cox test statistic, p, is then asymptotically distributed as N90.l) under the null. It is essentially a measure of the
superiority of the relative performance of the null. The criterion for rejecting the null yields a one—sided test. If p is a large negative number,
the null is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

where a

using posterior odds ratios to compare alternative model specifications has
a long history in statistics and econometrics. Zeliner (1979) discusses
the

merits of this approach.

20 The test in the AR2 case was performed by quasidifferencing the data using
the average of the p1 and p2 values implied by equations 2a and 2b and then

using OLS. This is only legitimate because of the near equality of the
values of p1 and p2 in the two equations.

— 37 —

While the results show that the double tax view is
never rejected in favor of
capitalization, the capitalization model is rejected with a high degree of con—
fidence in favor of double tax.21

While our research focuses on the use of investment equations to test
hypotheses about the financial behavior, the equations reported in Table 2

may be analyzed as investment equations in their own right. They support
earlier findings by Jenkinson (1981) and Oulton (1979) that the q theory model
can be quite powerful in explaining the observed investment behavior of

British industry. Our results suggest that an increase of 10 percent in the
stock market would raise the investment rate C, about 15 percent. The
coefficients on Q in the reported investment equations are larger than those
in earlier studies despite the division of our Q measure by (1—i)

.

This

is probably due to our use of annual as opposed to quarterly data series,
the extension of the sample period and the improved estimates of tax effects.

22

Our equations also fit somewhat better than earlier efforts.

The equations also provide information about the dynamics of investment

behavior. The year—lagged value of Q always enters significantly and with
a coefficient that is about two thirds of the value of the current Q. Our
results indicate that about 60% of the total investment response to Q occurs
within a year of the change in the valuation ratio.
Part of the explanation for our larger coefficient is that annual data
on Q is less contaminated by short—term fluctuations in market value than
quarterly Q, so our equations are more successful at capturing the underlying

21 We

also tested the competing hypotheses by including both Q and Q in the
equation. In this case, Q and Q1 always entered with significant positive

coefficients and Q, Q1 had negative coefficients which were sometimes
significant. This simple test also suggests that Q is more appropriate
than Q.

and Oulton (1979) employ quarterly data compiled by

long—term relationship between Q and investment. Most of the noise and
measurement should be concentrated at relatively high frequencies while
day to day changes in the market's value and in equity prices may be the
result of new information or speculation; the longer term movements in the
market probably reflect something about investors' underlying view of the

returns to capital investment. This argument also explains why the correction
for autocorrelation reduces the coefficients of Q. Quasi differencing the
data increases the weight placed

high frequencies.

Engle and Foley (1975) have invoked this argument and then estimated an
investment function for the United States using the band spectral regression
23

technique.

This approach involves decomposition of the observed data series

into frequency components and then filtering of data to eliminate high fre-

quency variations. In applying this approach to British investment data, we
alternately chose to eliminate those components of the variance in Q which

occurred at periodicities below three and five years. The results, reported
below, show that in fact the low frequency relationship between the investment
rate and the valuation ratio is stronger than the relationship which is observed

using the raw data on Q and investment. The effect of an increase in Q which
is caused by a permanent change in the corporate environment, for example a
new tax policy, is larger than one caused by a momentary increase in stock

market values. The superiority of the Q to Q equations also remains evident
at low frequencies.

All of the tests of the two dividend tax hypotheses which we have

reported so far involve comparison of two alternative hypotheses. In Section
II, however, we argued that there was no single margin for the whole economy

23 Band spectrum regression is described in greater detail in Eagle (1974).

and that in practice the aggregate investment equation would reflect a

weighted average of the two finance sources. Defining Z

(l—m)O/(l—z), we

claimed that the aggregate investment function could be written

=

(4.4)

+ [(a +

(1

-

a)Z) + u +

b -

1] +

where a represents the fraction of investment financed at the margin by new
equity issues, and (1—a) the share financed out of retentions. The double
taxation hypothesis implies a
a =

1.0 while the capitalization view predicts

0.
The results of estimating equation (4.4) using non—linear least squares

are reported in Table 4. They tell a consistent story. The estimates of a
range from .76 to 2.16. In all but one case the hypothesis that a = 0 can
be rejected at the 5 percent level. The hypothesis is that a = 1 cannot
be rejected except for the 1963—80 period when a =

2.16.

These results

suggest that the capitalization hypothesis does not describe the behavior
of the firms who undertake any empirically significant fraction of investment.
The results in this section universally support the traditional view of

dividend taxation. The tax factor in Q implied by the capitalization view
clearly detracts from the explanatory power of the investment equations.

These results contrast with Summers (1981) who found that tax adjustments

added to the explanatory power of Q investment equations for the U.S. The
difference may arise because the earlier study tested the contribution of
all the tax effects jointly rather than just the effect of the adjustment

for distributions. Alternatively, it may reflect differences between countries
in corporate behavior.

Conclusions
The results in this paper provide strong support for the traditional

view that dividend taxes discourage corporate investment. The data decisively
refute the hypothesis that by raising the cost of paying out funds to share-

holders, dividend taxes encourage investment through retentions. Rather, it
appears that in making investment decisions, corporations act as if marginal

investment is financed through new share issues. This suggests that the capitalization hypothesis cannot account for dividend behavior in the UK.
These findings have important implications for both tax analysis and

policy. They imply that even though only a negligible fraction of investment
is financed through new share issues, dividend taxes nonetheless have potent

effects on the cost of capital and investment. This implies that formulations
which employ weighted average costs of capital and assign a large weight to

retentions will badly understate the disincentive to investment caused by the
tax system. More generally, these results strongly confirm the importance of
considering taxes levied at both the corporate and personal levels in assessing

the tax system's impact on capital formation. This suggests the importance
of including variables reflecting personal taxes in standard investment sped—
f icat ions.

This research could usefully be extended in several directions. If the
investment equations reported here were coupled with a model of stock market
valuating it would be possible to obtain estimates of the effect of tax reforms

on investment. A rational expectations approach to modelling market valuation
is developed in Summers (1981), which shows how it can be used to estimate the
effect of policy announcements and temporary policy changes as well as the

types of reform usually considered. It might also be valuable to examine

— 43 —

empirically

the effects of various tax reforms on q. This would require

modelling investors anticipations about future tax rules. The sources and uses of
funds identity connects decisions regarding investment, leverage, and payout

policy. It would be valuable to examine the effects of changes in q, and in
tax policy on these variables in a model in which they were jointly determined.

Most importantly, the negative findings in this paper regarding the
"capitalization" hypothesis underscore the importance of developing a satis-

factory theory of dividend behavior. The "traditional" view supported here
offers no convincing explanation for the payment of dividends. Until such an
explanation is found, it will be difficult to model persuasively the effects
of changes in tax pclicy regarding corporate distributions.
