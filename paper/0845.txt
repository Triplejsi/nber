Expectations and Forecasts from Business Outlook Surveys

ABSTRACT

Each quarter since 1968 the National Bureau of Economic Research, in
collaboration with the American Statistical Association, has been collecting
a large amount of information on the record of forecasting in the U. S. economy.
This paper is a progress report on a comprehensive study of the distribution
of individual predictions from these surveys. It covers forecasts of quarterly
developments in the year ahead for six variables representing inflation, real
growth, unemployment, percentage changes in GNP and spending on consumer dur—
ables, and business inventory investment. The 79 respondents who participated
in at least 12 of the 42 surveys covered constitute a broadly based and diversified group of experts and agents, mostly from the world of corporate business
and finance——executives, analysts, economic consultants, also some government
arid academic forecasters. The data are in certain respects uniquely rich.
The first part of the paper reviews briefly the models of economic expectations and discusses the potential and problems of using survey data for testing
these models. The second part offers a comparative analysis of the individual
prediction series from the NBER-ASA as well as some earlier surveys. There are
gains from combining predictions from different sources, e.g., the group mean
forecasts are on the average over time more accurate than most of the corresponding sets of individual forecasts or expectations. But there is also a
moderate degree of consistency in the relative performances of individual forecasters, some of whom score well above average with respect to several variables
and predictive horizons.
The third section presents the distributions of an array of absolute
accuracy measures for the survey respondents, regressions of actual on predicted values, and associated tests of bias and autocorrelation of error.
The marginal forecast errors tend to increase, and the correlations between
predictions and realizations tend to decrease, as the target quarter recedes
into the future. The tests of the joint null hypothesis that the regressions
have zero intercepts and unitary slope coefficients are very unfavorable to
expectations of inflation, but they show the forecasts of the other variables
generally in much better light. Inflation has been largely underestimated, with
the predicted rates lagging behind the actual rates. On the other hand, real
growth has been on the average overestimated. The incidence of autocorrelation
in the prediction errors was also much higher for inflation than for the other
variables.

A summary of findings is provided. The fifth and last section lists some
additional questions raised by this study, to be dealt with in another paper.

I. Pde1s, Tests and Data

Realizations of economic processes are singular, though often subject to

different interpretations. In contrast, expectations are as a rule plural and
mutually exclusive, referring as they do to sets of more or less probable outcomes of alternative courses of action and to the interplay of partially known

past events and imagined future eventualities. The process of the formation
of expectations is internal to their source and hidden to outsiders; it may be

complex and need not be explicit. Even the results of the process are never
readily observable; however, some can be and are reported through guestion—

naire surveys. These data pose many problems but so do the attempts to model
the formation of economic expectations, that is, to infer the latter from
postulated relations with observed (realization) variables.

On Models of Expectations
Starting from deterministic formulae (simple moving averages, trend
projections), the evolution of extrapolative models proceeded along two
related lines, through recognition of (a) learning from errors and (b) the

stochastic nature of most economic processes. The linear distributed—lag
function generating one—period ahead predictions of a variable y,

likely) that the 8's decline into the past from some point in time I

and the linear extrapolation (1) would do so under less

restrictive conditions. 1

The most recent and sophisticated methods of extrapolating the future
values of a series from its past values derive from the analysis of stationary

and regressive elements appearing, respectively, on the right—hand sides of the
three equations. See Kane and Malkiel 1976; Jacobs and Jones 1980; Curtin 1980.

and homogeneous nonstationary stochastic processes.2 When skillfully applied
to sufficiently large amounts of good data, these techniques can be quite

effective in practice. However, univariate times series models do not attempt
to describe or explain the relationships expected to exist among different

variables. In principle, knowledge of the true structure of such relations
provides additional predictive information, which a properly specified
econometric model can exploit but a purely extrapolative model cannot. In

short, let X be the vector of those variables that influence y and let

LX and Ly (L being a general lag operator) represent the appropriately

weighted sums of the terms X_ and 't—]' respectively. Then the model
*

y = f(LX,

(7)

Ly)

would dominate even the best extrapolative model, since the latter would have

as its arguments Ly

alone.3

Economic expectations are to some extent autonomous in the sense of using
information that is not contained in the past values of any regular time—
series variable, e.g., news on current actions and plans of the government,

class of time series models includes the autoregressive (AR),
moving average (MA), and mixed and integrated processes (ARI4A and ARIMA).
Box and Jenkins 1970.

See

3Some but not all of the past effects on y of LX are accounted for
indirectly in Ly. Implementation of (7) might take the form of a combined
regression—cumtimeSerieS model (or, if y and y are vectors, a multi—
equation system including both econometric and time—series components). Such
a model could provide a proper representation of a multivariate time series
process, which is consistent with, but more informative than, a set of the
corresponding univariate time—series models (Zeilner and Palm 1974). Only in
very special cases are purely extrapolative expectations "rational" in the
sense that they employ all available information (Nelson 1975). It is well to
remember, however, that this theoretical advantage of econometric models
presupposes their validity and may be canceled by misspecificatiOfl errors.
Also, the incremental gains from using a correct econometric model instead of
an efficient time—series model need not always be large enough to justify the
costs which may be much larger for the former than for the latter (Feige and
Pearce 1976).

4

strikes, international developments, opinion polls, etc. Market rewards
motivate economic agents to use all information that can be acquired in a

cost—effective way. The rational expectations hypothesis assumes that a
sufficiently large number of agents know "how the world works," that is,
recognize the structure of their economic environment and efficiently process

all available and pertinent data. It is the so formed expectations that are
decisive for what transpires in the market place and they are reflected in the
equilibrating behavior of prices and other endogenous variables (Muth 1961;

Poole 1976). Rational expectations contain only purely random (though
possibly large) errors and thus satisfy

(Y1It_i) =

where

is the expected value operator and

the set of information

available at the end of period (t—1) on which y is conditioned, includes
the knowledge of the required models as well as the data.
Formulation (8) is too abstract to be useful in practice, but all
attempts to work out the full implications of this approach in its strongest

form confront a dilemmae Without specifying the contents of the information
set

the rationality of the corresponding expectations cannot be given

a complete evaluation. But in most cases that matter (e.g., for the much
studied expectations of inflation) it seems impossible to know what

contains. Economists do not agree on all the important features of their
models, and insofar as the models contradict each other they surely cannot all

5

be properly specified.4 It is difficult to accept the notion that the
representative agent is free of the limitations of knowledge that are evident

in experts' analysis of the economy. But consequences of incomplete
information or deficient knowledge may be mistaken for departure from rational
expectations .

Tests of the Models and Survey Data
One implication of (8), namely that the expectational errors are
unbiased,

(9)

c(y* —

= 0

can, of course, be tested without specifying 1i' providing that adequate

data on y are available. To this end, the regression

(10)

y=a+bYt+ut

is estimated to verify or falsify the joint hypothesis that a

and b are

not statistically different from 0 and 1, respectively. However, this is a
weak test of rational expectations, since the latter imply an efficient use of

all pertinent information, not just unbiasedness. A considerably stronger

test would require, in addition to H0: (a, b) =

(0,

1), that the errors

4The existing econometric models in effect summarize the average
historical experience in the past few decades, and their fixed—weight
equations attribute to economic agents the same behavior patterns under very
different economic conditions and policy regimes. But such invariance is not
really credible. For a serious criticism of such models from the point of
view of the rational expectations hypothesis, see Lucas 1976. However, the
construction of econometric models that would conform strictly to the rule of
rational expectations runs into major identification problems.
5Sorae errors that appear to be "systematic" in retrospect could not have
been detected and corrected on a current basis, as will be illustrated later
in this paper. There is often much uncertainty about what is happening in the
economy for lack of sufficiently long series of consistent and timely
observations (Zarnowitz 1982).

that are themselves a part of

be essentially free of all avoidable

systematic elements such as significant autocorrelations.
Much effort was spent in recent years on the collection and processing of

expectational data from periodic surveys of various groups: consumers,
corporate managers, business and financial analysts, economists. This work
was motivated mainly by the prospect of obtaining useful tools for practical
forecasting, but it is increasingly recognized that the surveys provide the

principal source of direct measures of economic expectations. Since the
models discussed above raise many questions and need to be tested, such
measures have important analytical uses.
The basic survey data represent anticipations, intentions, forecasts or
plans of individuals and teams (organizations), but studies have used only or
mainly the time series of averages based on responses to a sequence of surveys

by groups whose composition varies over time. This raises the possibility of
serious aggregation errors due to the neglect of the cross—section and

distributional aspects of the data: differences among the individuals and
susbgroups; sampling variation; consistency and representativeness of the

employed averages.6 This study will pay attention to some of these aspects.
At any time, some people will outperform others in anticipating the
future, partly by chance and partly because of systematic factors such as
greater incentives, more skills and knowledge, and access to better

information. Those who succeed relatively often tend to reap market gains;
the competitive game of economic prediction cannot be comprehended by treating

expectations as if they were single—valued and universally shared. Modeling

6 early study which dealt with certain characteristics of the relation
between aggregate and individual forecasts is Zarnowitz 1967, pp. 123-126. A
recent analysis of disaggregated data from surveys of inflation forecasts is

7

of expectations, therefore, should allow for their dispersion. In this
context, it is important to distinguish between individual and market

expectations. Prices in a market may incorporate all available information,
even though price expectations of many, perhaps most, traders do not meet the

rationality criterion. This will happen simply if some resourceful
participants have their way in eliminating the unexploited profit
opportunities in the given market.7
However, under uncertainty, quantity signals may be as important as price
signals, particularly in areas of the economy other than the competitive

auction markets with flexible prices. Economic agents are presumably most
interested in the local variables (quantities as well as prices) which relate

closely to their own activities. But aggregate measures such as GNP and
components, changes in money, credit, price levels and interest rates,

sensitive cyclical indicators, foreign trade and exchange rates, are also

widely monitored and selectively used. For most of the macrovariables, market
expectations are nonexistent or unobservable, but it is evident that numerous

predictions are being regularly made and used throughout the economy. The
outlook for the economy plays an essential role in shaping expectations of
many decision—making units, including prominently large and diversified

corporations. Macropredictions serve as important inputs to micropredictions.
Not surprisingly, professional business analysts and economists produce
the bulk of the macroeconomic predictions, both for public and internal uses,

and many of them participate in periodic business outlook surveys. It might
be argued that these are forecasts of people who study the economy (experts),
which are quite unlike the expectations of those who act in the economy

71n short, rational market reactions may coexist with a large element of
individual "irrationality." For an early argument along these lines, see
Becker 1962.

(agents). On the one hand, the experts are usually credited with more knowledge of the economy at large than the agents have. On the other hand, the
experts are often charged with being less strongly motivated to predict optimally than the agents who are seen as having more at stake.
In practice, the distinction between agents and experts is at this point

very blurred. The forecasters who respond to business outlook surveys act and
are treated as "experts" but they certainly are also "agents" in their own

rights. Indeed, many of them are influential agents who have passed critical
market tests, as certified by their positions and by the rewards their fore-

casts and advice earn them in the business world. It can be presumed that, in
general, they do have incentives to perform well and strive to do so.
In my view, therefore, it is appropriate that the results of business
outlook surveys have received alternative interpretations in the literature.
They are treated either as agents' expectations, e.g., in tests of whether
they conform to the hypotheses of rational or adaptive expectations, or as
experts' forecasts, e.g., in comparisons with predictions from particular

econometric models.8

Problems of Observation and Measurement
An ideal survey would use a large, properly constructed random sample to
insure that the respondents represent well the universe of those whose expectations count, and a system of rewards and penalties to insure that they have

a stake in their responses. In the absence of market expectations, it would
then be interesting to test the quality and analyze the properties of predictions from such a survey, and perhaps particularly those of the composite or
weighted average forecasts.

8For examples and further references, see Theil 1965; Mincer 1969; Mincer
and Zarnowitz 1969; Zarnowitz 1972, 1974, and 1979; McNees 1975 and 1978; Nelson
1975; Carlson 1977; Wachtel 1977; Pearce 1979; Figlewski and Wachtel 1981.

9

Unfortunately, the ideal surveys do not exist and the actual surveys may

be far from ideal. If a survey yields inferior or biased predictions, it is
possible that carelessness, poor information, or other failings of particular
respondents are to blame, which should not be generalized.

As already noted, past studies of expectations concentrated on the
performance of simple averages (means or medians) of the participants'

responses. But a series of averages from small samples whose composition
varies over time may lack consistency. A few outliers may cause large errors
and even bias the results. Moreover, the individual data will at times
inevitably contain errors of reporting and transcription, some of which at

least could be detected and eliminated. Thus the survey data need to be
carefully edited and interpreted. Neglect of data problems explains why some
of the survey evaluations yielded mixed and contradictory results, very
limited in both scope and applicability.9

The identification of the agents, which is a matter of common sense in
many cases (e.g., a survey of potential car buyers), presents problems with
regard to comprehensive phenomena that affect virtually everyone but mean

different things to different people. Thus individuals with widely divergent
consumption patterns may have quite disparate perceptions of inflation,

reflecting the shifts in relative prices of the different bundles of

case in point is a long series of surveys of economic forecasters,
conducted semiannually since 1947 by Joseph P. Livingston, a syndicated financial columnist. The predictions for CPI included in this survey have been
used in several recent tests of the "rationality" of inflationary expectations
before it turned out that the data need to be rather extensively reworked
(Carison 1977). Some of the subsequent tests showed the average expectations
derived from the revised survey data in a relatively favorable light, but
others, including the most recent and persuasive ones, do not. For a summary
of the earlier studies, see Pearce 1979; for other criticisms and comparisons
with indicators and consumer expectations of inflation, see Moore 1977 and
Juster 1979. More conclusive results, based on a summary of the behavior of
individual expectations, are presented in Figlewski and Wachtel 1981.

10

commodities they evaluate. The problem is altered but not resolved by a
stricter definition of the variable in question. Suppose that instead of
asking about expected changes in the "general level of prices of things you
buy," a poll referred explicitly to the changes in the official consumer price

index (CPI). This might well be more confusing than helpful in a broadly
based inquiry, since not many people are interested in, and well informed on,
the specific and technical matters involved in the construction of this

index. This is one reason why presumably informed views on the prospective
changes in specific macroeconomic variables (e.g., CPI) are collected from

professional economic forecasters. But, in the absence of ideal surveys, time
series of expectations reported by different groups of agents and experts need
to be analyzed and compared (allowing for the difficulties of such
comparisons), to expand the coverage and improve the chances of detecting any

interesting regularities of predictive behavior. Groups, as individuals, have
their particularities.

New Departures
Owing to the efforts of the National Bureau of Economic Research, in
collaboration with the American Statistical Association, a large amount of
systematic, quantitative and qualitative information has been assembled on the

record of forecasting changes in the U. S. economy since 1968. Each quarter,
the NBER examines the results of a survey questionnaire mailed by the ASA.0
The survey reaches a broadly based and diversified group of persons who are
regularly engaged in the analysis of current and prospective business

10The quarterly reports on each survey prepared by the NBER present and
discuss mainly the medians of the responses. These reports have been published
regularly by the NBER, first in Explorations in Economic Research and later
(since 1977) in the NBER Reporter, and by the ASA, first in the American
Statistician and later (since 1974) in AmStat News. On the origin of the
survey and the design of the questionnaire, see Moore 1969 and Zarnowitz 1969a.

11

conditions. Most of the respondents are from the world of corporate business
and finance but academic institutions, government, consulting firms, trade

associations, and labor unions are also represented. In the past, the
numerical predictions from each survey have covered eleven important
macroeconomic variables (in 1981 the coverage has been substantially
extended) •

The target periods always include the current and the next four

quarters.

The NBER-ASA surveys provide unique data on the methods and assumptions
used by the respondents, and on the probabilities they attach to alternative

prospects concerning changes in output and price levels. So far only the
overall results have been used in a number of studies;11 the rich detail is
yet to be processed and explored.

A comprehensive study of the individual predictions from these surveys is

currently under way. This paper, a progress report on the early and still
incomplete results of this investigation, addresses several questions.

How

accurate are the individual expectations relative to the group average predic-

tions? How representative are the latter of the former? What is the evidence
concerning the frequencies and significance of bias and autocorrelated errors?
How do the findings vary for different variables and predictive horizons?
Unlike most recent studies of expectations which consider only inflation

forecasts, this paper compares predictions for six variables: growth rates in
real and nominal income, two expenditure components of GNP, unemployment rate,

Charts showing the median, upper quartile, and lower quartile ASA-BER
survey forecasts have been featured quarterly in articles of current interest
published in Economic Prospects, a report by the Commercial Credit Company
(1972-73), and in Economic Outlook USA, a report by the Survey Research Center
at the University of Michigan (since 1974). Evaluations of the median series
and, in some cases, of dispersion and some other aspects of the survey forecasts include Christ 1975; Fair 1974; McNees 1974, 1975, 1976, 1979; Moore
1977; Su and Su 1975; and Zarnowitz 196gb, 1971, 1974, and 1979.

quarterly time series of forecasts are analyzed, consisting of sets of five

series per source (for five target quarters). Given the large scope of the
study, only the summary measures of error for the whole period covered are

presented in this paper to keep its size manageable. A sequel will deal with
the variations over time, the cross—sectional (survey—by—survey) resuts, and
disaggregation by method.

A serious limitation of most empirical studies in this area is that they
refer mainly to the 1970s, a relatively short period and a particular one in

several respects.12 Efforts are being made to construct longer series of
predictions comparable to those from the ASA—NBER surveys with the aid of
valuable data from a large group of business economists organized into the New

York Forecasters' Club. A small segment of this information is used in this
paper.

Data

Individual vs. Group Mean Predictions

and Measures
The body of data used in this paper consists of 42 consecutive surveys

conducted quarterly from 1968:4 through 1979:1. Altogether, the list of those
who replied to any of the NBER—ASA survey questionnaires includes 172 names

(which are treated confidentially). However, many individuals responded only
once or a few times, and some decision had to be made on the minimum number of

12For at least a part of the 1960s, some influential forecasts by government agencies and econometric model builders are available, but earlier data
are sparce, not easy to access, and often in need of much careful processing;
they are mainly informal predictions from business sources and surveys
(Zarnowitz 1967, 1979).

13

surveys that would qualify a participant for inclusion. It was set at 12,
which still left as many as 79 individuals in the sample.13
Four of the variables covered have strong upward trends, and it is not
their levels that are of major interest but rather their rates of change which

reflect real growth and/or inflation. These are gross national product and
consumer expenditures for durable goods, both in current dollars (GNP and
CEDG); GNP in constant dollars (RGNP); and the GNP implicit price deflator

(IPD). For these series, forecast errors are measured as differences,
predicted minus actual percentage change.

The change in business inventories (CBI), a current—dollar series, is

trendless, being already in first—difference form. The unemployment rate (UR)
represents the percentage unemployed of the civilian labor force and is domi-

nated by short—term, mainly cyclical movements, not a long—term trend. For
these two variables, therefore, forecast errors are measured as differences,
predicted level minus actual level.14
The "actual" values are not well defined for many economic variables,
such as GNP and components, which are subject to several, often sizable, re-

visions. In this paper, they are represented by the last data available prior
to the benchmark revisions of January 1976 and December 1980. These are

noted earlier, a careful proofreading of the survey questionnaire is
needed to detect simple mistakes of calculation, copying, and typing which
chance or neglect will always occasion in some replies. The voluminous NBER—
ASA materials were submitted to such an audit with the aid of the computer
and, where needed, an inspection of the original submissions. Although the
number of mistakes that were thus identified turned out to be very small relative to the mass of the data, failure to eliminate them would have affected
adversely the evaluation of several individual records.
14See Zarnowitz 1967, pp. 32—35, and 1979, p. 6; and McNees 1973, pp. 7—

where P and A refer to the predicted and actual levels, respectively. The
surveys have generally been taken in the first half of each quarter, at a time
when the most recent data available would be preliminary estimates for the

preceeding quarter (A_1).16 Consequently, the Pt figures for the quarter
during which the survey was taken (j = 0) are authentic, if short, ex ante

forecasts whose span is approximately one quarter. In addition, each survey

revisions that are assumed to remove observational errors. An alternative is
to compare the forecasts with provisional data that are closer to those that
were available to the forecaster. The most informative approach is one that
integrates the analysis of data errors and of prediction errors, which would
be a good task for another paper. On the role of revisions in economic measurement and prediction, see Cole 1969 and Zarnowitz 1979 and 1982.

17Al1 this applies to predictions of any i—th respondent for any rn—th
variable, so for simplicity all subscripts other than those referring to the
target periods are dropped from the formulae in this and the following paragraph of the text. A subscript for the time when the forecast was made is
also redundant, since it is always t (see also equation 12 and text below).

Thus et contains an error due to the discrepancy between Ati and
This difference is a measurement error, but it is usually akin to a very short

forecast error, since Ati is in most cases an extrapolation based on incomplete data. For j > 0, the base of each percentage change forecast is it-

self a forecast, namely that of the level in the preceeding quarter (P31).

casts made at time t,

are implicit predictions of changes

over the successive subperiods covered. Note that each of these marginal or

target periods do not overlap.18

averages over time. The best (lowest) ratios fall between 0.7 and 0.9, the
worst (highest) between 1.4 and 2.2. The means of the ratios (marked

M) are

all located to the right of the unity (broken vertical) lines. The histograms
seem to get tighter and also, often, less skewed for the more distant quarters
(i.e., as one moves down the chart, from QO to Q4, for each variable).
Table 1 shows that the mean ratios are remarkably close:

when rounded,

all but nine of the 30 statistics are 1.1. The higher mean ratios, ranging
from 1.2 to 1.4, refer to the shortest predictions, for QO and, less so, for

Qi. The standard deviations of the Mi/Mgi ratios tend to decreaase strongly
with the distance to the target quarter, from QO to Q3.2° An exception is
CBI, where the horizon of the expectations apparently does not matter much
(all the means are approximately 1.1 and the decline in the dispersion of the
ratios is very small).

The proportions of the better—than—average forecasters (Mj/Mgj < 1) vary
strongly with the target quarter for some variables, much less so for others.

Thus for UR the range is 8 to 42 percent, for CBI it is only 29 to 38 percent.
Averaged across QO—Q4, the figures fall between 20 percent for GNP and 33
percent for CBI (see the last section of Table 1).
As will be shown below, the average accuracy of forecasts varies
considerably across the individuals, variables, and target periods. Highly
volatile series such as CEDG and CBI are much more difficult to predict than
relatively smooth, trend—dominated series such as GNP.

In general, the

uncertainty and difficulty (hence errors) of prediction tend to increase for

the more distant future. The remarkable degree of standardization in the

should be noted that these comparisons are somewhat impaired by the
fact that the measures for QO, Qi, Q2, Q3, and Q4 refer to 42, 41, 40, 39, and
34 surveys, respectively. In particular, the relatively large figures for Q4
compared to those for Q3 probably reflect the drop in survey coverage.

One may speculate

that the individual forecasts for

QO and Qi contain more independent information than those for Q2—Q4, hence the

gains from averaging are larger for the former than for the latter.21 The
abilities to predict C3I are particularly limited, even for the nearest

quarters, so here the means and dispersion of the ratios Mi/Mgi depend
little on the distance to the target quarter (3 — 0, 1, . • •, 4).

1.2.22

These findings indicate that it is difficult for most individuals to

predict consistently better than the group. Contemporaneous expectations for
a given target may be distributed more or less symmetrically about their mean,
but over time the individuals' positions within these distributions are likely

to fluctuate. For most people, most of the time, the predictive record is
spotty, with but transitory spells of relatively

high accuracy. A series of

group averages has the advantage that it is helped by the cancellation of
individual errors of opposite sign.

Rank Tests of predictive Consistency
Success in one class of predictions (say, for GNP in Qi) may or may not
coincide with success in another class (say, GNP in Q4, or for IPD). If the

degree of coincidence were very low (e.g., if very few people managed to "beat"
the group mean in more than one class), then the success, being rather isolated,

might be attributable more to chance than to better techniques or skills.
The NBER—ASA survey participants have been ranked according to the Mj/Mgj
ratios for each of the variables and target quarters covered in chart 2. The
correlations among the resulting ranks could be either close to zero (indicating very little consistency in the relative performance of the forecasters
across different variables or predictive spans) or significantly negative
(those who succeed in one category tend to fail in another) or significantly

positive (those who succeed in one category also tend to succeed in others).

forecasts made by members of the same group in the period 1956—63
(Zarnowitz 1967, pp. 123—126) tell much the same story. The number and identity of those who did better than the group mean varied for predictions with
different spans and other characteristics, but the average success rate in
these terms was no more than 19 percent.

24

The rank correlations are presented in Table 2, both across the variables
for each target quarter (part I) and across target quarters for each variable

(part II). All the correlations are positive and in general they appear to be
significantly so (see note in the table) •

Thus there is some degree of con-

sistency in the predictive performance of the individuals as revealed by

their Mi/Mgi ranks.
People who predict relatively well the rates of change in nominal GNP

also tend to do so for the rates of change in real GNP: the average rank cor-

relation coefficient P is 0.74 is this case. For variables that are not so
closely related, the correlations are much lower (e.g., P = 0.23 for CEDG and

IPD, and also for CEDG and UR). However, only 15 of the 75 coefficients (p
in part I of the table are less than 0.2. The

overall

mean of the p

statistics is 0.36.

For any of the variables, people who rank high (low) in predicting one

quarter also tend to rank high (low) in predicting the next quarter. The
p's for Q0—Q1 average 0.61, those for Q1—Q2, Q2-Q3, and Q3—Q4 average 0.52—
0.55 (see part II of Table 2) •

For non—adjoining target periods, the rank

correlations are lower, P being 0.40 where the distance is two quarters (QO—
Q2, Q1—Q3, and Q2—Q4) and 0.31 where it is three quarters (Q0—Q3 and Q1—Q4).
The further apart the target periods, the less correlated are the values to be
predicted, and the above results suggest that the ranking consistency declines
correspondingly. But the reductions in the rank correlations vary cons ider—
ably in size and regularity, being most pronounced for CEDG, least for GNP.

When averaged over the quarters Q1—Q4, the P coefficients are relatively low
for CEDG, GNP, and RGNP (.27—.33) and high for IPD, UR, and CBI (.55—66).

III.

Assessing the Forecasters' Performance

Because of discrepancies in time coverage, absolute accuracy measures are
not strictly comparable across the individual participants in the surveys.
(This was one of the reasons for the standardiztiofl by means of the relative

accuracy measures Mi/Mgi•) However, we are dealing with numerous responses
to a relatively large number of surveys, and there is no apparent reason for
any significant bias due to missed observations.

23 With some caution,

therefore, it should be instructive to examine the distributions of the

statistics that sum up the records of the individuals. The corresponding
measures for the group mean forecasts provide some further interesting
comparisons.

Overall Accuracy
Table 3 shows the distributional statistics for the root mean square

errors of the individuals (columns 1—5). With virtually no exceptions, the
averages of the individual RMSE's are larger than the RSME's for the corresponding group mean forecasts (compare line by line the entries in columns 1

and 4 with their counterparts in column 6). In most cases, the medians are
somewhat smaller than the means, which indicates some skewness to the right,

that is, toward large RSME's. The measures for the group mean tend to be
closer to the lower quartile than to the median of the distribution of the
individual RMSE's (cf. columns 3, 4, and 6).

The more distant the target quarter, the larger tend to be the prediction
errors, as demonstrated by the increases from QO through Q4 of the entries in

23Each of the 42 surveys has an adequate coverage; on the average, 43
participants with a standard deviation of 9. Each of the 79 individuals
responded to at least 12 surveys; the mean is 23 with a standard deviation of
8. The distribution of the individuals among the periods covered appears to
be dominated by random choice.

Q0 denotes the current quarter, Qi the following (first future) quarter,
etc. The number of the surveys covered is 42 for QO, 41 for Qi, 40 for Q2, 39
for Q3, and 33 for Q4.
bThese measures refer to the sample covered in Chart 1 (75 individuals
forecast CEDG, 79 each of the other variables). See text, eqs. 6 and 7 and note
15, for the definitions of the symbols and measures used (RSME = root mean
square error).

columns 1 and 3—6. However, the increases tend to taper off: the individuals
on the average predict QO substantially better than Q1, and Qi still noticeably better than Q2, but their ability to anticipate Q3 is not much less
limited than their ability to anticipate Q2, and the same applies even more to

Q4 vs. Q3. In short, these measures suggest that the RMSE's tend to approach
asymptotically a high plateau at the more distant target quarters. Note that
these results apply to the marginal prediction errors for each successive

quarter (i.e., changes 0—1, 1—2, . . .). To the extent that such errors are
positively correlated, their cumulation will produce much greater increases in
the average prediction errors for changes over increasing, overlapping spans

(0—1, 0—2, . • )24
The RMSE's for CEDG and CR1 are particularly large and their Q0—Q4
differences are relatively small and irregular; those for UR, in contrast, are
very low for QO and display relatively large and regular increases for the

successively more distant quarters. Measures of dispersion for these distri-

(standard deviations in column 2 and interquartile ranges implied by
columns 3 and 5) increase but weekly and irregularly with the index j for

that the correlations between predictions and

24The buildup of average prediction errors with increasing spans is a
general phenomenon to be expected and is well documented in forecast evaluations. However, some evidence for earlier periods has shown marginal errors
varying narrowly and irregularly over the range of several quarters ahead,
without any systematic upward drift (Zarnowitz 1967, pp. 64—72, and 1979, pp.
18—19 McNees 1973, pp. 24—25). The present results may differ because of the
nature of the period covered (and Zarnowitz 1979 provides some support for
this hypothesis), but they also inspire more confidence than those of other
studies, being based on much larger samples of better controled data.

correlation coefficients average about .4 and .6 for QO and .1 to .2 for Q4,
except for the unemployment rate where they are much higher, exceeding .9 for

QO and .3 for Q4 (column 4). This reflects the fact that UR is a relatively
smooth series, since levels rather than changes are used in this case. The
dispersion of the correlation coefficients across the individuals declines as
the distance to the target quarter increases, again except for UR, where the
opposite happens (column 5; cf. also columns 1—3).

The r2 coefficients for the group mean forecast are consistently, and
often substantially, higher than the averages of the squared correlations for

the individuals (compare columns 4 and 6). They, too, decline sharply and
regularly for QO through Q4, the drop being most pronounced for IPD, least for
CBI (column 6).

Mean Errors
Table 5 shows that almost all survey members underestimated inflation,
i.e., had negative mean errors in their expectations of the rates of change in
IPD during the period 1968—79 (columns 1-2) •

On the average, these statistics

increase strongly with the predictive horizon, from QO-Q4 (columns 3-4). In
contrast, real growth as measured by the rates of change in RGNP was predominantly overestimated in this period, increasingly so for the more distant

future. The underestimates of the price component and the overestimates of
the quantity component tend to cancel each other in the predictions of rates
of change in current—dollar GNP; most of the mean errors are here negative but
very small (the overall averages are close to zero) •25 The signs of the

25Negative correlations between errors in predicting real growth and inflation have long been observed (Zarnowitz 1979; pp. 15—16). They are not
necessarily indicative of poor forecasts but are difficult to reconcile with
the positive short—term effects on output of unanticipated inflation as implied
by the recent model of an "expectations—augmented Phillips curve."

overprediction

underpredictiOflS prevail, which is consistent with the

of real growth. The rates of change in spending on consumer

durables are underestimated in the short expectations but not in the longer
ones. Negative mean errors prevail in the forecasts of business inventory
investment.

The

the

series

of group expectations have, of course, the same mean errors as

aggregates of individual expectations except for minor discrepancies due

to rounding (of. columns 3 and 5), but the standard deviations of their errors
are about 3 to 4 times higher than the corresponding statistics for the indi-

viduals (of. columns 4 and 6). Further, the standard deviations of the group
mean forecast errors show a strong and general tendency to rise with the

distance to the target quarter (i.e., with the index j).
In sum, there is the familiar tendency toward underestimation of change
in most of the forecasts, with the important exception of RGNP. After a
decade of relatively stable and high rates of growth, the 1970s gave rise to a

novel phenomenon commonly called stagflation and an unexpectedly serious

recession: these facts should go far in explaining the average overestimation
of real growth observed in our data. For IPD and RGNP, but not for the other
variables, the mean errors increase in absolute value with j.

Regression

Statistics and Tests of Bias

Regressions of the actual on the predicted values have been computed for

all individuals and the group means. For any variable, then,

34

from t.26 The sample least-squares estimates a and b (the subscripts may
be dropped for simplicity) lend themselves to statistical tests of the joint
null hypothesis that the true (population) parameters of the relation between

A and P are a =

0

and

= 1,

A sufficiently high F—ratio refutes that

hypothesis,suggesting that the forecast contains some systematic errors.
The results of these tests do not show any regular dependence on the time

distance j, so their representation can be greatly simplified without loss
of substance by aggregation across the quarters Q0-Q4. Table 6 sums up the
evidence from a very large sample (2,350 regressions). What stands out
clearly is the contrast between the predictions of inflation and those of the

other variables. For IPD, almost half of the F—ratios are significant at the
5% level and about two—thirds at the 10% level, which indicates a disturbing

frequency of apparently biased or inefficient predictions. Elsewhere no more
than six to twelve percent of the F—ratios are significant at the 5% level and
14 to 20 percent at the 10% level; and at the levels of 0.5%, 1%, and 2.5%
some of the proportions are low enough to be attributable entirely to chance.
The relatively good results for UR, CEDG, and CBI deserve to be noted.
Table 7 shows the detailed results of the regressions for the group mean

predictions. Most of the intercepts a are small fractions, with signs about
evenly mixed (column 1). All of the slope coefficients b are positive and
most are not far away from 1.0 (column 2). However, in several cases the

absolute values of a deviate significantly from zero and the values of b

deviate significantly from unity, as determined by the F and t statistics
(collumns 3—5). Of the thirty F—ratios, four are significant at the 1%
level, nine at the 5% level, and fourteen at the 10% level. The tests reject

this simplified notation, the distinction between levels and percentage changes (see equations (11) and (12) and text above) is disregarded.

weaker, rejections are indicated by the F—tests for the IPD—inflation in QO

sponding mean square errors, are listed in colwnns 6—8 of Table 7. Given

H, the larger its random component WI and the smaller both MC and SC,
the better.

Where the results of the H0 tests are favorable, the figures for MC
and SC are very low, as would be expected: the best examples are found in
the estimates for GNP, UR, and (except for QO) CEDG. For IPD, in contrast to
all other variables, the MC percentages are very high, rising from 15 for QO
to 45 for Q4 and averaging 31 (the averages elsewhere range from two to six

percent). The estimates for SC are on the whole smaller than those for MC,
but they are high for some of the QO predictions, probably because of errors

in the jump—off figures (column 7). RV accounts for 67 percent of the mean
square errors of the inflation forecasts on the average across the target
quarters (the figures decline sharply from 82% for QO to 54% for Q4), whereas
the other RV estimates generally exceed 80 or even 90 percent (column 8).

Tests of Autocorrelation of Errors
The swmnary measures of accuracy and bias are informative but they tell
only a part of the story; it is advisable to examine further the properties of
the time series of errors and ask whether autocorrelations exist that could be
exploited to improve the predictions (Granger and Newbold 1973).

The Box—Pierce statistic (R) serves as a convenient test of the
presence of autocorrelations in the errors. In the present context, it is
written as

Here rk is defined for level errors but the same formula, with e
replacing E throughout, applies to percentage change errors. The autocor—
relation lags are restricted to the range of one to six quarters because the

available error series are short. Table 8 covers all predictions by those 18—
20 individuals who participated in more than 12 consecutive surveys: a total
of 452 error series whose length varies from 13 to 33 and averages 19 quarters.

which the samples are smaller, are not included.

The Box-Pierce statistic is approximately distributed as chi-square, in

this case with 6—j degrees of freedom.28 The omission of rk for k

j

from (10) reflects the fact that the information available at time t, when a
survey is taken, includes the errors of past predictions through the previous
quarter (t — 1) but does not include the errors of the predictions made

currently for QO, Qi, etc. For example, the errors of the QO forecasts will
not known until a quarter later, hence they are not yet available to the
forecasts for Qi, Q2, and Q3, which are all made at the same time as those for

Q0.29
Overall, the frequencies of significant autocorrelations of errors are

high: 65, 127, and 174 at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively (that is,
14, 28, and 38 percent of the total of 452 series) •

For GNP, RGNP, and CEDG it

is the QO errors that show the highest proportions of the significant R
statistics, but for IPD, CBI, and UR it is the Q2 or Q3 errors. On the whole,

281f the errors formed random uncorrelated sequences, the {rk} would

themselves be uncorrelated and would have variances equal to nn-2 .

of the small size of the available samples, it seemed advisable to avoid the

it is not only desirable, but also, at least in principle, possible
for r1 to be reduced to a level not significantly different from zero for the
QO prelictions; but the lack of current knowledge of the most recent errors
makes it difficult to accomplish the same for Qi and any more distant

quarters. This argument applies generally to r1 for k < j
specifically to r1 for Qi, Q2, and Q3; r2 and r3 for Q3.

the distribution of these statistics does not depend strongly on the target
quarter.

30

Table 8, which uses aggregation across the quarters Q0—Q3, brings out
strong differences between the autocorrelations of errors in forecasts of

different variables. Once more it is the predictions of inflation that have
definitely the worst record, with more than half of the forecast series
showing

coefficients significant at the 5% level. By the same criterion,

39, 31, and 23 percent of the forecasts of unemployment, inventory investment,
and GNP, respectively, have autocorrelated errors, as shown in column 6 of the

table. The evidence for the predictions of real GNP and consumer expenditures
on durable goods is much more favorable, the corresponding proportions here

being twelve and eight percent. In general, the forecasters do considerably
worse on these tests than on the bias tests (note that the entries in Table 8
tend to be much higher than their counterparts in Table 6).
Finally, Table 9 presents the sample estimates of the autocorrelation

function for the errors in the ASA-NBER group mean forecasts. The coefficients
rk are computed to the formula (16), but here the series are long enough to
permit the autocorrelatiori lag k to vary from one to twelve quarters.31

30Thus, of the 174 R. coefficients that are significant at the 10%
level, QO errors account fr 29 percent, Q1 errors for 23 percent, Q2 errors
for 24 percent, and Q3 errors for 24 percent. The corresponding proportions
for the 127 coefficients that are significant at the 5% level are very similar
(29, 21, 24, and 26 percent).
31Rather than from one to six quarters, the range used for the shorter
individual error series (see text and Table 8 above). Accordingly, the Box—
Pierce statistics listed in Table 9 differ from those defined in eq. (15) in

percent). They increase markedly with j ,

the distance to the target

quarter, reflecting the rising absolute values Irkt?

which can be seen by

reading down the columns in lines 5—8. The rk coefficients are initially
positive and declining as k rises from one to four, but then they turn

negative and large as k rises from five to twelve. In short, they fail to
approach zero even for the largest k's.
For the other variables, there is much less evidence of autocorrelated

errors. The rk coefficients tend to be much smaller absolutely, particularly
for the larger values of k, and they do not show any comparable patterns in

signs as related to k or magnitudes as related to j.

The

statistics

are significant at the 5% or 10% levels for the GNP errors and in a few in-

stances for some of the other variables. The most favorable results in this
respect are those for RGNP and UR, but those for CEDG and CEl are not much
worse (column 13).

Since the rk should be normally distributed random variables with mean

zero and variance slightly less than 1/n (see note 26 above), another test
may be applied to these estimates to see how many of them fall outside range

standard deviations from zero. In Table 8, these would be the cases

of

where IrkI exceeds 0.25. Most of the autocorrelations for the inflation
errors, but relatively few of those for the other variables, are larger than
0. 25.

32

321n fact, a large number of the r coefficients are probably not
significantly different from zero on this test. It is intriguing that most of
the large autocorrelations are found in columns 8—10 of the table, that is,
for k of 8, 9, or 10 quarters. (The low—order autocorrelations for k < j
are high throughout for IPD and in about half the cases for UR and CBI as
well, but, as already noted, the errors involved are not part of the information that is available on the current basis.)

44

IV. Summary

In

this section, the main results of the study are summed up in several

points. It should be stressed that some of them may be particular to the
period covered, 1968—79 (as noted earlier in a few specific instances).

1. A very strong finding of this study, applying to all variables and
target quarters covered, is that the mean predictions from a series of surveys
are on the average over time more accurate than most of the corresponding sets

of individual forecasts or expectations. The minorities that did succeed in
outperforming the group averages vary in size and composition for the different
variables and predictive horizons, but typically represent one-fifth to one—
third of the total number of individuals surveyed.

2. Rank correlations among

the

respondents according to the ratios of

their root mean square errors to those of the corresponding group averages
(Mj/Mgj) are positive for all variables and target quarters, and in most cases

significantly so. This suggests that a moderate degree of consistency exists
in the relative performances of a sufficient number of the survey members, even
though most people have but transitory spells of above—average accuracy (most

of the Mi/Mgi ratios exceed 1.0). It remains to be seen whether weighted
combinations of selected forecasts from the group would yield significantly
large and persistent gains in accuracy, but our results do not rule out this
possibility.

3. There is a reasonably well articulated tendency for the errors to
increase in absolute size with the time distance to the target quarter, from QO

to Q4, but by decreasing margins. This shows up both in the summary measures
for the group forecasts and in the distributions of the corresponding

statistics for the individual forecasts. Correlations between predictions and
realizations decline steadily as the target quarter recedes into the future.

45

coefficients for the group mean predictions exceed considerably their

The

average counterparts for the individuals.

4. The mean errors are predominantly negative for all nominal variables
covered, which reflects mainly large underestimates of inflation. They tend to
be positive for real growth and negative for the unemployment rate. They are
small for the percentage change in GNP as the underestimates of the IPD

inflation cancel the smaller overestimates of growth in RGNP. For inflation
and real growth, but not the other variables, the mean errors increase in
absolute value between QO and Q4.

5. The tests of the joint null hypothesis that the regressions of actual
on predicted values have zero intercepts and unitary slope coefficients are

quite unfavorable to expectations of inflation. Of the individual F ratios, 18
percent exceed the 1% significance point, nearly half exceed the 5% point, and
two—thirds exceed the 10% point.

The F tests for the group mean forecasts

confirm the bias. These findings are consistent with other evidence that in
the past decade anticipated rates of inflation have generally erred on the low
side, tending to lag behind the actual rates much like adaptive extrapolations
would (Zarnowitz 1979; McNees 1981; Figlewski and Wachtel 1981).

6. For the other variables covered, these weak tests of rationality show
the survey predictions generally in much better light. Here the F-tests reject
at most three percent of the forecasts at the 1% level, six to twelve percent

at the 5% level, and 14 to 20 percent at the 10% level. In many cases,

particularly for the group, mean forecasts, H0: (,

8) = (0,

1)

cannot be

rejected.

7. Efficient use of information in the development of expectations
includes continuous checking on and learning from past mistakes to the extent

that this can be done in a timely manner. The process would tend to eliminate

46

systematic elements such as autocorrelatjons in the prediction errors. But the
errors in the forecasts of the rates of change in IPD contain highly

significant autocorrelatjons rk for both short and relatively long lags k.
The Box—Pierce statistics are significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels in
slightly more than one—fourth, half, and two—thirds of the cases, respectively;
and they are even significant at the level of 1/2 of one percent for the group
mean forecasts of inflation.

8. The incidence of autocorrelatjons is relatively low in errors of the
predictions for real growth and spending on consumer durables, as shown by the
chi—square tests of both the individual series and the group

means.

For

nominal GNP growth, the unemployment rate, and inventory investment, the
statistics relating to the individual forecasts are much less favorable
(though still considerably better than those for inflation), but the group
mean predictions show little evidence of serially correlated errors.

V. Ibre Questions and

Perspectives on Further 1search

The evidence that inflation has on the whole been poorly anticipated in

the late 1960s and 1970s is extensive and substantial. I conclude that, in
the absence of any empirically convincing challenge to it, this evidence

should be taken seriously. But why have the expectations of inflation been so
inaccurate and biased? Why so much worse than the forecasts of other import-

ant aggregate variables from the same sources? Did the great disturbances of
this period make predicting inflation uniquely difficult?
A study of the behavior over time of cross—sectional data from the
successive business outlook surveys can complement the overall accuracy
analysis presented in this paper and make a contribution toward answering

these important questions. What are the parameters of the error distributions

47

from each survey, by variable and target quarter, and how do they vary in
periods with different economic characteristics (level of business activity,
intensity of inflation)?

In addition, comparisons with autoregressive—moving average extrapolations will shed more light on the relative accuracy and efficiency of the

survey predictions. The time—series models to be used will be estimated from
the same data that were available to the participants in the successive

surveys. To this end, all revisions of the relevant data have been recorded
and stored in machine—readable form.

The recent marketing successes of several econometric service bureaus
have received considerable publicity, and forecasts from such sources as
Chase, DRI, and Wharton are considered to have gained much influence, at least

in the corporate sector. Where do these forecasts fall in the spectrum of
expectations provided by the business outlook surveys? Is there any evidence
of their superiority that past studies (McNees 1979; Zarnowitz 1979) failed to

detect? Can their influence be documented? These questions will be investigated with the aid of our compilation of the individual predictions by

business respondents to the ASA—NBER surveys. In this context, it should be
particularly helpful to classify the participants by their most favored forecasting methods (according to their own rankings provided in the surveys).

Earlier work based on rather fragmentary survey data revealed no systematic
differences in accuracy between the groups resulting from such classifications
(Zarnowitz 1971; Su and Su 1975), but an examination of the comprehensive

evidence that is now available may or may not confirm these findings and
should prove instructive in either case.
