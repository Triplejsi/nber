Methods for Analyzing Structural Models
of Labor Force Dynamics
ABSTRACT

This

paper takes a first

step toward developing econometric models

for the structural analysis of labor force dynamics. Our analysis

in continuous tine, although most of the points raised here

can be applied to discrete time models. We show that In previous attempts

to estimate "structural" models of job search, a key source of information

necessary to identify certain structural parameters has been neglected.
We discuss the conditions under which structural search models can

be estimated. In particular, the wage offer distribution must be recoverable——

i.e., it must be the case that the

parameters

of the untruncated wage

offer distribution be estimable from the truncated accepted wage distribution.

The wage offer distribution must be assumed to belong to a para-

metric family.

New Methods for Analyzing Structural Models
of

Labor Force Dynamics

This paper presents new econometric methods for the analysis of
labor force dynamics. The economic models we discuss asswne that
agents

rational

make choices about their employment and labor force activity In

face

of uncertainty about key aspects of theft labor market environ-

ment. A variety of such models has recently appeared in

the literature

(e.g., Burdett and Mortensen, 1978 and 1980; Lucas and Prescott, 1974;

Wilson, 1980; Lippman and McCall, 1976a, b, 1981) and

research

in the

continues to flourish. Theoretical results already in hand offer

area

possible explanations for frictional unemployment, on—the—job wage growth,

job turnover and wage dispersion.

To date there has been little systematic econometric analysis of
these models although qualitative implications obtained from these models
have sometimes been used as loose guides to interpreting unemployment

duration regressions. The few attempts at developing econometric pro-

cedures to estimate this class of models are direct transcriptions of
econometric models used to estimate reservation wages in the analysis

of female labor suppiyi A clear analysis of identification criteria
and estimation methods for models of labor force dynamics does not appear

in the literature.
This paper takes a first step toward developing econometric models

that implement and extend the new theory. A key feature of the class of

economic

models that we consider is that they produce predictions about

the dynamics of individual behavior. With the recent wide—scale availa-

bility of longitudinal labor market data with repeated observations on

individuals it has become possible to test the implications of the new
microdynamic models using microdynamic data. The goal of this paper is

to develop prothedures to enable analysts to apply the new theories to
the new data.
This

paper makes three contributions. First, economic theory is

used to derive

the appropriate econometric specification for three models

of labor force dynamics. They are (a) a continuous tine single spell
model of search unemployment, (b) an equilibrium continuous time two
state model of employment and nonemployment, and Cc) a three state model
of employment, unemployment and nonmarket activity.

Second, we present new identification criteria that must be satisfied
in order to estimate the structural parameters of the three models considered
in this paper. We distinguish structural parameters that can be estimated

using nonparametric procedures from structural parameters that can only

be identified if arbitrary functional forms are assumed. One identification
condition ("recoverability") applies to all econometric models for the

analysis of truncated data. An important conclusion of our analysis is
that most econometric models for the analysis of truncated data are non—

parametrically underide.ntified, and some are parametrically underidentified

as well.
Our third contribution recognizes that maximum likelihood estimators

for

most of the models considered here are nonregular. We develop an

also appear in the simpler setting of the one state model of

The

second part of the paper is devoted to analysis of a new equili-

two state model of employment and nonemployment. Empirical estimates

of this model are presented. An appendix presents a three state model
of labor force dynamics which introduces nonmarket activity into conventional search models and provides a structural economic motivation

for the competing risks model widely used in social science2) The
paper concludes with a summary.

Estimation of a One State Model of Search Unemployment

1.0 Introduction
In this section, we consider estimation of a single spell model of an
unemployed worker's search from a laown distribution of wage offers using

aspects of this model have been

We first present a continuous tine economic model for a
stationary environ-

ment. We compare the continuous time model to previous discrete time formulations. We then consider issues of identification and estimation first under
the assumption of no interpersonal

variation in parameters ("no heterogeneity")

and then with such variation ("heterogeneity"). In a concluding

subsection,

we consider econometric issues for a nonstationary search model.

Thus the one spell search model has the se statistical structure for

From the assumption that wages are distributed independently of

result in unemployment duration distributions that are stochastically
dominated by the predisplacement distributions.

If r — 0, straightforward manipulation of (1.2)' reproduces all of
the preceding propositions except those for r and translations of the
wage offer distribution. It is well known that if r 0 unit translations
of the wage offer distribution lead to unit increases in reservation wages.
Thus translations of the wage offer distribution in this case produce no
change in the hazard rate.
1.2 Relationship to Previous Discrete Time Models of Discrete Choice

Previous work in deterministic labor supply theory (e.g., Heclcnan
and Willis, 1977; Heclcman and MaCurdy; 1980, Heckman, 1981) estimates

a discrete time analogue of the model described above. For
a single spell of nonemployment, the decision to remain nonemployed is

made by comparing a market wage offer X to reservation wage rV although
a different theory is used to derive the reservation wage. Kiefer and
Neumann (1979) have applied discrete time econometric models developed in

the deterministic labor supply literature to the search unemployment
problem.

The assumption used in previous work is that new wage offers (or in

the labor supply theory, reservation wages, or both) arrive each time period.
To focus on essential. aspects of the comparison we assume that the

reservation wage is nonstochastic, and the cdf of the independent

wage offers is F(X).

Previous

models produce the probability that

9

a

nonemployment spell terminates after j periods as

(1 —

F(rV)).

Accepted wages are truncated from below by rV so that

approach is somewhat arbitrary because it is tine unit dependent.

To use it one must assume that wage offers come in at the rate of exactly
one per period. (This is a crucial assumption in the Kief er—Neumann

analysis. See Appendix C.) The model developed in this paper assumes

1Kiefer and Neumann (1979) have indirectly addressed this problem

for the case of log normally distributed X in a discrete time search model
with one wage offer received each period. They address the problem of
identification in these models using standard sample selection bias methods.
The analysis considered in this section is more general because it permits
wage offers to arrive randomly, it is not specific to a log normal wage
offer distribution, and because it utilizes crucial information overlooked

From a random sample of unemployment durations, possibly censored,

it is possible to use a Kaplan—Meier estimator (see Ka.lbfleisch and Prentice,

In light of the discussion in the preceding paragraph,

rV can be

consistently estimated. Provided that it is possible to recover the
untruncated distribution F(x) from the truncated distribution knowing

the point of truncation, it is possible to estimate F(x) from an estimate
of F(xlx.rV) and rV.

We define a distribution F(x) to be recoverable from a truncated
distribution with known point of truncation (rV) if knowledge

of F(xlx>rV) and rV implies that F(x) is uniquely determined.

12

Provided that F(x) is recoverable, all of the parameters in equation

(1.2) are identified provided that r is known. Thus if F(x) and rV are
known, from the estimated hazard A is known. (See eq. (1.6)). With A

known, F and rV can be inserted in (1.2) to estimate

F(x) is not recoverable without maintaining some functional form

(This restriction does not deny that

some nonnormal F* may also fit the truncated data.) Identification
through the use of functional form is not always possible.
We present an example in which the recoverability condition is
not met even if we impose the assumption that wage offers come from a

distribution with iciown functional form. Let wages be Pareto distributed

discussed further in Section 2.

If wages are normally distributed, the recoverability condition

is satisfied. This fact is implicitly utilized in Amemiya (1973) and
Pearson (1903). The condition is also satisfied for many commonly utilized
distributions such as the exponential and log normal distributjons.(1)

to use a Kolmogorov—Smirnov test or chi—square test to test concordance

metric cdf.2 Thus the selection of a particular functional form need
not be an entirely arbitrary process. But the fact that a given functional

Two new points arise. First, as is evident from equation (1.7),

is being considered in a non—regular setting because the lower

limit of the accepted wage offer distribution depends on a parameter of
the model (rV). Thus standard asymptotic distribution arguments will not
apply (Cox and Hinkley, 1974, p. 112). Second, because we utilize a

parametric framework, it becomes essential to explicitly account for

censoring of duration spells. (1) If the sampling plan of the longitudinal

Structural estimation of the model requires maximizing (1.9)

incorporating the economic restrictions in (1.8). There are many possible
parameterizations of the likelihood function. The most analytically
convenient one treats rV as an explicit parameter along with 8 and A

using (1.8) to solve for c. This parameterization does not force c to
be positive and so provides a test of the model. Note that for the model
to make statistical sense, it is required that A > 0. This constraint
is automatically imposed in the estimation as we demonstrate below.
The maximum likelihood estimator has a simple structure. Denoting
the maximum likelihood estimator by "", rV =
where x1 is the

x

minimum accepted wage observed in the sample of job takers (for whom

d=l). That this is the mle estimator is verified by noting that £ is
monotonically increasing in rV so that the first constraint in (1.8) is
always

effective at the upper limit.

We have thus far assumed that all agents in our samples

are plausible reasons why

In many

economic models of equilibrium price distributions, dispersion in c (or

such dispersion can produce badly biased estimates of the-parameters
some

of structural duration models (Silcock, 1954; B lumen, Kogan and McCarthy.

1955). This is the problem of "heterogeneity."
In principle, each parameter of the one state search model can be
written as a function of observed and unobserved variables. The parameters

estimator such as rV that is based on an extreme observation
in a sample is obviously quite sensitive to measurement error in the

x data. Since any fed number of extreme observations (say the first
up to the kth) are consistent estimators for rV, a consistent estimator

for rV that is less sensitive (in an

imprecisely

defined way) to measure-

ment error is an average of the lowest k observations. Greene's

estimator (1980) in a related problem is also worthy of exploration:

observations of x that

associated

with the observed variables in these functions can be estimated.

Unobserved variables can be integrated out using distributions whose param-

eters can be estimated. This approach is used in many studies of labor
force dynamics (Hecknan and Willis, 1975, 1977; Nickell, 1979; Reclaaan,
1981.)

A practical problem with this solution is the selection of ,articular
functional forms for use in estimation. Except for occasional quali-

tative guidelines, economic theory offers little guidance. It is silent on
the topic of the correct specification of functional forms for the distributions of unobservables.
-

This would not be a serious problem if estimates of key parameters

of the model were "relatively" insensitive to assumptions made about

spe—

cific functional forms. In fact, the available evidence (Hecican and Singer,
1981a, b) suggests the opposite. Estimates of key parameters are very sensitive tà the choice of particular functional forms.
The situation is not entirely hopeless. Heclaan and Singer

(1981,

1982) present a computationally feasible nonparametrià estimator for the

distribution fuüct ions of unobservables, so that

at

least one aspect of

arbitrariness in model specification can be eliminated with their methods.
Nonetheless, a considerable amount of arbitrariness remains, and this

arbitrariness vitally affects the inference from the structural models.
These problems are more troublesome than recent analyses indicate

the

It is analytically

also arises from unobserved variables is in principle straightforward.
When the models are identified the appropriate asymptotic distribution

Nonstationarity

There are many interesting and empirically relevant factors that
produce a nonstationary model; finite lives for individuals (DeGroot,
1970), unemployment insurance available for a limited duration, etc.

Nonstationarity raises two difficult problems. (A) The econometrician
must be much more careful about the initial conditions of the process

than has been required in the models analyzed up to this point (Flinn
and Heckman, 1982). (B) Properly controlling for nonstationarity raises
formidable computational problems (Heclcnan and Singer, 1982)

2. An Equilibriwn Model of Sequential Search

2.0 Introduction
The one state model of sequential search analyzed in Section One

is widely cited as the theoretical basis for empirical analysis of

42

unemployment

durations. Its value as a guide to data has been questioned

because without modification it does not support a nondegenerate equilibrium wage distribution (Diamond, 1971, Rothschild, 1973) . This now
widely echoed objection has caused many applied economists to reject

search theory as an interesting source of hypotheses on unemployment
durations. Many would argue that developing the econometrics of an
economically uninteresting model puts the cart before the horse.
In this section we develop an equilibrium two state model of sequential

search. The model is closely related to recent work on matching equilibria
by Diamond and Maskin (1979) .

to the equilibrium model analyzed here.
The simplicity of the model proposed and estimated here may offend

the sensibilities of readers accustomed to regression analysis with
numerous "control variables." The simplicity of our model is charac-

teristic

of the theory on which we draw. As discussed in Recician and

Singer (1982) small departures from the stationary search model affect

the predictione from these models, the existence of optimal solutions
and the nature of the appropriate econometric model.

For these reasons

we are reluctant to "throw in" numerous control variables in
our

empirical analysis, especially variables that control

for nonstationarity.

2.1 An Equilibrium Sequential Search Model

Labor market equilibrium is interpreted as the outcome of a steady

state sorting and matching process. Pools of unattached risk neutral workers

43

and firms are in the market seeking to form partnerships to
perform tasks. Before
a worker and firm meet they do not know the potential rate of productivity
of a match. Thus ex ante all firms look alike to all workers and all workers
look alike to all firms. Upon encounter the productivity rate is perfectly
revealed. The time required to complete a task is an exponential random variable. The distribution of the completion tine of a task is beyond the control
of either party. Each member of a potential partnership gets half of the
total productivity of the match if it is consummated. There is a distribution
of match productivity rates in the popusation known to both workers and firms.
Values of potential matches are dj.stributed independently across workers and

firms and are distributed independently across potential matches for the same

workers and firms. The outcome of one match is of no value in predicting the
outcome of another.

The probability that a worker meets a firm in a small tine interval

is

t

less than one and the probability of two or more such encounters is negligible.

The probability of encountering a potential partner is asswned to follow the

Poisson probability law. The Poisson parameter of encounters depends on the
number of firms searching in the market. For simplicity we assume equal
numbers of unattached firms and workers

(L) and that the rate of arrivals

to a given worker or firm is the same linear function of L.

The symmetry of

the position of workers and firms is one possible justification for the 50—50
splitting rule assumed here.
Each party to an encounter has two options:

(a) to accept the offered

terms of the match or (b) to continue searching. The task production technology is characterized by extreme indivisibilities such that partners can—

not search while working. If the prospective partners continue search they
incur an instantaneous flow rate of costs of c.

44

Search is with recall. If two prospective partners decide to continue
searching they can consununate their match at a later time. However it is

known from the theory of search in stationary environments (Lippman and
Mccall, l976a) that they never consummate their match if they ever reject

it. The intuitive reason for this result is that since the environment is
stationary the attractiveness of any forsaken option is the same tomorrow
as it is today.

This model generates equilibrium sequential search which is supported by

a nondegenerate equilibrium wage distribution. It shares many features in
common with the discrete outcome model of Diamond and Maskin although our

interpretation differs somewhat from theirsJ
Each potential match has two characteristics: a flow rate of output 2x

and a rate of termination a. Distribution F(x) is assumed to be absolutely continuous with finite absolute first moments. The value of a job to a

worker who receives flow rate x (by virtue of the sharing assumption) is

defined as V(X).
It is determined by the following calculation.

Thus the higher the cost of search, the rate of

support a search unemployment equilibrium. Determination of the uniqueness

Estimates of the Two State Model
This section reports maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters

of two specifications of the two state equilibrium model. The first specification assumes that (firm or worker) match values are exponentially dis-

tributed; the second assumes that they are normally distributed. Both sets
of estimates are derived under the assumption of homogeneity although we
attempt to control for heterogeneity by estimating the model for one demo-

graphic group: young (20—24) white male high school graduates not attending
school,

sampled from the National Longitudinal Surveys in 1971. A more

complete

description of these data is given below

(Table 1). To make the

model empirically operational we define the unemployment state more broadly
than is usually done to include unemployment as conventionally defined plus
nonparticipation in the market.
The parameter estimates for the two models are presented in Table 1.

The estimated reservation wage is $1.50 (stated as an hourly rate). The
mean length of a job (!)

is

28 months. For both models viability condition

(2.5) is satisfied.

Table

2 records some of the more interesting features of these esti-

mates. The first two rows record estimates of the cost of search (c)
secured from equation (2.4). These estimates are obviously quite sensitive
to the choice of interest rate r and the assumed functional form for the
distribution of

match productivities. The exit rate from the

nonemployed

("search") state h is 1.21 which implies a mean length of nottemployment
of 8.3 months. Given a and h the implied equilibrium nonemployment
rate is 22.52 which compares closely with the actual nonemployment rate

wave of which was collected in 1966. White, not enrolled in full time schooling (in

final requirement was made to eliminate the need to compute hourly wage rates for
workers not paid on an hourly basis. We use data on lengths of employment and non—
employment spells occurring in 1971. We use data on accepted wages to estimate the
pareters of the wage distribution. Information from 231 complete and incomplete
unemployment spells and 2915 complete and incomplete nonemployment spells is used.

As discussed in Section One,

estimates

tribution.

If an exponential model is assumed the estimated mean length of time between
offers ( ) is five months and the probability of receiving no offer in
the next six months is only .3. The probability of accepting a match that
is offered is .6. Thus the exponential model implies a relatively rapid

rate of arrivals of offers and a relatively frequent rate of rejection of
those

offers.

If a normal model is assumed,

the story changes. In

this case the mean

length of time between offers is 7.5 months and the probability of receiving

no offer in the next six months is .45. However, the probability of accepting a match that is offered rises to .92. Thus in the normal model,
job arrivals are a relatively rare event and most workers accept the first
job offer they receive.

In this particular case, the choice of model is clear. The accepted
wage data are not exponentially distributed and an eyeball test indicates

that the implied truncated normal distribution fits the data better. Before
taking much comfort from this point, it is important to recall the point made

Section One. In order to estimate A it is necessary to assume that
the match offer distribution is recoverable. This requires
in

making an

arbitrary parametric assumption about the functional form of the

productivity match distribution and the choice of this functional form will
critically affect estimates of certain parameters of the model. Although we

56

can check the plausibility of any assumed functional form (assuming recoverability) by inspecting accepted wage distributions, the power of such a test

is low. The

recoverability condition cannot be tested.

new points are made

Summary and Conclusions

This paper takes a first step toward developing rigorous structural
econometric models f or the empirical analysis of labor force dynamics.

The analysis is presented In continuous time although most of the new

points raised here apply with full force to discrete time models. Rigorous
structural estimation requires the solution of new problems that have not
been addressed in previous work. We identify those problems and offer

some solutions. We have also stated certain unsolved problems in the

belief that their clear statement will focus attention on the relevant
issues that should be addressed in subsequent econometric research on
structural. models of labor force dynamics.

A key condition required in our analysis is a recoverability

dition that is implicit in all econometric analyses of truncated data
of which structural models for the analysis of labor force dynamics are

a special case. This condition must be satisfied in order to recover an
untruncated distribution from a truncated distribution with a iciown point

of truncation. A major conclusion of our analysis is that a recoverability
condition will only be satisfied if the untruncated distribution is assumed

to belong to a parametric family. It is not satisfied for all parametric
families. Recoverability is not a testable proposition.
The implications of this analysis are far'-ranging. Economic theory

is rarely so specific as to predict the functional forms of untruncated

distributions.' Thus, at its foundation, structural estimation in all

58

truncated

data models involves an Intrinsically arbitrary decomposition

of reduced f on parameters into structural components. Both formally,
and by way of empirical examples, we have demonstrated that estimates of
structural parameters are very sensitive to arbitrary choices made about

functional forms required to anpirically implement structural models.
Put more succinctly, consistent non—parametric estimation of the parameters
of most
The

structural duration (and truncated data) models is impossible.

arbitrariness inherent in structural estimation is essential.
Granting the satisfaction of a recoverability condition (as the

literature on the econometrics of truncated data has done) we
have also demonstrated that structural estimation in a gEneral class
entire

of dynamic labor force models requires the utilization of inequality

constraints on accepted wage offers. Unless these constraints are used,
the structural parameters of the model are not identified. Previous

analysts have not noted this essential feature of these models.

Incorporation of the identifying inequality constraints into an
estimation

procedure raises certain nonstandard statistical problems.

Conventional

regularity conditions are violated so that the standard

theory of maximum likelihood estimation does not apply. We develop

the appropriate statistical theory for certain cases likely to be of
interest in applications but we have not developed the general case in
this paper, although we indicate how this might be done.
(l)A notable exception is the analysis of Telser on equilibrium
price and wage distributions.

59

We

also formulate a structural two state equilibrium matching model

of unemployment and estimate a simple version of it. Previous empirical
research on labor force dynamics has been conducted within the framework

of partial equilibrium search models which are not internally consistent
because they imply degenerate equilibrium wage distributions. The model
developed in this paper produces a nondegenerate equilibrium wage offer

distribution.
Empirical results obtained from this model provide an economically
meaningful decomposition of the parameters of reduced form exit rates
from unemployment. However, we demonstrate that the estimated structural

parameters are very sensitive to arbitrary assumptions about functional
forms of estimating equations. We demonstrate that two different behavioral
models are broadly consistent with the same data.

Our initial enthusiasm for structural estimation has been tempered
somewhat by the analytical and computational problems reported in this
paper.
in

The econometric analysis of structural duration models is still

its infancy. We are confident that subsequent

analysis will

solve

some of the problems left unsolved here.
Nonetheless, because much analysis of structural models remains
to be done, because basic facts on labor force dynamics remain to be
collated and analyzed and

because

of the inherent

arbitrariness

of the

identifying assumptions used to secure structural estimates (and the
sensitivity of estimates of structural parameters to such assumptions),

we also feel that a reduced form approach to analyzing labor force models

60

may be a useful complement to the structural approach presented in this

paper. A companion paper (nina and Heclcnan, 1982) develops a reduced
form approach to the empirical analysis of labor force dynamics.

There are three possibilities. First, in a small interval of time, no wage

S(n) is the value of household activity given nonmarket draw n. Its derivation is analogous to that given for V(x). Three things can happen to a person
engaged in household activity at the beginning of interval At. (1) No new nonmarket

or market draws arrive.

This event occurs with probability (l—(X+p)At).

In this case, the individual continues to stay out of the workforce. (2) A new

nonmarket draw arrives.

This event occurs with probability itht.

If it does

occur, the individual chooses the labor force option that gives the maximum of the

new S(n) or the value of search Q.

If

he chooses to search, the individual is

unemployed. (3) A market wage offer may arrive. This event occurs with probability
AAt. If it does occur, the individual chooses the option with the highest valtLe: he
either continues on in the nonmarket state or takes the job offer. As before, the
simultaneous arrival of a wage offer and fresh nonmarket draw is of negligible

the reservation wage functions defined above, these three equations produce restrictions across the parameters of the transition matrix governing transitions

among the three states. (For more details, see Coleman and Heclcuan,. 1981.)
The densities of duration times in each labor force state have a simple representation in terms of the reservation wages and arrival rates of offers. The
econometric model produced by the theory is a competing risks model of the sort

widely used in the duration analysis literature. (See

Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980.)

We establish the analogy by briefly reviewing that model using terminology from
the biostatjstjcs literature.

A patient can die from many causes that are assumed to operate independently.

Suppose that there are two diseases, each of which is fatal. The time to death
from disease one is
the

t1,

if it is

the only disease afflicting the patient, while

time to death from disease two is t2, if disease two is the only one afflicting

the patient. In the presence of both diseases, the time to death is m.in(t1,t2).
and

t2 are clearly only hypothetical random variables each of which would

characterize time to death if the other disease is not at work.
Suppose that each disease considered in isolation produces an exponential

The competing risks model can be applied to the three state model of labor force
dynamics. For example, an employed individual is subject to two risks: (a) getting a higher wage on another job and (b) getting a nonmarket draw that causes

him to terminate his current job. Whichever risk occurs first causes him to exit
his current job. Define E as the hypothetical duration of employment in the

73

current job if the only possible exit is to another job. efliS the hypothetical
duration of employment if the only possible exit is to the nonmarket state. Each
random variable has an exponential distribution as a consequence of the tine sta-

Given knowledge of x and x', and an assumed functional form for F, it is possible
to estimate consistently the parameters of F as the number of observed e to e

transitions becomes large. Consistent estimates of this density are not possible

without imposing a recoverability condition. Thus the model is nonparametrically
underidentified but parametrically identified. Since it is possible to use dura-

tion data to consistently estimate h, assuming recoverability is satisfied, Xe

Thus under the assumptions made, it is possible to consistently estimate

theory for these estimators ià produced by an analysis similar to

that given in the text, Part 1. For more detail see Coleman and Eeclan (1981).
In order to use the theory to secure structural estimates of the parameters of
the model it is necessary to sole (B—4) —

(B—7)

iteratively to compute the

reservation wage values needed to form the sample likelihood function. See
Coleman and Reckman (1981).

The distinguishing feature of this model is that the theory imposes cross

transition

restrictions. These restrictions have not been noted or imposed in

previous empirical work on labor force turnover. (See, e.g. Tuma and Robbins,

1980.) These restrictions aid in model identification and provide tests of the
theory. We have already noted that the model predicts wage growth as a function

of experience. By parameterizing nonnarket distributions we are able to produce
a rich class of turnover models which enable us to introduce economic analysis

from household economics into turnover models. Children, nonmarket income,
health status and the like determine

the value of nonmarket time.

Tests of hypotheses \ > Xe and Au >

A

provide indirect evidence on

the empirical validity of search models. If, for example, Au <

Xn

considerable

doubt would be cast on the standard search model. This hypothesis can be tested
assuming that a recoverability condition is satisfied. For further analysis of
this

model and more

general models see Coleman and Heckman (1981).

Appendix

This Appendix

C: the Kief er—Neumann Procedure

discusses the relationship between the analysis in Section 1

of the text and the Kief er—Neumann analysis of search unemployment (1979, 1981),

We demonstrate that

the

Kiefer—Neumann analysis is critically dependent on the

assumption that agents receive one offer per period (however the period is defined).
We also note that even under their assumptions, their estimator is less

efficient than the one presented in the text because they overlook a critical piece

of information which we exploit. We further demonstrate that their inefficient
estimation approach does not generalize to a continuous time setting and so cannot
be used as a substitute for the analysis of the more general model given in the text.

The

iCiefer

and Neumann approach is a direct application of statistical results

developed in the sample selection bias literature (see Heckinan, 197Gb and 1979 and
Heclcman and Macurdy, 1981) and in the literature on female labor supply (see Smith,

1980). F(x) is a log normal distribution so in X is normaly distributed with

mean zB and variance 2 Wage offers arrive one per "period". Following Lippman
and Mccall (1976) the reservation wage rV is defined as the solution to

Properties of R* have already been established in the text (just fix A = 1 in the

analysis of section 1.1). Given their log normality assumption, it is convenient
to work with

Exactly as in the analysis of sections 1.3—1.5, the likelihood function formed from

the joint density is monotonic in c and constraint C—li is always satisfied as an
equality for at least one observation.
Kiefer and Neumann do not maximize the likelihood for their model. Instead,
they use an indirect two stage approach patterned exactly after previous models

estimated in the female labor supply literature. They first use data on unemployment duration in a likelihood formed from (C—5) to estimate
as

a reduced

form index. (This

sta2e corresponds to estimating an equation

iterated variant of this procedure.

The estimates derived from this procedure are not efficient because they do
not exploit all the information in the sample (i.e., they are not derived from the

likelihood function)J1 Moreover, the two stage procedure is critically dependent
on the assumption that agents receive one off er per "period." In that case, the
per period probability of accepting a job (1—F(R)) is also the denominator of the

conditional density of wage offers. (See (C—6).) From the duration probit, it
is possible to estimate the selection index (

z5_.R(c,z$,r) ) and so it is possible to

correct for truncation bias in the estimated accepted wage offer distribution. In the

more

general case in which the probability of receiving an offer is less than one,

the per period probability of accepting a job is not the denominator of C—6. (For
a continuous time example see equations (1.4) and (1.5) in the text; the point
applies

to either a continuous time or discrete time model.) Thus in the more

general case, if the rate of arrival of job offers is not known, it is not
possible to estimate

the selectivity variable (X in equation (C—8)) from the

duration data alone; thus the two stage procedure outlined above breaks down.

Structural estimation requires utilization of the inequality restrictions
exploited in Section 1.
Another point not noted by Kiefer and Neumann is that under the assumption

that

agents receive one wage offer per period, it is

always possible to recover

the denominator of the truncated

Ictown (see the discussion in section 1.3, esvecially on tages

and footnote 1 on page 11). Thus, provided that the reservation wage

is

estimated in the manner we suggest in

of

wage offers is always recoverable from the sample truncated distribution if

the text, the

untruncated distribution

agents receive one wage offer per period. Thus it is not necessary to impose
a functional form for accepted wages onto the data. Under their assumptions

all

the structural parameters of the model are nonparametrically identified.

Adding

unobserved heterogeneity to the model in the fashion of Hecbian

and Willis (1977) or Kiefer and Nemnnn (1981) does not alter our conclusIons
in this Appendix in any fundamental way. For the sake of brevity, we refrain
froQ

extending our analysis to include

this

case.
