Models for the Analysis of Labor Force Dynamics

ABSTRACT

This paper presents new econometric methods for the empirical analysis
of individual labor market histories. The techniques developed here extend
previous work on continuous time models in four ways: (1) A structural
economic interpretation of these models is presented.

(2) Time varying

explanatory variabtes are introduced into the analysis in a general way.
(3)

Unobserved heterogeneity components are permitted to be

correlated across

(4) A flexible model of duration dependence is presented that
accommodates many previous models as a special case and that permits tests
among competing specifications within a unified framework.
We contrast our methods with more conventional discrete time and
regression procedures. The parameters of continuous time models are invariant to the sampling tine unit used to record observations. Problems
plague the regression approach to analyzing duration data which do not
spells.

plague the likelihood approach advocated in this paper. The regression
approach cannot be readily adopted to accommodate tine varying explanatory

variables. The functional forms of regression functions depend on the
time

paths of the explanatory variables. Ad hoc solutions to this problem

can make exogenous variables endogenous to the model and so can induce
simultaneous equations bias.

1'wo sets of empirical results are presented. A major conclusion of
the first analysis is that the discrete time Narkov model widely used in
labor market analysis is inconsistent with the data. The second set of
empirical results is a test of the hypothesis that 1tunemployment1' and
"out of the labor force'1 are behaviorally different labor market states.
Contrary to recent claims, we find that they are separate states for our
sample of

young men.

of the match but both learn about this productivity through a Bayesian

leaning algorithm. Both worker and firm start with the same prior about the
productivity of the match. The prior does not depend on the previous labor
market hIstory of the worker because each match is unique: the
productivity is not inherent in either the worker or the firm alone. The prior

is

then updated as

the two partners continue their relationship.

Jovanic demonstrates that a competitive equilibrium wage policy

of the firm which is also a socially optimal wage policy is to pay all
employees their expected marginal productivity where the expectation is computed

with respect to the updated prior on the productivity of the worker — f±rm
match. Workers, however, have alternatives. These alternatives include employ-

dependence during unemployment is associated with a declining reservation wage
in search theory (e.g., Lippman and Mccall) .

Negative duration dependence during

employment is associated with firm specific capital in the theory of turnover.
The hazard function arises as a simple and readily interpreted representation of the structural conditional distributIon of first oassage times in

many models of labor market turnover. The Mortensen, Lippman and McCall search
theory

generates a structural distribution of first passage tines. In the

infinite horizon case with a stationary economic environment, the optimal search

strategy is stationary so that there is no duration dependence in unemployment
speils. A shrinking horizon (Gronau), systematic job search over different
wage distributions (Salop), or declining assets in a utility maximizing job
search model (with constant relative risk aversion, see Danforth, or Hall,
Lippman and McCall), all generate optimal stopping time distributions with
positive duration dependence. The precise functional form of the hazard function

is determined by the distribution of the random shocks facing the agents.

Typically, these specific distributional assumptions are imposed as a matter
of mathematical convenience in formulating a theory and are not, themselves,

justified by an appeal to theory. For this reason, it

is

important to develop

a flexible approach to estimation that does not require special functional forms
to secure estimates. The approach to empirical model building which is developed

below permits the analyst to explore the sensitivity of his estimates to special
assumptions about functional forms

Intuitively, high a individuals are the

up as negative duration dependence in the fitted distribution.

By a theorem of Barlow and Proschan (p. 37) if each individual
exIt time distribution exhibits negative duration dependence over the entire
range of values of exit time the fitted hazard function also exhibits negative

duration

dependence. The only way for the fitted hazard

to exhibit positive

duration dependence is for some (but not necessarily all) individual exit
time distributions to have positive duration dependence over at least some
portion

of the domain of the distribution of exit times.

Although time varying variables are a

computat±onal nuisance they are a fact of life. In the empirical work reortad
below we demonstrate that this extension makes an important difference in our
estimates of the impact of key economic variables on turnover probabilitIes and

enables us to generate sensible parneter estimates.
Finally, our treatment of heterogeneity generalizes previous work by
permitting

unobserved components to be correlated across spells.

Work by tuna, Hannan and Groeneveld assumes that unobserved components are

uncorreIated across

spells. However, in this paper, our treatment of heterogeneity components
is soaewhat restrictive. We assume that within each spell V(t+t) a v i.e. that
heterogeneity' components

are constant within spells. Heterogeneity components

ar permitted to vary across spells. There is no particular reason to assume
that

unobserved components behave the way we assume they do unless unobserved

components are immutable person—specific effects. It is l±kely

that unobserved components change within spells. This assumption is made

Integrating out V is
formally equivalent to integrating out nuisance parameters. n alternative
approach to estimation would be to treat V as a fixed effect for each individual.

Except for some very special cases, the latter approach leads to a serious incidental

parameters problem (see, j., Heckman), and results in inconsistent
parameter estimates in short panels. For this reason we adopt a "random effect"
approach in our empirical analysis.

Testing
statistical

for the presence

of

heterogeneity

raises certain delicate

problems that arise in testing for values of parameters at the

boundaries of parameter spaces (Moran, 1973). A straightforward test for
the presence of seriafly correlated unobserved components can be constructed
that avoids these problems.

The following test procedure is proposed. Under the null hypothesis

that there is no serial correlation in unobservables. Future values of
duration variabLes should not be statistically significant determinants of

current duration distributions if heterogeneity is ignored in estimating the
parameters of current duration distributions. Standard (asymptotic) significance tests on the estimated coefficients of future duration variables
estimated without correcting for heterogeneity can be used to test the hypothesis

of no serial correlation in unobservables for any two spells of the event)
This test is not informative on the presence or absence of heterogeneity
components distributed independently across spells.

It is possible to estimate both A1. and A2. (subject to the restriction
and 12j• Using the estimated

1We advocate use of Cuture values rather than lagged values in constructing
the test because of the possibility that lagged duration variables may be present
in the structural model. See Hecican and Borjas (1980).

(d) Initializinz the ?rocess
It is a rare data set for which the beginning of the sample observation
interval is also the beginning of the individual's entry into the workforce —

the assumption made in the last section. More typically, a sample begins
with individuals caught midstream in an employment or uneploynent spell. It
is coonly the case that we know which state an individual occupies at the
beginning of the sample, and possibly the serial order of the spell but we do
not know the length of time spent in the spell before the individual is observed.
This section presents methods for adjusting the likelihood function presented
in the preceding section to account for this problem.

In order to focus on the essential aspects of the problem, we coence
the analysis under the assumption of a strictly stationary economic environment,
and under the further assumption that the process is in equilibrium.
People can be in only one of two states: employed or unemployed. The density

of exit time from employment, f(te) is the same across people and across time
for the same person. The same is true of the density of exit time from unemThe process is assumed to have been in operation for a long time

The completed spell

exit

because the completed lengths of spells sampled at r are on average longer
than the typical spell. Longer spells are more likely to be sampled than

shorter spells. Amplifying an heuristic argument due toCox and Lewis (pp.

scheme is the sum of the log of density (10) for each individual in the sample.
Maximizing this function with respect to the parameters of the model produces
consiscent and asymptotically normally distributed estimators as

the number

of event histories becomes large.

This procedure produces an exact solution to the probln of initializing
the likelihood in a stationary environment if the process is in stationary eq.zili—

brium. It is not a general solution. In many cases the two key assumptions —

equilibrit

and a stationary environment — are unlikely to be even approximately

correct. tn this case the procedure just presented is not valid.

We postpone a general discussion of this probl to a later occasion.
Here we sketch two solutions, both of which are patterned after a discussion
by one of us in a previous paper (Hectcnan). In a general nonstationary
environment, in order to correctly initialize the process, we require the prob-

ability distribution of the first spell in our saple. Its derivation depends
on the rule used to select the saple being analyzed, the probability that the
individual is in a given state at the time he is sapled, and the distribution

II CONTINUOUS TINE vs. DIRETE ThIS MODELS

The principal, advantage of continuous tine models for discrete panel

data over more conventional discrete tine models for discrete panel. data

is that the parameters generating the continuous time model are invariant

to the time unit used in empirical work. Commonly utilized discrete tine
models such as logit and probit lack this invariance property. A. probit
model for the occurrence of an event in a time interval of a specified
length does not imply a probit model for the probability of events in time
intervals of different length. Dependence of the parameters and functional

form of the model on the data.used to estimate it is an undesirable feature
of discrete time time models that is avoided by use of the continuous tine
approach. Put differently, a continuous tine model can always be used to
generate a discrete time model while

interval on which it

We now

Suppose that the data at our disposal come from a panel data set of

length T. To avoid inessential detail suppose that at the origin of the
sample — "0" — everyone begins a spefl of the event. This assumption
enables us to ignore problems with initial conditions.

We would like to use this data to estimate E(tIZ). But in our panel

sample the expected value of the length of the first spell is not E(tIz)

but is rather

In which T is tismaflit, regression estimators do not estimate the parameters

of regression function (18). Least squares estimators are critically
dependent on both the sample selection rule and the length of the panel.

Two studies that utilize the same sample selection rule for generating

"usable" observations will produce different regression coefficients if the
studies are based on panels of different length.

It is possible to estimate the true structural parameters of the model.
The maximum likelihood estimator discussed in section (1) automatically

corrects for the panel length bias. Moreover, it is obvious from our
exponential examples that by use of non—linear regression it is possible to

retrieve the structural parameters of interest.
The sane main conclusions can be obtained if we relax the simvlying

assumption that the process starts up at the origin data of the panel.

equations fit conditional on the "exogenous variables" measured starting at

the onset of a spell may generate biased coefficients. This is so because
the particular values assumed by the explanatory variables selected in this

fashion may depend on the lengths of the preceding spells. This is certainly

the case for tine trended explanatory variables like age, and in the
enpirical work we report below, it is also the case for our national
unemployment rate variable. Assuming that unmeasured heterogeneity components

To focus on the essential aspects of the problem, suppose that we have

access to a very long panel data set (T-) so that we can safely ignore the
length of panel bias previously considered. As before, there is only one
type of event and we assume that the stochastic process begins at the
beg4.mlng of our sample. The duration tine distribution depends on time

ignores the change in functional form that results from different paths for
regressors. It fails to capture the essential dependence of first passage
time densities on the entire sequence of exogenous variables, not just those
realized

in a spell. Exogenous variables that are selected in this fashion

become endogenous

variables. To demonstrate this final point by way of an example

consider a strictly positively treaded explanatory variable. The average

value of the variable within a spell is simply the multiple of the length of
the

spell, and is learly endogenous.
A.

second ad hoc procedure for introducing time varying variables into

a regression format is to use exogenous variables measured at a start of a

spell. Again, this procedure results in a misspecification of the true
conditional expectation function and for nonstationary explanatory variables
manufactures simultaneous equations bias

for models with heterogeneity

components by selecting "explanatory" variables on the basis of prior

realizations of the process.
The standard regression approach to the analysis of duration data is

thus seen to be a rather fragile empirical procedure. Only in the case of
long panels in stationary economic enviroents does it produce valid
parameter estimates •

These

conditions are unlikely to be realized in the

analysis of microeconomic labor market data. The likei.iiaood approach corrects

for length of panel bias and suitably modified corrects for other sampling rules.
Tine varying explanatory variables can readily be accommodated in the

likelihood approach. For both reasons, we strongly prifer the likelihood
approach to the regression approach In the analysis of labor market duratIon

1Cox and Lewis suggest this approach but only for explanatory

Sub-

section A compares empirical results obtained from regression and maximum
likelihood procedures used to analyze spells of employment and nonemployment
for a sample of young men. Our results from this analysis are of considerable

substantive interest, and also serve to illustrate the biases inherent in
using regression technicues to analyze duration data. Subsection B presents

tests of the proposition that it is legitimate to aggregate the "unemployment"
and "out of labor force" states into one state called nonemployment. This
proposition is of interest given recent claims that the distinction between

the two nonemploynent states is artificial (see, e.g., Clark and

As noted in
analysis

Section III restricting attention in the empirical

to completed spells of events generates sample selection bias. In

our empirical work, we lose apprwd.mately two—thirds of our sample by imposing

this sample selection requirement.
We include only two regressors in the empirical results presented

here; the first is a duny variable set to one if the individual is married
with spouse ptesent (ItlSP)

and

zero otherwise and the second is the national

unemployment rate for prime age white males. The second variable is a proxy

for aggregate demand. In addition to the first—differenced specification
described above, we also present estimates of a two equation system of first
and second spell completed log duration times using generalized least squares.

A topic of considerable interest in estimating the regression equations

is the

determination of the sensitivity of parameter estimates to the

method used to select spefl constant values for the time varying exogenous

variables. For the regressors used here, the national unemployment rate varies
by month, while marital status is observed yearly. In our sample period
(1969—1971) the within spell, variation of the unemployment variable is likely

to be far greater than that of marital status. We thus expect to find that
the parameters associated with unemployment wifl show more sensitivity to

the method of selecting spell constant exogenous variables.
Since the regression approach has been shown to yield biased parameter

estimates (see Section In) it is difficult to isolate the effect of fixing
the exogenous variables over spells using the two regression methods examined
here. To provide a benchmark we present maximum likelihood estimates of the

Weibull duration model using both methods of fixing the exogenous variables.

We then incorporate time varying variables. Differences among the estimates

are considerable.

49

Regression results for log employment durations are presented in

table 1. The top panel contains the estimates of the two spell aS model,
while the lower panel contains estimates from the first difference specif i—

cation. On tl left side of the table the values of the regressors is the
average value over the spell

and on the right side of the values are

those observed in the first month of the spell (zr.

As

discussed in Section

In the second method of fixing the regressors cay also produce biased co-

efficients because the values of the "exogenous variables" at the start of
the second spefl of an event will depend on the lengths of previous spells

of events if the true exogenous variables are tine treaded. In our sample of
thirty months the memployment measure has an extreme positive time trend.

The two methods for fixing the regressors produce large differences

in parameter estimates. Although most parameters are not significantly different from zero by conventional standards, the coefficient of the imemploy—

The sign of estimated second spell coas the coefficient based on

The

The two regression specifications yield very different parameter estithe estimate of the coefficient of unemploymates. For the model using
ment for second spell duration is .531 in the aS system as opposed to .858

from the first difference specification. The coefficients of the unemployment rate on first spell, employment duration are 9.31 in the first difference
specification and-6.523 in the GLS system. These disparities and the generally

poor fits demonstrate the difficulties inherent in the regression approach.

in virtually all transitions. However, spurious negative duration dependence
can be generated by not properly accounting for population heterogeneity.

duration dependence in the employment to nonemployment transition (see table 4).

The coefficient of MSP is significant in all three panels in explaining

piovm

equations

the method of introducing exogenous variables has little

effect on the value of the MSP parameter, though in all cases the coefficient

is approximately equal to its standard error. In all three panels the interpretation of the effect of marital status on exit tines is the same: mdividuals married with spouse present have lower rates of transition out of
employment and higher rates of transition from noneloyment than others.
-

The

differences in parameter estimates are much more extreme for the

coefficients of the prime age male unemployment variabla. Recall that this
variable is strongly time treaded. The coefficients of the unemployment
variable in both panels A and B are highly significant for the employment—

nonemploymant transition, but are of opoosite Ei2n. Allowing the variables

to change over the spell results in an estimate which is positive but not

statistically significant. Use of spell constant regressors leads to dramatically different interpretations depending on the technique employed to

arrive at a spell constant value. This same remark is true with regard to the
unemployment rate coefficients in the nonemployment-employment transition.

Taken as a whole, these results demonstrate the seriousness of the biases introduced into the parameter estimates by restricting the vartability of exogenous

variables. These findings cast considerable doubt on the value of regression
nethods for estimating duration models.

We next turn to an investigat±on of the effects of not controlling
for heterogeneity on estimates of duration dependence. The specification of
the one factor scheme we adopt is given in equation (6) in Sect±on I. The same

set of regressors is used as was used in the estimatIon of the model in table

3, Pane]. C, so that all variables are allowed to vary within s,efls. :able

It is interesting to note that unobservable heterogeneity is

an

impor-

tant determinant of the rate of transition out of the employment state, but has
little effect on the rate of leaving nonemployment. There has been much attention
given to separating the effect of heterogeneity and state dependence in the
length of nonemployment spells, but our estimates suggest that for young nen
estimates

of duration dependence are not affected by the inclusion of

geneity into the model. However, the duration dependence

hetero-

Effect vanishes with

the introduction of heterogeneity in the employment-nonemployment transition.

The introduction of heterogeneity reduces the agnitude of

all

the parameters

(with the excation of the constant) in the emoloynent equation, while the
coefficIents in the nonemployment equation are barely affected.
These findings indicate that employment—nonemploynent transitIon

prcbabili:Ies are non{arkovian and call into question the standard dLscreta
tine 24arkcv assumption widely used

in

Labor

arket analysts

(see, e.g.,

Do

aarston,

1976). The source of departure from the Markov model differs be-

tween the

employment to noneraployment transition and the rtonemployment tO

employment transition. The former transition is non—Markovian because of tin—

controlled heterogeneity which gives rise to the classical mover—stayer

problem. The latter transition is

non—Markovian because of

structural dura-

tion dependence.

All the estimation done up to this point has been predicated on the
assumption that the exit time distributions are Weibuil. We now relax this
assumption. We estimate a model which allows for general- forms of duration

dependence. This specification is obtained by letting

for all values of j and £ (see equation 5). Empirical results are presented
in table 5 f or models estimated with and without heterogeneity corrections. The
models estimated without heterogeneity show some evidence of linear duration

dependence in the E to N transition, while the hazard associated with the N to E
transition appears to be nonmonotonic in duration. Except for the unemployment

rate coefficient in the E to N transition, the estimates of the coefficients of
the explanatory variables do not differ much from the estimates obtained in the
Weibull model. When the heterogeneity correction is added, there is no evidence

of duration dependence in the rate of leaving employment. Recall that a similar
result was found in the Weibuli. case. Fot the nonernployinent to emDloyment transi-

tion, the exit rate to employment also appears to be a linear function of duration.
In our data we do not reject the null hypothesis that the squared duration term is
insienificant in each of the transition densicies. Assuming that this is so, it
then become possible to test between the Weibull (X .

specifications. The difference in log likelihoods between the two models
is neglIgible (—739.2 vs —740.6). The evidence suggests a slight preference

for the Weibull specification. The estimates of the coefficients of the explana—
tory varSables do not change much between those specifitat±ons, and for the sake

of brevtty we do riot report the detailed empirical results from this odel.

or not

Out of the Labor Force are Behaviorally Different States1

preceding empirical, work lumps the "unemployed" and those "out of

the labor force" into a conon "nonenployed" category. There- is considerable
controversy

in the literature over the issue of whether or not the

categories

"unemployed" and "out of the labor force" are behaviorally distinct labor
force states (Lucas). This issue is particularly relevant in the study of the
labor market dynamics
to

of youth.

Given the range

of

nonmarket options available

many youths, and given practices of many state unemployment compensation

agencies which affactively limit the eligibility for unenoloyment compensation

of many youths, it seems especially likely that there is no distinction between
"unemployment" and "out of the labor force" status for young people. Recent

1Corents by Gary Chamberlain have greatly improved this section of the paper,
and eliminated several errors that appeared in previous drafts.

58

papers by Clark and Suers and Eliwood have made this claim. In this section

of the paper we present a test of this proposition and reject it. We find
that distinct behavioral equations govern transitions from out of the labor force
to employment and from unemployment to employment.

Recent theory suggests that being "imemployed" and

behavior. Por example, in search theory (e.g., Burdect and

a key difference between unemployed individuals and those out of the

labor force is that the former are at an interior point with respect to the
optimal amount of tine they devote to search while the latter are at a corner and
spend no time searching.

these two

states.

Separate behavioral equations generate observations in

59

Even

though these theoretical distinctions are widely accepted, many

economists claim that the empirical distinction between reported "unemployment"

and reported "out of the labor force" is so arbitrary that it is of little
or no analytical value. This point would seem to have some merit after examining
the official current population survey definitIon of unemployment, which defines
those individuals as unemployed !twho had no employment during the survey week,

were available for work, and (1) had engaged in any specific job seeking activity
within
they

the past four weeks, (2) were waiting to be called back to a job from which

had been laid off, or (3) were

waiting to report toa new wage or salary

job scheduled to start within the following 30 days." Because there is no
stipulation as to the quality or quantity of searches made within the month,
the unemployment—out of the labor force distinction may be of little value in
predicting employment probabilities for the nonemployed.

In this lection we present a test to determine whether pr not the classifications "u" (unemployed) and "o" (out of the labor force) are behaviorally

meaningless distinctions. The idea underlying the test is as follows: controlling
for

heterogeneity if the hazard rate for exit

to employment

from unemployment

(h) is the same as the hazard rate for exit to employment out of the labor force
the origin state ("o" or "u") is irrelevant in determining the rate at
which individuals leave nonemployment to go to employment. In a simple 3 state

Markov model, this test is equivalent to testing the proposition that the two
nonemploynent states can be aggregated into a single state and a properly specified
two state Narkov model can be defined for employment and nonemployment. To simplify

the exposition we assume that there is no heterogeneity in observed or unobserved

characteristics. This assumption is not essential and is not used in performing
the empirical work reported below.

To motivate the test, we consider two cases. The fIrst case assumes that

60

individuals exit

employment

at a rate governed by density f(t). The

probability that a person teninating employment classifies himself as a
'u"

of

"o" is determined by tossing a coin that comes up "u" fraction T

The hazard rate for entry to employment will be the same whether or not the

nonemployed individual is classified as an "o" or an "u".1
In the second case considered here, individuals are allowed to switch
their reported nonemployment status "randomly't. By this we mean that initial
nonemployment classification is random (governed as before by a toss of the
coin) and that individuals switch randomly between "o" and "u". The continuous time

analogue of discrete time independent Bernoulli trials is an exponential waiting tine

Individuals may change among reported nonemployment states for whatever reason. All

that is required for the origin state (o or u) to be irrelevant for characterizing
transitions from nonemployment to employment is for h— h.

This interpretation of the test is also informative in that ft makes
precise the sense in which o and ii are "irrelevant". Aggregating o and

u into a single state for the purpose of statistical analysis does not alter
the Narkov property of the model. The rate at which indl':iduals leave nonem—
ployment to enter employment does not depend on which nonemployment state in-

dividuals are in.
It is tempting to extend this type of reasoning to consider transitions
from employment to the two nonemploynent states. Thus it might be argued that

SUMMARY kiND CQNCLUSIONS

This paper presents new econometric methods for the empirical analysis

of individual labor market histories. The techniques developed here extend
previous work on continuous tine models in four ways: (1) A structural
economic interpretation of these models is presented. (2) Time varying

explanatory variables are. introduced into the analysis in a general way.
(3) Unobserved heterogeneity components are permitted to. be correlated across

spells. (4) A fleble model of duration dependence is presented that accommodates many previous models as a special. case and that permits tests among

competing specifications within a unified framework. In addition, longer
range types of state dependence can be introduced into the model and their
empirical importance tested with our model.
We contrast our methods with more conventional discrete tine and

regression procedures. The parameters of continuous time models are invariant
to the sampling time unit used to record observations •

Parameters

of discrete

time models defined for one time unit are not in general comparable to para-

meters of discrete time models defined for other tine units. Two problems
plague the regression approach to analyzing duration data which do not plague

the likelihood approach advocated in this paper. The first problem is that
standard regression estimators are ill equipped to deal with censored spells

of events that arise in short panels. The second problem is that the regression approach cannot be readily adopted to accoimnodate time varying explana-

tory variables. The functional forms of regression functions depend on the
66

67

time paths of the explanatory variables. Ad hoc solutions to this problem
can make exogenous variables andogenous to the nodel and so can induce simul—

taneous equations bias. The likelihood approach advocated in this paper can

readily accoodate time varying explanatory variables.
Two sets of empirical results are presented. The first set is an
analysis of employment and nonemployment data using both regression and

maximtnn likelihood procedures. Standard regression methods are shown to

perform rather poorly, and to produce estimates wildly at variance with the
estimates from our maximum likelihood procedure. The maximum likelihood

estimates are more in accord with a priori theoretical notions. A major conclusion of this analysis is that, the discrete time Markov modal widely used

in labor market analysis is inconsistent with the data.
The second set of empirical, results is a test of the hypothesis that
"employment" and "out of the labor force" are behaviorafly different labor

market states. Concraty to recent claims, we find that they are separate
states for cur sample of young men.

APPENDIX A
The Likelihood Function for a Xultistate—Multievisode model.
In this appendix we discuss general issues in the estimation of continuous time probability models and the pirticular features of the Likelihood

function we employ in the empirical work presented in the text. Since our
data start at the beginning of the labor market history of individuals, we
can safety ignore the initial conditions problem discussed in the text.

This tern enters the likelihood function for, spells uncompleted as of the end

used in the estimation of the parameters of the hazard function. This is not
the case in regression analyses of durations in a state (or some transformation of duration) on ccogenous variables, there only completed spells can be

used in a straightforward fashion.

The Weibull Regression Model

This appendix presents a brief derivation and discussion of the

Weibull regression model utilized by Rectan

and Borjas

and employed

in this paper as well. We derive the conditional regression function of
the log of duration in the jth spell of state L, Zn t, discuss the distribution of the regression errors and demonstrate how it is possible to estimate

duration dependence parameters using regression analysis. The efficiency
of least squares estimators relative to maximum likelihood is derived for
a special case.
