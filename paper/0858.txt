New Nethods for Estinating Labor Supply Functions:
A Survey

Abstract

This paper surveys new methods for estimating labor supply functions. A
unified framework of analysis is presented. All recent models of labor supply are
special cases of a general index function model developed for the analysis of
dummy endogenous variables.

Introduction

Recant empirical studies of labor supply have their foundations
in the statistical theory of "index functions." This theory offers a general
methodology to correct for sample selection biases and provides a conceptually simple framework

far modeling corner solutions to the consumer's

problem. In this survey we show how recent studies on

supply dealing with

labor

the

topics of labor force participation, fixed

costs of work, and taxes can all be fit within a general "index function
framework."

The statistical theory of index functions has its foundation in the
literature on duy endogenous variables in a system of simultaneous equations.
This

literature is based on the notion that discrete endogenous variables

are generated by continuous latent variables crossing thresholds. Tobin's
(1958) seminal paper on estimating the demand for consumer durables is

the first application of index function theory in economics. In Tobin's
model, the intensity of demand for the durable good is the index function.
Due to population variation in reservation prices, many consumers are at
corner solutions. Only if the intensity of demand exceeds some minimum

level

(the threshold) does the individual purchase the durable good.
Over

extensively

the past decade, the "3.ndex function

framework" has been used

to analyze many problems in the area of consumer choice, includ-

ing the analysis of quantal (i.e., discrete) choice (McFadden, 1974, 1976
and Domencich and McFadden, 1976). This framework also forms the basis

for recent work dealing with problems arising from the use of nonrandom

samples and sample selection biases. A general discussion of index functions
and their relationship to simultaneous equation models which incorporate

—2—

both continuous and discrete variables appears in Heckman (1978).

This survey begins with a discussion of the basic statistical
framework found in many recent labor supply studies. In Section It we
interpret Recican's (1974a) model of joint labor supply, participation, and

wage rates within this framework. Section III considers extensions of this
model to incorporate fixed costs associated with labor supply, and it interprets the studies of Cogan (1976, 1979), Hanoch (1976, 1979), and Hausman

(1979). Section IV develops a basic model for analyzing progressive tax

schemes and labor supply. In Section V we generalize this model to allow
for

regressive as well as progressive taxes along the lines proposed by

Sunless

and

Ilausman (1978), Hausinan (1979), and Wales and Woodland (1979).

Discussion of specific methods of estimation is deferred to an appendix.

estimated structural labor supply functions.

The index function model given by equationè (2) — (5) underlies all of

In the elementary

model, a global

comparison between the best attainable utilities in the work and no work
states can be reduced to a local comparison between the marginal value of
leisure at the no work position (the slope of the consumer's highest attainable
indifference curve at zero hours of work) and the wage rate.

Hanoch

(1976, 1979) extend

the

simple model of

exposition follows more closely the

work of Cogan..

Consider Figure 1. A consumer's no work indifference curve is given by
HA. For the simple model described above, if the wage rate is given by the
slope of RC, the consumer works, and a standard interior solution labor supply

function is generated. If the wage rate is given by the slope of line RB,
the consumer does not work. The introduction of fixed money costs of work
means that the consumer must pay fixed money cost F in order to work. The
breakaven wage, which

consumer

causes the

to be indifferent between work (with the fixed cost) and no work,

is given by the slope of the line connecting points R—F and 0. If the consumer
is given a wage with this slope, and works Hd hours, he is indifferent between

work and nonwork. At any higher wage rate, he will work. As money costs are
thcreasad, so are reservation wage rates and the minisun number of hours that

the consumer works if he works at all. The relevant reservation wage for labor
supply is the slope of indifference curve RA at position D.

The labor supply curve thus has a discontinuity. The consumer either
does not work at all or works at least Ed hours. "Ed" is called "reservation
hours" in the literature. The slope of the no work indifference curve at Rd
hours,

is termed the reservation wage. The labor supply function for

those who work is essentially a standard labor supply curve with unearned
income a reduced by amount F, the fixed money costs of work.

The analysis of fixed time costs of work parallels our discussion of

Since the Rd Wa. and H functions are derived from a common utility function,
cross—equation

restrictions connect these three functions. Without assuming

explicit functional forms for the utility function it is difficult to impose
these restrictions. Cogan does not impose a specific functional f on and so

does not exploit all, the available information in the system. Zn practice,
one does not have data on fixed costs. f is assumed to depend on a large

set

of observed variables, some of which do not enter the labor supply

Using standard sample selection bias correction procedures it is possible

to obtain estimates of the parameters of the H function. Assuming a functional

form for H and H, writing H —

Ha in reduced form, and assuming that one

variable appears in H that does not appear in Rd (e.g., the wage rate),1 it
is possible to estimate the Hd function from the reduced form probability
that the consumer works if the sample at hand contains both workers and nonworkers.

All

of the tests for the presence or absence of fixed costs that have been

conducted within the Cogan framework have taken the Heck.n (1974a) specif i—
cation given by equations (13) and (14) as the baseline model of labor supply

without fixed costs. This model assnes a strict proportionality relationship
between the H and the H —

equations (i.e., between the

and the

indices).

The simple Heckman specification of the labor supply curve may be drawn as

BB' in Figure 2. The intercept of the function is the log of the reservation

—19—

wage.

The key point of Cogans analysis is that with fixed money costs of

work, the labor supply function looks like CC'Ct. The log reservation wage
is higher than 3, a working consumer works at least Rd hours, and the labor
supply

function is above the Heckman function (because leisure is assumed to

be a normal good). If CC'Ct' is the true labor supply function, and the linear

into two regions: a work region and a no work region. The boundary point for
;he region is given by J* which satisfies

V(R—F, W, *) = U(R, T, v*)

Preferences are defined so that for v >

v the consumer works (i.e.,

V(R—P, W, v) > U(R, T, v)), and for v -C .u* the consumer does not work (i.e.,
V(R—F, W, v) < U(R, 2', v)).
For each set of parameters (of V and U) and given R, W, and his assumed

function for F, Hausman writes

A corunon set of parameters generate U and V. Hausman is able to estimate
all of the parameters of the functions, and hence can generate all of the
labor supply parameters, including income and substitution parameters, using

only participation data. He is able to extract as much information as Cogan
using less data because he assumes that the same linear labor supply function

applies to the entire preference map, whereas Cogan uses a linear specification

—22—

only as an

approximation for the labor supply function for workers. However,

given hours of work data,

his

procedure products no more

information than the

Cogan procedure.
Two key assumptions in hausman's

model

not needed in Cogan's, are

(1) fixed costs components are perfectly predicted by measured variables, and
(2) data on wage rates are available for all individuals in the sample
(including nonworkers). -

If either of these assumptions is violated, a more

involved procedure is required which amounts to solving for u* given the

unobserved components of F and of W and integrating over both these unobserved
components.

While it

is conceivable that Rausman's

first

assumption concerning

perfect measurability of F is true, his second requirement concerning the
availability of data on offer wages for nonworkers is surely violated for
the

most data sets. We dater discussion of the consequences of not being able
to observe wages for some individuals until Section V, where we develop a
general framework for dealing with such unobservables.

IV. Labor Spp_1y Models with Progressive Taxes

In this section we extend the simple model of hours of work without

fixed costs outlined in Section II to incorporate progressive taxes. In
contrast to the models of labor supply discussed above where there are two

possible states of the world (Le., work or no work), here we consider a
multistate model. Although this extended model cannot be readily applied
to the regressive tax case, it provides the essential ingredients required
to analyze the general. case.

Provided that the tax function facing the consumer generates a
continuously differentiable strictly convex constraint set, the introduction

of taxes into the model poses few analytical difficulties.1 Define after—tax

A consumer may occupy any one of four states of the world in this model

of taxes. Each state corresponds to a different kink or segment of the

budget constraint. A consumer who does not work is at kink point a2 which
constitutes state 1. A consumer who chooses to work, on the other hand, may
be on segment R2Z, or at kink point 1, or on segment ZN, which constitute

states 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A consumer in state 2 faces a net marginal

is a crucial implicit assumption in the preceding estimation

procedures:

hours of work are not measured with error, so measured hours

reflect true or desired hours. If this is not so, data on hours of work do
not suffice to allocate individuals to the correct branch of the budget

constraint. The state of the world a consumer occupies can no longer be
directly observed, and we confront a discrete data version of an errors in

variables problem. If we use data on H to assign individuals to various
states of the world, the ordered probit estimates the wrong flu) functions.

Suppose that true hours of work, U, and measured hours, which we denote by

senting measurement error which is distributed independently of H and all

in equation (37) and forming variables using F(',) for the second stage regression),

one should estimate equation (37) directly by nonlinear least squares,

The labor supply functions associated with states 1 and 3 are

the unconditional expected value of hours of work by making the appropriate

substitutions.
Substituting thisnew expression for E(E) into the regression equation
given by (38) creates an estimating equation for labor supply which allows
wages to be endogenous and which does not require that wage offer .data be

available for all observations. This new specification can be estimated
using the nonlinear least—squares procedure described above. To identify

V. A General Treatment of Taxes and Labor Supply

This section formulates a model of hours of work that allows for

regressive as well as progressive taxes. Here we develop a methodology to
handle cases where local marginal. comparisons do not fully characterize

labor supply behavior following suggestions by Burtless and Hausman (1978),
Bausman (1979), and Wales and Woodland (1979).

A regressive tax scheme leads to a budget set that is not convex.

Figure 4 displays the case we consider here? A marginal tax rate of CA
applies to the branch R2S, and a lower marginal rate C3

If a consumer is at an interior equilibrium on either segment R2S or

minimized with respect to the parameters of f(v) and the parameters of

the utility function (which, of course, are also parameters of the labor

parameters of the preference function. Thus

algorithm that determines the parameters of the model.

Assuming normally

maximum likelihood criterion.

features of Hausman's model in Section III on fixed costs, we will not

The result is inconsistent estimates of the parameters of the

The analyses of Burtless-Hausman and ifausman depend crucially on

in this case the sample space of v cannot be simply partitioned into regions
associated with equilibrium along different branches.

In

contrast to the above studies, Wales and Woodland (1979) do

not allow

f or unmeasured random differences in consumer1s "tastes." tn particular, the

distributton of 'i is assumed to be degenerate at a single point. Thjs implies
that the direct and the indirect preference functions and the labor supply

they reduce to tJ(X, I., Za), V(R, W, Zc4 and

By

searching over

potential values of the parameters of the preference function, one chooses

the set of values that minimizes the above least squares criterion. In

—49—

computing the value of this

criterion

(for a given set of parameter values),

the following procedure is used to choose the labor supply function (i.e.,
E(E)) relevant for each consumer.
Given the functional form for preferences, the exogenous variables of
the model (i.e., a consumer's measured characteristics), and values for the
parameters of the preference function, one can compute the utility of the

consumer at each point of the budget constraint—in particular, along each
branch and at each kink point (including the no—work point R2). By checking
utility on each branch and verifying the existence of an interior solution,
and by checking utility at each kink, one can literally solve the consumer's

ma.mization problem by choosing that labor supply function associated with
the highest utility. For each set of values for the parameters of the
utility

function, it is possible to calculate the unique equilibrium

position, either interior or corner, for each consumer. As the parameter
values change, the computed equilibrium hours of work changes.
When taxes are progressive (the only case Wales—Woodland consider),

this procedure boils down to the following algorithm. For each value of a,
one can compute the hours of work implied for each branch using the labor

supply function associated with that branch implied by Roy's Identity.

Thus, for the first branch (i.e., state 2) hours of work are given by
If the predicted H(2) ties in the interval (0, HI, the consumer's equilibrium

omitted variables in the model. Moreover, the model assumes that all
consumers have the same a.

These are strong assumptions. If there are such omitted variables, or
if a differs across consumers, the Wales—Woodland procedure generates
inconsistent parameter estimates because their procedure can allocate

consumers to the wrong branch of the budget constraint. Surprisingly, less
restrictive assumptions that allow for random differences in unmeasured
traits affecting "tastes" may lead to a simpler estimation scheme, such as
the one proposed by 3urtless and Hausman outlined above.

Conclusion

The index function framework forms the basis for

much of the recent work on labor supply. The use of this framework provides
a convenient approach for the estimation of hours of work functions when
budget constraints consist of several segments and kink-s. The methodology

presented in the last section is the most general. It not only admits both
convex and non—convex constraint sets, it also allows for the endogenèity

The Performance of Various Estimators in

of sample selection bias. The model they consider is a variant of Heckntan

of Amemiya (method ZA which is one-Newton step toward the likelihood

optimum from the initial consistent Amemiya estimator) is badly

estimates that are badly biased.

Essentially the same results are found for estimators that use

the entire sample (see Table 2). OLS is badly biased. Maximum likelihood (method 4) generates estimates quite close to the true values.
Two stage methods are less precise in generating parameter estimates.

performance of these estimitors in the presence of other model misspeciiications, but by analogy with the findings in the simultaneous equation

Footnotes

S.ection II

1For .expositional simplicity, we abstract from endogenous wages in

the statistical analysis presented below. This assumption is not essential
to the analysis.

= 0 for nonworkers-, it is straightforward to verify that
efining
the partial derivative of expected hours with respect to W from equation (11)
exceeds the mean value of B in the population. Defining ER = 0 for non—
workers, if leisure is a normal good the partial derivative of expected hours

with respect to R is smaller than the mean value of H in the population.
3To simplify notation, we supress Z2 (i.e., a consumer's measured char-

acteristics) as an argument of the functions U(•), M(•) and H(•).

Section III

1Recall that we are assuming that W is exogenous and is available for
each individual in the sample exposition. Cogan (1979) allows for endogenous
wages and his approach does not require wage data for nonworkers.
2Because of the assumptions about functional forms, any set of exogenous
variables, including those that enter the utility function in their own right,
serve to identify the effect of fixed costs on hours of work. Thus, as a
consequence of his functional form, Hausman does not require the exclusion
restriction needed by Cogan to identify the effect of fixed costs on labor
supply.

Section LV
11n this section, we abstract from the very important problem that true
taxes are not measured by published tax schedules1 even schedules that carefully set out exemptions and deductions. If consumers spend real resources
to avoid paying taxes, such tax avoidance costs are properly considered as
part of the effective tax. With the exception of preliminary work of Gould
(1979), this problem has not received attention in the literature.
1

lnstruments will be available provided that variables appearing in the
wage function do not appear in the structural labor supply function. Such
variables are valid instruments.
3The procedure suggested by Hall (1973) and Rosen (1976) that evaluates
the marginal tax rates and intercept terms at a standard number of hours of
work for everyone in the sample, generates inconsistent parameter estimates
because V and E — E'H are evaluated at the wrong point.
4However, we have no guarantee in this problem that the constraint set
will be so characterized. See Rosen (1974).
5pellechio (1979) proposes estimating a model with kiniced convex
constraints in essentially this fashion.

related by the equation

where the last line follows from the independence assumption of ii and a.
71t is clear that one need not rigidly chain the parameters of the hours
of work function to the F functions to secure identification. Thus, one
could estimate the parameters of equation (37) by restricting the parameters
of the P and X functions to be the same, and not exploiting the theory to
generate the relationship between these parameters and a1, a2, and a3.
However, even though the model is formally identified, it is likely that
parameter estimates obtained by this procedure would be imprecisely estimated.
Exploiting all the restrictions of the theory requires making strong assumptions about functional form. But if these assumptions are not made, parameter
estimates are likely to be imprecise.
8Notice that the arguments t42, W4, and

each depend on W.

Section V
SC,eneralization to more than two branches involves no new principle.
Constraint sets like R2SZ are couon in negative income tax experiments and
in certain social programs.
2The kink at S is not treated as a state of the world because there is
not a positive probability that a consumer will be at this point if the
"taste" component v follows a continuous density. In fact, for most
preference functions, point S can never be an equilibriums
3Hausm.an (1979) introduces and estimates a wage equation, but, as we
discuss later in this section, his estimation procedures do not properly
treat unobserved components of wages.
