Aspects of the Current Account Behavior
of OECD Economies

ABS TRACT

This essay examines some aspects of capital flows within the OECD,

and outlines a framework for analyzing current account movements. In both
the theoretical and empirical sections, I argue for the importance of in—

cluding investment and growth in analyses of the current account. I present
empirical evidence confirming that shifts in investment rates explain a

large part of recent OECD current account behavior. In addition, the links
in theory and practice between exchange rates and the current account are

scrutinized. A link between current account deficits and depreciation
is evident for the large OECD economies, but not for many smaller European

economies. It appears that the exchange rate behavior in the smaller economies
can be explained by specific exchange rate policies in these economies.

competing theories about the links

of exchange rate movements to the current account that have not
yet been

sorted out empirically. Most

fundamentally, there is doubt about the basic

degree of capital mobility, with some (like Feldstein and llarioka [1981]),

arguing that national capital markets are highly segmented, and others
(lilçe Harberger [1980]) arguing that high international capital mobility

effectively equalizes rates of return in disparate financial centers.
Harberger [1980] recently bemoaned this professional "schizophrenia"
(p.331) in thinking about capital

flows, indicating that it points to

"a genuine ignorance on our collective part of how the world capital market

works. U'!

This

essay examines some aspects of capital flows within the OECD,

and outlines a framework for analyzing current account movements. In
both the theoretical and empirical sections, I argue for the importance of
including investment and growth in analyses of:the current account, in
contrast to much recent work which emphasizes

savings (but not investment)

decisions in current account determination. I present empirical evidence
• confirming that shifts in investment rate explain a large part of recent
OECD current account behavior.

In addition, the links in theory and practice between exchange rates

and the current account are scrutinized. There has been amazingly little
evidence brought to bear on the basic assertion that exchange rate depreciation
is correlated with current account deficits, and appreciation with surpluses.

2

The assertion •is made, but not tested, in Kouri and Macedo [1980], for

example. The hypothesized link holds up well for the larger OECD economies
and not for a number of smaller European economies characterized by large

deficits

and exchange rate appreciation in the 1970s. But on closer

scrutiny, the exchange rate behavior in the smaller countries can be
• explainedby their specific exchange rate policies. For these countries,

a link is found between deficits and rising nominal interest rates rather
than depreciating currencies.

An Overview of Current Account Behavior: 1960—1979

The broad outlines of current account behavior for fourteen OECD countries

may be gleaned from Table 1. From the final line of the Table, we see the well
known fact that the OECD as a whole went into deficit upon the 1973 oil price

hike, after a decade-and-one-half of aggregate surpluses. Even at the point
of deepest deficits, though, the ratio of the current account to gross national
product, CA/GNP, for the fourteen countries in the aggregate never fell below
-

.005 during 1974 to 1979. Note that the smaller countries have

consistently

run deficits since 1960, and that CA/GNP worsened after 1973 considerably more
for this group than for the larger countries, a fact which we will take up
soon.

The position of a country as a capital importer (i.e., with a current

account deficit) or exporter is remarkably steady over time, and is also
tied closely with economic size, The largest economies (by total GNP),
Germany, Japan, and the United States, have been fairly consistent capital

exporters, at least until the large U.S. deficits of 1977 and 1978. With
the exception of Sweden, the small countries have all been capital importers

for twenty years, with remarkable consistency. For the six small countries
excluding Sweden, during 1961—79, there are only 10 observations of surplus

of a total of 114 annual observations. The

proportion of surplus years

between 1960 and 1979 is shown in the last column of Table 1.

Of the large

countries, only Canada is consistently in deficit; of the small, none is
typically in surplus.

An indicator of the persistence of surpluses and deficits across years
is given by the correlation of CA/CNP for the list of countries across

subperiods. Between 1960—65 and 1966—73, the correlation for thirteen
countries (excluding France) is .81. For the periods l966-73 and 1974—79,

4

the correlation is r =

0.72,

Also, the absolute magnitude and variability of CA/GNP is negatively

related to economic size. For the group of large countries as a whole,
the 1960—79 range of CA/CNP is 0.004 to —0.004, while for the small countries,

the range is 0.003 to —0.044. The standard deviation of CA/GNP for the
large eight economies is 0.003, much less than 0.011 for the smaller

countries. This same point was made by Harberger [1980], using the ratio
of CA to gross investment i rather than to CNP. The result probably
reflects the fact that small countries are truly "small" in international
capital markets, and can borrow and lend internationally at a fairly fixed
interest rate, while larger economies face an upward sloping schedule of

international funds. We return to this point later in the paper.
Note that the deficits are a substantial fraction of gross domestic

investment in many of the countries. For the smaller countries as a group,
international capital inflows accounted for more than eleven per cent of
the

funds for gross domestic investment during 1974—79. This ratio is an

astonishing

22.6 per

cent for Norway; Norway's deficits, we shall note

reflect international borrowing to finance Norway's North Sea oil

development.

My regression analysis to date has focused more on the sources of
shifts

in the current account, than on the reasons for persistent Imbalances,

though the theoretical discussion below clearly
explain

decades

points to factors which can

long periods of. international borrowing. Current account flows over
can be expected between countries with similar tastes but unequal

marginal productivities of capital, either because of different technologies,
a

different industrial mix, or different initial endowments of capital.

Alternatively, CA imbalances can occur between countries with similar
technologies, but differing intertemporal consumption preferences (i.e.

5

savings behavior). If differing technologies or capital endowments are
the main source of capital flows, we would expect to see persistent

deficits in economies with high investment rates. This is indeed the case
for the large versus small OECD economies. The I/GNP ratio for the smaller
six countries is consistently three to four percentage points above the

same ratio among the large eight economies. For our three subperiods,
these rates are given by:

On a country—by—country.. basis, Japan is the significant exception to

the negative link of CA/GNP and I/GNP. The Japanese CA/GNP ratio is usually
positive although the investment share I/CNP is the highest among the

fifteen countries studied. My guess is that Japanese capital controls

until the late l970s explain the low CA/GNP ratio. In the absence of
controls, Japan's extraordinary savings rates would likely have led to

large CA surpluses, and smaller investment rates. Since the capital
controls effectively bottled up the savings domestically, in spite of
Japanese home interest rates much below international levels, CA/GNP was
reduced and I/GNP was raised..

As a further check on the investment relation, I ran a cross—section
of CA/GNP and I/GNP for a number of subperiods, with and without Japan

included. These are shown as regressions 1 to 3 in Table 2.

The

correlation between investment rates and CA/GNP is particularly strong
after 1970.

6

If

differing endowments of capital, rather than differences in techno—

logies or product mix are behind the persistent differences in investment
rates, the international flow of capita' would be from high per capita

income countries to lower per capita income countries. Surprisingly,
the

simple relationship between CA/GNP and real per capita income is

negative, not positive, and extremely weak, as shown in regression 4.
Other writers have found a weak or negative relationship between per
capita income and the current account balance in examining flows between

developed and developing countr1es.' Apparently low per capita incomes
are, as much evidence of low total factor productivity as of low endowments
of capital per head.

]t is often thought that the recent pattern of current account
deficits and surpluses reflects in part the distribution of oil import

dependence among nations. I have argued at length in Sachs [1981] that
the links between oil dependence and deficits were rather weak in the

1970s, for good theoretical reasons. As an illustration of this
proposition, regression 5 and 6 show CA/GNP as a function of I/GNP and

basic explanation

here is that while countries with higher oil dependence, cet.

suffered greater real income losses after the oil price increases in the
197 Os, real income losses

se do not lead to international borrowing.

In principle, it is crucial whether the income losses are perceived as
permanent or temporary; only in the latter case will deficits be greatest

in countries with the largest income losses. A second part of the explanation

7

is that oil—rich countries, such as Canada, Norway and the U.K., experienced
a sharp rise in investment expenditures on energy resource development,
and these expenditures contributed to current account deficits.

The links betweer investment and the current account are even

stronger when we consider shifts In international borrowing. With great
consistency, the countries that had the largest increase in CA deficits
in the 1970s were those with the sharpest rise in gross investment.

As seen in regression 7, [I/GNp)7179 — C I/GNP)6170] accounts for 66
per cent of the variance in [(CA/GNP)7179 —

(CA/GNP)6170}.

Since the

coefficient on investment is —0.65, a one per cent rise in the investment
rate was financed on average 0.65 per cent by foreign capital inflows, and

only0.35 per cent by gross national savings.
In principle, exogenous. increases in domestic savings rates, in

addition to shifts in investment, might explain the recent current account

behavior. Indeed the theoretical section stresses that a great variety
of shocks can potentially account for CA movements. Our empirical task is
to sort out which of the possible shocks is the likely candidate for having

moved the current account in any particular period, and here the evidence
strongly points to investment shifts as opposed to savings shifts as the

mijor influence. As seen in regression 8 in Table 2, shifts in national
savings rates are virtually uncorrelated with CA shifts between the decades

of the 1960s and 1970s. TheR2 is only 0.01, and A(S/CNP) is statistically
insignificant.

On a country—by-country time series basis, we again find a large
role for shifts in investment rates in CA swings and an apparently smaller role

for shifts in savings rates. The simple correlation (not shown) during 1961—1979
between (detrended) CA/GNP and (detrended) I/GNP Is negative in thirteen of the

8

fourteen coun€ries, with r < —.50 in six cases. The (detrended) savings
rates, as expected, are positively correlated to (detrended) CA/GNP, for
twelve of the fourteen countries, though. the correlation is generally

weaker; r >

.50 in three countries.

An Overview of Exchange Rate—Current Account Linkages: 1973—80

With the great extent of theorizing about current account effects
on the exchange rate, there has been remarkably little attempt to verify

competing hypotheses. Before we explore what theory says the links

should be, let's examine what the links have been. While there are
many potential hypotheses to test, I will focus on the view that deficit
countries will have depreciating nominal and real exchange rates, and

surplus countries the opposite. With respect to the current account
influences on the nominal exchange rate, Kouri has dubbed this view the
"accelerationist" hypothesis.

Proponents of this view, of course, recognize that domestic financial
policies can upset any simple link between deficits and depreciation, but

argue that the hypothesis is supported empirically, in spite of potential

complications. As Kouri and Macedo [1981] write:
Allowing for the effects of intervention, changes in interest rates
and so on there is still a clear tendency of currencies o surplus
countries to appreciate continuously and those of deficit countries
to depreciate continuously.
[referring to evidence on the large 7 countries] cumulative
autonomous capital flows have been insufficient to finance the
substantial imbalances that have existed since 1973. Year after
year, furthermore, they have often accentuated the pressure on the
exchange rate of deficit countries....

Table 3 offers the basic data to test this proposition. The exchange
rate for each country is a geometric weighted average of the country's

bilateral exchange rates with the other countries, where the weights are

country shares in total international trade during 1968—73. The real
exchange rate EP*/P Is similarly calculated, using the wholsale price

10

index as the price variable, Among the large countries, there is a clear
pattern of nominal and real exchange rate appreciatior among surplus
countries (Germany, Japan, the Netherlands) and depreciation among the

rest (Canada, France, Italy, U.K., and U.S.). The correlations of both
nominal and real exchange rate changes with (CA/GNP) are negative for all

of the large countries except Canada. Regression equations of %(E)
on lagged %A(E) and (CA/GNP), shown in Table 4, tell a similar story.
Interestingly, the pattern seems to break down for many of the smaller
countries, where we observe large deficits together with nominal and

,rea1 exchange rate appreciations. Norway, for example, had deficits of
over 10 per cent of GNP in 1976, accompanied by real and nominal exchange

rateappreciation of over 6 per cent throughout the year. Austria,
similarly,

experienced real appreciat.on in the midst of seven consecutive

years of deficit. Nor is there a negative correlation between exchange
rate movements and the current account on an annual or quarterly basis.
In

almost all cases the correlations are positive or weakly negative, and

the regression coefficients are statistically insignificant.
Table 5 packages the data in a slightly different format, by simply
counting for each country the number of observations in which surpluses
and deficits are associated ¶.ith nominal and real appreciations and

depreciations. An

statistic is used to test for independence of the

current account position ana the direction of exchange rate movement.

Again, there is a clear pattern of nominal and real depreciation cum
deficits in the large countries, versus nominal and real appreciation cum

deficits in many of the smaller countries. There are as many observations
of

deficits with appreciation as with depreciation for the smaller

countries.
What explains this difference in behavior? Clearly, a major step

11

towards explanation is a difference in exchange regimes in the small and

large countries. Of the large countries, the U.S., U.K., Canada and

Japan have been floating throughout theentire period 1973—80, and France
and

Italy floated for most of the period.±i Germany has been at the

center of a series of cooperative exchange arrangements, first the "Snake"
and since March 30, 1979, the European Monetary System

(EMS). The Dutch

guilder has remained fairly closely linked to the Deutsehemark, first in
the

Snake and now in the EMS.

The smaller countries, with the exception of Australia, have all
maintained

some linkage to a group of currencies, either formally as

members of the Snake

infoma1ly

and EMS (Belgium, Denmark, Norway for a period), or

by pegging to a basket of currencies (Austria, Finland, Norway,

Since the theory of nominal., exchange rate movements and the

account is predicated on a floating regime, it is perhaps not
surprising that.the smaller countries fail to support the "accelerationist"

With respect to real exchange rates, the difference in exchange

and small countries. Most of the links between CA/GNP and P/EP* that

12

these countries official reserves increased in almost all of the years

between 1973 .nd 1979. With respect to interest rates, e can check the
imperfect capital mobility assumption by examining whether interest rate
differentials with Deutschemark assets tended to increase during deficit
years for the currencies pegged to the DM (Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands,

and Norway until December 12, 1978). As seen in Table 6, there is a clear
pattern of rising differentials during the deficit years for all of the

countries. Correlations of annual changes in interest rate differentials
with CA/Y show a negative link for each of the countries except Denmark
(see Table 6 ).

With

this brief overview,' we turn to the theoretical section. The

goal is to embed international capital flows in a model that can explain:
(1) the persistence of current accouni deficits and surpluses,

large role of investment shifts in current account movements,

(2) the
(3) the

co—occurrence of deficits and exchange depreciation in floating exchange

rate economies, and (4) the ambiguous links between the real exchange
rate and the current account.

A Theoretical Model of the Current Account

In a series of recent papers, I have developed an infinite—horizon,
two-country model of the current account under assumptions of economic
growth with far-sighted households, value—maximizing competitive firms,

and efficient asset markets. Since an analytical solution to the model
is

apparently beyond reach, I

to

have examined the model with computer

In this section I sketch a two—period, one country analog

the model, that preserves the basic structure and results of the more

complete analysis. The strength of the approach is that it illustrates
how specific exogenous shocks induce particular correlations between key

variables, such as CA with P/EP and I.
Most recent models analyzing the links of the current account to
the exchange rate and to other variables, have failed to properly model

current account behavior. Typically, the current account balance is
written as a simple function of the exchange rate and current financial
wealth (as in Kouri [1981], Dornbusch and Fischer [19801, and Rodriguez

(1981]). There is almost never any treatment of physical capital accumulation, and its relationship to wealth holdings. Moreover, the current
account equation gives inadequate results for many types of questions,
since the savings behavior that is implied by the equations is not

credible. Thus, in Dornbusch and Fischer [1980] for example, consumption
is not a function of human wealth, or the discounted value of domestic

output. We will see that many disturbances affect the current account
precisely by altering the discounted value of domestic output, and such

channels are necessarily ignored in the Dornbusch—Fischer model. In
Rodriguez [1980], all anticipated disturbances to the economy have an

14

impact

on the current account onlj through real balance effects, probably

the least important of all the relevant channels.
Failure to treat investment and capital accumulation is not an

innocent simplification, if we are to draw real—world conclusions from

our models of exchange rate behavior. By excluding all wealth accumulation
except in the form of foreign assets, these models set up a one—to—one
link between the change in wealth, and the current account balance. With
domestic investment, however, real wealth may be increasing or decreasing

along with CA surpluses and deficits. Again, in Dornbusch'-FisCher, the
exchange—rate links to the current account are mediated entirely by changes

in wealth. A deficit signals declining wealth and thus declining money
demand cmii depreciation. With investment explicitly

treated, a CA deficit

may easily be matched with ris wealth and appreciation, particularly
if the deficit reflects an investment boom.
It is not enough to add investment as a component of expenditure to
arrive at a general theory of the current

include

account. In addition, we must

the returns to investment as part of the wealth of firms'

shareholders and allow that wealth to affect current consumption decisions.
This

general equilibrium structure is readily built into the simple model

now presented.

We consider an economy which produces a single final output, with price

P. The economy is small in the world capital market, so that domestic
agents can borrow and lend in foreign
rate r*.

denominated bonds at a fixed interest

The domestic output is an imperfect substitute in consumption

for a foreign final good that has

world price P and domestic price EP*,

where E is the exchange rate. The home country

is assumed to be small in

its import market, so that P* is exogenous, and may be considered fixed.

15

All international capital flows take place in one—period foreign
denominated bonds; I

denote

the end—of—period domestic net holdings of these

bonds as Z. Domestic equity is internationally tradeable, and is a perfect
substitute for Z, so that the required return on equity, in foreign

currency units, Is r*. The only outside asset denominated in domestic
currency is non—interest bearing money, M. Inside domestic bonds have
interest

rate i,

which may differ from the return on foreign assets

because of the portfolio preferences of domestic agents. Neither domestic
money nor the domestic bond is held by foreigners.
In assuming perfect substitutability of home equity and foreign

(or foreign equity), but imperfect substitutability of domestic

bonds

and foreign bonds, I am deviating from a typical assumption that home

assets are better substitutes with each other than each is with foreign

assets. Of course, there is no theoretical assumption that is "right"
in this regard: relative asset substitutability depends on the nature of
underlying

stochastic shocks in the economy, and on the structure of

trade. Kouri [19811 has pursued the hard work of linking an array of
exogenous disturbances to optimal asset demand functions in a general

equilibrium model. We are still far off from concrete results in this
area for open—economy macroeconomic models, and I do not pursue the
ambitious task of solving endogenously for the structure of portfolio
choices.

Households make their consumption decisions to maximize a two-period,

I will assume that

households own the entire domestic capital stock, and that all international

capital flows are chages in Z. There are no initial holdings of Z. In
this model, the issue of portfolio composition between equity and Z is
unimportant since equities and Z earn the same rate of return. All that

matters Is that at the beginning of the first period, domestic households

own the claims to domestic firms. Human wealth is the present value of

Our goal is to solve for CA1, the first period current account,

and to

relate CA1 to the parameters of the model, and to E2/E1 and 112/111, the

rates of nominal and real exchange rate change.

The first—period current account

by the household budget constraint. From (2), we have

consumption as a function of W, and in (5), we have the definition of W.
Thus, substituting in (10), we can write CA1 as

I

—

(2+5)(l+r*)

Of course this expression is not yet in final form, since 711, 1T2 Q2 and
I are endogenous, and indeed Q2

is

a function of I. Still, (11) points

up the three fundamental determinants of current account balance. The
first term on the right hand side shows that CA1 is an increasing function
of the difference between the world interest rate and the rate of time
preference (r*_cS). This difference determines the desire to save income
for later consumption. In the Continuous time version of the present
model, t1 =

(r*_i5)W, so that r*_tS in fact determines the path of overall

wealth accumulation.
The second term might be described as capturing the role of transitory
fluctuations in current account determination. When export demand falls te.rnporarily

in a given year, pulling down real income, households dissave not because

they are poor but because their transito income is less than permanent
income. In the attempt to smooth the income stream, households borrow in
early periods if the real income stream is rising, and lend Initially if
the real income stream is falling. Thus, CA1 decreases with (rr2Q2 —

1T1Q1).

The third term highlights the special role of investment in current

account determination. Since CA1 =

— (C +711C + Ii), the effects on

CA1 of an exogenous shock that causes I to rise depend on the effects of

the shock on C +iT1C. To the extent that the shock has no effect on

l1+ir1C + C -Q1)

will

and thus

rise one—for—one with the investment

boom. This is precisely the case for a rise in investment projects
that just earn the market rate of return, r*. If domestically owned
firms retain earnings to invest in projects with return r*, households

dissave by the same amount, keeping C1 constant. Though the first—period
dividend flow to households is reduced by the rise in I, households
'!pierce the corporate veil," and dissave. They effectively substitute

the firms' investment for their household savings, so that total absorption

is increased one—for—one with I.
Sometimes a rise in I also signals "good news" that raises household
wealth. For instance an anticipated rise in future world demand for

domestic output raises both I and W. In this case, both

+ C and

I rise, and the deficit worsens more than one—for—one with the increase

in I.
To solve for the reduced form for CA1, and

and 1T2 we must first

determine wealth W in terms of the underlying parameters: Y, Y, r*, K1,
ô. A couple of facts are helpful here, First, by the assumption of
Cobb—Douglas technology, (l+r*)K2 =

These bulky equations are in fact easy to interpret. To start with
CA1, a rise in

necessarily

cet.

improves the current account.. and

an anticpated rise in Y necessarily worsens the current account. In
both cases, the rise in world demand causes an increase in wealth, and in

11, 71, and Il• But when Y rises, households save some of the first
period income gain (i.e. run a surplus) to spread the consumption windfall
across time; when

rises, households borrow against the anticipated

future windfall to enjoy higher consumption in the initial period.
Since an increase in Y* in either period leads to a demand increase in
both periods, ir and 112 both rise. Also, I rises, since rr2Q2 is increased,

and I is linear in second—period real income (see (12)).
An equal rise in
the benchmark case r* =

and

5,

has an ambiguous effect on CA1. But in

a "permanent" rise in Y (i.e. dY =

dY)

leads

to a deficit on CA1! This is sharply counter to the conventional view

22

that the current account :Linproves when demand shifts permanently towards

a country. But the reason is clear enough. Higher Y* increases investment

negative. In a model without

1,

=

= 5, a rise in 'f* has no effect on the current account. Rather, iT1

and 112 rise in equal proportion, and the value of exports and imports
rise by the same amount.

Finally, note that CA1 is an increasing function of the initial
endowment

of capital. Higher K1, cet. p., reduces 11/K1, which in turn

induces an

improvement in the current account. All other things equal,

capital flows should lead from highly

capital—endowed economies to

poorly capital—endowed economies.
What can we say about the links of CA1 and real

depreciation?

We can easily verify

current account differences reflect taste differences, high deficit

countries will experience real depreciation. On the other hand, for two
countries that are identical except for future demand 'f*2, the opposite

conclusion is reached. Higher Y unambiguously leads to higher 112/ill,

and to a fall in CA1. Similarly, a temporary decline In world demand

(dY < 0; dY = 0) causes 112/ill to rise and CA1 to fall. First—period
deficits are again associated with real exchange rate appreciation.

If

the countries differ only in K1 the effects on the relative ¶2'il are

ambiguous. In general, with

and

r*, faster growing countries

Since growth in Q2/Q1 is inversely

23

related

to K1, we should expect, cet. par., that countries with initially

poor endowments of capital to experience relative large real exchange

rate depreciation over time. As noted above, such countries will also,
cet. par., have larger CA deficits.

At this point, we can bring in the monetary side to find the links

between CA1 and nominal exchange rates. The monetary subsystem was given

in (6) and (7). Noting that P1 =

(E1P*)ir1

that 6 measures the substitutability of home and foreign denominated

factors affect the exchange

and N2 can move E1 and E2 with no effects on CA1, it1,

under the assumptions of the model. For given N1, N2, real

exchange rate appreciations and depreciations tend to cause nominal exchange

rate appreciations and depreciations. Thus, as Stockman [1980] has indicated,
much of the observed correlation between changes in E and EP*/P may be due

24

to common responses to underlying shocks. This is in contrast to the more
typical assumption that

changes

in E cause EP*/P to move because of

nominal price rigidity.

We also see a direct effect of CA imbalance on the nominal exchange

rate,

working through the Kouri—Branson portfolio demand channel. Thus,

even if a deficit economy is on a path of real appreciation, rising output,
and stable money supply, it may experience nominal depreciation as its

net indebtedness grows over time. Of course only in the case of perfect
capital mobility, f= 0, does this effect go away.
Thus, to sum

up,

a deficit country will surely experience nominal and

real depreciation if the deficit is caused by high5. If, on the contrary,
the deficits arise from a path of increasing Y', then T2/1T1 will be

large, and the nominal exchange rate will tend to appreciate unless -fis also
large.

25

Extensions and Conclusions
There are at least three important directions for extending the

theoretical framework described above. hese are: a multiperiod or
infinite—horizon analysis with more general functional forms; the introduction of capital control restrictions as a policy instrument; and an
explicit treatment of portfolio considerations in a setting with uncertainty and risk averse agents.
The first is, in a sense, easy and already accomplished (cf. Sachs

[1982, forthcoming], Lipton and Sachs [1980]). An infinite horizon, two—
country version of the model here has been developed and analyzed through

simulation. There is no reason to stick with particular functional forms as
in the model in this paper once recourse is made to computer simulation.
Thus, in work now underway with Michael Bruno, a three—sector infinite—

horizon model of the U.K. is being developed, that incorporates a complete
input—output structure in the production technology.

The second extension, to explicitly treat restrictions on capital
mobility, would allow a more accurate depiction of the degree of capital

mobility among the OECD economies. Most of the major economies have or
continue to resort to restrictions on international capital flows to help

achieve current account and other objectives. Foreign access to the U.S.
bond market was effectively closed until 1974, and until much more

recently in Japan. Our understanding of theoretical aspects of capital
controls is still rather limited, and controls are rarely brought in explicitly .into theoretical work.

The third direction is by far the hardest. To this point we have
very little feel for the relevant sources of risk that lead to the imperfect

substitutability of assets across national borders. Our models will have
radically different conclusions if imperfect substitutability is •based on

26

inflation risk, default risk, political risk, or hedging behavior against

still other types of real disturbances. It seems that the most fruitful w2y
to proceed here is to build small theortical models, with attention to a
limited number of key stochastic elements, so that portfolio behavior may
be derived endogenously.
