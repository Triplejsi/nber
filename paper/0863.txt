February 1982

Rational Expectations and the Foreign Exchange Market

lths

tract

Many models of exchange rate determination imply that movements in

money supplies and demands should result in movements in exchange rates.
Hence, if rational agents are attempting to forecast exchange rate movements,
they should in the first instance forecast movements in the supplies of and

demands for money balances. Furthermore, if these underlying variables follow
some stable autoregressive processes agents should use those processes to

make their forecasts. If we identify the forward rate with the market's
expectation for the future spot rate, rationality of expectations will imply
testable cross-equation restrictions in a joint model of the autoregressions

and exchange rate forecasting equation. This strategy is implemented in the
paper using data on the

UK/$US and DM/$US exchange rates from the recent

floating rate period.

RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

Peter

R. Hartley1
Princeton University
and NBER

In this paper I test the hypothesis that expectations of exchange

rate movements are formed rationally. To do so, I need, in addition to
the hypothesis of rational expectations, a theory of the determinants

of exchange rate movements. I shall first consider a very simple "monetary approach" model of exchange rate determination. A serious defect
of the model considered in this paper is that it ignores the possibility
of a simultaneous determination of the exchange rate along with macro-

economic variables. However, it extends previous models in this genre by
attempting to distinguish the effects of changes in expectations on exchange rates from the effects of changes in underlying determining variables

apart from expectations. Furthermore, it does this in a context where the
assumption of rationality of expectations can be tested.
In the second part of the paper I shall present some results for the
U.S. dollar/German Deutschmark and U.S. dollar/Pound Sterling exchange

rates in the most recent floating rate period. In the final section I

examine a model similar to one studied by Frenkel (l9SI). However, I am
able to test for rationality of expectations where Frenkel could not.

I have chosen to emphasize the test of rationality in the paper for

two reasons. First the test of rationality, unlike the tests of the restrictions implied by the simple monetary model, does not depend on the

validity of the exogeneity assumptions. If we do find a rejection of
the cross equation restrictions implied by rationality this is indeed a
rejection either of the assumption that expectations are formed rationally

2.

or that the forward premium differs from the rationally expected depreci—

ation or appreciation by no more than a constant term. Second, I have
tested two alternative models of exchange rate determination and while
both lead to valid tests of rationality (given our assumption on the for—
ward rate) they do not arise from a single simple model.

I. Simple Monetary Approach Model
Proponents of the monetary approach to exchange rate determination

view the exchange rate as the relative price of two monies. They therefore
argue that variables affecting the supply of and demand for two monies will

affect the rate of exchange between them. Quite a few studies have tested
the monetary approach to exchange rate determination and some of the earlier
ones are collected in Frenkel and Johnson (1978).
Since money is a durable asset it has been argued that expectations
about the values of variables affecting its future supply of demand ("ex—
ogenous"2 variables) will be important determinants of current demand.
Suppose expectations of future movements in exogenous variables are influ—
enced by current movements in the same exogenous variables.3 Movements in
the exogenous variables would then affect money supply and demand directly,

but would also affect expectations and hence money demand. More significantly, it is most probable that anticipated and unanticipated movements
in the exogenous variables will have quite different effects on exchange

rates. Frenkel (1979) has suggested that short run movements in exchange
rates are dominated by the effect of unanticipated movements in the exogenous
variables.

Many previous tests of simple monetary models have included lagged
exogenous variables among the explanatory variables.

Insofar as the just—

3.

ification for including these variables is that they are useful for proxying
expectations, an important source of restrictions on the distributed lags
has been ignored.

The present study focuses on explaining errors in forecasting exchange

rate movements rather than the exchange rate movements themselves. This is
one way (also used in Frenkel (1979)) to separate out the effect of antici-

pated and unanticipated movements in the exogenous variables. Only unanticipated movements in the exogenous variable should lead to unanticipated move-

ments in the exchange rate. Rationality of expectations implies a set of
cross—equation restrictions on distributed lags. The conformity of these
restrictions with the data provides a test of rationality which I shall
implement in this paper.

The statistical theory I shall use derives from a paper by Abel and
Mishkin (1979) and has been applied to a study of bond yields by Mishkin
(1981).

Let S = Txl

Now if expectations are rational then agents should use the process (3)

in forming expectations in (4). In other words we should find
(5)

=

(x—zY)8 + C

To test for rationality of expectations we estimate (3) and (5) jointly
and test for the quality of the y coefficients in the two sets of equations.
An alternative procedure to estimating (3) and (5) jointly would be to

first estimate (3) and then use the residuals from that regression in (5).
The joint estimation is preferred for several reasons:

(i) The two step procedure does not test whether expectations are
optimal linear forecasts given the data on the right hand side
of (3).

5.

(ii) The joint estimation will use information in both (3) and (5)
to estimate

and y and will deliver more efficient estimates

of these parameters.

(iii) It is unlikely that the test statistics derived from the two—
step procedure will be consistent since they do not take account
of the variance—covariance structure in the regression from which
the residuals are derived.

To proceed we need an observable proxy for E(S÷iI), a theory of
exchange rate determination (2) and a forecasting equation (3) for the
right hand variables in (2).

If traders in the forward foreign exchange market were not risk averse

which is an equation of the form (5). To test for rationality of expectations, we can estimate (3)' and (5)' jointly and require that the y
coefficients in equation (5)' equal those in (3)'.
It is important to realize that the

coefficients in (5)' depend

on the forecasting parameters y in (3)', as well as elasticities in the
underlying money demand functions. In particular, therefore, changes in

policy which alter the y parameters in (3)' will alter the

parameters

in (5)'. This is a feature of rational expectations models which has been
emphasized by Lucas.8 In the present context it might make us pessimistic
about the chances of getting precise estimates of the

parameters in (5)'.

If the forecasting equations (3)' have varied over the sample period and
agents have been aware of these changes, then fitting a single time series

over the whole period will produce at least two sources of imprecision in
the estimates of the

parameters. First, there will be errors in the

right hand side variables in (5)'. Second, the "true"

The tests of rationality can be strengthened by estimating the system

(3)' and (5)' jointly for two exchange rates. In this paper, I have jointly
estimated a U.S. do1lar/I sterling equation (5)' along with a U.S. dollar!

German DM equation (5)', If expectations are formed rationally, then the
forecast of U.S. variables agents use to preduct the $/Ja exchange rate should

be the same forecast they use to predict the $/DM exchange rate. Note, however,

that the c's for these two (5)' equations may be correlated. The c's
represent sources of forecast errors apart form errors in forecasting money

and income growths. It is quite likely that the same unaccounted source of
error will affect both exchange rates each period. I report one set of
estimates which do, and another which do not, allow for this correlation

between the c's

Some set of k identifying restrictions on the k elements

in (3)'

and (5)' is needed to identify the beta parameters. The system (3)' and (5)'
cannot be estimated using standard full information maximum likelihood tech-

niques. The covariance matrix must be constrained if we are to get unique
estimates for the

parameters. In addition, unless the covariance matrix

is restricted, in a test of restrictions on the

We want a parsimonious set of forecasting equations (3)' to keep the

number of estimated parameters to a minimum. We cannot get much guidance
from

theory on which lags should be included and which excluded from (3)'.

I regressed each exogenous variable on 12 of its own
lagged

lagged

values and 12

values of the other exogenous variable from the same country. In

all cases this produced white noise residuals. Insignificant variables were
then dropped from the regressions. At each point the residuals were checked
to ensure they were still white noise. The forecasting equations arrived at
in this way were not altered after the joint estimation had been completed.
Appendix 2 sets out the likelihood function for the joint model (3)'
and (5)' for the two exchange rates and discusses the method used to maximize

the likelihood function. If we denote the covariance matrix of the error

Most of the beta coefficients are not significantly different from zero.
However, as noted above, the beta coefficients predicted by the. simple monetary

model will be functions not only of the parameters in the money demand function
but also the parameters in the forecasting equations for money and income growth.
The fact that most of the coefficients are not significantly different from zero

cannot be taken as evidence against the simple monetary model. More explicit
tests of the simple monetary model will be considered in the next section.
When the covariance structure is generalized to model (b), and the log
likelihood function is explicitly maximized,

to be estimated a more parsimonious parameterization for the forecasting

As in Table 1, few of the beta coefficients in Table 2 are significantly

different from zero. Furthermore, the coefficients on errors in forecasting
U.S. money growth changed sign in moving from Table 1 to Table 2. The most
robust beta coefficients appear to be those on German money and income fore-

casting errors. The cross—equation restrictions implied by rationality were
not rejected in the models of either Table 1 or Table 2.

III. Testing the Simple Monetary Model
In Appendix 1, a result from Sargent and Hansen- (1980) is used to

express the 8

coefficients

in (5)' in terms of the forecasting para-

meters y in (3)' and the income elasticities and interest semi—elasticity
of demand for money. As long as we restrict the covariance matrix

E

ye

to be zero, the beta coefficients will be identified and the restrictions
on those coefficients implied by the simple monetary model can be tested.

At the same time, we can recover estimates of the income elasticities and
interest semi—elasticity of demand for money which can be compared with
the values of these same parameters obtained from estimates of money demand
functions.

I attempted to test for the conformity of the simple monetary model

with the data using either the real GNP, or bank clearings divided by the
wholesale price index, as the income variable.9 I also tried estimating

and E

the model imposing the requirement that E

-

be diagonal or leaving

them unconstrained. In all cases I had difficulty getting the algorithms

to converge. The problem appeared to be that the likelihood function was
maximized for values of the interest semi—elasticity of demand for money
(cz3) which were very large so that

from

A =

approached 1. One example
3

these "results" is reproduced in Table 3. Note that these parameter

estimates are not maximum likelihood estimates as the algorithm was still
diverging

at these values.

The results must cast considerable doubt on the ability of the simple
monetary model to adequately account for the data I examined. However, it
should be emphasized again that some of the difficulty might be due to
changes over the period in the stochastic processes (3)' governing the
evolution of the money and income variables.

As a further test of the simple monetary model, I used the term structure

of the forward rate to test an alternative implication of the model. I show
in Appendix 1 that the error in forecasting the change in the exchange rate

monetary model of Appendix 1 and expectations are formed rationally, can be

and a2 are the income

of demand for money in the U.S. and the foreign country (UK

or Germany in our case) while a3 is the common interest semi—elasticity
of the demand for money.
We can get a test of the simple monetary model by estimating (3)',

(5)' and (8) jointly and

then

testing the restrictions on the coefficients

in (8). The values of the unrestricted coefficients in (8) are of interest

in themselves. If the so—called "overshooting hypothesis" is correct
then we might expect to see the coefficients on unanticipated money growth
change sign as the lag increases from 1 to three periods in equation (8).
The results of jointly estimating the equations (3)', (5)' and (8) are

given in Table 4. No adjustments were made for heteroskedasticity. Although
the constraints on the coefficients in (8) are not rejected, it is apparent
that the beta coefficients in the unconstrained version of (8) are estimated

very imprecisely. The results in Table 4 would give one very little confidence that the model (3)', (5)' and (8) is consistent with the data. As
far as the overshooting hypothesis is concerned, most of the coefficients
in the unconstrained version of (8) follow a pattern

/

,/

Exceptions to this pattern are the coefficients on U.S. and German income
in the German 3—month forecasting error equation. Both of these behave
monotonically as a function of the lag but only the coefficients on U.S.
income forecasting errors change sign.

Although this model has a less rigorous theoretical foundation than
the simple monetary model studied in Appendix 1, Frenkel found it was

capable of explaining part of the exchange rate forecasting error
He suggested that interest rates and exchange rates might both be affected

by the same "news." Further, if both bonds and foreign exchange are traded
in efficient financial markets, the time lag between the arrival of the
news and its subsequent effect on prices will be similar in the two markets.

This begs the question as to the exact nature of the news. It also suggests
we should set up a simultaneous equation model where exchange rates and

interest rates are both endogenous variables. Frenkel uses instrumental
variables to cope with the simultaneity problem. I have ignored it. As

above I shall assume that c and v in (8) and (10) are uncorrelated.
On the other hand, I can test for rationality by testing the validity of

the cross equation restrictions on the 5 parameters in (9) and (10).
Note that the validity of this test does not depend on the validity of the

assumption that E(c,v)

E

= 0

In the results reported in Table 5, I used the one—month EurocurrenCY
rates reported in the Harris Trust and Savings Bank Weekly Bulletin for

interest rates. Again I used the rate on the last Friday in each month.

Date limitations prevented me estimating (9) and (10) over the full period

2/72—4/79. I used maximum likelihood estimation as for the simple monetary
model results reported in Table 2.

In contrast to the tests based on the simple monetary model we find some

weak evidence against rationality of expectations in Table 4. Also, it is
rather interesting to note that although the German equation produced more
robust results for the simple monetary model, the UK equation gives more
significant beta coefficients when the simple interest rate model is estimated.

V. Conclusion
We have uncovered very little evidence unfavorable to the hypothesis
that expectations are formed rationally in the foreign exchange market.

18.

However, proponents of a simple monetary model of exchange rate determination

can find little comfort in the results. There is some evidence that a single
simple model may not be satisfactory for explaining all currency movements.

This might be related to the different way monetary policy is conducted in

different countries. If the monetary authorities followed an interest rate
rule then unanticipated innovations in interest rates may provide more relevant information than unanticipated movement in the money stock. The opposite
might be the case for a country which followed a money stock growth rate rule.
If the authorities did not follow any stable rule over the period examined,
then it would be very difficult to test any model of exchange rate determin-

ation. This is just another implication of the Lucas critique of econometric
policy evaluation (Lucas, 1977). Instability in policy over the estimation
period could have been a major factor leading to the very imprecise estimates
of the

parameters found in this paper.

the restrictions on the beta coefficients implied by the simple monetary

the money demand functions will also be obtained and these can be compared
with estimates of these same parameters which have been obtained by other

To simplify the exposition I will use the notation of equations (3)
and (5) in the text rather than the more explicit but more cumbersome
notation of (3)' and (5)'.

We want the likelihood function for the simultaneous system

X = Zy + V

= (X—Zy) +

Let (Xi,.. .

,Xkt,L) be

the lx(k+2) vector of observations on

the endogenous variables at time t and let (Z1,...

In

the more general case where E

an algorithm specified in a paper by Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman (1974).

In both cases, I corrected the residuals for heteroskedasticity using
the time trend procedure outlined by Glesjer and discussed in Johnston (1963).

Initial parameter estImates were obtained and the absolute values of the
residuals were then regressed on a constant and a time trend to get two
parameters

The data of equation I

the Lilly Endowment Fund, the University of Chicago, and Princeton University is gratefully acknowledged.

I shall use the term "exogenous" for these determining variables

for ease of exposition.

Some of them might in

fact be

simultaneously

deter-

mined with money supply and/or demand. This shall be discussed further
below.
3.

This will be true, for example, if the evolution of these exogenous

variables can be explained by a stable low order autoregression and agents
are aware of this fact and form expectations rationally.

9. Bank clearings and the wholesale price indices were obtained from
the International Financial Statistics. I used this variable to capture
the transactions demand for money.

10. Note that the theory implies the error term in equation (8) will
be a moving average. This fact has been ignored in the estimation and will
lead to inefficient estimates of the parameters of the model.

11. See Dornbusch (1976) for example.

F—2.

12. If, for example, partial adjustment parameters were appended to
the present model, a far wider range of estimated lagged effects would be

consistent with the model. However, I would consider that a weakness and
not a strength of the extended model. If one is to postulate a model with
lagged adjustments, it would be preferable to have a theory explaining the
source of the lags so that one could get restrictions on the adjustment
parameters more open to refutation.

13. Frenkel (1978) discusses the use of the relevant price index to

use here. To the extent that purchasing power parity pertains to traded
goods only, (1.1) would also contain terms involving the relative price of
traded to non—traded goods.

14. The functional forms proposed here for the money demand functions
are common in monetary economics and exchange rate literature.

15. Equation (1.5) has been tested previously in quite a few studies
and appears to hold up reasonably well (see for example Frenkel and Levich,
1975, 1977 and Levich L978, 1979).
