April 1982

Measuring the Fed's Revenue from Money Creation

ABSTRACT

The national accounts include the Fed's payments to the Treasury as

a component of corporate taxes. These payments constituted 22% of reported
corporate profits taxes in 1981. This paper discusses alternative concepts
of inflationary finance. Measures for these concepts are reported for the
post—World War II period.

Most economists know that the Federal Reserve system pays out the bulk

of its net revenues to the U.S. Treasury. However, very few economists
(actually, none whom I have asked) know where this term appears in the national

accounts. The Federal Reserve is treated as a member of the corporate sector.
The Fed's payments to the Treasury (labeled as "interest on Federal Reserve
notes") are regarded as taxes on corporate profits (at nearly a 100% rate in

this case). Therefore, the category, "corporate profits tax accruals," includes
as a substantial component the earnings of the Fed. Anyone using the aggregate
corporate tax figures to measure levies on the activities of private
businesses should know about this peculiarity in the data.
The data from 1946-81 for amounts paid from the Fed to the U.S.

Treasury, corporate profits tax accruals (which include the first item),
and the ratio of the Fed's payments to the figures on corporate profits
taxes are shown in Table 1. (Payments from the Fed were near zero. for

most years prior to 1946.) The Fed's payments constitute 22% of measured
corporate profits taxes in 1981! The ratio was 17% in 1980, between 8%
and 12% from 1969 to 1979, between 3% and 7% from 1959 to 1968, and below

3% prior to 1959. In other words the "tax payments" by the Fed significantly
distort the reported measures of total corporate profits taxes for recent

years. Presumably, this effect will be at least this important in the near
future.

We often measure the inflation tax as the product of an interest rate,
R, and

the

quantity of high-powered (non-interest-bearing) money, H.

Auernheimer (1974) discusses the sense in which this construct, R.H,

measures the effective flow of revenues for the government. He

also relates this measure to the change in the stock of base

money, LJ-1.

If

we neglected the finite maturity of the Fed's bond portfolio, and such items
as administrative expenditures net of fees, gold, float, Treasury deposits,

and surplus, then the payments of net revenues to the Treasury would maintain
equality over time between the monetary base (now consisting of Federal
Reserve notes and the reserves of depository institutions held at the Fed)
and

the

Fed's total portfolio of securities and loans. Hence, the amount

earned on the Fed's portfolio (all of which would be transferred to the

Treasury) would equal R•H. In practice, there are some differences--these
include the following: 1) when interest rates rise, the yield on the Fed's
holdings (measured at book value) respond only gradually, and vice versa
when interest rates fall; 2) a small part of the Fed's revenues go into
surplus; and 3) there are changes over time in gold, treasury deposits,
float, etc.

Table 2 reports values from 1946-81 for the Federal Reserve's
net revenues; for the product, Rfl (where ii

is

the annual average of high-

powered money); and for the change in base money, iH. The interest rate, R,
is measured as the yield on U.S. government securities with 3-year maturities

(3 to 5 years before 1953). This rate approximates the yield on the Fed's
portfolio. The Fed's revenues are always below the constructed measure,
R•H. Principally, this gap reflects an excess (currently about $20 billion)
of the monetary base over the Fed's loan portfolio (measured at book value).

Basically, a gap of roughly this size appeared with the large acquisitions

of gold during the 1930s. Otherwise, this gap has fluctuated mostly because
of changes in Treasury deposits, float, and gold holdings (measured at book
value, except for a few increases in the official price of gold).

Notes: All amounts are in billions of dollars. Net revenues of the Fed are
in the Annual Report, various issues. R from 1953-81 is the yield on
U.S. government securities with 3-year maturities (Economic Report of
the President), and from 1946-52 is the yield_for 3- to 5-year maturities
(Banking and Monetary Statistics, 1941-70). H is the annual average of
the monetary base, as reported in Banking and Monetary Statistics, 194170; Annual Statistical Digest, 1970-79; and the Federal Reserve Bulletin.
where H is the seasonally-unadjusted value for December

Recently, the Fed's revenues have lagged behind R•H because of sharp

increases in interest rates. In 1981 the Fed's net proceeds of $14.6 billion
were substantially below the figure of RH = $23.6 billion
The change over the year in the monetary base, H, would correspond
to R.IT only if the nominal interest

tions arise from year to year. Notice that the change in high-powered
money for 1981 is only $8.0 billion, as compared with the Fed's revenue of
$14.6 billion and the value of R•H = $23.6 billion.

rate of prices or the monetary base.)

Table 3 expresses the measures of inflationary finance as ratios to the
federal government's total tax and

non-tax receipts, T, and as ratios to

nominal GNP. As a fraction of total federal

receipts in 1981, the inflation

tax, RH, is 3.8%, while the Fed's revenues are 2.3%. These percentages are
roughly double those applying in the early l960s.

As a fraction of GNP in

1981, the inflationtaxis 0.8%, while the Fed's revenues are 0.5%. These
fractions are more than double those for the early 1960s.1
