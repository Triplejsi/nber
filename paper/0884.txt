STOCK ISSUES AND INVEST{ENT POLICY WHEN
FIRMS HAVE INFORMATION THAT
INVESTORS DO NOT HAVE

Abs tract

This paper describes corporate investment
and financing decisions when
managers have inside information about the value of the firm's existing investment and growth opportunities, but
cannot convey that information to investors.
Capital markets are otherwise perfect and
efficient. In these circumstances,
he firm may forego a valuable
investment
opportunity
rather than issue stock to
finance it.
The decision to issue cannot fully
convey
the managers' special
Lnformation. If stock is issued, stock
price
falls.
Liquid
assets or financial
slack are valuable if they reduce the
probability
or
extent
of
stock issues.
The paper also
suggests explanations for some aspects of dividend
policy and
choice of capital structure.

We now examine a trial solution assuming the firm issues stock
and undertakes the project regardless

of whether the favorable or unfavorable

state occurs. In that case P' = 155 because A + B = 155.
In state 1, the true value of the firm, including 100 raised from

the stock issue, is 350. That is v

—7—
Because

the firm issues

stock in both states, the

decision

to issue

tells investors nothing about the true state.

This trial solution is the

equilibrju solution, because issuing

stock and going ahead with the project leaves the old stockholders

better off regardless of the true state:

With these payoffs, the optimal

strategy

is to issue and invest only in state 2, because in state 1, the

market value of the old stockholders shares is lower when shares are issued.

if the firm follows this strategy, issuing stock signals state 2 and P'
drops to 60. The equilibrium payoffs are those circled below:

not have to issue stock to undertake the project, smart investors
will assume the worst if it does issue.

Discussion
The conventional rationale for holding financial slack—— cash,
liquid assets, or unused borrowing power—— is that the firm doesn't
want to have to issue stock on short notice in order to pursue a

valuable investment opportunity. Managers point to the red tape,
delays and underwriting costs encountered in stock issues. They
also typically say,"We don't want to be forced to issue stock when
our firm is undervalued by the market."

financial economist would respond by asking, tManagers may
have superior information, but why should that be a disadvantage?
A

If we admit that the firm is sometimes undervalued, then sometimes
it must be overvalued. Why can't firms take advantage of the market
by

issuing securities only when the firm is overpriced?"
Our examples suggest answers for these questions: slack

EXTENSIONS AND IFLIcAIIOS

Having explained our model formally, we can now turn to possible extensions

and qualifications. We also discuss broader issues, for example, the implications of managers' superior information for capital structure and dividend
policy.

Easy Ways Out
There is of course an easy way out-—an easy way tb avoid any loss of market

value: just issue stock at t = —1, when managers and the
market share the same information. That is one lesson of our model.

If managers know more than the market does, firms should avoid situations in

which valuable investment projects have to be financed by stock issues.
Having slack solves the problem, and one way to get slack is to issue stock

values is determined by the firm's actual assets, investment opportunities

At t

—1, the firm's decision to

issue and the price investors are willing to pay are governed by Eqs (1)
and (2) with the appropriate starred values

inserted. These equations would

also apply in t = —2, t = —3, etc., when expressed in terms of appropriatelY
defined variables.

We will not here pursue analysis of the optimal issue strategy in this

dynamic setting. However, we have shown that the problems addressed in
this paper do not go away when the firm has no immediate real investment

opportunity. Given differeiLtial information, a firm with valuable future
real investment opportunities is always better off with slack than without

it. Moreover, it should build up slack through

retention rather than stock

issues. This is consistent with actual retention policies of most public
firms, which limit dividends so that they will rarely have to go to the
market for fresh equity.

Thus we add one item in favor of the list of possible arguments for

low dividend payout. On the other hand, dividends would alleviate the
problems posed in this paper if they help signal the true value of

It does support positive payout policies with a high

This could explain why dividend payments respond to changes in earnings,

not market value. Earnings reflect the performance of assets in place.
At this point we revcrt to our

original three—date model, in which

differential information is important only at t = 0.

Debt Policy

Another easy way out is to issue debt

rather than equity. If the

firm never passes up a positive—NPV investment.

In our model,

stockholders are better off exante holding holding two firms rather than one,
providing that the spinoff does not reduce the values of the distributions

Our model's main message is this: given differential information, a
firm with insufficient financial slack may not undertake all valuable in-

vestment opportunities. Thus a firm that has too little slack increases its
value by acquiring more.

One way to do this is by merger. A merger always

increases value when

one firm's surplus slack fully covers the other's deficiency.'
But the same conditions that create this potential gain will complicate
the merger negotiations and in some cases rule out any possibility of

their successful completion. Consider a firm with an existing business,

Of course the six items stated just above depend on the specific

assumptions of our model and may not follow in other contexts. We have
only explored one of many possible stories about corporate finance. A full
description of corporate financing and investment

behavior will no doubt

require telling several stories at once.

A more comprehensive theory of financing policy would be a good initial

target for further research. Our model supplies a rationale for debt
financing even in the absence of taxes. On the other hand, a policy that
relies too heavily on debt increases the likelihood of bankruptcy costs and
agency costs or problems of moral hazard.' Firms may arrive at their
optimal debt policies by balancing these consideratioflS.Z

11. This problem is addressed in Rendleman'S paper 1113]. As noted above,
he does not devise a full equilibrium solution for it.

12. That is, the change in the debt value at t

1 is independent of

the firm—specific information revealed to investors at that time.

Other things, such as a general shift in interest rates, may change
debt value, but that is irrelevant here.

15. What if only part of the asset—in—place can

be sold? If it can be

sold at intrinsic value, the firm treats the proceeds as additional
slack and looks again at its issue—invest decision.

16. What if the asset in place can only be sold at a discount? What if
the potential buyer does not know its true value? What if sale of

the asset in place reduces b? These questions are worth exploring.
17. If the merged firms' total slack does not fully cover their investment
requirements, the merger may or may not increase value. See Majiuf

18. A proof follows. Define a*(N')

as the breakeven value of a, the

value at which the cash—poor firm is just indifferent to being

acquired at the equilibrium price Q'. Note that Q'

a*(N') + S.

Refer again to (la), the requirement for the firm to issue stock:

(S+a) <E+b
If F' were equal to Q', the firm would issue and invest at a*(N')
for any b > 0. That is, if
P' = Q' =

(S + a) =

(S + a*(N')) = E < E + b

Thus a(M'), the breakeven value of a at which the firm is just
willing to issue stock, exceeds a*(N') for any b > 0.
A(M') + B(M') > A(N') + B(N') and P' > Q'.
19. The cash—poor firm would prefer to negotiate with a firm that is not
a competitor. A competitor might back out of the negotiations and take
advantage of information acquired in them. This hazard is less in a
"conglomerate" merger.
