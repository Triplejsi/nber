THE PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY BEHAVIOR OF THE
AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY

by Olivier J. Blanchard

ABSTRACT
Understanding inventory movements is central to an understanding of

business cycles. This paper presents an empirical study of the behavior
of inventories in the automobile industry. It finds that inventory behavior
is well explained by the assumption of intertemporal optimization with

rational expectations. The underlying cost structure appears to have
substantial costs of changing production as well as substantial costs of
being away from target inventory, the latter being a function of current

sales. Given this cost structure, whether inventory behavior is stabilizing
or destabilizing depends on the characteristics of the demand process. In

the automobile industry, inventory behavior is destabilizing: the variance
of production is larger than the variance of sales.

L'nderstanding inventory movements is central to an understanding of

business cycles. This paper presents an empirical study of the behavior
of inventories in the automobile industry. It finds that inventory behavior
is well explained by the assumption of intertemporal optimization with

rational expectations. The underlying cost structure appears to have
substantial costs of changing production as well as substantial costs of
being away from target inventory, the latter being a function of current

sales. Given this cost structure, whether inventory behavior is stabilizing
or destabilizing depends on the characteristics of the demand process. In
the automobile industry, inventory behavior is destabilizing: the variance
of roduction is larger than the variance of sales.

Introduction

There is substantial agreement in macroeconomics about the importance of

inventory behavior in the business cycle. There is however little agreement
beyond that, for example on the issue of whether inventory behavior is

stabilizing or destabilizing. Although there exists a widely accepted
standard inventory ecuation (Lovell, 1961), it has been shown (Feldstein
and

Auerbach,

1976) that the empirical estimates obtained in these equations

partly contradict the theory from which these equations are derived.

The goal of this study is to learn more about inventory and production

behavior. This study makes two choices.
The first is to attempt to recover structural parameters, i.e. the

araneters characterizing the technology rather than to estimate reduced

form euations. The reason for doing so is well understood (Lucas, 1976):

2

the knowledge of structural parameters is both conceptually useful and
necessary to answer most questions of interest, such as the effect of a
particular sales process on inventory behavior or the conditions under which

inventory behavior may be stabilizing or destabilizing. Reduced form
coefficients are functions of both these structural parameters and of the

environment in which the firm or the industry operates. They do not by
themselves allow to answer the above questions. The approach used is therefore
to assume that production and inventory decisions are the results of a dynamic
optimization problem; the empirical work amounts to solving econometrically
an inverse problem, i.e. to recover the function being maximized from the
observed behavior.

The implication is that the dynamic optimization problem has to be
formulated as a linear-quadratic problem, as this is the only case in which

we know how to solve econometrically the inverse problem. Starting with the
work of Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon (1960) ,

the

linear quadratic

framework has often been used to characterize inventory behavior. Nevertheless,
to use it implies doing violence to some facts and excluding from the outset

explanations based on nonconvexities. The econometric methods used are
extensions of the methods developed by Hansen and Sargent (1980) .

Because

the linear-quadratic formalization is at best an approximation, we should be
under rio illusion that the estimated structural parameters are truly invariant

to all changes in the environment; they are however surely less affected by
such changes than reduced form coefficients.

The second choice follows from the first. This type of estimation imposes
a very tight structure on the data. It is likely to give reasonable results
only if it is reasonable to assume that the data used are indeed generated by

3

the

assumed optimization problem. This is less reasonable, the higher the

degree of aggregation, the worse the quality of the data used——because of

index nuer problems for inventory, for example. For this reason, this
study

concentrates

only on the behavior of the automobile industry. Excellent

data, weekly and by model, can be obtained for production, sales to and by
dealers for a long period of time.

I believe that the results obtained in this study are interesting in two
respects:

The first

is that the use of this technique is overall a success. Previous

attempts to use a similar technique, for example on aggregate consumption
(Sargent, 1978) have usually yielded negative results, i.e. a rejection of the
hyt'othesis that observed behavior could be generated by the assumed optimization

problem. This is not the case here. Observed behavior is well explained as
maximizing behavior and the estimated parameters are usually in accordance with

prior beliefs. This suggests that this approach can be used successfully.
The second and main respect is that the empirical findings are somewhat

at variance with the prevailing view. Heuristically, the conclusion is that
inventory behavior is well explained by the combination of two costs, a cost
of moving production and a cost of being away from a desired inventory level.
The

first

effect leads to production smoothing and is "stabilizing,' although

its immlications differ from the implications of a convex cost function. The
second effect is "destabilizing" because of a high marginal desired inventory

to current sales ratio. Which one dominates depends on the characteristics

of

the

demand process.

This paper is organized as follows. Section I describes briefly the
relevant aspects of the automobile industry. Section II gives descriptive

4

statistics about production and inventory behavior in the industry. Section
III formalizes the model and derives the equations to be estimated. Sections

IV and V report the estimation results. Setion VI shows the economic
implications of the estimation results. Section VII relates these results
to the literature on inventory and production behavior.

Section I. The Industry
This section first justifies the choice of the level of aggregation adopted
in the study, namely the division level, and of the time unit, namely the month.
It then describes how a typical division is actually organized and how, because
of data limitations and other considerations, it is assumed to be organized in
the rest of the study.
The automobile industry was chosen because of the availability of weekly

data on sales and production at a disaggregated level. Working at the level of
the model is however not desirable, mainly for two reasons. As many plants produce
more than one model, production decisions for different models are interrelated

and the interrelation is hard to formalize. For most of the econometric work,
the assumption that the sales process is stationary is extremely helpful but

cannot be made at the model level: models go through a life cycle. The analysis
will be done at the division level, for which interrelations between models can
be forgotten and for which the assumption of stationarity will be shown to be

acceptable for th period of estimation. There are ten divisions considered in
this paper: Five are parts of General Motors; they are Chevrolet (denoted in
what follows CV), Pontiac (PT), Oldsmobile (OD), Buick (BK) and Cadillac (CD).
Two are parts of Ford; they are Ford (FD) and Mercury Lincoln (!1L).

Two are

parts of Chrysler, Chrysler-Plymouth (CP) and dge (DC). The last one is
American Motors (AM).

5

The second choice to be made is that of the time unit. If there is such

a period as the decision period — in which decisions are taken for the duration
of the period and not changed until the next period —,

it is very useful to use

the same period as a sampling period. As many production decisions and production
and sales forecasts are made on a monthly basis, this has led to the choice of

the month as the assumed decision period and the time unit for estimation. The
period of estimation chosen is 1966—i to 1979-12. The first date was chosen so
as to have no major reorganization of divisions during the sample period.

The Actual Organization of a Division.

Because of the Canadian automobile agreement signed in 1965 which removed

most tariff barriers between the U.S. and Canada and has led to an idiosyncatdc
allocation of production across both countries, it would make little sense to

consider the U.S. without Canada. Production for all divisions takes place both
in Canada and the U.S., at least for part of the sample period (except for

Cadillac). Plants in the U.S. and Canada then ship cars to U.S. dealers,
Canadian dealers and the rest of the world, with substantial flows both from U.S.
plants to Canadian dealers, and from Canadian plants to U.S. dealers.
Manufacturers do not, except for Chrysler, hold inventories other than

cars in transit. As a result, most inventories (91% for divisions other than
Chrysler, 87% for Chrysler) are held by dealers. Data on production and flows
from plants to dealers are all available. Sales by U.S. dealers are available
but sales by Canadian dealers are not; as a result I have no data on Canadian
dealer inventories.

6

The ssurned

Organization

of a Division.

Production in the U.S. and Canada is aggregated to give American
production,

Producers are assumed to hold no inventories: actual

manufacturers' inventories are added to dealers' inventories. Production

is sold to two groups: the first is the sum of exports and shipments to
Canadian dealers and is denoted Z. The second is shipments to U.S. dealers,

denoted D. Thus

=

D

+

Z.

U.S. dealers receive shipments

hold inventories

and sell to U.S.

customers S. I denotes end of month t inventories and therefore satisfy:
=

't-l + D — S

Figure 1 shows the relation of the assumed to the actual structure.

The Manufacturer-Dealers Market.
Each division is composed of a manufacturer and a large number of dealers.
There is no actual market in the usual sense and the reported price charged

by manufacturers to dealers is approximately the list price minus some constant

amount and moves little. One extreme interpretation is that dealers face a
perfectly elastic supply of cars at that constant price and that production

adjusts passively. The other extreme interpretation is that manufacturers
in fact use both forcing and rationing, the "true" price adjusting so that
inventory adjusts passively.

(See White, 1971, for a description of dealer—

manufacturer relations.) None of these two extreme interpretations is
consistent with the empirical evidence. The assumption will therefore be
one of a shadow market, in which manufacturers have a supply curve, dealers

a demand curve, the shadow market clearing competitively. The implication of
this assumption (to be formally proven in Section III) is the equivalence of

the decentralized organization of a division with manufacturer and dealers to
a centralized firm making both production and inventory decisions. Therefore
in most of what follows, a "division" can be thought of as one firm taking
both decisions.

To summarize, a division is assumed to be equivalent to a centralized

firm. It produces both in the U.S. and Canada, selling cars both to U.S.
customers and the rest of the world, holding inventories against sales to

U.S. customers only. We have data on production

and both types of sales

St and Z.

Section II. Basic Factors about Production and Sales
This section has two goals. The first is to give basic facts before any

elaborate econometrics are applied to the data. The second is to discuss and
justify some choices made in formalizing the behavior of a division in the next
section.

Table 1 gives the mean values for production, sales and inventories by

division. The size of divisions varies in the ratio of approximately 10
(Chevrolet) to 1 (Cadillac). The last column gives the coefficient on a linear
time trend with value one in 1966-1 in a regression of production on a constant

and this time trend: Total North-American production shows practically no trend;
the trend is small compared to average production for most divisions.

Divisions look similar in other respects. The ratio of manufacturers'
inventories to total itiventories is small,varving between 3.1% for Ford and 17.1%

for Oldsmobile. No inventories are held against Z, sales to Canadian dealers
and the rest of the world. Therefore, the relevant inventory sales ratio is the

ratio of total inventories, I, to sales by U.S. dealers, S. This ratio varies

and Chrysler-Plymouth for which it is 4.45 and 4.08 months respectively.
Since the work of Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon, it is generally

accepted that production and inventory behavior depend on three types of costs:
the first is simply the cost of producing, which under the standard assumption
of decreasing returns is convex and therefore leads

constant —

to

if factor prices are

production smoothing; he second is the cost of moving production,

which also clearly leads to production smoothing. The two types of costs differ
slightly in their implications, the second one implying that current production

levels depend on past production, the first one not having this implication. The
third type of cost is the cost of being away from some target level of inventory,

the target level being either constant (as in Blinder, l98, for example) ,

function of current —

expected — sales.

or

or

a

depending on the exact formalization, next period

(To avoid semantic discussions, it should be pointed out

that this target level is not the "desired inventory' level found in reduced

form empirical inventory equations). Only if this last cost is large and
inventory is a function of current sales can inventory behavior lead not to
production smoothing but to larger movements in production than in sales.

It is therefore interesting to compare the variance of production and the

variance of sales. The results are shown in Table 2.

To have variables of the

same magnitude, the table compares the variance of production (Ye) to the
variance of total sales, which is the sum of sales by U.S. dealers and sales to

Canada and the rest ofthe world, S +

Z.

The results are striking. The first

three columns give the standard deviations of the raw series and the ratio of

the standard deviations. This ratio varies between 1.23 (ML) and 1.43 (PT, CP).
To see whether this is due possibly to factors such as August holidays affecting

production, the production and sales series are then regressed on two sets of

variables. The first is a set of 12 monthly dummies which therefore accounts
for additive seasonality; the second includes a time trend and individual division
dummies accounting for strikes (see the data appendix for exact definitions).
Columns 4 to 6 in Table 2 report the "standard deviations" of the seasonal

component of the production and sales series; as this series is deterministic,

it does not have a standard deviation in the statistical sense. The value

is simply

is

the estimated coefficient of the

th dummy. Columns 7 to 9 report the standard deviations of the cyclical
component, which are simply the standard errors of the regressions. For both
the seasonal arid the cyclical components and for all divisions, the variance of

production is larger than the variance of sales. The ratio is somewhat larger
for the seasonal component, a result which may be surprising as the seasonal
component of sales is better anticipated than the cyclical component and allows
for better production planning.

Table 2 suggests strongly that production

smoothing is not the dominant element of inventory behavior and that target inventory
is probably a function of current sales.

Can we also say something about the relative importance of the convexity

of the cost function versus the cost of moving production? If there are costs
of moving production, the formal model and the associated econometrics are
substantially more complex; it is therefore worth getting some prior evidence.
Intuition (supplemented in the next section by a formal proof) suggests

that this can be done. If there were no costs of moving production and the only
two costs were the cost of producing and the cost of being away from target
inventory, the only variable from the past directly affecting decisions would be

last period end of period inventories. Lagged production would not itself affect
current decisions. If, instead, the cost function is linear but there are costs

13

of moving production, the only relevant variable from the past will be lagged

production. Formally, if we write

past S's and Z's were used to forecast sales and if c is white. Even if these
assumptions are not exactly satisfied, these regressions appear to be a simple

and useful first step: They do not allow us to estimate any structural
parameters, nor can we interpret the coefficients on current and lagged S and
Z; they help however in choosing the appropriate model.

The results are very clear. Both a arid

A

are significant for nearly

all divisions. The coefficient on 1t—2' (—a) is always significant. This
suggests that costs of moving production are important and must be incorporated

in the model. The coefficient on 't—3 is usually insignificant; this suggests
that the costs described above may be sufficient to explain production behavior.
The last set of facts given in this section relates to seasonality.
Mainly for reasons of convenience, seasonality will be assumed to be additive

rather than multiplicative. Table 2 shows that the seasonal component is large,
with a standard deviation about as large as that of the cyclical component,

both for sales and production. The question is whether there is useful
information in the seasonal movements of production and sales. If the costs
themselves had no seasonal component, then seasonal movements in production

would be entirely due to seasonal movements in sales. As these movements are
anticipated, there would be substantial information in seasonal movements.

The other extreme is the case where costs themselves had a seasonal component.
If the movements of this seasonal were left unconstrained, there would be no
information to be obtained from seasonal movements in production and sales.

Table 4 gives the values of the seasonals for two representative divisions.
The pattern for sales shows two peaks, one in March to June and one in

October-November corresponding to the introduction of the new models. The
pattern of production shows two lows, one in July-August, the other in December.
It appears very unlikely that the seasonal pattern of production can be explained
only by the seasonal pattern of sales; the lows are due partly to holidays,

partly to the technical modifications needed to change the models. Rather
than constrain a priori the seasonal pattern of cost, I shall leave it

unconstrained. This is equivalent to not using the information contained
in seasonal components.
I now turn to the formal model.

Section III. The Model
We have, for each division, data on production and sales but not on final
prices.

(List prices bear only a vague resemblance to transaction prices,

especially cyclically. The only transaction price series, the "new automobile"
comnonent of the CPI, is available only for the industry as a whole.) We must
therefore construct a model which, once estimated, allows us to recover the

technology even in the absence of price data. We can choose one of two
formalization strategies:

The first is to specify, in addition to the technology, the demand system
and the nature of market equilibrium (competitive, monopolistic or otherwise)

We can then derive equilibrium price, sales and production. Even if prices
are unobservable, it may still be possible to recover some or all of the
Darameters of the technology (Elanchard, 1982) .

They will depend however on

the assumtions made about demand, and market equilibrium.
The second is closer to the traditional empirical approach to inventory

behavior, which regresses production (equivalently, inventory) on sales. The
above simultaneous determination of price, sales and production can be

euivalently recast as a two—level decision problem. First a division derives
its oDtimal price as a function of exogenous variables and shocks; if the
assumrtions about demand and market equilibrium are the same as above, the

pricenile will also be the same. Given the price rule and demand disturbances,
sales are determined; the firm then solves the second decision problem, that

of scheduling production given sales. As we have no data on prices, we may
formalize and concentrate only on the second decision. A further assumption
s however needed to allow us to estimate the technology by looking only at
the resDonse of production to sales. It is that prices be uncorrelated with

19

current and lagged cost disturbances. If they were correlated, sales would also
be correlated with these disturbances, making identification and estimation
difficult or impossible, depending on other assumptions of the model.

This paper adopts the second strategy, which does not require specification
of demand and market equilibrium but requires the assumption that prices be

uncorrelated with technological shocks. This assumption is unlikely to hold
exactly but is hopefully not too strongly violated. It cannot be tested by
itself but only as a joint assumption; we shall return to this issue in Section

V. The alternative strategy is pursued in another paper (Elanchard and Melino,
1981)

A division consists of a manufacturer and dealers; we now describe the
behavior of the manufacturer and dealers, the manufacturer-dealer market
equilibrium and derive the equation to be estimated.

Time is formalized as follows. At time t, dealers have inventories

from which they satisfy sales S. At time t, production, Y, takes place,
dealers demand

the rest of the world demands Z and the manufacturer-dealer

"market" clears at shadow price Pt. The two implications are that monthly sales
are known when monthly production decisions are taken and that dealers cannot
use current shipments to satisfy current sales.

The discount factor b < 1 is assumed constant, so that this present value is:

.

The same information set

is assumed for the manufacturer and for the

dealers. It includes at least current and past values for I, Y, Z, S, p and
disturbances; some of these variables are obviously redundant and some of them

irrelevant either to the manufacturer or to dealers. The set of first-order

conditions is, in addition to the transversality condition: i >

21

In this case, production depends positively on the price, but also on
lagged and expected future production, with weights adding to unity. The larger
the cost of changing production, k, the smaller the effect of the current price.
The Problem of Dealers.

Given demand conditions and the price rule, dealers face sales S. They
decide about their shipments from manufacturers,

at shadow price

In

addition to their purchases, they have only one type of cost, the cost of
deviating from target inventory:

The cost is quadratic in the distance of inventories to target inventories;

from the measurement of I as end of period inventories.
disturbance, with stochastic component
The underlying

suin of

u is again a technological

and seasonal component

justification is that this cost function is itself the

two cost functions: the first is the physical cost of carrying

inventories, which is an

increasing

function of the level of inventories; the

second is the expected cost of stocking out, which is a decreasing function
of the level of inventories given sales, as a higher inventory to sales ratio

decreases the probability of stocking out. The sum

of

these two costs reaches

a minimum for some level of inventories which is denoted 1*. An increase
in sales, for any level of inventories, increases the expected cost of stocking

out, moves the minimur of the cost function to the right. This description
makes clear however that the coefficients a and d are very likely to depend
at least on the second moments of the distribution of sales: In this sense,
they are not truly structural.

22

The decision variable of dealers at time t is Dti the shipments from the
manufacturer.

At time t, dealers minimize the expected present value of cost:

If the (discounted) price is expected to increase, they demand
more; the size of the response to expected price changes is inversely proportional
to d, the convexity of their cost function.

This is still only a first order condition, giving a relation between

endogenous variables. The following remarks can however be made: In addition
to expected, current and past sales, inventory depends on itself lagged once

and twice and itself led once and twice. As k goes to zero, the effect of I
lagged or led twice also goes to zero, substantially reducing the

of (4). The effect of sales to U.S. customers St or other sales
behavior is the same except for the term abdL

complexity

on inventory

for St: by assumption inventory

is held against St and not against Z. The term abd represents the direct effect
of S on target inventory, the others the effects of S and Z on the scheduling of

production. The last remark is on the effect of b: the smaller b, the larger
the rate at which the future is discounted, the smaller the effect of the
expected future.

Equation (4) has been derived as a market equilibrium equation. Not
surprisingly, it could. have been derived as the first order condition of a
centralized problem, namely the solution to:

This formally justifies the remark made in the preceding section that a division
can be thought of as a firm deciding about production and inventory behavior and
minimizing the expected present discounted value of cost given current and
exoected sales.

The Inventory Equation.

Equation (4) indicates that inventory behavior depends on five structural
parameters,

a, b, c,

k. Equation (4)

d,

is

however homogeneous of

degree zero

in c, d, k. Absolute convexities cannot be determined; only relative convexities

can. We may therefore normalize, by choosing k = 1;

the goal of the estimation

will be to recover a, b, c, d.

To solve equation (4), E1(L) can be rewritten, using k = 1, as:

:snc these two relations, it is easily shown that as c, d increase compared to

i.e.

costs of moving production become relatively insignificant, A2 goes to

26

zero and equation (7) simplifies accordingly (with some care in the derivation to

avoid dividing by zero). This proves the statement made in the preceding section.
Note also that given b, c and d can be determined easily from (X1+)2) and (X1X2).

Estimation of the Inventory Equation.

Equation (7) entirely characterizes inventory behavior. Further
assumptions must however be made in order to estimate it and to recover the
structural parameters.

The first allows the parameters in equation (7) to be estimated. It

and

assumes that St and

and

-

are uncorreated at.all lags. This

insures that the second set of terms in (7), lagged, current and expected sales
is uncorrelated at all lags with the third set of terms involving unobservable

disturbances. This shows in particular why the assumption that prices are
uncorrelated with cost disturbances at all lags is required. If prices were
affected by cost disturbances, they would affect current and possibly expected

sales: the second set of terms would not be uncorrelated with the disturbance
term.

The second specifies the processes generating '

u

and

Estimation

is substantially simpler when these are white noise; using Occam's razor, this

is the assumption made here. The third set of terms in (7) reduces to
A1X2 (dbu +

c

+

r)

The third specifies how expectations are formed, i.e. what is included in

There are two posible assumptions. The first is to assume that we know

which time series belong to ' the second is to assume that

includes some

time series unobservable to the econometrician. Both assumptions lead to
tractable estimation problems although the second one is substantially more

27

costly to implement. Most of the estimation, reported in Section IV, proceeds
under the first assumption; Section V reports results under the second assumption.
Under the first assumption, a simple first step is to assume that
includes only, in addition to current and lagged 11s, current and lagged S's

and Z's. The next section will specifically assume that (Zi S) has a fourth—
order bivariate autoregressive representation. (Although the estimation will
allow for seasonals in S, Z and the disturbances, they are in the derivation

which follows put equal to zero but only for notational simplicity.) This
representation can directly be written in quasi first—order form:

is the equation to be estimated in the next section. If we had carried

the three seasonal components of c, u, r and the seasonal component of the (S, Z)
Drocess, there would be an additional set of seasonals with unconstrained

coefficients; this set will be included in the estimation. Note that in equation
(10) ,

all

coefficients are real. A1, A2 and R depend on the structural parameters

a, b, c, d. The matrix A

characterizes

the process generating S and Z. The

disturbance term is white and unconstrained. I now turn to the joint estimation
of (9) and (10).

Section IV. Estimation Results
This section proceeds in three steps.
The first is simply to run unconstrained regressions of equation (10).

iat can be learned from such regressions? Consistent estimates of (X + A2)

and (AX2) can be obtained. From equation (8), this implies that if b was known,
consistent estimates of c, d could be obtained. The coefficient b is not known
but it is reasonable to assume that b, being a monthly discount rate is between

1 and .98 (.98 monthly irniies .79 annually), and to solve for both values. Note

that this estimation gives us no infortion about a, the marginal inventory-sales
fesired ratio.

Why go through this rather pedestrian step? The reason is that the
estimates of c, d obtained in this way will be consistent, conditional on b,

even if divisions did not have rational expectations. gore precisely they

29

will be consistent if the divisions formed their forecasts of sales S and Z
using past values of S or Z; this includes in particular adaptive, static,

adaptive regressive expectation formation mechanisms. The necessary regressions

have in fact already been run and reported in Section II, Table 3. Point
estimates and asymtotic variances of c, d given b can be obtained using

equation (8). They are reported in Table 5. The interpretation and the
economic implications of the results will be given in Section VI. Note
however that c, d are of the expected sign, namely positive.

c, which should

be interpreted as the ratio of c to k as k is normalized to be unity, varies
between .02 and 4.96 (equivalently the ratio of estimated k to c varies between
A

41.6 and .20). It is never significant at 95%. The coefficient d, or again the
ratio of d to k, varies between 0.00 and .35 and is either significant or close

to sicnificant. Varying b from 1 to .98 does not substantially affect the estimates.
The second step is the estimation of equation (9) and equation (10)

subject to the full set of constraints. This is done first by using a two—step

approximation to the full information maximn likelihood. Estimation of equation
(9) is first rerformed, giving an estimate of A, A. The estimate of A is then
used for the estimation of equation (10) which gives estimates for (a, b, c, d).

The information matrix is not block diagonal in A and (a, b, c, d): the method
therefore is not as efficient asymptotically as the FIML method. The reason for
using it is simply a reason of cost: the cost of maximizing the likelihood
function with respect to 20 coefficients rather than 4 in the second step of the

two—step method is ver high. The next section gives results from FIML estimation
for one particular division: they are substantially the same. The asymptotic
standard errors and test statistics reported in this section are derived under
the assumption that A is known, ignoring that A is substituted for A in the
second step.

Under the hypothesis

that equation (10) is correct, this is distributed asptotically X6) as 6
restrictions are imposed on the unconstrained regression given in Table

3.

Table 6b gives the implied values of the structural parameters a, b, c, d.
Table 6 contains bad news, namely that there is little hope of obtaining

sensible coefficients for a, c, d if b is left free. The estimation does not
determine b precisely and in some cases the point estimate is of the wrong sign.
As c, d affect the results of estimation mainly through (A1+A2) and (X1A2), and as

(7 + A2) and (X1A2) are determined precisely, the implication of equation (8)
is that nonsensible values of b imply nonsensible values of c, d. As a appears
only in equation (10) in the product adb, nonsensible values of b and d give

nonsensible values of a. What this does not explain is why the discount rate

is badly estimated. The answer is probably that given

+ A2), A1A2, i.e.

letting c and d adjust so as to keep A1 + A and A1A2 unchanged, different
values of b do not lead to very different behavior for a given division. This
is supported both by the available t tests on b in Table 6b and the

X(1) tests

below in Table 7b which show that for most divisions except Ford and American

iotors, the hypothesis that b

.98 cannot usually be rejected.

Table 7 therefore gives the results of fully constrained estimation, with

the additional restriction that b = .98

(Values of b between 1 and .95 do not

affect the estimates of a, c, d in any significant way). Table 7 contains the

main results of the paper. It is again composed of two subtables: Table 7a gives
the implied coefficients of the right hand side variables, together again with
the unconstrained coefficients repeated from Table 3.

from fully constrained estimation with b = .98 and SSR2 is the sum of squared

residuals obtained from fully constrained estimation with b free. Under the
hypothesis that b =

.98, it is distributed asymptotically X1). Table 7b gives

the implied values of the structural coefficients a, c, d.

Consider first Table 7a. The coefficients of the constrained regression
are in general close both to the coefficients of the constrained regression with

b left free and to the unconstrained coefficients. This is particularly true of
the coefficients of 1t—l' 1t—2

St which are very similar in the constrained

and unconstrained case. The main discrepancy is between the unconstrained and

constrained coefficients on Z. The unconstrained coefficient of

is usually

positive and large, implying that during the sample an increase in

of 1 was

associated with an increase in production of 4.2 for the average division. As
no inventories are held against Z, a potential explanation is that increases in
Z imply large expected increases in S or Z in the future and thus a current

increase in production. The coefficient on lagged Z in the bivariate regressions
of Z and S (not reported here) is indeed high. The effect of Z lagged once on S
is for example 4.92 for Cadillac and of 1.76 for Buick. This explains why the
constrained regression also leads to a positive sign on Z for 6 divisions. For 4
divisions however, the constrained regression does poorly for Z, suggesting that
t:at part of the model is probably misspecified.

Going from the unconstrained regression to the fully constrained regression
with b free (Table 6a) increases the sum of squared residuals by 19% on average.

Because of the large number of observations,the

statistic is large. The model

is rejected at the .005 level for S divisions and rejected at the .10 level for 8

divisions. The model fits better the divisions of GM than those of Ford or

Chrysler. It fits particularly well Buick and Cadillac. Going from the fully
constrained regression with b free to the fully constrained regression with

b = .98, the sum of squared residuals remains practically constant for 4 divisions.
The

statistic is however large for 3 other divisions, the 2 divisions of Ford,

Ford and Mercury Lincoln, and American Motors. In general, the assumed model
fits observed behavior well, except for the reaction of production to

for some

divisions, especially Ford and American Motors.

Turning now to Table 7b, all the coefficients, except an insignificant

estimate of c, have the correct sign. Some of the results hold for all divisions:
The first is that a, d are both statistically significant: there is a significant
cost of being away from target inventory; target inventory is a function of sales.
The marginal desired inventory to sales ratio, a, is auite high, higher than the
average inventory to sales ratio for the sample period for seven out of ten

divisions. Although the coefficient d appears small, with an average value of

.11, magnitudes are misleading: as Section V will show, its effect is substantial.
The point estimate of c varies across divisions from 0.0 to 3.29 but is never
significant; this suggests that the convexity of the cost function, relative to

the cost of moving production — as k is normalized to be one —

is

not a main

determinant of production and inventory behavior.

The next section considers some econometric extensions. The reader
interested mainly in the economic implications of the results may go directly
to Section VI.

38

Section V. Estimation Results. Extensions
This first subsection compares two-step versus efficient estimates; the
second derives estimates of the technology under alternative assumptions about
the information set.

Two-step versus Efficient Estimates.

The two—step method was used for reasons of cost but is not asymptotically

efficient. Table 8 reports the results of full information maximum likelihood,
which estimates jointly equations (9) and (10) ,

for

a particular division.

The division chosen was Cadillac, for which the model seems to fit well. The
results obtained using both methods are very similar, suggesting that the twostep method is quite good.

Alternative Assumptions about the Information Set.

Estimation in the previous section was performed under the joint hypothesis
that prices (and therefore sales) were uncorrelated with cost disturbances and
that the information set available to a division included only current and

lagged sales, S and Z. This joint hypothesis implies that S and Z are
statistically exogenous with respect to production and is testable by standard

exogeneity tests. We therefore regress S and Z on lagged values of S, Z and Y
and test the significance of lagged Y (it would be equivalent to regress S and
Z on lagged values of S, Z and I).
These exogeneity .tests, using a lag length of 4 for each variable, cannot

reject exogeneity of Z but reject exogeneity of S at the 5% level for nine of

the ten divisions. The source of the rejection is the sare for all divisions,
the coefficient on production lagged once is significant; it is however
relatively small, from .18 for American Motors to .40 for Chevrolet.

The rejection implies rejection of at least one of the two hypotheses of

the above joint hypothesis. It may mean that high production last period
implies higher desired production this period, and thus lower prices and

higher sales. It may alternatively mean that the information set available
to a division is larger than we have assumed: production would then depend
on more information about future sales than current and past sales, and would

help predict future sales in the above regressions. As explained in Section
III, the first hypothesis is maintained throughout this paper and I now relax
the second.

Because some cars are ordered rather than bought from existing inventories,

dealers may know next month's sales quite accurately. I consider therefore the
assumption that next month's sales, S41 and
information set

belong to this month's

Two—step estimation is performed under this alternative

assumption and the results reported in Table 9. The results are close to the
results reported in Table 7b; the main difference is the decrease in the

estimated value of a. This is not surprising as E(S+1lc2) has now been
replaced by 5t÷1 which has larger variance. The implied reduced forms are not

reported. As before, they replicate closely the coefficients on lagged
inventory and on sales S.

The second way to relax the initial assumption about information is to

assume that we only observe a subset of the true information set ft. The
model, summarized by equation (7) ,

still imposes

restrictions on the

aximuin likelihood estimation estimates B subject to this constraint: the
parameters are the 36 nontrivial elements of B and the structural parameters

a, b, c, d. Until now, our attempts to use maximum
not

been

likelihood

estimation have

successful: we have been unable to achieve convergence to anything

resembling a global maximum.

Consistent estimates of a, b, c, d can however be obtained as follows:
the matrix B is first estimated by ordinary least squares and B is replaced by

B in (12). Maximization of (12) over a, b, c, d is then performed as in the

previous section. These estimates are given in Table 10. The method has some
difficulty to estimate a and d separately; the results are roughly in line with
the previous results in Tables 6b, To and 9.

Section VI.

Imlications

The findings of the previous two sections are twofold: Production smoothing
exists but is more likely due to a cost of changing production than to a convex

cost function. There is however a cost in being away from target inventory;
this target is a function of sales.

How do these findings relate to the central macroeconomic issue about

production —

inventory

behavior, namely whether inventory behavior is stabilizing

or destabilizing, amplifies or dampens demand shocks? The framework used
here makes clear that the answer depends on the sales process; for example
for the sales process observed in the sample, Section II already gave the

answer: an increase in sales led to a contemporaneous decrease in inventories,
i.e. a less than complete increase in production; it however led to a movement

of production over time such
than for sales.

there

would be

as to inply

(If this was the

little

a larger variance for production

only sales process we were interested in,

justification for this paper). e can however address

45

this question by characterizing the effects of simpler sales processes. I
shall consider the class of first—order autoregressive processes for sales
assuming constancy of both sales to non-U.S. dealers

and cost disturbances.

Specifically, I characterize the effects of an unexpected increase in sales of
1 in period 0, decaying at rate p over time, pc[O, 1) .

The tables below can

also be interpreted as giving the weights of the moving average representation
of production and inventory for a given sales process.
As the focus is not on the intraindustry differences, I shall consider
a "representative division," with the following values of the structural

parameters a = 3, b =

.98, c = 1, k =

1 and d =

.1,

which correspond roughly

to the mean values obtained in Table 7b. There are two main results:

Production smoothing coming from cost of changing production tends to

be stabilizing in the short run, but much less so in the medium run. This
is different from production smoothing coming from a convex cost function.
This is made clear in Table 11. This table reports the effects of a sales

shock of 1, decaying at rate p =

cases a = 3, b = .98 and d = .1.

.9 in three different cases. In all three
In the first case, production smoothing

cones only from a convex cost function: c = 1, k = 0.

In the second, it

cones only from a cost of changing production: c = 0, k = 1.

In the last,

both costs are present: c = 1, k = 1.
In the first, the desire to keep the level of production approximately
constant together with, the desire to reach target inventory leads the firm to

the first nonth. In the second case, the desire to keep the change in production

aproximately constant has two effects: the first is to lead a smaller
change in production than in sales in the first month; the second is to lead

to higher levels of production than in the first case for the next five months

and to a substantially larger build up of inventories. Therefore, costs of
moving have a "stabilizing" contemporaneous effect but allow over time for a

larger "destabilizing" effect on production and build-up of inventories. In
the last case both costs are present, leading to an initial decrease in inventories,
followed by an increase until the seventh month.

The effect of tarqet inventory varies very much with small changes in

the sales process. It plays a significant role only if sales exhibit a high
degree of persistence. This is shown more precisely in Table 12, which gives
the effects of a sales shock with different degrees of persistence; P =

.9,

.8, .7 and .0. The structural parameters are those of a representative division,
the same in all four cases.

Consider first the case of a purely temporary sales shock (p=.O). In this
case there is no desired target inventory effect as next period's expected
sales are always equal to zero (All variables are measured in terms of deviations

from preshock values). Production increases contemporaneously by only 16 of
the increase in sales and after their initial decrease, inventories return

to zero over time. The dynamics do not change drastically for p =
p =

.8:

.7

or even

production adjusts only partially, reaching a peak after a month; it

is "smoother" than sales. Although desired inventory is now positive, actual
inventory remains negative all along the adjustment path.

The adjustment path changes drastically when p =

.9.

(The results for

this case are repeated from Table 11.) Although production responds initially
by slightly less than the increase in sales, the desired inventory effect

becomes important, leading to a positive inventory after the first month
and an increase in production larger than the increase in sales from the first

to the seventh month. This shows that whether inventory behavior is stabilizing
or destabilizing—-whatever criterion or definition is used-—depends very much on
the sales process.

Section VII. e1ation to the Stock Adjustment Model
The most oopular emoirical model of inventory behavior is the stock

adjustment model, introduced initially by Lovell. How does our model compare
to it?

The underlying justification of inventory behavior is in many ways
similar; in both models, costs of adjustment and target inventory play a central

role. The stock adjustment model cannot however be formally derived as a
special case of our model, with static expectations for example. It should
therefore probably be considered as an alternative model. This suggests
another way of comparing them, namely by considering the fit of the stock
adjustment model conpared to this model, for all divisions of the automobile

industry. The stock adjustment model is usually written as:

X(I_Ii)

=

+

(E(SjQt1)_S)

and I

+

S

The results of the regressions, ran under the assumption of static expectations

E(S1) =

S,

are reported in Table 13.

(This estimation parallels

a similar estimation at the industry level by Irvine, 1981.)
Consider first the fits, as measured by the sum of squared residuals,

for the stock adjustment model and our model. A comparison of fits is
aDrOpriate as both nodels are regressed with the same number of observations

and the same ni.ber of free parameters (a, b, c versus a, X, 6). The result
is a draw, each model domir.ating

the

other for five divisions. The estimated

coefficients are usually of the right sign; all divisions however exhibit the

characteristic emphasized by Feldstein and Auerbach for manufacturing: although
the underlying justification would suggest that A = 1

-

S, this is strongly

rejected for all divisions. There is also evidence of serial correlation,
although not as strong as for aggregate manufacturing data.
Therefore, although our model does not dominate in terms of fit, it gives

a more satisfying explanation for inventory behavior. Given the similarity of
the results of Table 11 to the results obtained for manufacturing, this
suggests that our model may also provide a more satisfying explanation for

manufacturing as a whole. This is clearly only a conjecture.

Conclusion
This study has shown that the production behavior of the automobile
industry is well explained by the assumption of intertemporal optimization

with rational expectations. The underlying cost structure appears to have
substantial costs of changing production as well as substantial costs of being
away from target inventory, the latter being a function of current sales.

The last section suggests that this cost structure generates the type of
time series behavior usually explained by the stock adjustment model and that
the results of this study may be of relevance to more than the automobile
industry.

This sentence hides a lot of work and a superb program written by Angelo

Melino and Danny Quah, based on work by Melino (1982) .

The program works with

the eienvector and eigenvalue matrices associated with B. In this case, the
constraint simply allows to express 12 of the free elements of the eigenvector

matrix as a function of the others ad the eigenvalues and reduces the
constrained maximization to an unconstrained one.
