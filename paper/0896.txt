Retirement Annuity Design in an Inflationary Climate

AB STRACT

This paper examines the tilt and risk—return characteristics
of real retirement incomes provided by variable annuities tied to bills,
long—term bonds, stocks and a mixed portfolio which combines all three.
The analysis emphasizes the riskiness of the real value of benefits

provided by conventional nominal annuities. The Rockefeller Foundation
Plan, together with the "ad hoc" cost—of—living adjustments made by
many large firms, are interpreted as representative market responses

to increased inflation uncertainty. The paper examines the annuity
designs implicit in these innovations, and shows them to be variants of
the standard variable annuity.

A pensioner who receives his benefit in the form of a nominal
annuity has claim to a stream of payments whose nominal value is certain.
The real value of this claim, however, will be highly uncertain if
there exists substantial uncertainty regarding the future level of

prices. Since this appears to be the case, and since pensioners are
presumably concerned with the real value of their retirement incomes,
the question of annuity design in an inflationary climate merits increased

attention. Our belief is that at least some individuals may find alternatives to the nominal level—payment annuity better suited to their needs
or preferences in an environment of substantial inflation urlcertainty)

If individuals are to make rational choices, they must first understand
the risk—return and other characteristics of alternative annuity designs.
The primary objective of this paper is to clarify these issues.

The first task is to examine the streams of real benefits that

are likely to be provided by variable annuities (VA's). Although equity—
based VA's appear to have fallen into some disfavor, perhaps because of
the lack of attention accorded the inherent volatility of common stocks,

recent work by Bodie (1980, 1981) suggests that VA's tied to bills or
short—term bonds may produce income streams that are quite stable in

real terms. VA's backed by bills, long—term bonds, common stocks and a
mixed portfolio are thus examined, and the results contrasted with those
for a graduated—payment, nominal annuity.

The second task is to examine novel annuity designs which have
emerged in recent years, in which floors or floors together with ceilings

have effectively been added to the standard VA. The Rockefeller Foundation plan, for example, provides cost—of—living adjustments which equal

2

the average prime interest rate for the year less 3% (Heaton (1977)).

Once granted, these adjustments are never reduced and thus the annuitant —

in

effect — has a VA subject to a nominal floor.2 Annuities provided by

the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) also have a guar-

anteed nominal floor.3
the

In recent

years, large firms in both Canada and

United States have frequently made "ad hoc" cost—of—living adjust-

ments to the pensions of retired workers. In Canada, these adjustments
have

often been financed from pension fund earnings in excess of the plan's

valuation rate (Pesando (l98l)). Once granted, these adjustments are
again permanent. Moreover, there appears to be a ceiling on these adjustments in that the real value of the initial benefit is never increased

even if "excess" fund earnings might so permit. The second part of the
paper thus examines avariable annuity subject to a nominal floor (VAF)
and a variable annuity subject to a nominal floor and a real ceiling (VAFC).

The former is suggested by the Rockefeller plan, and both may be viewed
as an attempt to formalize the apparent practice of many firms in grant-

ing cost—of—living adjustments to retired plan members. Unlike VA's,
the cost of VAF's and VAFC's is not known with certainty at their date
of purchase.

The paper is organized as follows. The performance of a nominal,
level—payment annuity is first contrasted with that of a hypothetical

"purchasing power annuity" for the period 1971—1980. The latter is
formally equivalent to a VA backed by an index bond yielding a certain

real return of zero percent. Theoretical distributions of the real
payments from VA's tied to alternative asset bases are then presented,

3

and serve to illustrate the nature of the tradeoff between risk and

expected real returns. These payments are also contrasted with those
provided by a graduated—payment, nominal annuity. The properties of
VAF's are then explored, and simulations conducted to contrast their

performance with VA's backed by identical asset portfolios. The same
exercise is then repeated for VAFC's. To place the alternative annuity
designs in a final perspective, an historical simulation is conducted

for the period 1971—1980. A summary and conclusion completes the
paper.

1. Thel-Payment, Nominal Annuity
The nominal and real values of the benefits provided by a nominal,
level—payment annuity during the period 1971—1980 are illustrated

in Table 1. The annuity is purchased at the beginning of 1971 for the
sum of $100,000, the annuity is sold at a (nominal) interest rate of
7.5 percent, and the benefits are payable with certainty for 10 years.5

The real value of the annual, nominal payment declines by more than

50 percent during the decade. Further, it is likely that a substantial
portion of this decline was unanticipated. If the anticipated rate of
inflation embodied in the nominal rate of interest was 5 percent, then
the annuitant would have expected the real value of his benefit to

decline at about 5 percent per year.6 Deviations around this rate of
decline would then have been unanticipated.

For illustrative purposes, the performance of a "purchasing
power annuity" (PPA) for the period 1971—80 is also shown in Table 1.
This annuity is fully linked to the consumer price index and is sold at

4

a certain real return of zero percent. Earlier work by Bodie (1980)
indicates that the minimum—variance portfolio (in the absence of short
selling) consists of one—month Treasury bills hedged with commodity
futures, and that the expected real return on this portfolio would not

exceed zero percent. For simplicity, it is assumed that a portfolio
could be constructed which would provide a certain real return of zero

percent. The PPA is analytically equivalent to a VA tied to an index
bond which provides this certain real return. Although the stream of
real payments provided by the PPA is certain, there is no requirement

that this stream of payments be constant. If RV is the annuity valuation
rate used to determine the base value of the annuity payment and if r
is

the certain real return on the portfolio, then the real value of the

annuity payments will change with certainty at an annual rate equal to
(1 +

r)/(l + RV)

—

1.

(See

Appendix for details.) With r =

0

and RV = 5,

the real benefit declines with certainty at 4.76 percent per year, as

shown in Table 1. When r and RV are equal, there is no tilt to
the projected stream of real annuity payments. If the real return is
uncertain, the previous expression depicts the expected degree of tilt-

ing in the real payments stream. If pensioners wish to design a stream
of pension payments which is expected to decline in real terms, perhaps
due to liquidity constraints or estate motives, this is readily accom—
plished with vehicles other than the nominal, level—payment annuity.

The downward tilt in the real benefit provided by a nominal, level—
payment annuity is, of course, equal to the expected rate of inflation.

5

2. Variable Annuities with Alternative Asset Bases
The limitations of fixed—dollar annuities in an inflationary
climate prompted life insurance companies in the 1950's to offer equity—

based VA's. As emphasized by Bodie (1980), however, an equity—based VA
exposes the annuitant to substantial investment risk even if it is
assumed that the real return on equities is unaffected by unanticipated

changes in the rate of inflation.7 The purpose of this section is to
explore the real income streams provided by VA's with alternative
asset bases.

Theoretical distributions are presented in Table 2 for the real
benefits provided by VA's backed by one—month Treasury bills, long—term
U.S. government bonds, common stocks, and a mixed

portfolio.

(The mech-

anics of a variable annuity are detailed in the Appendix.) The mixed
portfolio is the minimum variance portfolio with the same expected return

as the long—term bond portfolio.8 The VA's are purchased for $100,000 and
benefits are paid with certainty for 15 years. The real returns on bills,
bonds, and stocks are assumed to be lognormally distributed with means of
zero, 2.956 and 7.232 percent, respectively, and standard deviations of 1.52,

7,64 and 18.61 percent. The means are the continuous time equivalents of

annual returns of zero, 3 and 7,5 percent. These parameters, together with
the covariances necessary to construct the mixed portfolio, are based on

historical data for the period l953—80. The valuation rates used to determine the base level of the annuity payments are the annual equivalents of
the

continuously compounded real rates of return. Examination of the

historical data indicates that real bill returns, but not those on stocks

and bonds, are serially correlated)0 For this reason, the theoretical
distribution of real benefit payments is also calculated for a bills—based
VA on the assumption that real bill returns are serially correlated.

6

The assumption that real returns are lognormally distributed

implies that annuity payments are also lognormally distributed. Since
the valuation rates used to calculate the base values of the benefits are
the annual equivalents of the expected real returns on the portfolios,

median benefit payments show no tendency to rise or to fall over time.11
Because these payments are lognormally distributed, they exhibit posi-

tive skewness and thus the mean payments rise steadily over time. The
distribution of real benefits provided by a graduated—payment, nominal

annuity is also included in Table 2. For this annuity, all of the
uncertainty regarding the real value of the benefit payments stems from

price level uncertainty. Thus, an additional set of assumptions is
required. The price level is assumed to be lognormally distributed, and
the continuously compounded rate of inflation is assumed to follow the
first order autoregressive process which characterizes the period 1953—

1980.12 The degree of graduation is set equal to 8 percent, which is
the (annual) steady state rate of inflation implied by the autoregression.13

The purpose of including the graduated, nominal annuity is to emphasize
the fact that while its nominal payments are devoid of risk, its real
payments are not.
The distributions of real benefit payments reported in Table 2

mirror the risk—return characteristics of the underlying portfolios. The
stream of real benefits provided by the bills—based VA is smaller and
more stable than the stream provided by the bonds—based VA, and so on.

Acknowledgement of the serial correlation in bill returns produces a
more risky stream of benefit payments, especially as the time horizon

increases. Even when this serial correlation is acknowledged, however,

7

bills remain the cornerstone of any VA which is intended to limit uncer-

tainty regarding the real value of benefit payments. The importance of
diversification is seen in the comparison of the bonds—based VA with
the VA tied to the mixed portfolio with the same expected return.
Although the median benefits are identical, the standard deviation of
the real benefit payment in the 15th year is 22 percent smaller for the
VA tied to the mixed portfolio.

Note, finally, the real benefit stream provided by the graduated—

payment, nominal annuity. We assume that the pcit expected real return
is 3 percent (at an annual rate), and is thus equal to the expected real

return on long—term government bonds.14 This assumption is equivalent
to assuming that life companies can hedge graduated—payment, nominal
annuities by holding an appropriate sequence of long—term bonds, and that
competitive pressures ensure that this is the implicit real yield at

which these annuities are sold. Because of the 3 percent return assump—
tion, the median benefits are identical to those for the VA's tied to

the government bond and mixed portfolios. The standard deviation of the
benefits provided by the nominal annuity is less than those for either of

the VA's in year 5, but significantly exceeds them by the 10th year. The
significant increase in the riskiness of real benefits provided by the

nominal annuity as the annuitant ages merits emphasis. This is a direct
reflection of the substantial serial correlation in the inflation rate.
These results, especially as the annuitant ages, illustrate how inappro—
priate it is to argue that VA's are inferior to nominal annuities because

they transfer all of the investment risk to the annuitant. The results
also highlight the importance of acknowledging the serial correlation in

8

inflation

rates in attempting any assessment of the risk of the real

benefits provided by nominal annuities.

3. Variable Annuities_with Nominal Floors
As noted, the Rockefeller Foundation Plan provides retiring
emDloyees with a variable annuity subject to a nominal floor, or VAF.
Sun Life Insurance Company of Canada has recently introduced a VAF,
tied to Treasury bills, in which "excesst' earnings above 3 percent are

also used to provide permanent benefit enrichments. The nominal floor
in each of these cases is equivalent to the plan sponsor's guaranteeing

the fund will earn at least 3 percent. If the fund earns less
than 3 percent in a given period, the plan sponsor fully absorbs the loss.
that

(The mechanics of a VAF, as well as the contrast to a standard VA, are

detailed

in the Appendix.)

The

(and

plans provided by most large firms in the United States

Canada) are defined—benefit

employee

or

pension

plans. These are plans in which the

receives a benefit equal to a given fraction of his average

of his final earnings for each year of service. Although the promised

benefits are nominal, firms —

especially

in Canada — have typically

granted "ad hoc" cost—of—living adjustments to the pensions of retired

employees. Once made, these adjustments tend to be permanent. Thus the
nominal value of the pension benefit is never reduced even if the fund

performs poorly. This is, of course, what happens explicitly under the
Rockefeller Foundation Plan, which functions as an ordinary defined—
benefit plan during the pre—retirement period.

9

If the source of these adjustments is pension fund earnings in
excess of the plan's valuation rate, and if there is no ceiling on the
size of the benefit increases, then the plan member effectively owns a

VA with a guaranteed nominal floor, or a VAF. Equivalently, he is provided with a traditional VA plus a put option on the nominal investment
earnings of the pension assets with a striking price equal to the plan's

valuation rate. The plan's valuation ratebecomes the equivalent of the
valuation rate used to set the base payment in a standard VA. If the
—-

nominal return on the pension fund is less than this valuation rate,
then the nominal benefit is unchanged and the shortfall is absorbed
fully by the plan sponsor.

Let A represent the initial amount in the fund, RV the valuation rate and (R) the measure of the risk of the nominal return that is
relevant to option pricing. The value

AVAF

(AVAF) of the VAF is:

A + Put(A, RV, 0(R))

(1)

For a given A, the value of the put option is an increasing function

of both RV and G(R). If the fund is invested exclusively in the risk—
free nominal asset and thus earns the certain nominal return Rf,

the value of the put option is zero as long as RV

Rf. On the other

hand, the value of the put option is likely to be large if the nominal

return on the pension assets is very uncertain, even if RV is well
below the expected nominal return on these assets. If the objective of

10

the plan sponsor were to minimize the value of the put option, he would

wish to set a low RV and to choose an asset base which would effectively
make the VAF into a standard VA. If the sole objective of the employee
were to maximize the value of the put option, he would —

prefer

of

course —

that the funds be invested in the riskiest asset, or common stocks.

Since the employee presumably cannot sell his VAF, he might nonetheless
prefer

that the fund not be invested in risky assets if he wishes the

real retirement income provided by the VAF to be stable. This point is
examined

below.

Simulation results (1,000 trials) are presented in Table 3 for

VAF's tied to (i) bills and (ii) the mixed portfolio described previously.
The

interest in bills reflects the fact that they represent the corner-

stone of

any low—risk stream of real annuity payments. Although still

active workers may have sufficient flexibility to vary their consumption—
saving and work—leisure decisions to permit them to assume considerable
investment risk, this is less likely to be the case for retired workers.
The interest in the mixed portfolio stems from the desire to monitor —

in

effect —

the value of the put option when the uncertainty in the

return on pension assets is increased. Since the value of this option
depends upon the nominal return on the pension fund, simulations are
performed for both a low inflation (3%) and a high inflation (9%)

scenario. The (continuous) nominal return is equal to the sum of the
stochastic real return and the continuous time equivalent of these two
inflation rates. Both low (3%) and high (8%) valuation rates are included
in the simulations for the VAF tied to the mixed portfolio.

11

When the inflation rate is 3 percent, the expected real return
of zero on the bills portfolio implies an expected nominal return of

3 percent. Since the valuation rate is also 3 percent, the floor
frequently binds and thus the put option is frequently exercised. The
result is that benefits have a higher median and a lower standard devia-

tion than do those provided by the corresponding VA. When the inflation rate rises to 9 percent, the floor never binds and the result is

identical to that for the VA. This result occurs because the combination of the high (expected) nominal return relative to the valuation rate arid the low standard deviation of bill returns ensures that

the realized nominal return always exceeds the valuation rate. Note
also that the expected real return of zero together with the valuation
rate of 3 percent causes the stream of real benefits to be tilted

downward. This is most easily seen for the VA, but occurs as well for
the VAF.

When

the

inflation rate rises from 3 to 9 percent, the put option

is occasionally exercised for the mixed portfolio. This is a direct

result of its more uncertain return. When
the interest rate used to set the base

the

valuation rate (again,

payment) is raised for a stan-

dard VA, the sole effect is to tilt the real payments stream downward

relative to what it would otherwise have been. When the valuation rate
is raised for a VAF, it has the additional

effect

of raising the value

of the put option. When the valuation rate is raised to 8 percent,
which is typical of the rates now used to value defined benefit plans
in the United States, the striking price of the option rises accordingly.

The result is a dramatic rise in the value of the put option in the low

12

inflation scenario. With an expected nominal return of 3 plus 3 equals
6 percent, the nominal return typically falls short of the valuation rate.
By the 15th year, the median real benefit is 65 percent greater than that

provided by the corresponding VA. In the high inflation scenario, the
effective value of the put option falls sharply as realized nominal returns
fall short of the valuation rate with much lower frequency.
It is interesting to note that proponents of the Rockefeller
Foundation Plan, which functions like a VAF, emphasize the importance
of investing the pension fund reserve for retired employees exclusively

in short—term commercial paper. If the nominal interest rate on short—
term securities remains high relative to the plan's valuation rate of
3 percent, the value of the put option which distinguishes the VAF from

a traditional VA will be very small. In effect, the Rockefeller Foundation Plan will have been transformed from a defined-benefit plan in the
pre—retirement period to a defined—contribution plan at the date of
retirement, with the plan's valuation rate of 3 percent used to capitalize the nominal benefits due at the date of the employee's retirement.
If inflation were to recede and thus short—term interest rates to fall,

the value of the put option would increase. Thus the annuitants stand
to gain and the plan stands to lose from a reduction in the rate of

inflation. This fact is of particular interest since the Rockefeller
Foundation Plan is widely cited as a means whereby cost—of—living pro-

tection can be provided to retired workers, perhaps implying that the
plan is particularly attractive to workers if inflation is high.

It is also interesting to note the continued emphasis in policy
discussions in Canada on investing pension fund reserves held for retired

13

employees

to

exclusively in short—term securities if "excess" earnings are

be used to provide cost—of—living protection. Since the VAF is vir-

tually identical to a VA when the value of the put option is small, the
use of "ad hoc" adjustments may simply reflect the metamorphosis of
defined—benefit into defined—contribution plans as the market response

to Increased inflation uncertainty (Pesando (1982)). Because most large
firms had already introduced defined—benefit plans, the use of VAF's —

rendered virtually ident:ical to VA's by the combination of low valuation
rates and investments concentrated in short—term securities — may be the

most convenient way to effect the rnetamorphosis.5

4. Variable Annuities with Nominal Floors and (Cj.mu1ative) Real Ceilings
In the preceding section, it was assumed that firms which provide
"ad hoc" cost—of-.living adjustments could be regarded as providing their

employees with VAF's. Although this may well be true for some firms,
the reality may also be more complicated. Firms which make ad hoc cost—
of—living adjustments may impose a ceiling on such increases, and may
also bank underwriting losses (when the nominal floor binds) as a first

claim on future "excess" earnings. In citing options for pension reform
in Canaaa, the Task Force (1979) considered an "excess" interest scheme

which contained a cumulative real ceiling. The real value of any enriched
pension could not exceed its initial level and any "excess" earnings
above the amount necessary to preserve fully the real value of the pension would be banked against future investment shortfalls.

In addition,

any underwriting losses incurred by the plan sponsor by virtue of the
guaranteed nominal floor would be banked, would accumulate at a market

14

rate of interest, and would represent a prior claim on future "excess"
earnings. Only after any accumulated losses borne by the plan sponsor
were repaid would "excess" earnings be used to enrich pensions in pay.
Significantly, this illustrative scheme was chosen for study after the
Federal government solicited input from both firms and members of the
employee benefits industry.

The most important feature of a VAFC relative to a VAF is its
(This is perhaps most easily seen by considering the

banking provisions.

case in which there is a real floor equal to the initial benefit. In this case,
the annuity would be constant in real terms and the banking provisions

would mirror the underwriting experience of a plan sponsor who provided
a fully indexed pension and held assets other than index bonds in the

pension fund.) Nonetheless, it is useful to consider the options inherent
in a VAFC without reference to the banking provisions. By virtue of the
ceiling on the real value of the pension benefit, the worker has —
effect —

sold

in

a call option on "excess" investment earnings above those

sufficient to provide full cost—of—living protection. Since the nominal
return on the plan's assets is the real return plus the inflation rate,

this is equivalent to the worker's having sold a call option on real

investment earnings in excess of the valuation rate. Let AVAFC represent
the value of the variable annuity subject to both a floor and a ceiling;

let a(r) be the measure of risk of the real return that is relevant to

option pricing, and let AVAF and A be as defined in (1). Then:

AVAFC = A +
=

Put(A, RV, o() — Call(A, RV, (r))
—

AVAF

Call

(A, RV, (r))

(2)

15

Unlike

a

VAF, whose value to the beneficiary is at least as great

as that of a standard VA, the value of a VAFC may be greater or less
than that of the corresponding VA, depending on the relative values of

the put and the call. For a given A, the value of the call option is
a decreasing function of the plan's valuation rate and an increasing

function of the risk of the real return on the plan's assets. The
value of the call option will be zero if the pension fund is invested
exclusively in a risk—free real asset and if the risk—free real rate of

return rf < RV.

As noted by Bodie (1980), there is no risk—free real

asset. A pension fund invested exclusively in bills will, however,
earn a real return which is quite stable and which has an expected

value of (approximately) zero. The value of this call option will thus
be close to zero if (1) the fund holds only bills or their equivalent,
16

and (2) the valuation rate is above (say) 3 percent.

In this case,

the value of the VAFC will equal that of the VAF. If, in addition,
the anticipated rate of inflation is sufficiently high that the nominal

bill yield significantly exceeds RV, then the value of the put option
contained in both the VAF and VAFC will equal zero and thus both will
be equal in value to the corresponding VA.
Consider first (Table 4) the distribution of real benefits by a

VAFC tied to a bills portfolio when the inflation rate is low. Because
the projected stream of real annuity payments is tilted downward (since
the expected real return of zero is less than the valuation rate), the
ceiling binds rarely and only in the initial years of the annuity pay-

out. Median benefits fall short of those provided by a VAF, primarily
due to the banking provisions, but exceed those of a VA. In the high

16

inflation scenario, the VAFC provides benefits which simply reproduce

those of a VA. This result, which was anticipated in the discussion of
(2), may be empirically relevant. If so, this might explain the apparent
lack of attention that is sometimes accorded this issue. The Rockefeller
Foundation Plan, for example, makes no reference as to whether or not

a ceiling exists on the cost—of—living increases. Because the valuation
rate of 3 percent exceeds the expected real return on a portfolio of
short—term coimnercial paper (or its surrogate, the prime rate), the

question of whether or not there is a ceiling may simply not be empirically
relevant.

For the mixed portfolio with a valuation rate of 3 percent, there
is no tilt to the projected stream of real benefits provided by the

corresponding VA. For the VAFC, unlike the VAF, the benefit payments
are similar in both the low and the high inflation scenarios. This is,

of course, due to the banking provisions. For both scenarios, the
ceiling binds frequently (i.e. ,

the

call opt ion is exercised) as evidenced

by the fact that median benefits remain at the ceiling in all years.
Although we do not attempt to explicitly evaluate them, it would appear
that the value of the sponsor's call option exceeds the value of the

annuitant's put in these two cases. Note that the median and mean benefits are lower than those of the corresponding VA in all years. Further-

more, in contrast to both the VA and the VAF, the mean benefit for the
VAFC is well below its own

median,

reflecting the reverse skewness induced

by the truncation of the upper tail of the distribution. The dramatic
decline in the standard deviation relative to both the VA and VAF is also
a result of this truncation and therefore reflects not a reduction in

17

risk from the annuitant's perspective, but rather the loss of upside

potential. Further evidence that in these two cases the value of the
VAFC is considerably less than that of the corresponding VA is provided
by Table 4' which shows the distribution of the real accumulation in
the

"bank" at the end of year 15. When this number turns Out to be

positive at the end of a simulation run it means that the years of
"excess" earnings from the portfolio were more than enough to

compensate

for the years of shortfall.

Raising the valuation rate, as noted in the discussion of (2),

reduces the value of the call option. When the valuation rate is set
at 8 percent, median benefits do exceed those provided by the VA for
all years in the low inflation scenario, lthugh they remain less than

those provided by the VAF. When inflation is high, and thus the permitted real erosion in the value of benefits is also high, the stream
of payments provided by the VAFC and VA are quite similar. The ceiling
frequently binds, but the "excess" funds so banked are then used to
enrich nominal benefits in subsequent years.
To sum up, three empirical results merit emphasis.

First, if

the pension fund is invested exclusively in bills, the VAFC will provide
benefits similar to those provided by a standard VA if (1) the inflation
rate is high relative to the plan's valuation rate and (2) the valuation
rate is (say) 3 percent or more and thus significantly exceeds the expected

real return on bills. In this case, the value of each of the put and
the call options is (approximately) equal to zero. Second, when the
expected real return on the plan's assets is equal to the valuation rate,
the real benefits provided by a VAFC are likely to be far more stable

18

than those provided by either a VAF or the traditional VA. This result,
in essence, reflects the procedure for banking the gains or losses

experienced by the plan sponsor. Third, by choosing appropriate combinations of RV and asset allocations, it would appear possible to
"cancel" the values of the put and the call (without setting each equal

to zero) and to create a number of VAFC's all having a value equal to A.
But there would have to be mutual agreement between sponsor and annuitant
about the portfolio's composition, and some mechanism for monitoring
adherence to it.

As noted, our interest in the VAFC is motivated by the possibility
that it may formalize the behavior of at least some firms which make

"ad hoc" cost—of—living adjustments. If so, and if the stream of real
payments is smoothed relative to those obtainable from (say) a bills—
based VA, then firms must be compensated for their underwriting the

attendant investment risk. In principle, this should be reflected in
compensating wage differentials. Since the VAFC does not alter the
efficient frontier, it will be the basic risk—return tradeoffs available
in the capital market which dictate the size of these compensating wage
differentials.

5. AlternativetyDs. Historical Simulations

for the Period:

Historical simulations of the nominal and real benefits provided

by VA's, VAF's, and VAFC's for the period 1971—1980 are presented in
Tables 5A-5D. As in Table 1, the initial capital in 1971 is $100,000 and
the payments are made with certainty for 10 years. VAF's and VAFC's must,

19

of course, be underwritten by the plan sponsor (or life insurance company) and their cost may exceed or fall short of the initial capital.'7
Two valuation rates, zero and five percent, are used in the simulations.

The former is the expected real return on the minumum variance portfolio
(i.e., bills) while the latter is typical of the rates actually used in

the early 1970's to value defined benefit plans.
Consider first the bill results. When the valuation rate is zero,
the real benefit provided by the VA declines from $10,100 in 1971 to
$8,794 in 1980 or by 13 percent. This erosion is only modest in view of
the substantial unanticipated inflation that appears to have occurred

in the 1970's. Because the floor never binds, the VAF produces benefits
identical to the VA. Because the ceiling binds in 1971 and 1972, thus
causing "excess" earnings to be banked for future use, the real benefits

provided by the VAFC diverge from those provided by the VA and VAF. With
a valuation rate of 5 percent, the floor binds twice (1971 and 1972)
so that the final benefit provided by the VAF exceeds that provided by

the VA. Because of the banking feature, which requires that the plan
sponsor be compensated for prior underwriting losses, the stream of
benefits provided by the VAFC differs from that provided by the VA.
The sharpest contrast among the alternative annuity designs

occurs with the riskiest asset base, which is common stocks. Consider

only the results when the valuation rate equals 5 percent. Although
this rate is less than the expected real rate of return on common
stocks, the real benefits provided by the VA, in fact, decline sharply.
This result simply reflects the poor performance of the stock market

during the decade. The value of the nominal floor (i.e., the put option)

20

is high as evidenced by the fact that the real benefit provided by the

VAF in 1980 is almost twice that provided by the VA. The tendency for
the VAFC to stablize the real stream of benefit payments is readily

apparent. In 1973 and 1974, for example, annuitants are partially
insulated from the precipitous declines in the stock market. When the
stock market recovers in 1975, however, real benefits continue to de—
dine as "excesst' fund earnings are first used to repay the plan sponsors

for the net underiting losses they incurred in the previous years.
The final comparison is between the bond portfolio and the

mixed portfolio with the identical expected return. Because of the very
adverse performance of the bond market, the real benefit by 1980 is much

higher for the VA when it is tied to the mixed portfolio. This
ex post result is consistent with the greatEr ex ante risk of the bond

portfolio. The comparisons of the results for the VA's, VAF's and
VAFC's are quite straightforward, and only the continuing tendency for
real benefits to be stabilized under the VAFC merits note.

6 Summary and Conclusion

Nominal annuities, whether level—payment or graduated, expose
the annuitant to substantial uncertainty regarding the real value of

his retirement income. The exclusive source of this uncertainty is
uncertainty regarding the future level of prices, and hence of the

future rate of inflation. Standard VA's backed by Treasury bills or
their equivalent provide much more stable real retirement incomes,

even when consideration is given to the serial correlation in real

21

bill returns. VA's backed by common stocks, long—term government bonds,
and a mixed portfolio illustrate the risk—return tradeoffs inherent in

the alternative portfolios. These should be of interest to plan sponsors
who may

wish,

without increasing their own costs, to provide increased

annuity choices to plan members.18
The cost of a VAF, which is a VA with a nominal floor, is not known

with certainty on the date the annuity is purchased and must be under-

written by a plan sponsor or life company. The plan provided by the
Rockefeller Foundation functions, in effect, like a VAF. If the objective is to provide a stable stream of real benefits, then a VAF must

also be linked to a bills portfolio. When nominal interest rates are
high and the valuation rate is low, this VAF will produce results vir-

tually identical to those of a bills—based VA. This is the case for

the Rockefeller Foundation Plan. In effect, the Rockefeller Foundation
Plan functions as a defined—benefit plan in the pre—retirement period,
and becomes a defined—contribution plan at the date of the employee's

retirement. This metamorphosis of defined—benefit plans into defined—
contribution plans appears to have occurred extensively in Canada, and

may represent a market response to increased inflation

uncertainty.

Because the "ad hoc" adjustments made by firms are never (to
our knowledge) more than those necessary to fully offset the impact of

inflation, it is likely that the behavior of many firms is more compli-

cated than that suggested by the VAF. We therefore analyze a VA subject
to a nominal floor and a real ceiling, in which underwriting losses and
gains by the plan sponsor are banked from one period to the next. Under
Stylized conditions which might well be met in practice, a VAFC tied to

22

bills would closely replicate the benefits provided by a bills—based VA.
More generally, due to the interaction of the floor and ceiling with the
banking provisions, it is possible for a VAFC to provide substantially

more stable real benefits than a VA tied to the same asset base. Because
the risk—return tradeoffs available in the capital market have not
changed, however, sponsoring firms in these cases would presumably extract
compensating wage differentials from their employees if mean benefits

were unaffected. As noted in the text. however) mean benefits will be
reduced if the implicit call option (pertaining to the real ceiling) proves
to be more valuable than the implicit put option (pertaining to the nominal
floor).

FOOTNOTES

1
For simplicity, the discussion proceeds as if the sole source of
wealth of the retiring plan member is his claim to a private pension.
If he has other sources of wealth, then the risk—return characteristics of his pension benefit must be analyzed in the context of his

total portfolio. For a discussion which explicitly focuses on
social security as an additional source of wealth, see Feldstein
(1981). See L. Summers.t paper in this volume for a discussion of the
extent to which households may be able to diversify away the inflation
risk implicit in nominal pension benefits.

2

A separate provision in the Rockefeller Foundation plan provides that
the cost—of—living adjustment equal at least 4 percent if the inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index exceeds 4 percent.
Otherwise, however, the floor is that cited in the text (Heaton (1981)).

There is no reference to a ceiling on the size of the cost—of—living

adjustments. Subsequent discussion of the Rockefeller plan ignores
the separate floor provision.

3

TIAA, which manages one of the largest pension plans in the United
States, offers its members two annuity designs which resemble VA's

which contain a nominal floor. The older of these, the traditional
TIAA annuity, has a guaranteed minimum nominal floor. This floor is

embodied in the guaranteed return of 3%. Unlike the Rockefeller
plan (which is characteristic of the hybrid annuities examined
at length in the text), this nominal floor does not ratchet upwards

over time. The asset base in the TIAA annuity consists of a portfolio

24

dominated by long—term bonds, mortgages and other fixed—interest loans.
TIAA pays to its beneficiaries a variable benefit which has been
"smoothed" relative to what it would be under a standard VA design.

by ignoring unrealized capital gains and losses on these dollar—

fixed investments. One consequence of this smoothing is that the
guaranteed rate cited previously is far less likely to bind. Another
consequence is that there can be cross—subsidization of different

generations of annuitants. Currently, for example, TIAA is paying
a total nominal rate of return of 11% to new retirees, while the
risk—free nominal rate of return in the capital markets is well in

excess of that. The interest rate used to determine the initial
benefit (called the Assumed Interest Rate or A.I.R.) is also equal to

11%, so the expected nominal benefit stream is level. Recently,
TIAA has offered its members an alternative design (called the Graded

Benefit Payment Method), which differs in two respects from the older

one. First, the expected nominal benefit stream has been given an
upward tilt by using an A.I.R. of 4% to determine the initial benefit

level. Secondly, the guaranteed nominal floor ratchets upward whenever
the interest rate declared in each period actually exceeds 4%. Earnings

above 4% are credited at the end of the year and —

in

effect —

are

used to purchase an additional TIAA annuity with its own guarantees and
dividends.

(The interest rate used in calculating the increase in the

nominal floor is the guaranteed rate of 3%.)
It

is worth noting that TIAA has been shortening the average

maturity of its portfolio in recent

Ontario's Select Committee on Pensions (1981) has recommended that
the use of "excess" investment earnings to provide inflation pro-

tection be mandated by law. No reference is made to floors and/or
ceilings in the proposed scheme, which the analysis in this paper
shows to be of crucial importance.

5

For the purposes at hand3 there is no advantage in explicitly incor-

porating mortality factors into the analysis. Mortality is thus
ignored in all of the illustrations presented in the paper.

6

More precisely, each year's real benefit would be equal to the previous year's benefit divided by 1.05.

7

In fact, real equity returns appear to be negatively correlated with

unanticipated inflation, as noted by Bodie (1976) and Pesando and Rea

(1977). Feldstejn (1980) attributes this result to the fact that
inflation raises the effective tax rate on corporate—source income.

8

The mixed portfolio consists of 52% bonds, 29% bills and 19% stocks.
We do not refer to this as an efficient portfolio for two reasons.
First, our portfolio proportions are derived from a single—period
variance—minimization procedure which ignores the serial correlation

in bill returns. Second, the efficiency of an annuity for a particular household can only be determined if we know all of the household's
other assets and liabilities.

9

As noted by Bodie (1981), the mean realized real return on bonds is

in fact negative during this period. The mean real return on bonds

26

was set equal to an annual rate of 3%, whose continuous time equivalent
is 2.956%, while the other parameters were based on the observed means,
variances and covariances.

10

First order autoregressions were performed for the logarithms of the
real annual wealth relatives of bills, bonds and stocks. The results
are as follows:

Bills: r = -.044 + .768

The real benefit in year t is given by bt = B0 .1(fRv) where B0 is the

The continuously compounded nominal interest rate (R ) is thus

equivalent to an annual rate of 11%, since the (annual) steady state

rate of inflation built into the illustration is 8%.
15

If

there were no nominal floor on

the

pension benefits, any decision

to channel pension fund reserves exclusively into bills or their

equivalent would have an unambiguous interpretation. Workers, who

28

presumably cannot diversify away the inflation risk inherent in nominal
pension benefits, are sufficiently risk averse that they will pay the
price (i.e. a low expected real return on their pension wealth) of
stabilizing their real retirement incomes.

16

Remember that the standard deviation of the continuously compounded
real bill return is only 1.52 percent per annum, so that the expected
real return of zero is about two standard deviations less than 3 percent.

17

The plan sponsor could underwrite VAF's or VAFC's on either a pay—go

or a fully—funded basis. This issue is not explored in this paper.

18

If the sponsor provides a defined—benefit plan, the lump sum necessary
to purchase the requisite annuity could be made available to the

employee, who could then choose his preferred VA. If the promised
pension is purely nominal (and the firm has no tradition of providing ad hoc adjustments), then discounting the promised payments by

the risk—free nominal rate R

(as well as by mortality) would

identify the lump sum to be offered to the employee.

II. Terms of the Annuities
For all annuities the base value of the annuity payment is determined by:

if RV=0

A0/T

B0 =
A0RV[1

—

(l+Rv)_T]_l if RV > 0

We assume that benefit payments start at the end of the first year so B0
is not actually paid Out, but rather serves as the base value for computing

the first year's benefit, B1.
For the standard variable annuity the nominal benefit is:

(l+R)

B =
and the real benefit:

b =

b1

b =

B I?

(l+r)
(l+Rv)

or

t

For a nominal annuitl Rt is nonstochastic so
—
Bt —B
t—l

(l-l-R)

(1+RV)

and the rate of graduation in the nominal benefit payments is:
(l+R)
(1-i-RV)

- 1

Note that if RV = R,

we have the conventional level—payment nominal

annuity.

For a purchasing power annuity

bt —b t—l

rt is nonstochastic so

(l+r)

(1+Rv)

and the rate of graduation in the real benefit stream is:
(l+r) 1
(l+RV)

For the VAF, the variable annuity with a nominal floor, the nominal

benefit is given by:
(l+R )

B=
t

Btj
B

t—l

(l+RV)

if

Rt > RV

if Rt—
<RV

and the real benefit by:

b = Bt/P
The VAFC, the variable annuity with a nominal floor and real ceiling,
is complicated.

The benefit calculation follows an iterative procedure that

can be seen by a sinple flow chart (Flow Chart 1).
To create an algebraic flow chart, we need some additional notation:

= Amount
=

of money in the "bank";

=

0.

Amount of money available to increase the benefit stream.

Ft = Present value of a $1 annuity due for T—t+l years at an interest
rate of RV.

B = Benefit

which would be payable in the absence of the real ceiling.

The benefit calculation follows the following iterative procedure (Flow Chart 2).
