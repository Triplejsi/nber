Exchange—Pate Policy After a Decade of "Floating't

ABSTRACT

This paper integrates exchange—rate policy into a model of exchange—
rate behavior, and examines the data econometrically to infer hypotheses
about policy behavior in the 1970s. The model shows how unanticipated
movements in money, the current account, and relative price levels will
cause first a jump in the exchange rate, and then a movement along a
"saddle path" to the new long run equilibrium. Here the role of "news"
in moving the exchange rate is clear. The model is used to analyze the
options available to the central bank that wants to reduce the jump in
the exchange rate following a real or monetary disturbance. The distinction is made between monetary policy and sterilized intervention, and a
regime in which the domestic interest rate is used as the policy variable is also studied. Systems of vector autoregressions (VARs) for each
of four countries——the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan——are estimated,
and the correlations among their residuals are studied. These represent
the "innovations," or "news" in the time series. A clear, pattern emerges
in these correlations, in which policy in the U.S. and to a lesser extent
Japan, drives exchange rates, and policy in Germany and the U.K. reacts.
It appears that U.S. monetary policy is essentially determined by domestic
considerations, with the exchange rate moving as a consequence. In Japan,
interest rates are varied in response to movement in the current—account
and relative price levels, and the effects on the exchange rate are partially neutralized by sterilized intervention. Germany and the U.K. react to movements in their exchange rates by moving interest rates, and
sterilized intervention.

I. Introduction arid Sunimarv

During the 1970s an extensive theoretical literature has developed

analyzing market determination of freely floating exchange rates. At the
same time, there has been extensive and continuous intervention in the

market by central banks. Exchange rates have not been floating freely;
they have been managed, or manipulated, by central banks. However, most
of the description of exchange rate policy, as actually practiced has been
informal,

or

"literary," not integrated with the formal theoretical litera-

ture. Recent examples are the surveys in Branson (1980) and ussa (1981).
Rather than reproduce Mussa's excellent review, in this paper I integrate exchange—rate policy into a model of exchange—rate behavior, and

examine the data econometrically, to infer hypotheses about policy be-

havior in the 1970s. I focus on four major currencies, the U.S. dollar,
the Deutschemark, Sterling, and the Japanese yen, and analyze movements
in their effective (weighted) exchange rates as calculated by the I' for
their relative cost arid price data.

In section II a model of market determination of a floating exchange—

rate is laid out. It is a rational—expectations version of the model in

Branson (1977), and it draws on the model of Kouri(1978). The model
shows how unanticipated movements in money, the current account, and rela—
tive price levels vii]. cause first a jump in the exchange rate, and then
a

movement along a "saddle path" to the new long run equilibrium.

role of "news" in moving the exchange rate, as recently emphasized by

2.

Dornbusch (1980) and Frenkel (1981) is clear. The model ernphasizes ier—
fect substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds, in order to pre—
pare for the analysis of intervention policy in section III.

Exchange—rate policy is introduced in section III. We analyze the
options available to the central bank that wants to reduce the jump in the
exchange rate following a real or monetary disturbance——"news" about the

current account, relative prices, or money. This is the policy characterized as "leaning against the wind" in Branson (1976). The distinction is
made between monetary

policy

and sterilized intervention. We also study

a regime in which the domestic interest rate is used as the policy variable.
In

sections IV and V

we turn to the data. These are described system-

atically in section IV, where

we investigate the

time—series properties of

the exchange rate, money, realtive prices, and the current account, the

short—term interest rate, and reserves for each of the four countries. It

is difficult to sarize these data, but the time—series behavior of exchange rates, money, relative prices, and current—account balances are
roughly consistent with the model of section II.
In section V we estimate system.s of

vector autoregressions (VARs)

for

each of the countries, and study the correlations among their residuals.

These represent the "innovations," or "news" in the time series. A clear
pattern emerges in these correlations, in which policy in the U.S. and to

a lesser extent Japa; drives exchange rates, and policy in Geiany and the
1LK. reacts. It appears that U.S. monetary policy is essentially deter—
mined by domestic considerations, with the exchange rate moving as a conse-

quence. In Japan, interest rates are varied in response to movement in the

3.

current—account and relative price levels, and the effects on the exchange

rate are partially neutralized by sterlized intervention. Ger.any and the
U.K. react to movements in their exchange rates by moving interest rates,
and

sterlized

intervention.

II. An Asset—Market Model with Rational Expectations

II.A. Introduction

The purpose of this section is to lay out a simple asset—market model
of exchange—rate determination within which, in the next section, monetary

policy reaction to movements in the exchange rate can be analyzed. The
literature of the l970s has identified three principal macroeconomic vari-

ables that influence movements in exchange rates. These are money supplies,

relative price levels, and current—account balances. Here I develop a representative model that explicitly includes all three elements. The model
is an extension of the asset—market model sketched in Branson (1975) , and

developed in full in Branson (1977). It is a close relative of Kouri
(1978). In the early versions of this model the focus was on the roles of
relative prices and asset markets, and static expectations were assumed.

Here the model is extended to study the effects of underlying "real" disturbances influencing the current account and to include explicitly policy
intervention in a rational expectations framework.

II.B. Asset—maret specification.
To make the analysis manageable, let us consider one country in a

many—country world. We can

aggregate

the assets available in this country

into a domestic money stock M, which is a nonearning asset, holdings of
domestically—issued assets B, which are denominated in home currency, and
net holdings of foreign—issued assets F, which are dominated in foreign

exchange)

B (for bonds) is government debt held by the private sector,

and BC is government debt held by the central bank. Total government debt

F (for foreign assets) is the net claims on foreigners held by

the domestic private sector and R is central bank foreign reserves. Total
national net claims on foreigners F =

indexed to unity, and that the central bank does not permit capital gains or

losses on R to influence N. Similarly, interest income on the central bank's
holding of R is assumed to be turned over to the Treasury so that it does not

affect N. The current account in the balance of payments gives the rate of
accumulation of F over time. The rate of accumulation of B is the government
deficit. N is controlled by central bank purchases (or sales) of B or F
from (or to) the domestic private sector.

fixed

The rate of return on F is given by ,

market, plus the expected rate of increase in the exchange rate, ê. The
rate of return on B is the domestic interest rate r, to be determined in

domestic financial markets. Total private—sector wealth, at any point in
time, is given by W

point in time, the central bank can make discrete changes in N by swapping
either B or F with the domestic private sector; these are open—market operations in government debt or foreign assets.
The demand for each asset by the private sector depends on wealth,
W = N

+ eF, and both rates of return, r and r +

&. As

wealth rises,

demands for all three assets increase. The demands for B and F depend
positively on their own rates of return and negatively on those of the

other assets. The demand for money depends negatively on both r and
r + ê; as either rises, asset—holders attempt to shift from money into the
asset whose return has gone up.

These asset—market equilibrium conditions are sunarized in equations

the domestic wealth portfolio W into the three assets. Specifying the asset demand functions as homogeneous in wealth eliminates the prive level

constraint (4), and gross substitutability of the three assets, we have

the constraints on partial derivatives of the distribution functions:

m— + b f <

Here a subscript denotes a partial derivative. The three narket equilibrium conditions (l)—(3) contain two

independent

equations given the bal-

ance sheet constraint (4). In equation (5) the bar over B indicates that
the total supply of government debt is fixed.

II.C. Asset accumulation and the current account.
Equations (l)—(6) provide the specification of asset markets in the

model. The other main building block of the model is the current—account
equation. The balance—of—payments accounts provide the identity

where X is net exports of goods and non—capital services in terms

eign exchange. Net exports depend on the

real

of for-

exchange rate e/p, private

sector wealth W, (given by equation (4) above), and an exogenous shift
factor a which represents real events such as changes in tastes in technology, oil discoveries, etc., which increase net exports for given values

of e/p and W. Thus we can write

The sign of Xe assumes the

Below we will conveniently assume that F/T = 0;

it will quickly become apparent why this is convenient. In Branson (1981),

the case where F/aP < 0

is analyzed.

Equations (l)—(7) plus the assumption of rational expectations (or,
more precisely, perfect foresight in this non—stochastic model) give us a

complete dynamic model in F and ê. Price dynamics are suppressed, but we
will discuss below exogenous price movements as delayed response to monetary shocks.

II.D. Solution of the model.
Solution of the model proceeds as follows. First, the rational expectations assumption is that ê is the rate of change of e. Then two equations

to hold the existing stock of F given the lower iiiterest. rate. The

rise in e/P generates a current—account surplus, and F rises with e fall-

form of

"overshooting."

Suppose the domestic price lve1iediate1y reacts by rising by the
same proportion as the monet stock. Then F = 0 also shifts up by that
same proportion. The extent of the upward shift in ê = 0 depends on initial portfolio distribution and the degree of substitutability among F,

shown in Figure 5. The decrease in competitiveness shifts t

to E1, and then gradually rises to E2 as

F falls. The depreciation of the currency restores current—account balance (t

The model"undershoots" in response to real disturbances.

13.

II.E.3. Sluggish price adjustment.
A limiting case of sluggish price adjustment could be modelled as a

combination of Figures 4 and 5. Expansionary monetary policy would begin
this process illustrated in Figure 4. The delayed price response would
then resemble Figure 5. To the extent that the price response is logged

and unanticipated, the e, F point would follow

a

path illustrated in

Figure 6. Quicker price response or anticipation would straighten the
path to E2, which may be to the right or left of E0 depending on initial
portfolio distribution and substitutability.

II.F. Conclusions and empirical implications.
It is convenient to summarize here the basic conclusions from the
analysis so far.

1. Unanticipated changes in money, the price level, or underlying real conditions should cause a jump in the exchange
rate toward the new rational—expectations saddle path.
2.

Thus we should expect to see correlation between unantici-

pated movements

in e and M, X, and P in the data. Some

initial evidence was presented in Branson (1981); more is
presented below.

3. Movement of the exchange rate following a real disturbance
is likely to be monotonic, while monetary disturbances are

likely to produce "overshooting." Lagged price adjustment
makes "multiple overshooting" possible. This can be seen
in a combination of Figures 4 and 6.

14.

II.G. Interest—rate control as an alternatIve to money—supply control.
In interpreting the empirical

results

on exchange—rate policy in sec-

tion V below, it viii be convenient to have a version of the model in which
the monetary authority manipulates its holdings of government debt in order
to hit an interest—rate target, and uses the interest rate as the instru—

ment of monetary

policy.

Here we take r as exogenous, fixed by policy,

and permit B/W and M/W to vary as necessary to hold r at its target value.
To solve the model under a regime of interest—rate control, we make
r exogenous and M/W endogenous in equations (8) above, and then solve for

d& and d(M/W). This yields an ê equation in the form

(12)

eF
e=*(—V—, r), *1>0 ;*2>0.

The interest rate simply replaces M/W here.

The ê

0 locus is still a rectangular hyperbola in e, F space. A

reduction in r, implying an increase in M/W and decrease in B/W, shifts
the ê = 0 locus up. Thus Figure 4 provides a qualitative description of
the effect of a reduction of the interest—rate target in a regime of mone-

tary control. The etfects of movement in the interest rate on the path
of the exchange rate are clearly the same as the effects of the corresponding change in M/W in the model with monetary control.

15.

III. "Leanins Aainst the Wind" as Exchange Rate Policy
III.A. Introduction.
There is already ample evidence that monetary authorities have gen-

erally tried to slow the movement of exchange rates. This type of intervention has long been characteristic of U.S. domestic monetary policy; in
Branson (1976) I labelled this "leaning against the wind" as exchange

rate policy. Artus (1976) and Branson, Halttunen and Masson (P2) (1977'
presented evidence that German monetary policy responded to movements

in the exchange rate in this fashion. B} (1977) estimated a reaction
function of the for-rn

czLe + ...,

with

< 0 for Germany. As the ex-

change rate rose (1DM depreciated), the money supply was reduced (relative

to its trend). Amano (1979) describes Japanese monetary policy as attempt-

ing to stabilize the exchange rate similarly. U.K. exchange rate policy
was discussed briefly in OECD (1977), where a regression of the form
= $Ae + ...,

with

r the minimum lending rate (R) arid 8 > 0 is reported.

This suggests that when sterling depreciated (e rose), the NLR was increas-

ed as a policy reaction. More recently, Mussa (1981) has presented a thorough review of exchange—rate intervention which is consistent with a
"leaning—against—the—wind" model.
The purpose of this section of the paper is to characterize policy intervention in terms of the model of section II, to prepare for interpre-

tation of the empirical results in section V below. The objective is not
to evaluate policy; it is to describe it. The main difference from the
-

previous

models is the description of intervention as instantaneous and

discrete changes In asset stocks via open—market operations to reduce the

size of discontinuous jumps in exchange rates. This type of policy behavior is discernable in the "innovation" correlations in section V below.

16.

'e will begin with the descriptfon of monetary policy reaction to
real dIsturbances via open—market operations in government

debt or for-

eign assets. Then we study sterilized intervention in the foreign asset
market.

III.B. Monetary poli.
Consider a real disturbance to the current account that shifts
F = 0 up, (rise in e) to restore equilibrium.

This is illustrated in

Figure 7, where in the absence of policy intervention, the exchange rate
would jump from the initial equilibrium E0 to

and then depreciate fur-

ther to E2. If the central bank tightened money by

selling bonds to the

0 curve in Figure 7 would

path down to the path running to E2, and reduce the exchange—rate jump to
in e.
E1. Thus instantaneous intervention would reduce the initial jump

This would be an unexpected change in N, since the originating shift in

z and X was unexpected. Sc this type

of intervention could reduce the

variability of e over time.

If the open—market operation were done in
a smaller quantitative intervention

the foreign asset market,

would give the same shift in ê = 0

and in the saddle path in Figure 7, because

eF/W in equation (8) would

rise. In addition, since P would rise, the initial jump would be to a
point on the new saddle path below E1.

Thus intervention on the foreign

asset market would, in a sense, be more efficient than open—market opera-

result that is obtions in the bond market. This is essentially the same
tained

by Branson

(1977) and Kenen (1982)

under static expectations.

In a mode]. with interest—rate control, the same result as the bond—

market open—market operation of Figure 7 could be obtained by an appropri-

ate increase in. the interest rate target. The necessary increase in
could be reduced by performing the open—market operation in the foreign
asset market.

III.C. Sterilized Intervention.
There is by now ample evidence that central banks intervene in the
foreign exchange markets but attempt to prevent the intervention from

changing the path of M. The literature was cited in Whitman (1975); more
recent results are discussed in Obstfeld (1980) (1982).

In terms of the

model of section III, this is an open—market exchange of foreign assets
f or bonds by the central bank, with LB—eLF' initially. The result is

again a downward shift in ê =

0, as in Figure 7, plus an outward shift in

F. Thus the jump in the exchange rate is to a point below E1, since
increases. This presents the possibility for intervention

F

that does not

move the path of the money supply.

III.D. Monetary disturbances.
Shifts in asset demand functions on the foreign interest rate would
such as
shift the ê = 0 locus, and the exchange rate would follow a path

that of Figure 4, at least initially. Either monetary or sterilized intervention could reduce the extent of the shift in

0, reducing the jump

in e. The central bank would vary the supplies of the three assets to
meet, at least partially, shifts in their demands by the public. Again,
this is a

straight—forward extension

reaction from the

of "leaning_againsttheWind" policy

domestic to the international markets.

18.

III.E. Emnirical Irirolications.

The principal empirical implication of the present model of policy
intervention is that we should observe the intervention in the correlation

of unexpected movements or "innovations" in exchange rates with innova-

tions in money and/or reserves. Nonetary intervention would give a negative correlation between exchange—rate and money innovations. Intervention with interest—rate control would give a positive correlation between

exchange—rate and interest—rate innovations. If the monetary intervention
is done in the foreign—asset market, a positive correlation between

exchange—rate innovations and reserves would result. Sterilized intervention would give the reserve—exchange rate correlation without a money—

exchange rate correlation. Thus we can study the correlation matrix of
innovations in section V below to infer hypotheses about policy behavior.

19.

IV. The Data
IV.A. Introduction.
The asset—market model of section II implies that unanticipated ex—
ogerious movements in the money stock, the current—account balance, and re-

lative price levels will cause unanticipated jumps in the exchange rate.
The intervention model of section III implies that unanticipated
jumps in exchange rates can cause unanticipated changes in the money stock,

reserves, or interest rates. Thus innovations in money or interest rates
may have a positive or negative correlation with innovations in exchange

rates. If the correlatIon is negative, the inferred hypothesis would be
that the underlying model is a monetary reaction function. A negative
correlation between reserve and exchange—rate innovations would indicate

exchange—market intervention. In this and the following section of the
paper we see that the quarterly data for the U.S., Germany, Japan, and the

U.K. can be interpreted in this framework. We are inferring testable hypothesis from the data in this exercise.

In this and the next section, we study relationships of movements in
the exchange rate of each country, measured by the effective exchange

rate as defined by the IN,with movements in money stocks, current—account
balances, relative prices, reserves, and interest rates.

The purpose is

to see what policy stance is implied by the data. The data are described
in detail in Table 1.

The first step in analyzing the data is to investigate their time—

series properties. This provides a compact description of the "facts,"

20.

and an initial indication of whether the facts are roughly consistent with
the theory. The time—series analysis of the data is done in this section.
Then in section V we study systems of vector

autoregressions, one for each

country, to test the relations between unanticipated changes, or "innova—
tions," in the variables.

For each variable we began with a regression on four lags, seasonal

dummies, and a time trend. We then shortened the lags by eliminating insignificant variables at the far end of the lag. The results are shown
in Tables 2 through 5, one for each country. Each column in the tables
shows the results of a regression of the indicated variable on lagged

values of itself. Coefficients of the time trend and seasonal dummies
are not shown. The regressions are performed on quarterly data for the
period 1973—IV to 1980—IV. The beginning date was chosen because it was
after the major period of disequilibrium adjustment in 1971—73, including
a major real devaluation of the U.S. dollar,

and the

last date was the most recent for which data were available when we began
the study in June 1981. The regressions were run using the jogs of e.x—
change rates, relative prices, and money, and the levels of the current—

account balance, interest rates, and reserves. The current—account and
reserves are both

regressions for the log of the U.S. nominal effective exchange rate e,

weighted by the IMF, in foreign currency per dollar. The first column
shows the regression with four lags on the exchange rate; only the lag at

t—l is significant with a coefficient of 0.86. When the lags at t—2
through t—4 are eliminated, the standard error of the estimated equation

falls a bit, and the coefficient of ei is 0.78. Thus the U.S. effective

The first regression for P/P in Table 2 gives significant coefficients

to the lags at t—l and t—2. Elimination of the longer lags results in the
second equation, with a standard error only slightly larger than the first.

The result for P/P is a second—order autoregression (AR2), with a stable
cyclical response to a disturbance.3
The next two pairs of columns in Table 2 show the univariate auto-

regression results for the two U.S. money stocks. In both cases only the
lag at t—l is significant. Both are stable first—order autocorrelations.

The next two columns in Table 2 show the autoregressions for the

current—account balance. These are run on the level of CAB, rather than
its log, since the time series passes through zero. The result is similar
to that for the money stocks.

The next three columns in Table 2 show the autoregressions for the

U.S. short—term interest rate. All four lag coefficients are significant
in the first column. In the second regression, with just lags at t—l and
t-2, the second is completely insignificant. Beyond t—l, the important
lags are at t—3 and t—4. The last of the three regressions includes only
the lag at t—l; the standard error is clearly higher than in the four—lag

regression. Rather than include in the VAR system for the U.S. in section

25.

V four (or triore) lags on the interest rate, which would greatly reduce

degrees of freedom, I decided to include only the lag at t—l. The
last two columns of Table 2 show the regressions for U.S. reserves. Only
the lag at t—l is significant, giving a stable first—order autoregression.

In the case of the U.S., then, money stocks, the balance on current

account, reserves, and the nominal effective exchange rate all follow
stable AR]. processes. This suggests that the behavior of money stocks,
the current—account balance, reserves, and the exchange rate are consistent, at this level, with the theoretical model of section II and III.
The relationships between interest rates and relative prices, and

the exchange rate is more complicated. With relative prices following
an AR2, there is at best a loose relationship to the exchange rate.

This

is consistent with the evidence of high variability in PPP in Prenkel

(1981). The higher—order process for the interest rate suggests that it
is being moved by all the exogenous variables simultaneously, rather than
reacting systematically to, or causing directly, the exchange rate.

IV.C.2. West Cerman.
Table 3 shows the univariate autoregression results for Germany. The
format is exactly the same as for the U.S., so the discussion can be brief.
As in the U.S. case, the nominal effective rate, the money stocks,
and the balance on current account all follow AR1 processes in Germany.

The German relative price series is AR2 with a stable cyclical response
to disturbances.4

The Ger-man interest rate is AR1 with a lag coeffi-

cient close to unity. Reserves have a barely significant lag at t—3, but
but can be approximated by a stable AR1. Thus the impression from the
German data is similar to the U.S., except for the additional possibility
that the interest rate is used as a policy instrument to control move-

ments in the exchange rate.

IV.C.3. United Kingdom
The U.K. results are suarized in Table 4. Both the nominal effective rate and the Ml money stock in the U.K. have coefficients of unity

on the t—l lag, indicating that they follow a random walk. The relative
price series is AR2, as in the U.S. and Germany, but with a stable mono—
tonic adjustment response to disturbances.
In the first regression for the current—account balance, there are

no significant lag terms. Thus the U.K. CAB is best described as random
around the path described by the trend and seasonal dummy terms. This
suggests that the innovations in the CAB in the U.K. should not be inter—
preted as conveying information about future movements in the exchange
rate.

5

Both the interest rate and reserves in the U.K. follow second—order

autoregressions, with stable cyclical responses to disturbances. This
would be consistent with interest rate policy being used to control
reserves.

3. The U.S. and German e.xchange—rate and current-account
series are first—order autoregressions, and the Japanese

are second—order. Thus these movements in exchange rate
are consistent with movements in the current—account balance, while the U.K. CAB contains no information about
its future path.

4. The U.S. and German exchange—rate and reserves follow AR?

processes that could reflect intervention. The U.K. and
Japanese interest rates and exchange rates follow consistent processes, AR]. and AR2

respectively.

V. Emirical Results Using Vector Autoregression

V.A. Introduction.
A useful technique for studying the relationships between the innovations in money, the current account balance, relative price levels, interest rates, reserves, and the exchange rate is vector autoregression

(VAR). Here each variable of a system is regressed against the lagged
values of all variables (including itself) in the system, to extract any

information existing in the movements of these variables. The residuals
from these "vector autoregressions" are the innovations — the unanticipated movements ——

in

the variables. e can study the correlations of

the residuals to see if they are consistent with the hypotheses implied

by the theory of sections II and III. The vector autoregression technique is introduced and justified by Sims (1980). A clear exposition is
presented in Sargent (1979). Interesting and instructive applications
are discussed in Taylor (1980), Ashenfelter and Card (1981), and Fischer
(1981).

Here I estimate systems of VARs

for

each of the four countries, the

U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan. Two systems were estimated for each
country. Both include the effective exchange rate e, the current account
balance CAB, and the effective relative price PIP, the interest rate IS,
and reserves R; the difference between the two

and the other M3. An

obvious

is

that one includes Ml

extension of the research would be to in-

clude cross—country effects, particularly of money stocks, but also the

other variables. The difficulty in proceeding in this direction comes
from the limited number of quarterly observations: 29 from 1973—IY to

30.

1980—IV. Each VAR

includes

lagged values of four variables, a time trend,

and three seasonal duies. In order to expand the analysis, I am presently moving to a monthly data base.

Before estimating the VARs, one must consider the issue of the timing

of the data. The effective exchange rate can be computed from public information on a daily basis. In fact, a UK effective rate is published
daily in the Financial Times. Our data are averages during the quarter.
The effective rate used here is the inverse of e as defined in sections

II and III. Money stock data are available on a weekly basis, so they
are roughly contemporaneous with the exchange rage data. Our money data
are end—of—period. We would expect from section II that the weekly changes
in N would generate nearly simultaneous movements in e. Thus the innovation of the average e over a quarter would be most closely connected in
our data with the innovation of the end—of—quarter money stock, which is

the cumulation of the weekly innovations. Reserves are also end—of—period
data, so that intervention to slow an unanticipated jump in e would appear
as an innovation in reserves.

The relative price data are quarterly averages of monthly data, which

become known soon after the month finishes. Thus in our data set1 the innovation in e would be most closely connected to the innovation in P/Pr.
Interest rates are also quarterly averages, so that if the interest rate
were used to control the exchange rate we would see a correlation between

the innovations in e and in IS.
On the other hand, the data on the quarterly balance in current ac-

count are not announced until well into the following quarter. Thus to

31.

the extent that the innovation in CAB signals a change in the equilibrium
real exchange rate, it is the innovation in

CABt 1 that moves et.

The VAR residuals to be correlated, then, are those of

CABi. IS, and R. We will use a

et

(P/)

to designate residuals from the VARs.

The variables in each VAR system are listed in Table 6. The number of
lags included in each variable was determined by the univariate autoregres-

sion of Table 2 through 5. This constraint provides a convenient way to
limit the number of regressors and conserve degrees of freedom. A next
step in research would be to re—estimate the VAR systems with additional
lags to see how much information is lost by application of this constraint.

After the VAR systems are estimated, we correlate their residuals to

study the relationship among innovations. The correlations are givenfor
the systems with Ml and M3 in Tables 7—14 below, two for each country.

Each table includes the correlation coefficients among the VAR "innovaton"
and in parentheses the probability of that correlation occurring under the
null hypothesis that the true correlation is zero.
In discussing the correlations, we will focus on

the correlations particularly relevant for analyzing exchange—rate de-

termination and policy. Detailed discussion of all the results would be
far too tedious.

V.B. United States
The correlations of VAR innovations for the U.S. are shown in Tables

7 and 8. Remember that here the effective nominal exchange rate is defined in units of foreign exchange per unit of home currency, the inverse

of the theoretical definition of sections II and III. So here an increase
in e is an appreciation.

The first rows of Tables 7 and S give the correlations of exchange—rate innovations. The negative signs for relative prices and money are consistent with
innovations in those variables driving e, as in the model of section II. There
is a weak correlation with reserves, consistent with intervention. Innovations
in reserves, shown in the last columns of Tables 7 and 8, are positively corre-

lated with innovations in CAB, but not in money. It is useful here to recall
that

during the period in which the actual CAB occurs.

The underlying vector autoregression for e (not sh here) also

interest rates and intervention. The negative correlation of the interest rate and CAB innovations suggests that interest—rate policy may re—
spond to the state of the CA.B

as

well as to the exchange rate. The lack

of correlation between money and reserves or exchange rates indicates

sterilized intervention. The correlation between CAB and R also supports
the intervention hypothesis.

Thus the German data suggest fairly strongly a

situation in which

(a) price and exchange—rate innovations go together, and (b) the authorities react to exchange—rate and current—account movements through changes
in interest rates and sterilized intervention.

This is consistent with

the earlier results of B (1977) and of Herring—MarstOn (1977) for the
fixed—rate regime.

with interest—rate and intervention policy reacting to innovations in e
and CAB with Mi unsterilized.

V.E. Japan

The results for Japan are shown in Tables 13 and 14. Let us focus
on Table 13 first. The correlation of innovations in the exchange rate
and interest rate suggest a system of interest rate control with policy
targets other than

the

exchange rate, rather than reaction to exchange

rates as in the U.K. and Germany. The correlations of the interest rate
with relative prices and the CAB suggest that these might be the targets.
The reserve correlations with the exchange rate and CAB strongly suggest "leaning—against—the—wind" intervention, with the central bank ob—
sorbing part of the CAB innovations to reduce movement in the exchange

rate. The lack of correlation of Ml with reserves on the exchange rate
indicates sterlization.

An interesting story emerges from the Japanese correlations. They
suggest that policy sets interest rates with CAB and P/P among the objec-

tives. The interest rate moves the exchange rate, as in section II, and
the authorities intervene to, in a sense, neutralize this effect. They
also attempt to sterilize N]. from all of this.

The VAR system with M3 is consistent with this story in term.s of

signs of correlations, although significance levels vary from the Ml sys—

tm (in both directions — see the correlation of IS and CAB).

An interesting view of how the monetary system and interdependence

The

My interpretation, or inferred set of hypotheses Is as follows.

U.S. sets monetary

policy,

largely by controlling quantities, with do-

mestic objections most in mind. The market looks to innovations in
money and relative prices, and levels of the current—account balance,

to set the U.S. exchange rate. The monetary authority attempts sterilized intervention occasionally.

In Japan, interest rates are set with

relative

prices (or rates of

inflation) and the current—account balance among the leading objectives.
Interest—rate innovations move the exchange rate, but an attempt is
made to neutralize this effect through sterilized intervention.

Movements in the U.S. and Japanese effective rates, caused partly
by fundamentals and partly by policy, are mirrored instantaneously in
the U.K. and German effective rates, and their policy reacts.

The re-

action appears as "defensive" interest—rate movements sensitive to
exchange—rate and CAB innovations, and largely sterilized intervention
in the foreign

ecchange

market. Thus a consistent story in which do—

mestiGally—oriented policy in the U.S. and Japan is transmitted in the

U.K. and Germany is consistent with the VAR

innovation

results.

One final issue appears in the relations among exchange—rate and

interest—rate innovations. The correlation in the U.S. is negligible,
while in the U.K. and Germany it is strongly negative.

An implication

is that innovations in the dollar prices of the DM and Sterling should

be negatively correlated with innovations in the U.S.—German and
U.S.—U.K. interest differentials, as noted by Frenkel (1981).

The

36.

hypothesis advanced there was that nominal interest rates and exchange

rates were both reacting to changes in inflation rates. The alternative
hypothesis provided here is that U.K. and German interest rate innovations are policy reactions.

FOOTNOTES

1.

Since the analysis here applies to any single country in the international financial system, I use the terms 'home' and 'foreign' to denote
the country being discussed and the rest of the system, respectively.

At the level of generality of this discussion no damage would be done
if the reader substituted U.S. for 'home country', 'dollar' for 'home
currency' and 'Fed' for 'central bank'.
2.

Since F is home claims on foreigners less home liabilities to foreigners, an asset swap which exchanges a claim and a liability with a f or—

eign asset—holder is a transaction within F, changing claims and lia-

bilities by the same amount. This transaction would leave F and B unchanged. The reason for using this particular aggregation will become
clear when we study dynamic adjustment below. Basically, we want to
define net foreign assets consistently with the balance of payments and
national income and product accounts, which record the capital account
balance as the change in U.S. private holdings of net foreign assets.

The assumptions outlined above make N and B non—traded assets. This
implies that the total stocks of N, B, and F in domestic portfolios
are given at any point in time.

Note that the German price equation would not invert due to multico—

A moving average specification of the equation for the U.K. CAB was

also experimented with, with no improvement in results. The U.K. CAB
does seem to be random about its trend.

The Japanese VAR results were re—estimated using a four—quarter lag
on reserves, without much change.
