Trade Structure and Transmission of Inflation:
Theory and Japanese Experience

ABSTRACT

The international price linkage in a single commodity model
can be explained trivially by the law of one price or the cpantity

theory of money. In this paper, we formulate a simple sectoral,

general equilibrium model with money. The transmission of price
pressures from the world market to nontradable sectors of a domestic
economy depends on industry structure, and the size of the direct

substitution effect and the indirect money and income
effect through the balance of payments. The structural model
is then empirically implanented for Japan, 1956—77. Various
dynamic simulations conducted show both the overall magnitude of
imported inflation and the relative importance of three major
channels of transmission (price, money and income) in Japanese
inflation during the period covered. These results imply that
closing of one channel of transmission such as the monetary
channel by a completely sterilizing monetary policy does not
insulate the domestic economy fran foreign price disturbances.

TRADE STRUCTURE AND TRANSMISSION OF INFLATION: THEORY AND JAPANESE PERIENCE

"Imported" inflation has been the subject of increasing concern but not

enough attention has been given to how the structure of the econon,r
affects the nature and process of the transmission of inflation. Many
models of inflation in an open econort,r (Brunner and Meltzer (1917), Parkin

(1977), Laidler (1976), Branson (1975), Thrnovsky and Kaspura (19Th) and
others]

or

either combine

"domestic" and "foreign" factors in an ad boc manner

rely on aggregate real—sector modelling. The aggregate, one—comxrodity

approach,

however, conceals the forces that lie behind sectoral

transmission of price pressures. The international price linkage in a
single commodity model can be explained trivially by the law of one price

or by the quantity theory of money. The transmission of inflation from the

world

market to a domestic econorrrT, however, is inherently a two—stage

process: first, the direct linkage between the world market and the tra—
dables

sector of the domestic econonbr, and second, the subsequent spillover

to the nontradables sector.

The sectoral, multi—commodity approach is, of course, basic in international trade literature, but its implication for the price linkage is yet

to be explored fully. As pointed out by Jones and Corden (1976), in a
relative—price model of tradables and nontradables, devaluation cannot

improve

home balance of trade without creating an excess demand in non—

tradables sector. The inflationary pressure created in the nontradables——
unless offset by government anti—inflation efforts specifically addressed
to this market——underscores a necessity for a more general analysis which

includes the income and money as well as the relative price effect.
The Scandinavian theory of inflation !Aukrust (1970), Edgren, Faxen and

Odhner (1969)] recognizes the importance of the structural problem, but the
transmission in that model is entirely supply—determined, contingent on the

—2—
assumption of constant factor shares and constant mark—up.' A recent paper
by Katseli—Papaefstratiou (1980) emphasizes consumption substitution in the

tansmission of inflation, but in a framework where the monetary channel
connecting the balance of payments and the money supply is not recognized.
The purpose of this paper is two—fold:

first, to construct a simple

model of international price linkage for an open econorrry which incorporates

both the direct price channel due to substitution in production and consumption, and the indirect channel through the impacts of the balance of

payments on the money supply and income. The transmission of inflation
from the world market to a domestic econon,r is viewed as a two—stage

process: first, the direct linkage between the world market and tradables
sector of the economy, and, second, the subsequent spillover to the nontra—

dables sector. The theoretical analysis suggests a possible conflict between the direct and the indirect effects, and emphasizes the importance of
the structure of the economy in international transmission of inflation.

Second, the structural model suggested in the theoretical analysis will
be

implemented empirically for Japan and simulated dynamically for the

effect of various foreign shocks. Estimation is on annual data from 1956

to 1977. Japan is an interesting and fitting case, because its trade
structure is easily identifiable and because its capital account is basically dictated by the trade balance——thus effectively exogenous as in our

model——rather

behavior
coupled

of

than the other way around. The debate on the relative price

primary versus manufactured commodities in the world market,

with dependence on raw material imports and exports of finished

products within the export—led growth strater, provides an added reason
for interest in the Japanese experience. "Partial" simulations will also

—3—

be attempted to highlight the relative importance of the three nnjor channels of transmission——price, money and income——in Japanese inflation. The

results

suggest that closing of one channel of transmission such as the

monetary channel by complete sterilization by the ntnetary authority, does
not insulate the domestic econony completely from foreign price disturbances.

1. The Model
-

Our model is a monetary general equilibrium framework with tradables,

nontradables and money. To allow for an exogenous change in external terms
of trade, tradables are further divided into importables and exportables,
but overall categorization of tradables versus nontradables is maintained,
that is, substitution is between tradables——or one kind of tradables——and

nontradables, not within the tradable goods. Such specification permits
focusing

often

attention on the "exposed" versus "sheltered" sector distinction

stated in the literature, which is important for our present

purpose.2
The model focuses on the linkage between the world prices of tradables

and the domestic prices of nontradables through commodity trade for a small

country case under the fixed exchange rate regime. A price increase in the
world rrket is first imported to domestic tradables sector of the econony
through commodity arbitrage. The resulting increase in price of tradables
relative to nontradables then triggers substitution of consumption from the

former to the latter. Productive resources, on the other hand, will shift
from nontradables to tradables. On both counts, the prices will increase
in the nontradables sector. Further there is a indirect channel through
the balance of payments. The relative—price change affects the balance of
trade, which, given exogenous private capital flows, will affect the money

—'4—

supply and income. The price of nontradables will be affected accordingly.
We assume that capital flows,

exchange

world prices of tradables, and the

rates are exogenous; exogeneity of capital flows is a minor

problem in Japan, since, over the period of empirical work, the Japanese

government had de facto controls over capital flows. The "small country"

especially with respect to export prices, may prove a bit
troublesome. However, for the interest of volume growth, the Japanese
assumption,

generally are known to be reluctant in using their potential monopoly power

to raise export prices in the world market. The assumption of fixed
exchange rates potentially is

a

serious problem for the latter half of the

period under consideration. This assumption was dictated by our choice of
annual data in view

of

our interest in structural issues in this paper.

Experiments under the fixed—rate assumption, however, are still of

rele-

vance, since the yen experiences in the l97Os were marked as naich by the
"exogenous" government interventions——which can be accommodated in the pre-

sent model——as the free market forces. The fact that Japanese balances of

payments were nowhere near zero during this period testifies that the real—
world "managed floating" after 1972 in Japan includes a high——even
dominant——element of "fixed" exchange rate regime. A dumxrrj variable

is included in the empirical model to capture irçflications of different
exchange regimes.
Suppose a domestic supply, Q1 of commodity i——in and t denoting non—

and tradables respectively, with

the latter including importables (z)

and exportables (x)——that is a simple positive function of the amount of
inputs

engaged in production process (Fl) and the productivities of

such inputs (FR). Total factor employment is assumed to be demand—

—5—

determined, hence a negative function of its om input prices (q).3

that sector relative to others, nrasured by output prices. The signs

Domestic demand for a comntdity (Di) is of standard form: negatively
related to its own price (p-) and positively related to the prices of

substitutes and to money income (y). Commodities are assumed to be gross

substitutes and norl goods.5

Both the demand and supply equations are assumed to be homogeneous of
degree zero, so that prices and income can be defined either real or nomi-

nal. Since the price linkage is the present objective and since the
foreign exchange rates are not meaningfully defined other than between two
money prices, we will take money prices and money income as our arguments
in these equations.

An

()

equilibrium in nontradables requires

Qfl (..)

The supply and the demand in tradables, however, need not balance, the
difference being the balance of trade. Since the world supply of the

—6—
country's importables (Z) is assumed to be infinitely elastic at given
world price pZ*, actual equilibrium imports (z) can be written in a similar
form as home import demand, zd = DZ (..)

Supposing foreign demand for exportables is a positive function of

The balance of payments

The equilibrium condition in money market consists of the simple quantity theory equation adjusted for an open econoIr according to the

monetary

approach to the balance of payments. Nominal demand for nney is directly
related to money income (y) by the Cambridge k, and the money supply includes

both domestic (H) and international components (R) of the monetary base.

If the g is taken to be constant, then there exists a one—to—one

correspondence between the world and the domestic prices of tradables. No
such relationship exists for nontradables, in contrast to the monetarist
models where

the law of one price implicitly is extended to all goods.

The rodel presented above is a simple, but fairly comprehensive one,

which includes both the direct price
tion

effect due to substitution in consump-

and production and the indirect money and income effects through the

balance of payments. Our approach is in contract to the single—channel

treatment generally seen in the existing literature on international inflation [see Krause and Salant (1911), for instance, for survey of this

literature]. Yet, the model adopts several salient features of the
existing models described in the literature. The characteristics of the
Scandinavian model are retained in our model by sectoral disaggregation of

the econonr and inclusion of the supply—side effects. The element of the
monetary approach to balance of payments is recognized in our money—supply

equation which includes international component of money supply. A
Keynesian spirit can be found in the sterilization possibility recognized
as well as in the tradable—goods equilibrium which incorporates net
exports.

—8—

The system can be summarized by three equations describing the
equilibrium in nontradables (equation 3), the balance of payments (equation
6), and the money—market equilibrium (equation 7), plus the commodity

arbitrage equation for tradables (equation 9). The price of tradables in
(9), however, can be substituted in domestic demand and supply equations

underlying (3) and (6). With total differentiation, the system can be
solved for changes in money income (y), money price of the nontradables
(pn), and the balance of payments CBP) under the fixed exchange rate

system. Capital—account variables (NF, CF) are taken as given. Exogenous

A rise in the world price of tradables directly causes a rise in the
domestic price of tradables through the law of one price given the trade

barriers and the exchange rates. This rise in the domestic price of

—9—

tradables

will then be spilled over to the nontradables sector both through

the direct price channel due to substitution in consumption and production
between sectors, and through the indirect channel through changes in the

balance

of payments, the money supply and income.

In the price elasticity formalae, the first terms which contain Nt, t=x
and z, reflect the direct impact spillovers from tradables to nontradables
due to the price effect of substitution in consumption and production. The

third terms represent the indirect effects that operate through the balance
of payments (the bracketed term), the money supply (ms), and income (DT).

The middle terms, with both Nt and B in the expression, reflect general—

equilibrium consequences of the direct impact spillovers: a rise in the
price of nontradables as a result of the direct spillover from the trad—
ables due to substitution nay affect the balance of payments, which——
following the money/income channel——may in turn affect the price of nontrad—

ables. This contrasts with the indirect effects which start with an initial increase in the price of tradables. A pictorial view of the chains of
transmission in the case of the fixed exchange

— 10 —

Several interesting points enrge. First, the overall impact of
transmission depends on the relative size of the direct and the indirect

effects. The direct price spillovers through substitution are positive, but
the indirect effects depend on demand elasticity. When import demand is
elastic, the indirect price effects are positive. With inelastic demand,
however, the indirect effects on nontradables ceteris paribus are negative.

The overall impact on the price of nontradables, therefore, depend on the
demand—reducing

(hence deflationary) effect of the balance—of—payments

deterioration, and the demand—increasing and the supply—reducing (hence

inflationary) effects in the nontradables market due to consumption and

production substitution.

With elastic import demand, the indirect effect (of a change in the

price of the irnportables) reinforces the direct price effect, but offsets
it when import demand is inelastic.1 The conclusion from the conventional
one—commodity transmission model which, by definition, predicts
uni—directional price changes is supported only when import demand is

elastic. This highlights the importance of the industry structure——
tradables and nontradables——in the transmission of inflation, insofar as the

indirect

effects depend on the import demand elasticity, and the general

level of prices is a weighted average of the two different sectoral
prices.

Second, the case of an increase in foreign income is a special one in
that

it involves the indirect channel of adjustment only: there is no

direct impact spillover due to substitution (or the general equilibrium
consequences

of it naturally). The effect in this case is straight—

forwardly positive on the price of nontradables.

An Empirical Application

In

this section, the structural model suggested in the theoretical

analysis will be implemented empirically for Japan using the annual data from
1956 to 1977.

While

modifications were necessary in individual equations

to comform to Japanese realities, the overall empirical system basically

matches the theoretical construct in all important respects. In particular, the system contains, as required, three major channels of
transmission both over time and across equations.. A potentially difficult

problem of identifying the industry structure turns out to be not difficult:
Japanese exports are almost entirely manufactured goods and over 80% of

all

imports are primary commodities. Services, and products from other ter-

tiary industries in national income accounting, plus construction, are
defined nontradables.

— 12

—

Estimation is done by the ordinary least square or the Cochrane-Orcutt

regression method. In the case of the latter, indicated by the presence of
an autocorrelation coefficient, p, a specification of the lag structure is
required

in system solution. The full empirical ntdel is provided in

Appendix I. Definitions and the data sources of the variables are in
Appendix II.

The system consists of four sectors. The first direct price—linkage
sector relates the world prices of Japanese exportables and importables to

the domestic prices of the same commodities. This is done in two steps:
first, through the "law of one price" equations estimated in logarithmic
form,. and, second, through the bridge equations connecting the domestic

prices of actual imports and exports with those of import—competitive pro-

ducts (primary industry) and potential exports (manufacturing industry).
In
of

the foreign trade sector, real goods import is a log—linear function

the relative price between imports and nontradables, real wage rate, the

foreign

exchanges available from goods and services exports plus net trans-

fers and capital flows, and the oil shock dummy. Inclusion of the
available foreign exchanges reflects an observation that the Japanese eco—
nont,r

has grown basically export—dependent. This takes a role of income

variable left out due to its domination of the relative price term which is
important

in our context. The magnitude of the coefficient of the relative

price term indicates that Japanese import demand is in fact inelastic due

to her dependence on raw material imports. Exports are estimated directly
in value form; a real export equation performs poorly. Arguments included
are foreign income measured by the trade—weighted index of real GDP's in
developed (Japan excluded) and developing market economies as aggregated in

— 13 —

U.N.,

Yearbook of National Accounts Statistics, the price ratio between

exportables and nontradables, and the l913714 oil—shock dumw. Real
domestic GD? is also included to capture negative domestic demand pressure.

In the monetary sector, the money supply comes from the monetary reserves
of both domestic——exogenously controlled by the monetary authority——and

international——related

to the balance of payments——sources. The elasticity

of the money supply, Ml, with

respect to reserve is rather low (0.31)

in

the short run but unity in the long run. The usual demand—for—money func-

tion, which includes the interest rate as its argument, is not included for

two reasons: it is difficult to implement empirically in Japan and it is
not important in our theoretical analysis. Following the convention in
Japanese macro econometric modelling,12 the real and the financial sectors

are

linked, instead, through domestic credit.

In addition, a dumny

variable is included to measure possible structural changes since the
start of the flexible exchange rate system in the 19105.13
Finally, the domestic sector determines real income and the price of
nontradables.

The real income depends on dorrestic credit and imports of

goods and services——which represent two important factors for Japanese
growth as most Japan—observers would agree——plus a post oil—shock dumrrw and

a lag. The income equation should be viewed as an equilibrium condition

where the real balance of domestic credit is a shift (increase) parameter
in aggregate demand, and where increased access to imported materials simi-

larly

boosts the aggregate supply. This specification of an equilibrium

output would appear to be more satisfactory than the usual hypothesis of
demand—determined

(for developed econony) or supply—determined econonv (for

developing econonw), given the fast—track growth of' Japan in the postwar period. This takes us a bit out of the theoretical specification, but

— 114

—

enables us to identify the income (output) channel of transmission
separated from the monetary channel, which would not have been possible
with a pure demand—determined income equation.

A change in income affects the price of nontradables through the

wage

rate. The wage rate depends on the general level of prices——the GDP

deflator—— and the real GDP reflecting general activity level. The real
GDP is used in lieu of the conventional demand—supply gap measures such as

unemployment rate or the capacity utilization rate. The conventional
measures are thought to be relatively unimportant in Japan, the reasons being

the importance of "life contracting" in the labor market, and the high and

fairly steady growth of the Japanese econox,r in this period. In any event,
the wage rate is but an intermediary in the indirect channel of
transmission,

Simulation

connecting the income and the price of the nontradables.
Results

The model performs fairly well in its ability to track the Japanese
experience during the period under consideration. Mean absolute errors for
the l14—year simulation period (1963—1916) are 1.5% for the price of nontrad—

ables and 2.0%

for the GDP deflator.

Indeed, errors are rather small if

considers that the model is basically a "transmission" model without a

one

fully—developed

domestic sector, and that the present simulation includes

volatile years of the 1970s.

The model can be simulated for the impacts of various "foreign" shocks.

The control solution is obtained

solving iteratively the dynamic system

after storage of the single—equation residuals as additive adjustments in

the

in

constant term. The storage of residuals enables us to impose the shock

the vicinity of real world numbers, which is important in a non—linear

— 15

—

such as the present one since the system response to a shock nay not
be independent of initial values.
system

We experiment with three "foreign" shocks: (a) a 10% increase in the
world price——in the U.S. dollars——of Japanese imports; (b) a 10% increase

in

the world price of Japanese exports;

and (c) a 1%

increase in the level

of real GDP in foreign countries, computed as a Japanese trade—weighted
average of index of real GDP's in developed and developing regions of the

world. In addition, a series of "partial" simulations were experimented

with

an eye on highlighting the differential impact of each channel of
transmission. All shocks were exogenous, and were sustained over the sintu—
lation period. The shocks were computed as percentage deviations rather
than absolute deviations, to minimize the impact of volatility in the underlying series.

The theoretical analysis suggest that, under the fixed exchange rates,

the general level of domestic prices is affected by a rise in the world
prices of the country's ixuportables in the following ways:

(a) positively, due to an increase in domestic prices of importables via
comnndity arbitrage, and entry of these items in the general price
index;

(b) positively, as a result of an impact spillover of the price pressures
from tradables (importables) to nontradables due to consumption and

production substitution via the direct price channel; and

Cc) positively or negatively, depending on whether import demand is
elastic or inelastic, asa result of an improvement or deterioration
of the balance of payments, and the resulting increase or decrease in

— 16

the

—

nnney supply and income, in the absence of effective offsetting

government policy.

The overall effect, therefore, is unambiguously positive if import

demand is elastic. With inelastic import demand, however, there is uncertainty on the direction of the change in the price of nontradables with a

in import prices, depending on the relative strength of the spillover

rise

due to the direct price effect——(b)——and the deflationary forces of the
balance—of—payments deficits due to the indirect nney and income

effects——(c). The same possibility exists for

the general level of prices,

the presumption here is much stronger towards

but

a positive effect, owing

to the direct entry of imported consumer goods in the price index——k).
The introduction of a supply shock facilitates separation of the
supply—determined

output/income effect from the demand—determined money

effect. It, however, complicates the analysis further. Barring Giffen
goods, real imports (of foreign inputs) will fall with a rise in the price
of foreign inputs which would——through the production function——reduce the

real

GDP. But,

whether

the value of imports will decrease or increase according to

import demand for foreign inputs is elastic or inelastic, hence the

effect on the balance of payments, real income, and prices are in general
uncertain.

The

simulation results for 1963—76 with the three exogenous shocks are

provided in Table

1. The numbers in the table are the percentage

deviations between the shocked and the control solutions, and can be viewed
as

elasticity nultipliers——percentage changes in domestic prices I uiit

percentage changes in the shocked foreign variables. The results from the
0iniport—price shock confirm that Japanese import demand is inelastic with

As indicated by the net positive impacts, in the nontradables, the
positive

direct price spillover outweighs the deflationary effect of the

balance—of—payments deterioration with a rise in import prices. However,
the price changes are significantly smaller in nontradables than in the
tradables, as implied by higher percentage impacts, as shown in the table,

These results support what Kravis

and Lipsey (1978) had found for other

that sectoral price differentials are both substantial and per-

sistent, and contrast with such aggregate or the monetarist models which
assume or predict long—run homogeneity in sectoral prices.
All in all, a io% sustained increase in the world import prices brings
about a 0.6% increase in general level of prices in the first year, with its

peak effect reaching 2% in the sixth year. The time it takes to the peak

sector in our model. Effects on the price of nontradables are

lower with the impact effect of 0.2%, and the peak of 1% only. The

stability of the system is evident not only in prices, but in real GDP
which tends towards the original level (deviations tend towards zero),
although there exhibits some

fluctuation in trade figures in later years

reflecting general uncertainties of the 1970s. The balance of trade
remains out of balance, suggesting again a possible non—homogeneity in

The effects of the export—price shock are similar to those of the
import—price shock, except that the ambiguity is removed. Since the value

Simulation Results

To continue on this note of differentiation among various channels of
transmission, a series of "partial't simulations were carried out, i.e.,
simulations

the

with one of these channels turned off. The first "partial"

experiment blocks the entry of iruportables and exportables to the price
index.

The sec,ond simulation disconnects the relationship between the

international reserves and the money supply, so that the money supply is

effectively exogenized. The third experiment removes the real—imports term
in real—output equation; the income effect not associated with the money
effect

is hence closed off. These three "partial" models were simulated

with imposition of 10% shocks on import and export prices.

Tables 2 and 3 report the dynamic simulation results from these

"partial" experiments. In the case of an import price shock (Table 2), it
is immediately clear——by the comparison with the "full" simulation results

(Table U——that the effects on the domestic prices are minimal if the

direct price channel is closed.

In fact, the impacts on the price of
nontradables turn negative in later years, as the deflationary effect of
the balance—of—payments deterioration with inelastic import demand over-

takes the small initial price spillovers.15 With closing of the monetary
channel, the effects of the import—price shock are greater than under the

"full" simulation, since the deflationary indirect effects are now eliminated. Similarly, the removal of the income channel facilitates the direct
price impact to rise above the full simulation case, but by substantially
smaller margin compared to a case when the money channel is closed. This

— 21

—

"perverse" result that the price impacts can be greater under partial than
under

full simulation arises from the fact that Japanese import demand is in-

elastic; the closing of the money and income channels in this case removes
the deflationary effect of the balance—of—payments deterioration,

the

hence

transmission effects are greater without them.
The relative importance of these three channels is nore clearly seen in

the case of an export price shock. None of the partial simulations now

yield the price transmission effects which exceed those of full sinulation.
Table 3 presents the losses in transmission for each of the three partial
simulations,

as compared to the results from the full simulation. Numbers

in the table are the differential price effects in the nontradables sector
under

partial simulations, over the results from the full simulation,

for the case of 10%

increase in export prices.

It is apparent that the losses are greatest if

the

closed. The price channel is especially dominant in early years, while

the money and income effects are initially insignificant and gain strength
over time. In the 8th year, the monetary channel——measured by losses if

it

is closed off——reaches a parity with the price channel. Toward the end of

lb-.year simulation, the monetary channel, however, declines while the price

channel still retains 46% loss ratio. The income channel reaches its peak
at 31% loss in the 7th year, which is significantly lower than 19%

loss in the 9th year if the monetary channel is closed off. These
results from partial simulations suggest that serious biases may exist in
many aggregate models of transmission which do not specify the direct price

channel [Darr (1978) for instancel)-6

Summary

—

and Conclusions

We have constructed a simple, yet comprehensive model of the price

linkage between the world market and the domestic, nontradables sector
which includes major balance—of—payments adjustment mechanisms. The struc-

tural equations suggested in the theoretical analysis have been implemented
empirically for Japan and simulated dynamically with several "foreign"
shocks.

The main theoretical conclusion is the importance of the industry

structure in international transmission of inflation. The reason is the
possible conflict that may exist between the direct price effect due to
production

and consumption substitution in nontradables sector, and the

indirect money and income effects that operate through changes in the

balance of payments in tradables sector. Further,

demand elasticity, the two sectors may react

also proves the specialty of the alleged monetary "insulation"

complete "insulation" is possible by the monetary sterilization,

only when there is a single commodity, or when the direct price effect is

The simulation results provide some evidence of the "imported" infla-

tion in Japan. Due to

the inelastic import demand, sectoral differences in

responses to an import—price shock, hiever, are maintained. The

prices are sectorally more homogeneous in the case of the export price

The results from the more "special" case——the foreign inconE shock——

and from "partial" sinnlátions provide a clue on the relative magnitude of

various channels in Japan. The importance of the direct price channel

underscores the possible downside bias that nay be present in some

existing studies where only the indirect channels——mostly the money effect

at that——are specified. A foreign real shock is shown to impact differently from a foreign price shock; the former works through the indirect
channels only, while the latter operates through the direct as well as the
indirect channels of transmission.

The

magnitude

of the imported inflation estimated for Japan, however,

be qualified in terms of the several important deficiencies of the

model: exogeneity of the exchange rates, and the validity of the
"small—country" assumption for Japan. The theoretical section, being a
comparative—static analysis, suffers from the lack of dynamics involved

with the inflationary transmission. The implications of capital flows,
expectations, and others can also be examined in future studies.

FOOTNOTES

(1976) suggest merging the Scandinavian model with
the Phillips curve. However, such a direct marriage would seem rather
awkward since both cannot be the price equation; one of them should
either be entirely passive or determine some other variable than

1. Branson and 1vrhrinan

price.

2. This specification is also consistent with the multi—commodity corn-.
parative advantage model, where substitution takes place between

neighboring comdities only in the comparative advantage hierarchy,
with nontradables in the middle separating the two kinds of tradables.
This view implies that all comnDdities potentially are tradables
except for natural and nan—made trade barriers.
3.

The nDdel is not completely general since the factor prices are given
exogenously. A sufficient condition for the negative sign for import

prices is that factor supply is perfectly elastic at given factor
prices. This assumption allows for factor unemployment.

h. Commodity definitions are given, i.e. , the possibility of commodity
reclassification as a result of changes in prices is not addressed in

this

5.

paper.

The case of complementarity can easily be incorporated by changing the
signs of the cross price terms.

6.

The elasticities of P with respect to three domestic variables
(H, q and PR) can be obtained likewise. The effects of q and PR
depend

on trade structure as do those of world prices. Interestingly,

the results confirm conclusions from the Scandinavian theory in which
the price in the sheltered sector is a positive function of the
productivity differential between

the advanced exposed——tradables----

sector and the lagging sheltered—--nontradables——sector. See Choi
(1980).

7. No similar complications are present with respect to export prices
under our assumption of elastic world market. The unit—elastic import
demand will side with whichever case that has definite results. The

"small country" assumption made here is actually more restrictive than
all that is necessary is greater elasticity of world demand
for exportables than domestic supply of exportables, and greater
elasticity of world supply of inrportables than domestic demand for
importables.

necessary;

8.

The importance of the industry structure is obvious with inelastic un.port demand since the direct and the indirect effects work in opposite
directions. With elastic import demand, these two effects are of the
same sign, but

general

the industry structure would still natter as far as the

level of prices is concerned, since there is no reason to expect that the resultant change in the price of nontradables is identical to the change in the price of tradables.

this is true only in terms of

reduction of the number of
channels, since the reduced number of transmission
channels does not necessarily mean a reduction in the magnitude of
price pressures that are transmitted.
Strictly,

10. Hanada and Makoto (1978) profess a similar view in a two—country
model which employs a standard supply—dominated international trade
model combined with the Phillips curve.
11. The collapse of the general open—econonrj model to a closed—econow
case requires——in addition to the balance—of—payments being zero——

assumption of a-single commodity, the absence of the relative
price terms in the sectoral demand and supply equations, or a discarding of the law of one price equation.

of uncertainty and information.
