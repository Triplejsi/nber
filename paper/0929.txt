July 1982

Taxes and the User Cost of Capital for
CXvner-Gcupied Housing

ABSrRACT

Owner-occupied housing is said to be favored in the tax code because

rrortgage interest and property taxes can be deducted in the conputat ion of

one's incate tax base in spite of the fact that the returns from owner—
occupied housing are not taxed. The special tax treatnEnt reduces the
user cost of capital for owner-occupied housing.

The issue treated in this paper is the rreasuremant of the tax rate

to be employed in the user cost calculations. It is argued that different
tax rates are appropriate for the tenure choice and quantity—demanded

decisions, and that these values depend on the detailed tax posit ion of
the household and the mathod of finance. Average 1977 tax rates for
households in different incoma ranges are calculated using the NBER TAXSIM

microeconanic data file on individual tax returns.

Taxes and the User Cost of Capital for (Xvner-Cocupied Housing

Patric H. Hendershott and Joel Slemrod
The C*-iio State University and the University of Minnesota
CXvner-occupied housing is said to be favored in the tax code because

mortgage interest and property taxes can be deducted in the cauput at ion
of

'S inccfl tax base in spite of the fact that the returns from

owner-occupied housing are not taxed) This favored tax treatment should
generate a higher haTcmnership rate and greater demand for housing by
owner—occupiers than would otherwise exist. Saiie recent attempts to

rrasure

these impacts include Rosen (1979), Rosen

King (1981)

and

Hendershott (1980). The method

and Rosen (1980),

employed is to measure

cost of capital for owner—occupied housing and to
the tenure choice and per unit housing demand decisions to

the real user

relate

both

this and

other variables.
The issue in this paper is the rieasureTnt of the personal income

tax rate employed in the user cost calculations. Usually this tax rate
(r) is labeled the marginal tax rate of the household with little further
discussion. In the most detailed analysis, Diamond (1980) has argued

that T depends intricately on the particular tax position of the household,
including the household's nonhousing deductible expenses relative to its

standard deduction. We contend not only tbet t depends on the detailed

tax position of the househOld but that different values of T are relevant
to the tenure-choice and quantity-demanded decisions of the same house—

'Even if interest were not deductible, owner—occupied housing is favored relative
to investments that are taxed in that households do not pay taxes on the returns
on their equity investment in the house,

hold. For the tenure-choice decision, the relevant tax variable is the
average tax savings per dollar of expense due to being an owner rather than

a renter of housing. For the quantity-demanded decision, the appropriate

tax variable is the tax saving due to a marginal dollar of owner-occupied
housing related expenses.

The present paper is divided into five sections. The first is dewted
to the conceptual neasuremant of r for the tenure—choice and quantity—

demanded decisior.. Section II describes the assunptions and precise
mathodology underlying the calculations of the tax rates and presents

a variôty of relevant household data by inceme class. In Section III, the
NBER TAXSIM file (see Feldstein and Frisch, 1977) is employed

to calculate

the relevant T' s for households in different inca ranges based upon

tax retums filed for 1977, and these -r' s are then ccared with those
employed in other studies. In Section IV, we speculate on the impact of
abandoning the assusption of an exogenous tax law. Section V offers sciiie
concluding remarks.

I. Incci Taxes and Housing fcisicis
Consider a household with labor incone Y and wealth W. This wealth

can be invested at the interest rate i. Say that an inccine tax systan
exists in which rising marginal tax rates (t) are applied to additional
incone increnents (A). If this household chooses to rent a housing unit
valued at V, the householdt s incc* after taxes and housing expenses (Y) is:

housing related deductions, and R Is the rental outlay on the house. If this

enter the taxable incczre base. Because taxable inconE is reduced relative to
the renter case, kn and tktn (given a progressive tax system).
Of course,

households can choose the alternative of a standard deduc-

tion (STD). If S'1D>NIIE for renters, then NIlE should be replaced by S'D in

equation (1). For owners, NIlE + (T+a1)V is replaced by SIT) if the latter
exceeds the foniier. Note that the implicit interest on equity in the house
is excluded froni taxable incone whether or not the household itemizes.

t is the relevant personal incone tax rate, is the depreciation

(maintenance) rate and is the expected rate of increase in the price of the

house. The user cost is the product of the price and the sun of the real
after—tax interest rate, the depreciation rate, and the net property tax
rate. The issue in this paper is the rneasurerrent of T.
First consider the owner' s decision regarding how much housing to purchase.

The relevant price is the opportunity cost of an incrntal dollar of housing. Ignoring the expected capital gain and depreciation ten that have no
tax implications,3 we can calculate C/V by finding —3Y/V fran equation (2')

2These include: zero transactions costs, static expectations regarding future
inflation, interest, and tax rates, and treatment of debt and equity as earning

while equation (3) includes an imputed net (of depreciation) appreciation term
as a negative cost.

which is the foregone inconE (opportunity cost) due to purchasing a house.

As long as the owner is an itemizer at the margin of purchasing nore housing, then

_aI3v equals (l.tk)(i+rp). Thus in this case the appropriate interpretation of
T is tk the marginal tax rate. However, if at the margin the standard deduction is taken, then

this is equal to (i+t)V —R less the difference in federal tax liability

(the tenns in brackets) corresponding to the two altematives. This latter
difference is a canplicated temi depending on the marginal tax rates and

optional itemizing status in the renter and owner situations.

The results derived here are illustrated graphically in Figure 1.
The taxable inectre base is on the horizontal axis, and the marginal tax rate
is on the vertical axis. Assune for the mcnient that SI'D<NHE (the taxpayer

is an itemizer regardless of tenure choice) and ignore the vertical dashed

line in the figure. The tax rates paid on the last dollar of taxable incctnes

underlying the computations and discuss our data set.

The Underlying Data

SalE relevant data are listed in Table 1 by AGI (adjusted gross incaie)

class. In 1977, virtually half of households (husband-wife family, other
family, and primary individuals) had inconE under $10, 000 while only 1.6

percent had inconE over $50,000. Nonetheless, households on the bottom

half of the inconE ladder earned only one-sixth of total incare, while the
highest 1.6 percent earned over 10 percent.
Both the horneownership rate and proportion of households that itemize
rise nDnotonically with in cone . This correspondence is not coincidence,

as is indicated by the very high percentage (97) of itemizers who pay

property taxes (i.e., own homes). Ckily a quarter of all households itemized
in 1977, but over 90 percent of households with incorre above $40, 000 did

(less than 5 percent of households on the lower half of the income ladder did).

Table 1 also lists the average property tax paynEnts of itemizers by incalE
class and their implied house value (PrAX/ where

0.0154). Ncniteniizers

and renting itemizers create a problem in that property taxes (and thus those

value) are not available. Half of nonitemizers are owners, and hypothetical

house values must be attributed to all renters in the calculation of their
taxable incczre if they were owners. For these purposes, the V's in Table 1

are attributed to nonitemizers and renting itemizers with incams in the
relevant ranges.

The final problem is estimation of potential NilE for nonitemizers. It

is invalid to assii that the distribution of NHE' (conditional on incar, if
this explains potential deductions) is the same for nonitemizers as it is
for itemizers because the choice of nonitemizing status itself depends on
potential NIlE'. Specifically, we 'wt)uld expect that potential NIlE' will be

lower for the nonitemizers than itemizers and that the crucial surplus
standard deduction will be higher. Thus, any calculation of
only will be biased upward as an estimate of average

for itemizers

in an income class

because it tends to include mere people who have extraordinarily high NilE'
(and possibly PThX and INT). We have developed a procedure for generating

an unbiased distribution of NilE to be attributed to non itemizers and have

employed it in our calculations of the . This procedure is described in
Appendix B The average values of the imputed surplus standard dedactions are

presented in Table 1, beside the actual average values for itemizers. As
expected, they are uniformnly higher for nonitemizers than itemizers.

III. Estimated Tax Rates
The estimated tax rates are reported in Table 2. Begthining with the
itemizers, the difference between

and t1 axe not large. We do find
for the lowest and the three highest incae classes, i.e., when

NilE is especially low or high. In the $20.-30 thousand range, t1 slightly
exceeds F1, reflecting S!ID NHE. For nonitemizers, the tN s are roughly

The results of these calculations are

While the

individual

and t1 are not that different, significant differences in the
h1 and the y.o. lead to a large difference in the relevant aggregate tax
rates to employ is user cost calculations for the two distinct housing
decisions.

As noted in the introduction to this paper, the nDst detailed earlier
study is that of Dianond (1980). He correctly recognizes the relevance of
both the implicit income earned on owner's equity (the entire financing cost,

not jist c. of it, lowers the taxable incane base) and the "surplus" standard
deduction (STD -

NIlE

acts as an offset to deductible housing expense

including the equity cost — in the calculation of ). Furthenre, he distinguishes between the tax rate effects on the tenure and housing demand decisions.
Hcvever, his calculations, which refer only to the median inCC1T, husband—wife

family that itemized, differ fran those we prested for this group in two ways.
Ci a conceptual level, Dianond does not distinguish between the marginal

tax rates relevant to the quantity demanded decision and to the calculation

of .

In a progressive tax system, the former will be less than the latter.

In teniE of the synbols employed in the discussion of Figure 1,

tk<tm The

rate utilized by Dianond (tm) for both calculations is greater than either
of these rates. Thus, his t for the quantity—demanded decision, 0.22, exceeds
the 0.191 we have caiiputed.

(Ii an empirical level, Dianond assumes that nonhousing deductible expenses
for the median-income, husband-wife family anounted to $880 in 1977. Thus,

,320 (the standard deduction of $3200 minus $880) of the deduction; due to
owning a house are assumed not to provide a net reduction in taxable incai.

This anounts to 50 percent of our estimate of the total potential tax reduction

-20-

to owning." In contrast, our results utilize the average anDunt of non—
housing deductions actually reported by itemizers in canputing the excess

standard deduction, or $758. Thus, only 17 percent of the total potential
tax reduction due to hareowning is lost in our calculation. As a result,
]lLanxiid's calculation of

is, by our conputation, only 0.110, far less than

our 0.179.

Rosen and Rosen (1980) assurr that the nidian (incane) household would

itemize, which is correct given anew and the current i, but they use historic
housing expense deductions based upon far lower a and i values. Application

of their nEthodology to 1977 would give a tax rate of about 0.2, or 44 percent
greater than the household-weighted econonp-wide value we propose for explaining

tenure choice.
deLeeuw and Ozanne (1979) employ a tax rate of 0.30 in their analysis

of the quantity-derrnded decision. This rate is cc*nputed as an inconE—

weighted average of imrginal tax rates of owners, i.e., is equivalent to tA
Data fran the Brookings tax file for 1970 were enployed. While the procedure
seens appropriate, the 0.30 rate is too high. Owing to bracket crep, we would

expect tA for 1970 to be less than that for 1977, i.e., 0.274. We suspect
that deleeuw and Ozanne used actual housing deductions for 1970 based on

historic at s and i's rather than anew and the i for 1970.
IV. A Ik)ssible Extension: Ehdogenous Tax Law

In our view, the principal weakness in the present analysis is the inplicit

assurrption that the tax law (the t1 and S'ID) is fixed for all tinE. This is
not a particularly appealing assumption, and it could be irrportant to the cal—
culation. of the tax rates relevant to housing decisions.

That is, 2,320/ (i +)V =0.5.

—21—

Consider the t1. If governnnt expenditures financed by incone tas
are expected to grow over tinE as a share of (NP, then the t1 would be
expected to rise. Experience in the U. S. over the previous decade would

have led a rational household in 1977 to expect rising t, even net of pert—
ôdic tax 'Tcuts." Higher future t1 would raise both TA and tA if they, like a,
were ccinputed in a discounted present valus manner, although the increases

would likely not be substantial.
Future expected changes in &ID might have a greater impact. In 1977,
26 percent of households itemized, virtually, all of which were hcnEowners.

f all of these owners refinanced at I = 0.09 with an , a new of 0.6 then

practically all owners would itIze. Of course, at any point in tine
many owners will have a's less than 06, sai far less. Nonetheless, with
no further changes in I and no change in S1D, the proportion of households

itemizing could well double. This would alnost certainly lead the Treasury

to seek, and Congress to legislate, a major increase in
The inact of an increase in STD on the tax rates relevant to housing
decisions depends on the incoma level, preferences for housing, and non—

housing deductible expenses of households. The impact of an increase in

S'ID to S'ID* on and t depends on the vahe of SID* relative to values of
NHE and deductible housing expenses, as shown in Table 3. For very high
ncone households, both

and t would be unaffected; for scmethat lower

incan', alone would decline; for low to noderate incone households, both

and t would decline. Because the economy-wide average tax

rate relevant to the quantity-demanded decision (tA) is incone weighted,

the decline in this rate would not be large. In fact, given the expectation

increases in the standard deduetion have been defended on the grounds
of reducing the proportion of itemizing households and the additional adntinisstrative and conipliànce costs itemizing entails. See, for example, Senate
port #91-552 on the Tax Reform Act of 1969, pp. 584—586.

of rising t discussed above, our estimate of tA is probably reasonable, However,
the economy-with average tax rate relevant to tenure choice is household weighted.

Thus a significant increase in SI!) weuld undoubtedly lower A significantly. As

a result, even our low 0.137 estirrate is probably too high. That is, the tax
rate relevant to the tenure decision on an economy—wide basis is probably less

than half that relevant to the quantity demanded decision.
V. Surrnary

Conceptually, the tax rate5 relevant to the quantity demanded (t) and tenure

choice (T) decisions are different, although which is higher is unclear. With
no excess standard deduction (with S'ID<NIIE), thon, t( But with STD >NHE, we

could easily have t >.
In 1977, t —

<0.02 for itemizers in each of our six income classes.

Thus, for example, t and are quite close (0.191 and 0.179 respectively) for
itemizing husband—wife families with the madian inccire (in contrast to Diamondt s

calculations). For nonitemizers (with SI!) NIlE by definition), t is greater
than T by as much as 0.08. In percentage terns, t is over 25 percent greater
than

for over 60 percent of these households. Thus it appeare to be important

to distinguish between t and in a microeconanic study that includes nonitemizers.
C an economy-wide basis, we compute tA = 0.274 and TA = 0.137. This

result follows from the different weighting schemas employed in the calculations.

The weights for the incoma class t s are the portion of total honEowner i.ncone

eamed by hareowners in the various incone classes; the weights for the incone

class ' s

are the portion of total honeowners in the various incone classes.

Thus, the appropriate tax rate to use in the computation of the user cost employed
in the estimation of an aggregate tenure choice equation might be only half
that employed in the estimation of an aggregate quantity demanded equation.

tppendix B
A Procedure for Cenerating a Distributioii of Nhousing Deductions for Nonitemizers

In order to calculate t' and for nonitanizers, a value for potential
nonhousing-related deductions is needed. It is invalid to assurre that the
distribution of NilE' (conditional on incon, if this explains potential deductions) is the sane for nanitemizers as it is for itemizers because the choice
of nonitemizing itself depends on potential NHE'. Specifically, ve would
expect that potential NHE' will be lower for the nonitemizers than itemizers.

Thus, any calculation of T for itemizers only will be biased upward as an

estimate of average T in an incon class because it tends to include nore
people who have extraordinarily high }]E1 (and possibly PTAX and INT).
We generate an unbiased distribution of NHE1 for nonitemizers as

follows. Assi that NilE and housing related expenses [H = (i+cd )V I
are described by the following nodel:

possible because reasonable values of H'

and

NIlE' are nonnegative, but the

nonnal distribution cbes not, of course, recognize such economically mean ing-

This procedure encountered the problem that the dispersion of the estii.ted
was so large that a very large fraction of the
distributions of H1 and
imputations of

ended up being either zero or the standard deduction. In

order to generate a rrore reasonable distribution, the maximum likelihood

procedure was re-estimated on a san1e of taxpaying units with AGI less than

$50,000. By eliminating the high incon nonitemizers fran the sanpie, the
estin.ted dispersion was substantially reduced. However, the fraction of

imputations at the extren values was still quite high. To reduce the
frequency of this, the imputations used a variance—covariance structure

equal to one-ninth tines the estimated values. Thus, in the reported
