Estimating Distribution Lags in Short Panels with an
Application to the Specification of Depreciation

Patterns and Capital Stock Constructs
ABS TRACT

In

this paper, we investigate the problem of estimating distributed

in short panels. Estimates of the parameter of distributed lag
relationships based on single time—series of observations have been usually
lags

rather imprecise. The promise of panel data is in the N repetitions of
the time—series that

identified

it contains which should allow one to estimate the

lag parameters with greater precision. On the other hand,

panels tend to track their observations only over a relatively short time

interval. Thus, some assumptions will have to be made on the contribution

of the unobserved presample x's to the current values of y before any
lag parameters can be identified from such data. In this paper we suggest
two such assumptions; both of which are, at least in part, testable, and

outline appropriate estimation techniques. The first places reasonable
restrictions on the relationship between the presample and insample x's
while the second imposes conventional functional form constraints on the

lag coefficients. The paper concludes with an example which investigates
empirically how to construct a "capital stock" for profit or rate of return
regressions.

ESTIMATING DISTRIBUTED LAGS IN SHORT PANELS WITH AN APPLICATION TO
THE SPECIFICATION OF DEPRECIATION PATTERNS AND
CAPITAL STOCK CONSTRUCTS

I. INTRODUCTION

The problem we deal with in this paper arises, as is often the
case in econometrics, because we do not have all the data that we

would like to have. We often expect that changes in our independent
variables have relatively long lasting effects, but have only fairly

short time series to uncover them. Consider, for example, the simple

model
y

t

wx
+x
Ot
it—i

mt—rn

t

where we have suppressed the constant term for simplicity of exposi-

tion. Here in + 1 is the total length of the lag structure and the
problem we wish to consider arises when rn is large relative to T

or to T + 0 , where

T is the total number of observations on y

and 0 is the available number of lagged observations on x • A
typical example might be T = 20

,

in = 6 ,

and

0 = 2

.

In

this case,

one would have to give up )4 observations on y to get the whole lag
"in", and estimate 8 parameters (including the constant term) on the

of i6

basis

observations.

The resulting estimates are unlikely to be

very precise. One way of gaining precision is to impose additional
structure on the w's , choosing the form of the lag a priori —— poiy—
nomial, geometric, etc. Alternatively, one may try to increase the
sample

in some other dimension, adding more individuals, states or

commodities. The sample becomes then a time—series panel with N x T

observations.

—2—

A significant number of panel data sets are now available. Though
N in these data sets is often quite large, it is not yet clear
whether they will yield "better" estiraates of distributed lag coef-

ficients. Part of the problem lies in the fact that panel data sets
usually track their observations only over a rather short time inter-

val. Thus, if in the example introduced above T + 0 were less than

seven while m > 7

,

we could not estimate any of the coefficients

consistently (as N grows large) without bringing in additional
information. The problem is, of course, that in short panels the

contribution of the unobserved presample x's to the current values
of y (or the truncation remainders) are likely to be particularly
important. Since the value of the truncation remainder is determined
by the lag coefficients and the presaniple x's one has to constrain
either the lag structure, or the stochastic process generating these
x's ,

in

order to identify any of the coefficients of interest. The

first alternative has been discussed in the context of a single time
series by Klein (1958), Dhrymes (1971), Maddala and Rao (1971),

Pesaren (1973), and others. In Section III, we discuss how their
solutions can be adapted to the panel data situation. Because there
are usually many more degrees of freedom available in panel data, we
concentrate on solutions which do not restrict the lag coefficients a

priori. Section II considers, therefore, the problem of estimating a
sequence of unrestricted lag coefficients when one is willing to
impose some structure on the stochastic processes generating the x's
The models we deal with allow for the possibility of individual—

specific time—invariant unobservable factors which impact both on y

given past x's and on the distribution of the x's themselves (they

—3—

allow for heterogeneity and correlated effects). We consider explicitly the identification of lag coefficients when the regression func-

tion of recent xs on all past values of x and an individual specific constant term depends only on this constant term and a small

number of the immediately preceeding x's .

Examples of stochastic

processes which statisfy such assumptions are mixture processes consisting of individual—specific components plus an integrated auto-

regressive deviate. The parameters defining this process may differ
from year to year (they need not be homogeneous over time). It is
shown that given this assumption one can identify the leading lag

coefficients without nking any assumptions on the shape of the rest
of the lag distribution and test for alternative simplifications (for,

e.g., that there is no individual—specific component, or that the lag
coefficients, at least after a few free lags, have an autoregressive

structure). These assumptions do not allow, however, for the identification of the tail of the lag structure (at least not without

further restrictions). One cannot provide answers to questions
involving the entire sequence of the lag coefficients (such as their
sum) without imposing constraints on the lag structure itself (Sims,

l9T4). On the other hand, the early w's are often of significant
interest in themselves, especially since unconstrained estimates of
their values may provide an empirical basis for restricting the tail

of the lag structure in further work. This brings us then to
Section III where we discuss the estimation of distributed lag coefficients from panel data when one is willing to restrict the shape of
the lag structure a priori.

_14_

An advantage of using the approach discussed here is that, in
general, it can be checked against the observed behavior of the data.

The tests we consider consist of a set of constraints on the second

order population moments of the vector r '

= (y

',

_]_

x')
_i

; where y

is the T element vector of observations on y for individual i ,

and

x

is the T + 0 vector of observations on x •

In most cases

these constraints are restrictions on the matrix of coefficients

obtained from the regression of each of the T y 's on all
it

(T + 0) of the x

it

's .

In

each of our models this matrix, labelled

II by Chamberlain (1918), consists of a combination of the lag coef—
ficients of interest, and of the regression functions of the unobserved components (the truncation remainders, and the individual—

specific sources of heterogeneity), on x.
We conclude with an empirical example. It consists of regressing
the operating profits of firms on a distributed lag of their past

investment expenditures. The example, therefore, investigates empirically how to construct a "capital stock" for profit or rate of return

regressions. We find that the lag coefficients rise monotonically
over the first three periods and then remains fairly constant over the

next four or five. This differs significantly from lag structures
based on straight line or declining balance depreciation schemes (in

both of these the lag coefficients decline monotonically in T ).
When we compare the fit of the equations estimated from our models to

the fit of a system of regressions functions based on the usual capital stock constructs (net or gross), our equations do quite a bit

better. On the other hand, when we compare the restricted

II matrix, we find that we

can, using traditional testing procedures, reject the null hypothesis

embodied in our assumptions. It is doubtful whetherthe relationship
between profits and past investments is truly stable over different
firms and time periods.

set of unknown finite parameters.

Here (and in the discussion below) E*(z1 z) is the operator
which provides the minimum mean square error linear predictor (or the

regression function) of z1 given z2 .

Some preliminary comments on

Al are in order. For ease of exposition we have omitted time—specific
constant terms from it and from all equations to be introduced below.

Since we will be concerned with the limiting distribution of the para-

meter estimates in dimension N (holding T fixed), time—specific

—6—

constant terms, if required, can be added without creating any addi-

tional estimation problems. Al does assume that the distributed lag
coefficients do not differ either over time

or

between individuals

(though random differences in these coefficients as defined for
example by Swairty, 1910, are covered by Al). Note, however, that the

model does allow for individual—specific constant terms (the a ).
1
This permits one to deal explicitly with the problem of unobserved
individual—specific components which are constant over time and affect

both the conditional distribution of .

given the x sequence

corresponding to individual i and the marginal distribution of x.

Given the a

,

we are also assuming that u is not correlated

it

with either the x's observed prior to, or those observed after,

period t

[i.e., E*(uj x, D) = o]

.

Since the models presented

here will, in general, be overidentified, one may, in any particular
example, wish to relax the assumptions of constancy of the lag para-

meters and E*(u. x., D.) = 0

These assumptions do, however, allow

•

for a relatively straightforward exposition of our results concerning
the estimation of lag structures in short panels.

distribution.

The

leading coefficients in each equation are, in fact, esti-

mates of the leading lag coefficients. As t increases, one gradu.-

ally uncovers the lag structure. Of course, if T + 0 is small rela-

tive to p ,

we will not be able to build up much information on the

tail of the lag distribution. This simply reflects the fact that
short panels, by their very nature, do not contain unconstrained

information on that tail. However, even when T + 0 is small, the
initial consistent estimates of the first few lag coefficients pri—
vided b (14) may

contain

enough information on the lag structure to

allow one to restrict it to be a member of a family of distributions
which depend on a small number of parameters and concentrate on esti-

mating those parameters thereafter. This gets slightly more complicated when there is also heterogeneity, a topic which we turn to now.

11.2 Identification With Heterogeneity

Recall that the reason for dealing explicitly with the x was to
allow for the possibility of unobserved individual—specific factors

which cause differences in both

given all the individual's past

—12—

x's

,

and in x.

It follows that if there is heterogeneity, A3

is not likely to provide a good approximation to the regression func-

That is, if

past

y conditional

on all

x's has an individual—specific component, and the diverse unob-

served factors which lead to that component have an independent effect

on insaniple x's ,

then

these same factors are likely to have an inde-

pendent effect on presample x's •

The simplest way to incorporate

this possibility into our framework is to allow the regression func-

tion of presample on insample x to depend directly on the a

That is, we would drop A2 of the last subsection (thus allowing for
heterogeneity) and replace A3 with the assumption

A simple example where the restriction is relevant is provided by
Mundlak (1961). In that article, the problem is to estimate a

11.3 Some Further Considerations: Estimation and Testing

Having discussed the identification of the lag parameters under
alternative assumptions, we turn now to the consideration of some
issues associated with the choice of estimators and test statistics
for such models.

In the context of panel data one is interested in the limiting

properties of estimators as N (the number of individuals) grows
large, and these depend on how the sample moments behave as the sample

grows in this dimension. Chamberlain (1982) provides an explicit
discussion of the properties of alternative estimators of II and of

relevant test statistics under the assumption that the N obser—

III. Distributed Lags from Panel Data with Prior Structure on the Lag
Coefficients

As noted earlier in order to identify any of the lag coefficients
from panel data one must impose some structure on the relationship

between the truncation remainders and the observed data. The last section discussed the possibility of restricting the relationship between

presample and insample x ; in this section we consider restricting the
lag coefficients themselves. The particular example we focus on is a
sequence of lag coefficients which, after a few free lags, has an auto—

result no longer applies. In particular with large N as in

also Pesaren, 1973).

One further point is worthy of note. In this section we have not

restricted the relationship between presample and insample x in any
way, and as a result the

II matrix resulting from assumptions Al and

A5 are not, in general, nested inside the

II matrices of Section II.

If, however, in addition to A5 we assume A2 or AI of the last section,

then the

II matrices from the models in this section can be

simplified further (the additional restrictions are straightforward
special cases of the restrictions developed in Section II) and the

models presented here will be nested to those presented in the last
section. Thus, if either A2 or A14 were relevant, and the initial consistent estimates of a free lag distribution obtained from the techniques developed in the last section indicated that one of the simple
lag structures satisfying A5 seemed plausible, one could test and then
estimate this lag structure in a second round.

IV.

AN EXAMPLE: ESTIMATING THE SHAPE OF THE DEPRECIATION FIJNCTION

A common empirical construct is the "stock of capital" based on

some variant of the perpetual inventory method. It is, in fact, a
distributed lag function of past investment expenditure with the

depreciation formula implying a set of lag weights (w's). These
weights are, usually, assumed a priori based on mortality assumptions
(straight line, geometric, etc.) and some scattered evidence on the

length of life of selected assets. Alternatively, one accepts the

—27—

depreciation assumptions used by firms and reported in their annual
statements, even though they n.y be heavily affected by tax and other
accounting considerations that have little to do with the economic

measure of depreciation one is after. In general, there is no obvious
unique right way to construct "capitalt'; it all depends on the purpose

for which such a variable is to be constructed (Cf Griliches 1963, and
the articles in Usher, ed. 1980).

One of the more common uses for capital is to compute and compare

"rates of return" across projects, firms, or industries. Such
measures assume implicitly that there exists a stable relationship
between earnings (gross or net profits) and past investments, and that
firms or industries differ only by a factor of proportionality in the

yield on their past investments, with the time shape of these yields
being the same across firms and implicit in the assumed depreciation

formula. In this section we investigate this question empirically,
using panel data and the methods developed in Section II to estimate
an

unconstrained distrubuted lag relationship between firm profits and

their past investments.
The data come from the Compustat tape (1980). Profits are for the
years 1961i_72 inclusive (thus T = 9

)

and are defined to equal the

operating income of firms deflated by the implicit G.N.P. deflator
and an index of the average gross rate of return (1972 =

1.0)

taken

from Feldstein and Summers (1977, table 1, column 3, page 216). The
observed investment data are for the years 1961—71 (thus, assuming
that this year's investment does not effect this years profits, we

have two presample observations on investment). Investment is defined
to equal the reported gross investment of firms deflated by the impli—

—28--

cit G.N.P. investment deflator. Firms were chosen from the tape if
there was no evidence of a major

merger,

acquisition, or sale of a

part of the firm during the sample period; and if all the required

of

variables for the firm were available. This yielded a sample (w)

258 firms)-'
All

results

reported here are based on two simplifications.

First, after making an adjustment for heteroskedasticity, we shall

assume that the conditional (on x )

covariance matrix of distur—

bances from the regression of y on x does not vary over obser—

1

vations.

This implies that maximum likelihood estimation procedures

provide consistent estimates of all parameters and their standard

errors, and maximum likelihood is used throughout. The adjustment
made for heteroskedasticity was to divide all figures for each firm by
the square root of the average rate of investment over the 1961—11

period as a whole. The second simplification to be used here concerns
the relationship between presaxnple and insample x .

Our results

focus on the model which allows for heterogeneity and, therefore,

assumption A4 will be used to describe this relationship. It will be

assumed that p in A4 equals three. This is based on a preliminary
examination of the observed x sequences (see note 8) which indicated

that a p of 2 or 3 would do.

13.

It also, no doubt, resulted in some selection bias. The estimates presented here do, however, allow for firm effects or

heterogeneity, and this should take care of nost of the sample
selectivity pr oblem.

—29—

The Compustat tape for the years of interest contains more information on the history of the firms x's than just the reported

investment series. It reports also the firm's gross (ks) and net
(k'') capital stocks at the beginning of each year. These numbers are

essentially linear combinations of the firm's past investment expenditures (including investments in years that we do not have in our

data). Net capital makes adjustments for reported depreciation

expenses while kg

does not.

The availability of k allows us to

Table 1 summarizes the parameter estimates. Estimates of the
unconstrained

II matrix indicated that there was heterogeneity (see

p.18). Column (1) lists the estimated lag coefficients based on
allowing for a single source of heterogeneity (the model of assump-

tions Al and A4, or the

11 matrix in (6)) while column 2 adds

equation (11) to this system. The algorithm used to compute the maximum likelihood estimates of column (1) did not actually meet its con-

vergence criteria. It seemed that the data could not distinguish

effectively between alternative combinations of the vectors c and C
and the last few lag coefficients when using system (6); but conver-

gence was rapid once we added equation (ii). The resulting estimates,

listed in column (2), yield w through w8 which are all positive,
the first seven being estimated with a fair amount of precision. As
one should expect from the structure of the

errors of the lag coefficients rise nnotonically in

the estimates of column (2) in Table 1 (which use Al and A4 of Section

II). The latter figure is still, however, 18 percent larger than the

trace of a ndel which allows for a free

II matrix (the trace of the

comparison model is lO! percent larger than the trace from the model
II accounts for about 19

with the free matrix). The model with a free

percent of the total variance in profits, the model based on Al and A4

accounts for about 75 percent of this variance, while the comparison
model accounts for about 57 percent of it.

Coming back to the lag structure, recall that the estimates of
column (2) suggested that it rose over the first three periods and was
fairly flat over the next four or five, with perhaps a slight decline

in the last few coefficients estimated. A simple way to approximate
such a lag structure might, therefore, be to allow for three free lag

coefficients and then substitute either k

or k'

(the choice would depend on the rate of decline in the

)

of

Table 1 present

estimates of these ndels (the system estimated is constructed in a
manner analogous to the construction of the system for the comparison
model, see the discussion of system 10).

The estimated coefficients

in both these columns also rise over the initial three year period.

Thrning to columns (3) and (4) of Table 2, it is clear that the trace
of the estimated coveriance matrices of disturbances for the systems
which allow for these three free initial coefficients are much smaller
than the trace of the covariance matrix for the comparison model

—36—

(which does not). Their values are only 66 percent of the values of
the trace for the comparison model, but they are still over 15 percent
larger than the trace of the covariance matrix which uses the estimates of column (2).
So far we have compared the estimates from the model based on a

single source of heterogeneity and a set of free lag coefficients to a
model which uses capital stock figures from the Compustat tape, and,
in addition, shown that the model's estimates seem to be consistent

with the information from auxiliary calculations. Though the model
does well in these respects, it does not really provide a completely

adequate summary of the data. This becomes evident when we formally
test the restrictions on the

II matrix embodied in the system con—

sistirig of equations (6) and (ii). The observed value of the x/55
test statistic for the restrictions was 5.64 which indicates rejection

of the null hypothesis at traditional levels of significance.--' Thus
though the model underlying the estimates of column (2) seems to pro-

vide a better summary of the relationship between past investment and
current profits than conventional capital measures, none of these
models provide a really adequate account of the interaction between

profits and past investment expenditures. This model failure
reflects the basic implausibilities in the original maintained hypo-

thesis: (a) that the relationship between investment and profits is
essentially the same for different firms and industries and, (b) that

16. Though in judging this test statistic one should keep in mind the
rather large size of our sample.

the time shape of the relationship (the depreciation pattern) is independent of calander time, that the contribution of a particular
vintage of investment is independent of the circumstances and factor
prices that prevailed at the time it was purchased and from subsequent

changes in them. Nevertheless, what is clear is that the usual depreciation schemes which assume that the contribution of past investments

declines rapidly and immediately with age are wrong. If anything
there nay be an "appreciation" in the early years as investments are
completed, shaken down, and adjusted to.
