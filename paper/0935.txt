Optimal Funding and Asset Allocation Rules for
Defined—Benefit Pension Plans

ABSTRACT

This paper considers a world in which pension funds may default, the
cost of the associated risk of default is not borne fully by the sponsoring

corporation, and there are differential tax effects. The focus is on ways
in which the wealth of the shareholders of a corporation sponsoring a pension

plan might be increased if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) follow simple and naive policies.

Under the conditions examined, the optimal policy for pension plan funding

and asset allocation is shown to be extremal in a certain sense. This
suggests that the IRS and the PBGC may wish to use more complex regulatory
procedures than those considered in the paper.

Sharpe (1976) showed that, in the absence of taxes, if the parties
bearing the, cost of possible default behave rationally, neither the
asset allocation decision nor the funding decision may affect the
wealth of corporate shareholders. On the other hand, if some parties
do not require compensation for actions that increase the risk of

Two important papers, by Black (1980) and Tepper (1981) consider the

Under these conditions shareholder wealth may be maximized
by funding to the greatest possible extent and holding assets (such as
bonds) taxed highly for other investors.

This paper considers a world in which pension funds may default, the

cost of the associated risk of default is not borne fully by the
sponsoring corporation, and there are differential tax effects. We
explore ways in which the wealth of the shareholders of a corporation
sponsoring a pension plan might be increased if the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (P}33C)
follow simple

Incidentally, a single strategy component X will be called extremal
if Xt(s)E for all states s.
It is the purpose of this subsection to prove there exists an optimal
strategy which is extremal. Toward that end, first let (A,X1,...X1..)
be an arbitrary feasible strategy. Adding a notational dependence on A

for emphasis, let R(As)WT(A,s) be defined in terms of A and the
relative portfolio proportions X(s) as at the beginning of this
section. and then let V(A) be defined in terms of R(A,s) by (7).
Proposition

(3)

shows that R(A,s) is a convex function of A for each

fixed s, and it follows immediately (because the contingent claim
valuations v(s) are non—negative) that V(A) is convex. Thus V(A) will
be maximized by taking A to be an endpoint of the feasible interval I.
To
the valuation associated with an arbitrary feasible
repeat,
strategy can be increased (or at least not decreased) by moving A to
one of the extreme points of I, leaving X1,...,X1 fixed.

The Ei ack-Tepper- result involves the Use o-f pension +Ltfldi ng and

Policies that involve possible default by the fund provide a way to
take advantage of possible asymetri c behavi or on the part of the PEGC,

the insurer of pension benefits. If stocks are more effective than
in this role, and if the feasible (A,X) region includes

combinations that make default possible, the Black—Tepper strategy may
not maximize •shareholder wealth.

The matter is not straightforward, even

in this very simple setting.

The "value of the insurance" depends on the relationship between the
payoffs over states of (1) fund assets and (2) benefits. It is
entirely possible that a risky bond might provide both tax benefits
and a large value -For the i neurance. In effect, we are assuming that
the manager will consider both the "tax effect" and the "insurance
offect" of decii one concerning funding and investment. Our previous

results indicate that in our setting,

the optimal policy will involve

"bonds' versus "stocks" involves a trade—off of these two effects or

an

it is instructive, however, to examine a very simple case in

which there is such a tradeoff.

One might think that, given the tradeoff between the insurance and tax
effects, and our previous results, the optimal policy would involve
either (a) full funding plus investment In bonds (corner 1 in Figure
4) or (b) minimum funding plus investment in stocks (corner 3 in
Figure

However, as our example shows, this need not be the case.
