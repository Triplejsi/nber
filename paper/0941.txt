The Leading Indicator Approach to
Economic Forecasting——Retrospect and Prospect

ABSTRACT

For many years a system of leading, coincident, and lagging economic
indicators, first developed in the l930s by the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER), has been widely used in the United States to appraise
the state of the business cycle. Since 1961 the current monthly figures
for these indicators have been published by the U.S. Department of

Commerce in Business Conditions Digest. Similar systems have been
developed by government or private agencies in Canada, Japan, the

United Kingdom, and more recently in many other countries. A few years
ago the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) set
up a working party to develop this type of analysis and most of the member

countries participated. The Center for International Business Cycle
Research at Rutgers University has given guidance in this field to some
fifteen countries during the past three years, in Europe, Asia, the
Middle East, Africa and South America.

Our purpose in this paper is to explain briefly the theory and
rationale underlying this approach to economic forecasting, describe
the more important statistical procedures used, and review the evidence

on how the indicators have performed in practice. The tests of performance
concentrate on data not used in the selection of the indicators, in the

United States and nine other countries. We conclude with some suggestions
for future research and development, including the application of the
approach to the analysis of inflation.

For

many years a system of leading, coincident, and lagging economic

indicators, first developed in the 1930s by the National Bureau of Economic
Researth (NBER), has been widely used in the United States to appraise

the state of the business cycle. Since 1961 the current monthly figures
for these indicators have been published by the U.S. Department of

Commerce in Business Conditions Digest. Similar systems have been
developed by government or private agencies in Canada, Japan, the

United Kingdom, and more recently in many other countries. A few years
ago the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) set

up a working party to develop this type of analysis and most of the member

countries participated. The Center for International Business Cycle
Research at Rutgers University has given guidance in this field to some
fifteen countries during the past three years, In Europe, Asia, the
Middle East, Africa and South America.
Our purpose in this paper is to explain briefly the theory arid

rationale underlying this approach to economic forecasting, describe
the more important statistical procedures used, and review the evidence

on how the indicators have performed in practice. The tests of performance
concentrate on data notused in the selection of the indicators, in the

United States and nine other countries. We conclude with some suggestions
for future research and development, including the application of the
approach to the analysis of inflation.

The Indicator System: Rationale and US Experience
The leading, coincident, and lagging indicators cevor a wide v;n-ety

of

economic processes that have been found to be iniport.int

in business

cycles. The leading indicators are for the most pirt invasurts of

—2—

anticipations or new commitments. They have a "look—ahead" quality and
• are highly sensitive to changes in the economic climate as perceived in

the marketplace. The coincident indicators are comprehensive measures
of economic performance, pertaining to output, employment, income, and

trade. They are the measures to which everyone looks to determine whether
a nation is prosperous or depressed. The lagging indicators are more
sluggish in their reactions to the economic climate, but they serve two

useful functions. First, since they are usually very smooth, they help
to confirm changes in trend that are first reflected in the more erratic

leading and coincident indicators. Second, their very sluggishness can
be an asset in cyclical analysis, because when they do begin to move, or

when they move rapidly, they may show that excesses or imbalances in the

economy are developing or subsiding. Hence the lagging indicators
frequently provide the earliest warnings of all, as when rapid increases
in costs of production outstrip price increases and threaten profit
margins, thus inhibiting new commitments to invest, which are among the
leading indicators.

The procedure in selecting and classifying indicators, therefore,
is one in which economic theory and empirical observation closely interact.
The indicator that has a near—perfect record of performince during a
business cycle, but whose behavior cannot be explained, will not comm3nd or

warrant much attention, since faith depends on understanding.

On the

other hand, the indicator that is suggested by theoretical considerations

but has not been tested or does not perform as theory predicts will not
command much attention either, since faith depends on performance.

With

these precepts in mind let us look at the classification of U.S. indicators

—3—

that we have been using for some years in our work in developing an
international system of business cycle indicators (Table 1).

The first column on the left lists six broad types of economic
process, of the kind that figure in most theories of the business cycle.

Most of the variables that are employed in econometric models can be

found under one or another of these categories. There are, however, some
important exceptions. Foreign trade is not shown explicitly, although it
is implicit in the second group (production, income, consumption and trade).

Taxes and government expenditures do not appear explicitly either, although

they are conspicuous in most models. Here the reason is not that
government has no impact on the business cycle, but rather that most
measures of its activity have not performed very consistently as indicators.
The same comment could be made about agricultural production.

The indicators in the body of the table were selected from the six
types of economic process, again with a view both to their contribution to

theory and empirical performance. Performance has been judged primarily
with respect to the consistency with which the measure has conformed to
business cycles and led, coincided or lagged behind the cycles' turning

points. An indicator can have too many cycles or too few; one—to--one

correspondence is preferable. An indicator can lcid on some occasions
and lag at other times; uniformity in timing is preferable. Other

criteria play a role too. Comprehensive coverage of the economy

is

preferable to narrow coverage. Prompt availabi.llty of curr'nt fi;ures

is

important and coupled with that, monthly figures

quarterly.

Indicators of Business Expansions and Contractions (New York: National Bureau of Economic Research. 1967). The thief modification is
that those series marked with 'are converted to constant prices. The timing classification for each series is the same as shown in Business Conditions Digest for all turns (see Table 1, column 1, in any recent issue), except as follows: Unemployment is unclassified (U)
at all turns in BCD because it leads at peaks and lags at troughs, but here it is classified roughly coincident, as in the 1966 list. Four
series that here are in constant prices are shown in BCD only in current prices: change in consumer installmentdebt, investment ex•
pendtures for plant and equipment, commercial and industrial loans outstanding, and change in output per man-hour, manufacturing.
inverted, which is the constant price equivalent of laborcost per unit of output. The constantprice series are assigned the same classification as the current price series.

CROSS-CLASSIFICATION OF U.S. INDICATORS BY ECONOMIC PROCESS
AND CYCLICALTIMING

—5—

Within each of the economic process groups, reading across the table,

are indicators that lead as well as those that coincide or lag. That is
one reason for thinking of them as processes. The activities represented
normally follow a sequence. The average workweek, for example, is one
of the first variables pertaining to employment that manufacturing
enterprises change, either by increasing or reducing the amount of overtime
work or by changing the number of persons working short hours or fewer

days per week. Changes in the number employed usually occur a few months
later, because such changes are less easily reversed and are more expensive
to accomplish.

Every entry in Table 1 has been supported by detailed studies showing
that the indicators not only behave in the manner specified by the
classification but also that there are cogent economic reasons for this

behavior. These studies have considered not only the sequences across
columns but also the more or less simultaneous relationships among the

indicators within each column: how stock prices are related to profits,
materials prices to inventory investment, production to employment, sales

to income, etc. Finally, these studies have developed the reasons for
and evidence underlying a relationship not explicitly shown in the
table——a relationship that helps to explain why one business cycle tends
to generate the next one.
This

relationship has to do with the influence of the li',giig

indicators upon the subsequent movements of the idin, indlc.itors. An

increase in the level of inventories, especially in rel;ition to si1es,
if it proceeds far enough is likely to cause buyer; to cut btck their

—6—

orders.

Here a lagging indicator, inventories, has an inverse effect UI)Ofl

a leading indicator, new oders. Similarly, a rapid increase in expenditures
for new plant and equipment may, as output and capital utilization rates
build up, result in a cutback in contracts for new plant construction.
Likewise, an increase in interest rates on business loans may at some
stage trigger decisions to reduce orders for machinery and equipment and
to reduce the rate at which inventories of materials are accumulated.
In short, there are feedback relationships running from the lagging
indicators to the subsequent, opposite turns in the leading indicators.

These relationships, too, have been documented empirically, as we shall
see.

The hardest test for a theory or system of indicators to meet, as
with any other economic theory or system, is one that requires it to
perform on data that were not available

U.S.

when it was formulated. The

indicators have experienced many such tests. One that covers a

twenty—five year span, based on data not available when a set of
indicators was selected and classified in 1950, is contained in Table 2.

The empirical evidence used to select and classify indicators in
the 1950 study covered periods of varying length but ending in 1938,

i.e., before World War II. Twenty—one indicators were selected as ilie

end—product of a study covering some 800 series. Eight of the twenty—one
were classified as leading, eight coincident, and five lagging. Fifteen

1948 to 1975. The indexes have been adjusted for long—run trend, using
a method developed in the 1970's. The turning points in the trend—adjusted
series are compared in Table 2 with the peaks and troughs in a chronology

of growth cycles, a concept of the business cycle that has come into use
in many countries only in recent years, which we shall discuss more fully
below.

The test in Table 2, therefore, not only confronts the twenty—one
indicators with data not available when they were chosen, but also with

methods of analysis not then available either. The results, recorded in
the left—hand section of the table, show that the expected sequence among
the three groups of indicators occurred at almost every turn throughout

the period. The lagging indicators not only lag as expected but also
lead the opposite turns in the leaders, which is also as expected.
Even though the indicators selected in 1950 turned in a good record
during the next twenty—five years, research on indicators and business

cycles did not stand still. We have already referred to some of the changes
in methodology. In addition, the indicators themselves have improved.
More of them are available in deflated form, more are published in
seasonally adjusted form, some are available more promptly, there is better
coverage of inventories and of price/cost relationships, and so on.
In 1975 the Department of Commerce established a new list of indicators,

and its record during the preceding twenty—five years is shown on the

right—hand side of Table 2. The results are similar, on the whole, to
those achieved by the 1950 list, partly because the content overlaps to

a considerable extent. The user of indicators would, however, not hesitate
a moment in opEing for the 1975 list in view oi
significant variables.

From this brief review of U.S. experience we would contend that the

conceptual

framework underlying the indicator approach to business cycle

forecasting has stood up well under repeated tests on subsequent data.
Much room for error and uncertainty remains, as witness the current
uncertainty about the prospects for recovery from the current U.S.

recession. But we know much more about the merits and limitations
of the system than we did thirty years ago.

Another kind of test of the system, which has both scientific value
and practical advantages, is to examine comparable data from other

countries and apply similar techniques of analysis to them. If indicators
that have proved to lead or lag consistently in U.S. experience could be
shown to have a similar temporal relationship in other countries, the
case for indicators——both in theory and in application to forecasting

efforts——would be strengthened. This was the task which we set ourselves
in 1973 when we launched the work on international economic indicators
at the National Bureau of Economic Research and are continuing
today at the Rutgers Center for International Business Cycle Research.

Internationalizing the Indicator System
The 1973 study began by developing growth cycle chronologies for the

major market—oriented economies. Most of the work on indicators for the
United States has been done in terms of the business cycle——or classical

cycle——concept. This concept involves an absolute rise and fall in
aggregate economic activity. In the 1950's and 1960's, however, many
countries did not experience actual declines in activity but did expcricnce

varying rates of growth. To examine these growth cyc1, thcrcfor',
methods of measuring and eliminating long—run trends wi're

dcvelopd.

—11—

From the trend—adjusted data chronologies of growth cycles were derived
in the same manner that had been used, in the United States, to derive

the business cycle chronology. The growth cycle, then, is simply a
trend—adjusted business cycle. The expansion phase is a period when the
short—run growth rate of aggregate economic activity is greater than the
long—run rate, whereas in the contraction phase the short—run growth rate
is less than the long—run rate.

Problems arise, of course, in deciding precisely what the long—run

growth rate of an economy is, especially on a current basis. Historically
there are fewer difficulties, and the growth cycle chronologies have
proved to be quite robust against variations in techniques of trend—

adjustment, etc. This is especially true of the number and identity
of the cycles, less true of the precise turning dates. For analyzing
sequences among indicators, however, variations in the reference turning
points with which the indicator turns are compared are not crucial.

Table 3 presents the growth cycle chronologies that have been
developed at the Rutgers Center for thirteen market—oriented economics.

They are based on substantially the same measures of the physical volume
of economic activity in each country, covering output, employment,

unemployment, real income and real volume of trade. The growth cycle
peak and trough dates represent the concensus among the turning points
of these indicators after adjustment for long—run trend.

It is interesting to note that a very old tendency for the United
States to exhibit more cycles than other market—oriented economies is
visible in the growth cycle chronologies for the last thirLy years as

well. While there was a period of time——roughly the twenty years 1955—1975
when the growth cycles of the countries included in the table were largely
synchronous, there has in recent years been more disparity again in the

timing of growth cycle peaks and troughs. But generally the behavior of
the indicators which enabled us to produce these chronologies is convincing
evidence that market—oriented economies, whatever their differences, still
have much in common and are afflicted with a roughly comparable tendency
to cyclical instability.

This conclusion is strengthened considerably by the results of our
efforts to develop leading and lagging indicators of growth cycle turns in
other economies by analyzing the behavior of rough equivalents of the U.S.

leaders and laggers. This constitutes a test of the indicator system of
a fairly high order. The list and the classification were established on
the basis of the behavior of indicators in the United States prior to

1966. The test is based on the behavior of comparable indicators in other
countries during the period 1950 to 1980. Note especially that the
indicators are classified into the three groups on the basis of their
U.S. behavior, not their behavior in the respective country.

A convenient way to obtain a summary view of the behavior of the

indicators is provided by Table 4. This shows the median lead or lag
for composite indexes derived from the leading indicators, the roughly
coincident indicators, and the lagging indicators for each of the ten

major market—oriented economies we have studied. The medians have, of
course, the well—known virtue of not being unduly influenced by extreme
values.

What the table shows, therefore, is how

the composite Indexes

in each country behave at peaks, at troughs, and at all growth cycle

—15—

turning points. The table shows the timing of the lagging indicators in
both positive and inverted form. As noted earlier, one of the most useful
properties of lagging indicators is that if they are considered in inverted
form the turns tend to lead the subsequent growth cycle turn by a longer

period of time than do the leading indicators. Thus the trough in the
lagging indicators precedes the peak in the leading indicators, and the

peak in the laggers precedes the trough In the leaders. This tendency
is throughly grounded in business cycle theory, as noted in our discussion
of the U.S. indicators.

Concerning the composite indexes whose behavior is summarized in

Table 4, there are two sorts of question we might ask. The simplest is
whether the composite index for each group of indicators in each country

exhibits the timing vis—a—vis growth cycles that we would expect. That
is,do the leaders lead, do the roughly coincident indicators turn within

a few months of the growth cycle turns, and do the laggers lag? The
table shows that among all ten countries there are but six exceptions

to these requirements: in France the composite leading index exhibits
coincident (0) timing at peaks, troughs, and all turns; in Sweden and
the Netherlands the leading index is coincident at troughs; and in

Belgium the coincident index shows a six—month lead at peaks. Apart
from these six exceptions all the other entries conform to the timing
expectations we derived from the behavior of series equivalent to these
in the United States.

A second question we can ask is whether, regardless of the timing

growth cycles, the

vis—a—vis
at

least

sequence among the groups of Indicators is

what is expected. Even, for example, were all the compo;iLus

for a given country to exhibit a lead, we would find it useful to know
that the leaders turn first, followed (i.e., with a shorter lead) by
the roughly coincident indicators and (with the shortest lead) by the

lagging indicators. Examining the evidence in this way we find only
five exceptions, and four of the five involve coincidence in timing

rather than a reversal. The exceptions are in France, Sweden, the
Netherlands and Belgium.
In short, there are clearly very few cases of perverse behavior.
If identical timing for two groups of indicators were not considered

should not be improved in all countries. The U.S. list for classical

cycle analysis has already been revised a number of times over the years.

—17—

In searching, therefore, for ways to improve the performance of indicator
systems one must consider not just composite indexes but how individual
indicators behave in various countries at growth cycle peaks and troughs.
In our ongoing work we have, of course, carefully examined this behavior

turn by turn. Here it will be sufficient to refer briefly to the median
leads and lags of all the indicators for which we have found rough
equivalents to the U.S. series in the other nine countries.

On this indicator—by—indicator basis there are very few cases
where the median timing at growth cycle turns in other countries fails to

conform

to

the timing one would expect on the basis of timing at U.S.

growth cycle turns. Mong the roughly coincident indicators there are
three countries in which employment fails to turn within three months of the

growth cycle turns. Two countries exhibit lags longer than three months
(France and Italy) and one (West Germany) exhibits a lead longer than

three months. These findings are interesting because of a widespread
belief that employment is either a lagging indicator or is becoming one.

Even in the United States at recent classical cycle turns there has been
a slight tendency for employment to lag, apparently because employers are
increasingly inclined to make marginal employment adjustments before

making major adjustments. In most other countries the

median liming for

employment is a lag of a month or two but no more.
The other case where three countries exhibit roughly coincident

turns more than three months from the growth cycle turns occurs n

connection with retail sales, where France, Bc1ium, an( Tpn 1Ii1)it

-1.8—

purchases

maybe a factor, since consumer credit change has long been a

leading indicator. If its use is spreading (as it is), it may

be

producing

leads in retail purchases by making consumers less dependent upon income
in making decisions about purchasing.

Finally we may note that in one country (Belgium) the index of

industrial production shows a long lead in its median timing. This is
noteworthy because of the widespread use of that index as the primary

measure of aggregate economic activity. We have long argued that no
single measure, no matter how aggregative or pervasive, ought to be

relied on in dating business cycles. It is, of course, precisely those
cases in which the major measures of aggregate economic activity fail
to turn in symnchronous fashion that we have the greatest difficulty

in placing business cycle turning points. In Belgium, sole reliance on
industrial production would result in earlier turning points than most
of the other evidence suggests.

Among the leading indicators in the overwhelming majority of cascs
the indicators in other countries conform in timing to the U.S. experience.
Oneof the exceptions, the ratio of price to unit labor cost——a measure
that reflects profit margins——falls to lead in Canada and the Netherlands.

Industrial materials prices lag in their median timing at growth cycle
turns in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands, and are coincident

in Canada and France. New orders for durable goods unaccountably lag
in Canada, and contracts for plant and equipment lag

In all

in other countries conforms to

—19—

The lagging indicators also generally conform well to the U.S.—based

classification. There is but one exception. Business loans outstanding
lead instead of lag in their median timing at German growth cyc].e turns.

Overall, therefore, the median timing of the indicators and the

composite indexes conforms to our expectations. It is clear that there
is room for Improvement, and the same factors that have led to periodic
revision of the short list of U.S. indicators suggest that the next order

of business in our international work must be to secure such an

improvement. But the results we have described demonstrate that indicator
systems established on a comparable basis in many countries are likely to
have similar properties.

Recent Developments in Practical Application
One possibility for improving the ability to forecast growth cycles

with leading indicators which we have already explored has involved the

use of so—called "qualitative" indicators. Survey results dealing,
for example, with what entrepreneurs think about their sales possibilities

are now regularly collected both in the United States and in many other

countries. We have already explored some of the possibilities for
augmenting the quantitative indicators with the results of these surveys.
The survey results are available in what is called "net balance" form.
In case of sales, for example, the percent of respondents who think profits
are Increasing less the percent who think they are decreasing gives the

"net balance" of respondents with

respect

to sales. Using survey net

balances presents difficulties. flow the questions arc worded, for example,

determines precisely what the net balances mean

and dictates

whether

—20—

cumulating

the net balances or taking their first differences may be

necessary in some cases before they can be related to the quantitative
indicator to which they pertain.

Surveys have the advantage of being available often before the

equivalent quantitative measure. While our preliminary investigations
have suggested that the turning points in survey net balances do not
customarily lead turning pointsintheir quantitative equivalents their
greater promptness opens some possibilities for increasing our ability
to forecast by using surveys along with or as proxies for these
quantitative measures.

Another area which we have explored has been an outgrowth of the

trend—adjustment necessary for growth cycle analysis. We customarily
construct composite indexes of leading, and roughly coincident indicators

for the major countries we have been monitoring. An early decision
involved the question whether to trend adjust the components and then
construct the composite index or whether to utilize the components in

unadjusted form and then trend adjust the composite index. We decided
on the latter because it is useful to have the composite indexes in both

adjusted and unadjusted form. A major use to which we put the indexes
in unadjusted form is to calculate their short—run growth rates on a

continuing current basis. In this way one can observe growth cycles
and yet avoid the uncertainty about what the long-run trend is currently.
Charts

1 and 2, taken from a bi—monthly report prepared by the Rutgers

Center and published by the Conference Board, illustrate the USC of

these growth rates. Their value in comparing the recent changes in each

country against growth rates over a long period as well as in comparing

recent developments in one country against those in other countries
will be readily apparent.

It might be noted that we find combining composite indexes for
several countries a useful way to monitor growth cycle developments as

well. The charts just presented illustrate several multi—country
composite leading indexes.

Customarily we consider the European

countries alone, the European countries plus Canada and Japan, and

all seven countries together. This has proven particularly useful in
recent years when the tendency of the major countries to exhibit fairly
synchronous cyclical behavior (in the 1950s and 1960s) has been replaced

by considerable divergence. In these composites each country's index is
weighted by its GNP in 1970, measured in dollars. For some purposes,
such as forecasting exports, the use of export weights would be desirable.

Chart 3 shows how the six—country leading Index, weighted by U.S. exports
to those countries, compares with total U.S. exports in constant dollars.

In Chart 4 the year—to—year changes in U.S. exports are shown in relation
to the end—of—preceding—year rate of change In the six—country leading

index. The r2 is . 84

,

which indicates that the growth rate in the

leading index at the end of the year gives a useful clue to the forthcoming

growth of exports. This technique can readily be extended to other
countries and used to monitor both imports and exports.

We have experimented as well with leading and coincident indicators
that are focused on a particular economic process, such as employment.

Our leading employment index for the United States includes five leading
indicators

that reflect marginal employment adj ustmc'nts (the average

workweek, overtime hours, part—time employment, layoffs, and initial

unemployment insurance claims. The coincident employment index includes
five series on employment and unemployment. Both indexes use all three
of the major sources of information on employment: the household survey,
the establishment survey, and the unemployment insurance system. This
adds to their reliability and smooths away some of the erratic movements.

Chart 5 shows these two indexes during the current recession
(solid line), starting six months before the business cycle peak of

July 1981. This is compared with the average patterns durIng three
preceding mild recessions and four preceding sharp recessions.

The

leading tendency of the leading employment index is clearly evident in

these recession—recovery patterns, as we call them. The course that the
indexes have taken during previous recessions and the ensuing recoveries
can readily be used in evaluating a recession as it unfolds and in

judging the prospects for recovery. The method can, of course, also be
applied to indicators for other countries, using the growth cycle
chronologies described earlier.
The final application of indicator aiialysis that we shall discuss is

a sequential signal system for identifying the beginning and ending dates

of recessions. The system has been developed at the Rutgers Center
using growth rates in the U.S. leading and coincident indexes. The current
rates are compared with certain target rates to determine when they

reach certain critical levels defined in advance. This results in a
sequence of three signals: preliminary, intermediate, and final. The
preliminary signal of recession gives an

early

closer at hand and more likely to occur. The third and final signal
signifies with almost complete certainty that a recession has begun. A
similar set of signals is defined for the upturns at the end of recessions.
The method invokes several principles to gain reliability. One is to
use two indexes jointly rather than a single index. Another is to allow

for the possibility of a false signal by using the sequential design. If
the system were to be used to trigger certain policy actions such as the
release of government funds for public works or public employment, the

amount as well as the reversibility of the action can be governed
according to whether the signal is preliminary, intermediate or final.
Equally important are the signals of recovery, which allow anti—recession
policies to be terminated by degrees, depending on how definite the
signals are.

The historical record of the third signals of business cycle peaks
(P3) and troughs (T3) is compared with the unemployment

rate in Chart 6

and with the inflation rate in Chart 7. Since neither unemployment nor
inflation was taken into account in defining the stgnals, this provides

a strong test. The results are quite impressive, since when the signals
of

recession are on (shaded areas) unemployment is generally rising and

inflation declining.

Some were not seasonally adjusted, some were not deflated, some

were not available as continuous series, some required processing to

enhance their properties as leading indicators. In many countries the
coverage of indicators available on a monthly or even quarterly basis

is very limited. Timeliness often does not get a high priority.
Business survey data may not be in most appropriate form or may not

cover the most appropriate questions. In the United States, even though
indicator analysis has been pursued for more than forty years, we continue
to find both needs and opportunities for new and better data.

Second, the development of leading, coincident and lagging
indicators of inflation is a wide open field. We need to quicken our
awareness of new inflationary trends, ordisinflationary trends. What
are the most reliable indicators for this purpose, and how reliable are

they? Can available measures be improved? The Rutgers Center is
carrying on some research in this field in connection with the new
bi—monthly report, Inflation Watch, but we have barely scratched the
surface.

Third, an organized effort to develop business cycle indicators in

the countries in the Pacific area is warranted. In Europe, the OECD
and the EEC have been engaged in such an enterprise for several years.

This has stimulated many member countries to undertake research and

development programs, to exchange results and discuss techniques. In
the Pacific area, on the other hand, Japan has pursued this subject for

many years, and more recently Australia, New Zealand, South Korea,

Taiwan and Malaysia have engaged in such studies. But an orgnntzcd
