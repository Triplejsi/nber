July 1982

Are High Income Individuals Better Stock Market Investors?

ABSTRACT

This paper presents evidence that the corporate stock owned by
high income investors appreciates substantially faster than the stock owned

by investors with lower incomes. Those with very high incomes enjoy the
greatest success on their investments while those with incomes under

$20,000 have the least success. The evidence indicates that the differences
are large and that they have persisted for a long time.

Are High

Income Individuals Better Stock Market Investors?

Martin Feldstein*
Shloino Yitzhaki**

This paper presents evidence that the corporate stock owned by high
income investors appreciates substantially faster than the stock owned by

investors with lower incomes. Those with very high incomes enjoy the greatest
success on their investments while those with incomes under $20,000 have the

least success. The evidence indicates that the differences are large and that
they have persisted for a long time. Since the present paper represents what we
believe is the first such evidence of income class differences in the rate of

return,1 our results must be regarded with some caution. But if
fact

this

apparent

stands up to further scrutirj, there are important implications for a wide

variety of issues including the theory of efficient markets, the rate of saving,
and

the distribution of wealth.

Our evidence is based on tax

return

data on individual shareholder

transactions. Section 1 describes our data and method of calculating rates of
return and

presents

the basic estimates. The second section then discusses

several possible sources of bias. Additional

results based on data for a

dif-

ferent year are presented in the third section. A final section discusses some
of the implications of our finding.

1. The Data, Method and Results for 1973
The basic data are a sample of 57,676 individual Federal income tax

returns that reported corporate stock capital gains in the year 1973.1 These
returns report more than 250,000 corporate stock transactions. For each transaction, we have data on the cost of the asset, the proceeds from the sale, and

the dates when the stock was acquired and when it was sold. Associated with
each transaction is a variety of information about the taxpayer, including his

adjusted gross income, the value of his other capital gains, etc. The sampling
weight for each observation makes it possible to estimate population means for
any desired subgroup of taxpayers.

Our analysis focuses exclusively on the capital gains realized on cor-

porate

stock. Since the rate of gain is likely to be particularly great on

stock acquired through np1oyee stock options or by company founders, we have

eliminated such transactions from our sample. Our analysis

deals

only with stock

acquired by open market purchase. This also eliminates shares acquired by
or

gift

bequest. The restriction to shares acquired in ordinary market transactions

eliminates approximately 87,000 transactions.
We have also eliminated from the sample any
holding

transaction for which the

period is not reported (approximately 1ii,O0O transactions) or for which

the total capital gain reported on the tax return is not equal to the sum of the
individual transaction gains (approximately 35,000 transactions). These exclusions

reduce the final

sample to 90,022 transactions.2

1These data were compiled by the Internal Revenue Service for the 1973 Capital
Gains Study. The tax returns represent a weighted probability sample of all

individual tax returns for that year.

2We have repeated some parts of our

restrictions and found very

Consider nov the way in which we use our data on individual transac-

tions to calculate the average rate of return in each income class. We begin by
evaluating for each taxpayer an income defined as adjusted gross income minus
the capital gains on corporate stock that are used to calculate the rates of

return. Taxpayers are then divided into six broad income groups: less than
zero; zero to $20,000; $20,000 to $50,000; $50,000 to $100,000; $100,000 to

$200,000; and greater than $200,000. The relatively small number of individuals
whose net adjusted gross incomes (i.e., AGI minus the corporate stock capital
gains) are negative but who have sold corporate stock are typically investors

with large and complex financial transactions whose income reflects large losses

in business activities, tax shelters, partnerships, etc. The average value of
corporate

stock sales among these individuals

there-

average sales in any of the other income groups except among

those with incomes over $200,000.

Within each income group, transactions are divided according to the
time

since

the stock was purchased. For this purpose, we use 11 time intervals

ranging from

less

than six months to more than 20 years.

2Note that our procedure of calculating the rate of return based on aggregate
sales and aggregate costs gives an unbiased estimate of the sample rate of return
for each income group and time period. The alternative procedure of calculating

rates of return for each transaction and then averaging the rates of return
gives an underestimate of the rate of return on the total investment made by
investors in class i and time period t.

The annolous group with negative net income (equation 2.5) has a. particularly high rate of return (13.6 percent). As we explain below, this is consistent with the combination of high economic income that appears to characterize many members of this group and their nontaxable status in 1913.
The constant terms of these individual equations are not exactly equal
and indicate that the superior performance of the higher income groups is more

true for longer holding periods than for shorter ones. However, equation 2.6
confirms the monotonic relation between income and the rate of return when the

constant term is constrained to be the same for all groups. Equation 2.1
repeats this with the negative net income group omitted. !vkreover, an explicit
test of the equality of the constant terms does not reject the hypothesis that
all four constant terms (for the groups with positive income) or even all five
constant terms are equal.

Constraining the constant terms to be equal has relatively little

effect on the estimated rates of return. To show formally that the differences

ang the

rate of

return

coefficients for the four groups with positive income

are statistically significant, we reestiniate equation 2.1 with the rates of return
constrained to be equal and compare the sums of squared residuals. The
constrained estimate appears as equation 2.8. The F—statistic for testing the
of
constraint is 5.92 while the one percent critical value with 3 and 39 degrees

freedom is 11.33. The evidence is thus very strong in indicating that there are

significant differences among the rates of return.
The most direct evidence on differences in the rate of return is presented in equation 2.9 where the constant term is constrained to be zero.1 In

coefficients thus correspond to separate regressions for each income class,
each without a constant tern.

increases monotonically from 3.7 for investors with adjusted incomes below
$20,000 to 6.7 for investors with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000.
The rates of return presented in the first nine equations of Table 2
are based on regressions that give equal weight to each calculated ratio of

sales value to initial cost (St/C1t). In principle, it would be desirable to
correct for heteroskedasticity by using generalized least squares. The individual observations represent different numbers of underlying transactions; observations corresponding to a large number of transactions should lie closer to the

true regression line and therefore should be weighted more heavily. Similarly,
rates of return for longer holding periods provide more opportunity for annual
fluctuations to be averaged out and therefore should lie closer to the tn.ie

regression line. We have therefore reestimated many of the equations with a
weighted generalized least squares procedure to correct for heteroskedasti—

city. The basic estimates are essentially unchanged, regardless of whether we
weight observations according to the number of underlying transactions, the
holding period, or both.
To save space, we present only two of these weighted estimates.
Equation 2.10 repeats the specification of equation 2.6 with each observation

weighted by the number of individual transactions. The results are very similar
to the unweighted estimates and confirm the nznotonic relation between the rate

of return and the level of income among individuals with positive incomes. The
same confirming estimates are found in equation 2.11 where each observation is
weighted by the total holding period represented by the underlying transactions,
i.e., the weight assigned to each transaction is the holding period for that

transaction

and

the observations are weighted by the sum of' the transaction

weights

corresponding to that observation.

The higher rates of return earned by higher income groups is not an
artifact of a particular holding period but can be confirmed for a wide range of

holding periods. 'I.ble 3 presents some of these results. Equation 3.1 repeats
the basic results previously shown as equation 2.6. Excluding transactions of
less than six months simply adds 0.2 percent to the calculated rate of return in
each income class and does not modify the strong pattern of monotonically

increasing returns. For investments of more than five years, the relation between income and the rate of return is slightly stronger.

Only when investments

that have been held for 20 years or nxre are excluded is the strict monotoriicity
lost but in this case (equation 3.5) the gap between the rate of return of the
lowest income group (li.i percent for those with net incomes between zero and

$20,000) and the rates of return of the higher income groups (an average of 7.9
percent) is even greater than when all holding periods are included.

the intercept term in the regression provides estimates of
constant average rates of return for each income group. These estimates are

five years or longer (equation 3.9) and for investments of less than 20 years

2. Biases in the Estimated Rates of Return
The rates of return presented in

section 1 are not unbiased estimates

of the rates of return on Investors' entire portfolio of corporate stock. This
section discusses several possible sources of bias. We shall explain why we
believe

the

that the likely effect

of such biases is to cause an underestimate of

observed differences in rates of return among income classes. If this is

so, correcting the bias

The

would only strengthen our findings.

nxsZ important source of bias is our use of tax return data. This

implies that we look only

at

the rates of return on the stocks that individuals

choose to sell. To understand the likely

"realization

bias" in the estimated

rates of return, it is important to distinguish two reasons why the return on

stock that is sold may differ

from the return on

entire portfolios. First, in

the absence of taxes, investors might tend to favor either "winners" or "losers"
in

their selling decisions. Optimal portfolio

bus,

behavior requires, ceteris pan—

selling winners to reduce their weight in portfolios. This tendency to

siake realized gains exceed the overall portfolio return is reinforced by such

conventional

faulty

wisdom as "hold a loser until you get your original invest-

ment back" and "you never lose money by taking

a profit." Conversely, conven-

tional rules like "cutting your losses quickly" and "backing
imply

a winner" would

that realized gains will be less than gains on stocks not sold. However,

none of these selling rules will bias the comparison of returns among different
income groups unless the selling rules differ among these income groups.

It is particularly
tal gains

important

therefore that our

system

of taxing capi-

does provide a substantial reason for shareholders to favor selling

losers rather than winners and for this bias against selling stocks with large

profits to be strongest in high income groups. Since the capital gains tax is
due only when a gain is realized by selling the asset, the shareholders can
reduce the effective tax rate by postponing the sale

of

stock

on which there is

an accrued gain. The advantage of postponement is strengthened by the fact that
the unrealized gains that exist when a shareholder dies are subsequently ignored

for tax purposes.1 These tax rules provide an incentive to postpone the sale of
stock with gains and, when possible, to sell stocks with losses at the same time

that stocks with gains are sold. These incentives are greater the higher the
individual's marginal tax rate.2
There is therefore a strong reason to believe that
gains represent a.

greater understatement of

realized

capital

the overall capital gains for high

income individuals than for lower income individuals.3 Correcting for this
realization bias would
by more than

therefore

raise the rate of return for high income groups

it raised the return for lower income groups. This would only

strengthen the finding reported in Th.bles 2 and 3.

The tax rules do not discourage the realization of capital gains by

individuals with no other taxable income. Indeed, their incentive to realize

1The individuals to whom the shares are bequeathed take their market value
at the time of death as their "cost" for subsequent capital gains taxation.

2For evidence that high tax rates do deter the ree.lization of capital gains,

and Feldstein (1978), and Yitzhaki (1979).

Slemrod

(1980),

3High income individuals also have an incentive to avoid the capital gains
tax by giving appreciated stocks to charitable organizations. Such gifts
not only avoid the capital gains tax but also earn the donor a deduction
for the market value of his gift. In 1977, gifts of appreciated property
accounted for approximately 70 percent of total charitable deductions among
taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 but less than 5 percent of gifts among

taxpayers

incomes under $15,000.

strong incentive to realize gains probably accounts for the very high

reported rate of return in Thbles 2 and 3 for individuals with negative net
incomes.

The existence of a group with large capital gains but negative net
income points to another source of bias in the estimated relation between
income and rates of return. An individual who realizes a large capital gain may
engage in tax shelter activities that reduce his income exclusive of those gains

or cause that net income to be negative. This implies that some individuals who
actually have high incomes will be classified in lower income groups and that

this downward misclassification is st likely among individuals with large
capital gains. If large capital gains are associated with higher than average
rates of return, th±s tax shelter misclassification tends to weaken the measured
association between income and the rate of return.
In

addition to the realization bias and the income classification

bias, there may also be a bias in the reporting of capital gains. ¶L.xpayers may
not

report all of their gains honestly. If the extent of under—reporting is the

same at all income levels, there will be no bias in the estimated relation between iriome and rates of return. It is inherently impossible to obtain infor—
ination

on

however,

the extent or pattern of such under—reporting. It is worth noting,

that the probability of an Internal Revenue Service audit rises with

the individual's income and that this increasing probability may encourage

greater honesty. However, since higher income individuals also have more to
gain by under—reporting, it is not possible to make any inference about whether
there is a bias in the estimated relation.

—15—

A final problem of interpretation is that our evidence relates only to
capital gains while the total return to common stock investment includes divi-

dends as well. Because of differences in the taxation of dividends and of capital gains, lower income investors might choose stocks that offer higher divi-

dends. Such behavior would imply that the observed differences in capital gains

overstate the differences in the total return on equity. Although the extent of
such offsetting differences in dividend rates cannot be determined precisely,1
we have examined three types of evidence and found that both suggest that the bias

from this source is small or non—existent. The first piece of evidence on this
question is based on a special survey of income and wealth conducted by the

Federal

Reserve Board in 1962 and 1963.2

The survey

collected information on

the amount of income received from each source and on the value of each tThe of

wealth. The

was heavily weighted with high income individuals. We have

used these data to estimate the average dividend rate on the shares held by
investors

income class and in the open—ended class above

$100,000. Individuals with positive adjusted gross incomes below $10,000
reported a dividend return of 2.1 percent while those with negative AGI's

reported a dividend return of 0.5 percent. There is clearly no suggestion that
higher income individuals accepted a lower dividend return in order to obtain
greater capital gains.

When individuals are classified by an estimate of adjusted gross
income exclusive of capital gains on corporate stock (i.e., by an estimate of

the income measure that e used in the rate of return regression), the estimated
dividend yields show a clear positive relation to income: a 2.0 percent return
for those with positive net AGI below $10,000, 3.5 percent for net PGI between
$10,000 and $50,000, 3.6

percent

for net AGI between $50,000 and $100,000, and

14.1 percent for net AGI over $100,000. These data suggest that, if anything,
the pattern of dividend yields reinforces the disparities in capital gain yields
among income classes.

The second source of data on dividend yields comes from a study by

individual records for 19T3 to evaluate the effect of these problems on the
results for 19T3 and found that their effect was quite small.
Table 1 presents the estimated rates of return for each income class

and holding period.1 The estimated regression coefficients of Table 1 are
strikingly similar to the results presented in Table 2. The rate of return
fises monotonically from 3.2 percent for investors with incomes below $10,000 to

9.7 percent

for

investors with incomes over $100,000. The standard errors of

each of the estimates is small and the differences among them are clearly signi-

ficant both economically and statistically. The constant terms are all negative
(presumably because 1962 share prices were unusually depressed) but again rise
monotonically

from —ll.1i for the lowest income group to —3.2 for the highest

group. This implies that the higher income groups also did better in the timing

their purchases and

sales;

the estimated regression coefficients therefore

the net differences among

the

income classes. This is demonstrated

by equation 5 in which a single constant term is estimated for all the classes;
the rates of return now rise from 3.0 percent in the lowest income group to 10.0
percent in the highest group.2

1Note that the four income classes for 1962 are those that appear in the

Equation 6 provides the most direct way of comparing average rates of
return since the constant term is eliminated. The relative effect of the
constant term was of course largest for the lowest income group.

In the current

equation we see that the net yield really averaged only 2.11 percent for this
group and then rose monotonicalJy to 9.5 percent in the highest income group.
The remaining equations of Table 1 show that the same pattern of rates

of return are observed for various holding periods. For example, eliminating
stocks held less than one year (equation 7) raised the average return for all
income groups but did not change the difference between the highest and lowest

groups. Eliminating the open ended interval of nre than 20 years (equation 8)
raised the rates of return further for all groups but significantly increased
the yield difference between the lowest and the highest income classes.

i.

Explanations

and Implications

The evidence that we have developed and presented in this paper indicates that the realized rates of return on corporate stock sold in 1962 and 1973

varied systematically among income groups. In both years, higher income groups
experienced substantially greater rates of increase of share values than lower

income groups. This surprising finding cannot be explained by the use of
realized capital gains or by the other statistical biases in the calculated
rates of return.

One possible explanation is that higher income groups enjoy greater
share price increases because they take systematically greater risks.1 Modern

et al.

1Blume
(l971) report that tax return filers with larger AGI tended
to hold stock with greater nondiversifiable risk but do not provide specific
evidence on the extent of differences among income classes. They did, however,
present evidence that indicates very little portfolio diversification,
suggesting that the beta coefficient might not be the relevant measure of risk
bearing.

—23—

capital asset

pricing theory Implies that portfolios with greater nondiver—

sifiable risk (as measured by the beta coefficient) do have higher expected

rates of return in an efficient capital market. Because our data contains
information only on the realized capital gains, we cannot measure the riskiness
of the investors' portfolios and therefore cannot evaluate this explanation

directly. It would,

however,

require very substantial differences in beta coef-

ficients to explain the very large differences in observed rates of return.

the

unpredictability of the firm's

willing to accept such uncertainty in

order to obtain higher rates of return.
Another possible explanation is that high income individuals are more

likely to have access to inside information that enables them to buy stocks
before the market recognizes their value. However, such "early" buying would be

reflected in a high constant term in the regressions (indicating an unusual gain

soon after purchase) rather than in the high regression coefficient that
indicates stocks that cumulatively grow faster year after year.
Several people have suggested that the higher average returns may

reflect

the fact that higher income individuals generally have larger portfolios

and can therefore devote more time or resources to managing their investments.

An obvious counterargument to this is that lower income individuals could in

principle achieve the same investment management

resources

by investing in

mutual funds. The view that large individual portfolios have an advantage over
both small individual portfolios and mutual funds must therefore rest on the
combined effect of being big enough to justify significant portfolio management
resources while, unlike mutual funds, being small enough to be able to buy and
sell amounts of individual securities that are large relative to the portfolio
without altering the market price of those securities.
Finally, it remains possible that our result is a statistical artifact
caused by relatively greater under—reporting of gains by lower income indivi-

duals or by some

source

of statistical bias that we bave not considered. Since

there is no independent basis for either conjecture, we believe that the implications of our finding of significant differences in rates of capital gain accumulation deserve to be considered.
If the observed differences in rates of return are more than a sta-

tistical

artifact but represent a permanent and stable feature of investments in

corporate stock, there are likely to be important implications for the rate of
saving,

the distribution of

wealth and the

debt and equity preferences of indi-

vidual investors.
The differences in rates

of capital in imply that

the after—tax rate

of return to the highest income group is as high or higher than the after—tax
rate of return of lower income (and therefore lower tax bracket) individuals.

For example, if individuals in the highest tax bracket have a 7

rate of return (subject to a 20 percent capital gains tax) while individuals

with incomes under
