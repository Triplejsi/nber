PENSION FUNDING, PENSION ASSET ALLOCATION, AND CORPORATE FINANCE:
EVIDENCE FROM INDIVIDUAL COMPANY DATA

Abstract

This paper examines the relationship between U.S. corporations'

management of their pension plans and their management of the more familiar

aspects of corporate financial structure. The chief conclusion, on the
basis of data for 7,828 pension plans sponsored by 1,836 companies and their
subsidiaries, is that corporations do not manage the pension plans which they

sponsor as if these plans had nothing to do with the corporation. Different
responses appear to characterize firms' behavior in different contexts, but
the evidence persistently indicates clear relationships between decisions
about pension assets and liabilities and decisions about the other assets
and liabilities of the firm.

At the same time, the pattern of these relation-

ships is, more often than not, inconsistent with familiar hypotheses that
have emerged thus far in the theoretical literature analyzing pension aspects

of corporate finance. Hence the conclusion from the data is also that the
connections between pension decisions and corporate financial decisions
in the more conventional

sense are, at least as yet, not well understood.

PENSION FUNDING, PENSION ASSET ALLOCATION, AND CORPORATE FINANCE:
EVIDENCE FROM INDIVIDUAL COMPANY DATA

Benjamin M. Friedxnan*

Private pension funds
investment

now

constitute one of the largest pools of

assets in the United States. Their total assets exceed $300

billion, and for the foreseeable future they are almost certain to grow
still further in relation to the overall size of the U.S. financial markets.
These funds already comprise by far the largest major category of institutional investor in the U.S. corporate equity market, and the second largest

(after the life insurance industry) in the corporate bond market. As
private pension funds continue to account for a steadily growing share
of these key markets, their behavior becomes increasingly important to
the understanding of how the U.S. financial markets determine the yields
on, and prices of, financial assets.

At the same time, both the assets held by private pension plans and

these plans' liabilities for future benefit payments are now large — and

growing —

in

relation to the non—pension assets and liabilities of the U.S.

private business sector. Many major corporations' pension assets and
pension liabilities represent substantial fractions of the net worth of
the company, and in some cases even bulk large in comparison to the

company's total assets. Because corporate equity shares therefore
represent ownership claims on two pools of assets, and obligations via
two sets of liabilities, shareholders clearly have a direct interest in
the company's pension plan in addition to the quantities that appear on

—2—

its balance sheet. The larger are the assets and liabilities of the
company's pension plan, the greater is their role, along with the non—

liabilities,

assets and

overall

risk—return prospects. Hence private pension plans increasingly

in the

The growing importance of pension plans' assets and liabilities
for nearly all constituencies within a typical corporation raises the
possibility that the corporation's overall financial position arid prospects

may influence its strategy for funding its pension liabilities, as
well as its subsequent allocation of these funds among alternative invest-

ment

assets,

pension

in any of a number of ways. Companies may use

unfunded

liabilities as a substitute for credit market debt, or alternatively

to extend overall indebtedness in conjunction with credit market debt.
Similarly, companies may invest pension assets so as to mitigate, or

alternatively to compound, the leverage and other risk—determining

characteristics

of their business. Then, too, there may be no connection

at all —perhaps because managements feel a responsibility to subordinate
the corporation's interest in its pension plan to the interests of the
plan's beneficiaries.

Moreover, as private pension assets and liabilities continue to
grow in relation to the

possibility

balance sheet of the typical corporation, the

arises that the connection between corporate finance and

pensions may be as relevant for understanding the former as the latter.
If companies face limitations on the management of their pension assets
and liabilities (as they do under the 1974 Employee Retirement Income

Security Act), or if the treatment

The object of this paper is to test empirically for interrelationstructure

ships along just these lines between U.S. corporations' management of
their pension plans and their management of the more familiar aspects

of corporate financial structure. (e motivation underlying this effort

is

to subject to empirical scrutiny some of the theoretical hypotheses

that have already emerged in the nascent literature of private pensions

and corporate finance. In addition, the goal is to examine the data

more

broadly, to allow other regularities to appear which may be suggestive

in the further development of theory describing these aspects of corpora-

tions' financial behavior.
Because of the overwhelming heterogeneity of both

arrange-

ments and financial structure within the U.S. corporate business sector,
as well as the profusion of powerful economic, regulatory, and other

institutional influences that have shaped the pension and general corporate
financial environments in recent years, any attempt to conduct such an
investigation using aggregated time-series data would be of limited value.
Instead, the analysis undertaken here relies on individual company data
assembled from the pension plan information that each plan sponsor

Service and the U.S. Department of Labor

on Form 5500, used in conjunction with additional conventional individual

company financial statistics contained in the Standard and Poor's
Compustat file. The pension data are for plan year 1977, the only year

for

which a nearly complete Form 5500 file exists as of the time

of

writing.

Section I describes the data and indicates the procedures used
for such steps as within-firm aggregation of multiple pension plans,

merging of the Form 5500 and Compustat files, and treatment of corporate

parent—subsidiary relationships. Section II, which focuses on pension
funding strategy, presents the results of a series of tests for relationships between corporations' funding of their pension liabilities (the
total of which is taken as given here) and other characteristics of the
respective firms' business and balance sheet (also taken as given).
Section III, also on pension funding strategy, digresses to examine the
results of tests of the familiar hypothesis that corporations' decisions
in

this regard are oriented not to achieving fundamental financial

objectives but to smoothing their reported earnings statements over time.
Section IV, which focuses on

pension asset allocations, presents the

I. The Data
The Employee Retirement Income

Security

Act of 1974 requires each

pension benefit plan sponsored by a U.S. corporation to file a report

ann, with the Internal

Revenue Service and

the

Department of

Labor,

on Form 5500 (or Form 5500-C if the plan covers 100 or fewer participants).

The form includes information about the plan's benefit structure, the

number and current status of the participants in the plan, the plan's
income and expenses for the year, and the plan's beginning—of—year and

end—of—year assets broken down into a substantial detail of investment

categories. Each defined benefit plan must also file Form 5500 Schedule B,
which provides actuarial

information about the plan's accrued

including

liabilities separately, together with

other related items. The Appendix shows the format of Form 5500 and

of

the plans. Nearly one-half of the plans had less than $1 million in

assets, and more than four-fifths had less than $5 million. By contrast,

the 22 plans with more than $1 billion in assets together accounted for
almost one-fifth of the total, and the 55 plans with more than $500 million
together accounted for almost one-third.4
Because many

companies sponsor more than one pension plan — one

plan for salaried staff and another for wage earners, for example — the
24,426 plans in the sample represented only 15,098 sponsoring corporations.5
For purposes of testing hypotheses about relationships between pension asset
and liability decisions and corporate financial behavior in the conventional
sense, what presumably matters is not the assets or liabilities of any one
of a corporation's pension plans but the combined assets and liabilities

of all plans that it sponsors. Table 2 shows the distribution of the $222
billion in total assets across the 15,098 sponsoring firms in the sample.

As is to be expected, aggregating all plans sponsored by a single firm shifts
the distribution toward larger assets for each observation, although the
effect is quantitatively small.
The most common form of pension plan in the United States is the

defined

benefit plan, but other forms (primarily the defined contribution

plan) exist as well. The distinction is relevant because the concept of
pension

"liabilities" has meaning only for defined benefit plans. For the

same reason, shareholders in a corporation have no direct financial interest

in how the assets of a defined contribution plan perform. Of the 24,426
plans in Table 1, 16,200 sponsored by 10,470 different companies, and

with $165 billion in assets, were defined benefit plans. Nevertheless,
856 of these plans failed to file Schedule B in time for the Internal
Revenue Service to process it, along with the corresponding Form 5500

return, before June 30, 1979. The remaining 15,344 plans, sponsored by

9,899 companies, reported $152 billion in cnbined assets, Table 3 shows
the distribution of these assets across the 9,899 firms.
The information contained in Form 5500 is insufficient, of course,

to facilitate tests of hypotheses about
and

liability

decisions and

corporate

relationships

between pension asset

finance decisions in the conventional

sense. Some source of information about each sponsoring company's balance
sheet, as well as its income statement and other aspects of its financial

situation, is also necessary. Because many of the 15,098 companies sponsoring
pension plans included in the 1977 Form 5500 sample are either small or
closely held, however, obtaining such information on a comprehensive basis

would be impractical if not impossible. By contrast, most of the larger

are included in the Standard & Poor's

companies

Compustat file. A systematic

based on a computer procedure supplemented with "by hand" inspection,

search,

revealed

1,690 corporations included in the Compustat file that were sponsors

of 5,788 pension plans included in the 1977 Form 5500 sample.6
Even so, simply matching Compustat firms with pension plan sponsors

would

still be inadequate.

The Compustat file reports balance sheets and

earnings statements for each included corporation on a consolidated basis

—that is, including all of the corporation's wholly owned subsidiaries.

From

the perspective of analyzing corporate financial behavior at the

level

of the relationships posited in this investigation, consolidation is pres.unably

the

sponsors

correct procedure. Matching Compustat firms

with

pension plan

would be inadequate, therefore, without also consolidating plans

sponsored by each Compustat firm with plans sponsored by its subsidiaries

(if any). A laborious "by hand" search indeed revealed that 593 Compustat
firms

were sponsors -'--not directly,

but through subsidiaries —of 2,040

pension plans included in the 1977 Form 5500 sample.7 Of the 593 Compustat
firms

sponsoring pension plans through subsidiaries, 447 also sponsored

one or more plans directly.

The fully aggregated and consolidated sample available for use in
testing for relationships between pension decisions and corporate financial

therefore consists of 7,828 pension plans (including defined
benefit as well as other type plans, and, among defined benefit plans,
decisions

those that did and did not file Schedule B), with $153 billion in combined
assets, sponsored by 1,836 consolidated companies.8 Table 4 shows the

distribution

of the $153

billion of assets across the 1,836 firms.

Of

the 7,828 plans sponsored by consolidated Coxnpustat companies, 5,836 were

defined benefit plans, of which 5,670 filed Schedule B in time for Internal
Revenue

Service processing. Table 5 shows the distribution of these 5,670

plans' $110 billion of assets across the plans' 1,552 sponsoring firms.
A comparison of Tables 2 and 4,

and of Tables 3 and 5,

shows that the result

of not only consolidating subsidiaries into parent companies but also
excluding all plans

not sponsored by a Compustat firm (even through a sub-

sidiary) is to shift the distribution further toward larger dollar amounts
per company.

II. Pension Funding Strategy
In the most abstract conception of the incorporated firm, the assets
and

liabilities

of a corporation's defined benefit pension plan(s) are

just like the assets and liabilities that appear on its balance sheet.
Shareholders own both sets of assets, and they are responsible (to the

extent of their equity) for both sets of liabilities. Whether the firm's
management

acts so as to maximize the share price, to maximize expected

profits, or to achieve

yet some other objective, there is no need to dis-

tinguish between one pooi of assets and the

liabilities

other, or between one group of

and the other.

Such an abstraction may fail to describe the world of U.S. corporations and their sponsored pension plans for several well-known reasons.'°
At the most practical level, the firm's flexibility on the pension liability

side is usually severely limited. Conventions of labor market practice,
reinforced by legal requirements and often by collective bargaining agreements, restrict the range within which a firm and its workers can divide

total labor

costs

between current and deferred compensation. To the extent

that the firm's basic pension liabilities are predetermined from the perspective of financial decision making, therefore, its choice of pension
"liabilities" in this context refers only to that part of the basic actuarial

liability

in excess of the amount

of assets coimitted to the pension fund.

Hence decisions about pension "liabilities" in this sense are really decisions

about pension assets. Moreover, the firm's flexibility is limited here too,
in that its pension funding position must meet standards specified by the

nployee Retirement Income Security Act

apart fran such constraints, a variety of considerations may

scheduling of the "debt service" associated with the

two kinds of liabilities may differ in important ways. A second distinction
is that pension liabilities, unlike the firm's other liabilities in most

circumstances, are insured in a way that limits the firm's exposure. The
Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation insures corporations' pension liabilities in full but, in the event of default, has a claim on only one-third

of the firm's assets. The tax treatment of pension plans provides a third
reason why the simple abstraction, in which one asset or liability is just

like any other, may not apply to actual corporations. Payments of funds
into the pension plan are deductible from the firm's income for tax purposes, and earnings on assets held in the pension plan are excluded from

taxable income. Finally — although these four factors do not exhaust
the possible reasons for distinguishing pension versus

and liabilities — shareholders

another way, the question is whether the firm treats pension liabilities

and other liabilities as substitutes or conlements, although the sense
of substitutability versus complementarity involved here differs somewhat
from the usual one in which vector X includes specific time—varying yields
associated with PL and BL.

where X is, in turn, each of a series of variables describing the firm and
its operating environment. ice again, the positive relationship between
pension and other liabilities (both scaled by net worth) holds up regardless
of the choice of additional controlling variable.
The specific results for the partial effects of the several controlling

variables are also interesting in some cases. Neither the growth rate nor

trend-adjusted variability of the firm's earnings had a significant
effect on its pension liabilities. The 1977 rate of return on assets
the

affected pension liabilities positively, but the mean rate of return over

the past ten years did not. The negative effect of the volatility of rate
of return was marginally significant in the full sample, but not in the
subsample with large pension liabilities relative to the firm's total assets.

The firm's tax status had no significant effect. As would be expected, the
firm's labor intensiveness affected pension liabilities positively, arid the

fraction of the firm's pension plan participants who were still employed
affected pension liabilities negatively; but both effects were significant
in the full sample only.

The failure of so many basic aspects of the firm's risk and return
situation to affect its pension liabilities supports the suggestion, made
above,

that

the firm does not actually choose PL in the usual portfolio

sense. Instead, the firm may take PL as given — by labor market
considerations, for example — so that its actual choice in this
context is simply how much of its pension liabilities to fund. If the

The parallel question in this context is whether firms with large

values that are again consistent

Hence the fLrm-to-fjrm variation in pension funding does not simply

reflect individual firms' decisions strictly about their unfunded liabilities.

—18—

At

the margin, with

other

factors equal, a firm with an additional $1 of

pension liabilities typically funds only about 60 more in pension assets.
This marginal funding rate — marginal from one firm to the

rather than

that is,

time — is also just equal to the average

funding ratio (.62) for all firms

the sample. In addition, the
consistent finding of a negative y value in (9) and (10) indicates that
firms

with

in

greater amounts of non-pension liabilities fund their pension

liabilities less fully, to

the extent of about a l0 reduction in pension

funding for each $1 of additional non—pension liabilities. This result is
again consistent with Sharpe's analysis of the pension funding decision in
the context of the value of the put to the PBGC.

The main conclusions that emerge from this consideration of the
firm's choice of pension liabilities and funding, on the asstunption that

the asset and liability totals on the firm's balance sheet are predetermined
with respect to its pension decisions, are (1) that pension liabilities,
either in total or in excess of funding, depend positively on the firm's
other liabilities; (2) that firms do not make decisions simply with respect
to their unfunded pension liabilities, but instead fund pension liabilities
less than one-for-one at the margin; (3) that funding of the firm's pension
liabilities depends negatively on its other liabilities; and (4) that,
apart from labor—specific characteristics like the firm's labor intensiveness
and the working—retired status of its labor force, basic aspects of the
firm's risk and return position have no apparent effect on its choice of
either total or unfunded pension liabilities.

—19—

III. The Earnings Smoothing Hypothesis
The discussion of pension funding strategy in Section II focuses

on fundamental aspects of portfolio behavior: substitutability versus
complementarity of pension arid other liabilities, the degree to which pension

assets offset pension liabilities, and the role of other measures of risk

and return confronting the firm. From the perspective of any familiar theory
of corporate financial behavior, these considerations and others like them
are the principal determinants of the firm's pension decisions.

By contrast, discussions of pension funding strategy by corporate

practitioners often emphasize different factors. In particular, in seeking
to explain why so many firms underfund their pension pians

despite

apparent

tax incentives to fund fully, corporate financial officers and other financial
market participants frequently cite the "hidden" nature of pension liabilities.
Because the pension plan is off the balance sheet, shareholders and others

may be at least partly unaware of the associated liabilities. The most
obvious implication of this assertion is that a firm may be able to raise
its share price by substituting pension liabilities for liabilities that

appear on the balance sheet, but recent research on the relationship between
stock prices and pension liabilities has provided evidence that typically
18

warrants rejecting this proposition.
A further implication of the idea that pension assets and liabilities

are "hidden" is that shareholders and other interested persons may judge
the firm's performance by its reported earnings, rather than by more com-

prehensive flow measures. Because contributions to a firm's pension plan
reduce

its reported earnings in the same way as any other expense item,

control over the timing of pension contributions enables firms to influence
the

time path of reported earnings. To

the

extent that the management seeks

—20—

to report smoothly growing earnings over time, therefore, it may want to
increase pension contributions when business is strong and reduce them when
business is weak. Such actions need not change the total amount contributed
to the pension plan over time. Indeed, in the broader context that consolidates the firm's pension assets arid liabilities with its other assets and

liabilities, such actions change nothing at all. They have a purpose only
if some constituency, whose actions matter to the corporation, focuses on
the time path of reported earnings.

This earnings smoothing hypothesis provides a potential explanation
for the pension underfunding puzzle to the extent that firms with unfunded
pension liabilities have more flexibility to adjust the timing of their

pension contributions than do firms with fully funded pensions. Restrictions
on pre-funding unaccrued pension liabilities prevent a firm with a fully
funded pension from making extraordinary increases in contributions, and
firms that simply decide to fund fully choose thereby to forego using the
potential flexibility in the opposite direction.
Data from the 1977 Form 5500 sample provide evidence indicating

that firms typically do manage earnings in this way. For the entire sample
of firms with defined benefit plans, 70.0% had before—tax reported earnings

streams that were smoother, as measured by the normalized ten—year standard
deviation

around trend, than the corresponding consolidated earnings including

pension contributions. On an after-tax basis, with the included pension
contributions adjusted for additional taxes that the firm would otherwise
have paid, 70.5% of firms had smoother reported earnings than consolidated
earnings -

Nevertheless, the data provide almost no support for the claim that
firms with underfunded pension liabilities are more likely to manage their

—21—

reported earnings in this way. Table 8 shows the percentages of firms

with

smoother reported than consolidated earnings, comparable to the percentages
reported above, for a break-down of the full sample according to the ratio

of pension assets to pension liabilities. If anything, these distributions
seem to indicate that firms with underfunded pension liabilites are less

likely to engage in smoothing their reported earnings by managing their

pension contributions. Only for the two extreme subsamples —with funding
ratios below .10 or above .90 — does the relationship go in the hypothesized
direction.

A more systematic examination of the data confirms this impression.

reported earnings and consolidated earnings, respectively, yields a value
of which is positive, as hypothesized, but negligibly small and with

t—statistic

less than 0.1. The results for the relationship based on

after—tax earnings are analogous.
In stan, the evidence does show substantial prevalence of the timing

of pension contributions so as to smooth reported earnings, but it does not
support the hypothesis relating this activity to the funding status of firms'

pensions. The explanation for the underfunding puzzle apparently lies
elsewhere.

IV. Pension Asset Allocations
Private pension pians invest their assets in a way unlike any other

major category of institutional investors. For the aggregate of all pension
plans, nearly two—thirds of all assets held are corporate equities. Among
other major investor groups (apart from mutual funds), the corresponding
fractions are about one-fifth equities for the public pension plans sponsored
by state and local governments, one-sixth equities for fire and casualty
insurance companies, and one-ninth equities for life insurance companies
19

(even including some "separate accounts")

Clearly there is something

unique about the investment choices made by private pension plans.

To the extent that the assets in a corporation's defined benefit
pension plan "belong" to the sponsoring firm's shareholders, in the sense
that they and not the plan's beneficiaries stand to gain or lose according
to the assets' return, the heavy concentration of private pension assets in

equities is not surprising.0 By holding the corporation's shares in the
first place, shareholders have already expressed the desire for an equity

investment. Because of the pension plan(s) that the firm sponsors, however,
each such investment represents ownership in two pools of assets. If the
firm's pension plan holds debt securities instead of equities, then the
-shareholder's investment is no longer a pure (or even levered) equity but a
mixture of debt and equity claims.
In the simplest abstraction like that used to motivate the discussion

in Section II, a corporation would not hold its pension assets in any form

other than the ordinary assets of its business —that is, in its own stock.
Legal restrictions preclude holding pension assets entirely in this form,

however, and also impose "prudence" standards that many firms interpret
to preclude investing pension assets entirely in equity securities even on

—23—

a fully diversified basis. Once again, therefore, the extreme simplification does

not adequately describe the behavior of actual corporations and

the pension plans that they sponsor. In addition, tax considerations appear
to favor holding equity assets outside the pension plan and

debt

assets in

the plan.21
The discussion in Section II emphasizes the role of the firm's pension
assets and liabilities, along with the assets and liabilities on its balance
sheet,

in determining its overall risk and return posture. The allocation

of the pension assets among alternative investment vehicles

is a further

element in this calculus. For example, borrowing in the credit market
to finance additional (tax-deduction augmented) pension contributions has
essentially no risk implications for the firm if the pension plan then
invests these funds in debt securities, but such an action increases the
firm's risk if the pension plan invests in equities.22

The dependence of the firm's riskand return posture on the allocation
of its pension assets raises in turn the possibility that these allocations

may depend on the firm's asset—liability structure in thesense of either
(1) or (2), or on other characteristics of the firm's business and

financial situation as introduced in (3), or on both. Sharpe's analysis
described in Section II, for example, suggests that firms with nontrivial
probability of bankruptcy have an incentive to maximize the value of the

effective put to the PBGC. In the context of pension asset allocation
decisions, therefore, the Sharpe hypothesis is that firms bearing
greater overall risk will tend to invest their pension assets more in

equities. Hence the more highly levered a firm is (as measured by
debt on the balance sheet or by unfunded pension liabilities), or the
greater is its risk exposure in other regards, the greater is the firm's

—24—

incentive to invest its pension

assets

in equities.

In the simple context of (3), the question of pension asset

allocation represents simply a disaggregation within the pension asset

total PA. By contrast, if the total amount of pension assets is predetermined with respect to the allocation

as seems plausible in the

context of most corporations' decision procedures —then PA is the
constraining variable and

variability of the firm's earnings relative to trend —a result that is
directly counter to the implication of Sharpe's hypothesis. Moreover,
this result holds regardless of the definition of earnings used (before
tax, after tax, with or without consolidation of pension contributions,

etc.), and

it also holds for subsaxnples limited according to the importance

of pension

assets

23

in the firm's overall asset structure.

Hence firms

with greater business risk, as measured by greater volatility of earnings,
systematically seek to offset at least part of that risk by investing
their pension assets in instruments other than equities.
It is interesting that several measures included in Table 9

do not appear to affect pension asset allocations. Despite the incentives
for taxable firms to hold high—yield assets in their pension plans and
low—yield assets on their balance sheets, as emphasized by Black (1980)
and Tepper (1981), the firm's tax status over the past five years had

no apparent impact at this level. Similarly, although the age and
related structure of the pension plan's beneficiary population affects
the time profile of liabilities under the plan, the current employment

ratio also had no effect. Finally, the firm's overall pension funding

ratio had no noticeable effect either — again in apparent contradiction
of Sharpe's analysis.

It is also useful to note how two specific aspects of the results
shown in Table 9 carry over to the larger sample including Compustat firms'

defined contribution plans as well as their defined benefit plans. First,
the negative relationship between earnings volatility and the equity allocation was smaller in absolute magnitude, but statistically more significant,

in the broader sample.24 With cY(EBIT) as the control variable in (13), the

—26—

estimated value of in the equity equation was —.11, with t—statistic
-4.0 (R 2 = .60). Second, although the current employment ratio of the
beneficiary

population

did not matter in the defined-benefit—only saxle,

it did in the broader sample. With AGE as the control variable, the
estimated
2.1

value of

2 =
(R

.60)

in the equity equation was .014, with

Because a large AGE ratio typically reflects a younger

beneficiary population, a positive

workers

t—statistic

25

value means

that plans with younger

are typically more heavily invested in equities.

Hence pension

plans in which the beneficiaries stand to gain or lose according to the
return on the plan's invested assets do take account of the beneficiary

population's age structure in making asset allocation decisions, even though
plans in which the firm's shareholders stand to gain or lose from the
assets' return do not.

The pension asset allocation and

the

pension funding ratio are two

major determinants of prospective risk and return for many

firms.

A third

important element in the risk and return structure, of course, is the debt

on the firm's balance sheet. The relationship among these several components
raises the possibility, therefore, that the firm's allocation of its pension

assets may also depend on its basic leverage. A relationship consistent
with the risk—offsetting strategy reported above, for example, would be for
highly levered firms to offset some of their leverage by holding debt

securities in their defined benefit pension plans.27 Alternatively,

under

either Sharpe 's PBGC put hypothesis or some form of "general

aggressiveness" hypothesis, firms content to have a more leveraged

position,

as

indicated by the liabilities on their balance sheets,

might further extend that risk posture by investing their pension assets

in equities.

—27—

Table

10 presents the results of an attempt to examine this question

in compact form by estimating the regression

PAD

=

(14)

cL+YBL+BEQ+X

where BEQ is the book value of equity on the firm's balance sheet, and

all

other variables are as before. The estimated value of y is consistently
positive, in contradiction to either the Sharpe hypothesis or a "general
aggressiveness" hypothesis, indicating instead that firms with more

highly

levered balance sheets have some tendency to offset that leverage

by investing more or their pension assets in debt secuzities. 28

Somewhat

surprisingly, however, this positive relationship is statistically

significant (and

larger) in the broader

sample

tion plans but not in the sample limited

including

defined contribu-

to defined benefit plans.

The estimated $ values shown in Table 10 support and extend the

findings shown in Table 9

assets

in

several ways. First, the allocation

to debt securities is positively related to any

variability of earnings. It is
larger

with

measure of the

interesting that this effect, too,

is

always

and more highly significant in the broader sample. Second, firms

high rates of return (to either assets or book equity) tend to invest

their pension assets more in equities and less in debt securities. Third,
the firm's tax status

allocation,

apparently

has no independent impact on pension asset

although allowing for it about doubles

the estimated magnitude

of the effect of balance sheet leverage. Fourth, after allowance for balance
sheet leverage, firms with yowiger pension beneficiary populations tend to
invest more in debt securities and less in equities, although the estimated

effect is smaller (as would be expected) and statistically insignificant

in

the broader sample including defined contribution plans.
The main conclusions of this analysis of the allocation of pension

assets, on
the

the

assumption that not only the pension asset total but also

other principal elements of the firm's asset and liability structure

are predetermined with respect to that allocation choice, are (1) that firms
with more volatile earnings invest pension assets so as to offset their
ordinary
the

business risk by holding less equity and

more debt securities in

pension; (2) that firms with more highly leveraged balance sheets invest

pension

assets so

as to offset

this risk too, again by holding less equity

and more debt securities in the pension; (3) that firms earning high rates
of return adopt the opposite allocation strategy, investing pension assets
more in equities and less in debt securities; and (4) that firms' pension
asset allocation decisions also depend on the current employment status
of the pension beneficiary population, with employed (hence presumably
younger) beneficiaries leading firms with defined benefit plans to invest

pension assets less in equity and more in debt securities, but with just
the opposite effect for defined contribution plans.

V. The Corporate Balance Sheet
The empirical analysis undertaken in Sections II and IV considers
first the firm's pension funding strategy, and then its pension asset
allocation, on the assumption that the

amount and nature of assets and

liabilities on the firm's balance sheet are predetermined with respect to

decisions about the firm's pension. Such a secondary role for pension
decisions in corporate financial structures may be plausible when the sums
involved are small in relation to the sponsoring firm's ordinary business

assets and liabilities. In an increasing number of corporations, however,
pension liabilities (and pension assets too, if the liabilities are fully
funded) are large in comparison to the assets and liabilities that appear

on the firm's balance sheet. Moreover, pensions are continuing to grow
more rapidly than general corporate assets or liabilities. The larger
pensions become, the more likely it is that firms make decisions about their

pension assets and liabilities and their other assets and liabilities
jointly.

As the discussion in Section II already emphasizes, the combination
of legal requirements and established labor market practices sharply restricts

many firms' flexibility with respect to their pension liabilities. In
considering possible interrelationships by which the firm's pension assets

and liabilities affect its ordinary business decisions, therefore, a useful
place to begin is the possibility that the direction of influence in (4)

and (5) is backward. Estimating the reverse relationship, in which the firm
takes its pension liabilities as given in deciding how much to borrow on
its

balance

NW

sheet,

=

c+y
NW

(15)

—30—

yields

y =

.26, with t—statistic 7.8 (R2 = .04),

for the sample of all

firms sponsoring defined benefit plans, and y = .34, with
2 =
t-statistic 7.9 (R
.17) for the subsample in which each firm's pension
Conipustat

liabilities equal at least one—tenth of its total assets.29
That estimating (4) in the reverse order (15) again leads to a
significant positive relationship is hardly surprising. What is more
interesting is that the positive partial relationship between pension
liabilities and other liabilities — that is, the relationship after
allowance for other controlling variables — also holds up on reversal

of the ordering. Table 11 presents results, analogous to those in
Table 6, of estimating the reverse of (5),
=

(16)

for the full sample and the sample with PL/TA > .10. ice again, the strong

positive value of y appears regardless of the choice of controlling variables.
Although the focus of this paper is not on corporations' debt issuance,
except in

its relation to their sponsored pension plans, it is interesting

nevertheless to notice several of the

values in Table 11. First, the

growth of earnings had no effect on pension liabilities in (5), but earnings

growth negatively affects other liabilities in (16). This result also holds
for other definitions of earnings. Second, the mean rate of return either
on

assets or on equity (not shown in the table) had no effect on pension

liabilities in (5), but mean returns negatively affect other liabilities
in (16). Third, the variability of the firm's rate of return affected
pension liabilities negatively in (5), but return variability affects other
liabilities positively in (16), at least in the full sample.3° Fourth,

labor intensity affected pension liabilities positively in (5), at least
in the full sample, but labor intensity affects other liabilities

negatively in (16). Each of these influences is familiar in the literature
on

corporate choice of capital structures, and these results would perhaps

be of interest in an investigation of that subject. In the context of this
paper's focus on pensions, the main point is simply that the positive

partial relationship between pension liabilities and other liabilities
holds up after allowance for any of these separate effects.
Similar

conclusions follow fran reversing the order of (7) and (8),

which treat not total pension liabilities but only the unfunded portion

as the relevant measure. Estimating the reverse relationship

Controlling for additional influences by estimating the regression

PL-PA

(1.8)

also yields consistently positive y values, and values roughly in line
with those shown in Table 11 and discussed above.
Cmce again, it is useful to examine whether pension liabilities and
assets

matter separately in this context, or whether what matters is only

the difference, as in (17) and
BL

(18).

For the PL/TA > .10 sample, the corresponding

results are y = .58 and 6 = —.54, with respective t—statistics 6.1 and —3.1

(R2 = .17).

To the extent that firms make borrowing decisions in light

of their pension assets and liabilities, therefore, what matters is just

the unfunded pension liabilities.32 Moreover, these results too hold up
in the presence of other controlling variables like those included in Table
10.

Finally, if firms

decide

on their pension assets arid liabilities

and on their other assets and liabilities in a fully joint way, then neither
the direction of influence assumed in the regressions presented in Section II
nor that assumed in (15) — (19) is strictly correct. Instead, a fully

simultaneous portfolio choice like that in (3) —or, if only unfunded
pension liabilities matter, (6) —would be the correct way to view the
firm's decision process. Table 12 presents results (values of ) for
estimating (3) directly, using one independent variable at a time. These
results add little to the analysis above, however. With the somewhat
marginal

exception of the earnings volatility measure, the estimation of the

full portfolio choice model does not reveal influences that affect both the
pension and

the

balance sheet.33

The main conclusions of this analysis of the relationship between the
firm's borrowing decisions and

its

pension assets and

liabilities

are (1)

the amount of liabilities on the firm's balance sheet is positively
related to the firm's pension liabilities; and (2) that what matters for
that

the determination of balance sheet liabilities in this context is just the
firm's unfunded pension liabilities rather than its pension assets and
liabilities

separately.

Concluding Remarks

The final paragraph in each of Sections II - V summarizes in capsule
form the principal specific empirical findings of this paper, arid there is

no need to restate each one here. The unifying overall conclusion from
the data is that U.S. corporations do not manage the pension plans which
they sponsor as if these plans had nothing to do with the corporation.

Different responses appear to characterize firms' behavior in different
contexts, but the evidence persistently indicates clear relationships
between decisions about pension assets and liabilities arid decisions about

the other assets and liabilities of the firm. At the same time, the pattern
of these relationships is, more often than not, inconsistent with familiar
hypotheses that have emerged thus far in the theoretical literature

pension aspects of corporate finance.
At least three caveats are important, however. The most significant

analyzing

is

that the measurement of pension liabilities is hardly uniform across

firms. To the extent that each corporation's management believes that
the value it reports for liabilities on Form 5500 Schedule B is the best
available measure of the firm's actual commitment or exposure, firm—to—
firm variation in actuarial assumptions need not affect the analysis here.
If managements make allowance for the differing actuarial assumptions,
however, then this analysis neglects a potentially important element.34
Further potential problems of a related nature also arise in connection with
the date and the method chosen for Schedule B valuation of pension assets.

The second major caveat stems from the use in this paper of fully
consolidated firm data, incorporating all wholly owned subsidiaries, whenever

possible. No doubt many parent corporations do adopt a consolidated approach
to financial management. Even so, the possibility remains that many

-.34 —

firms

handle such matters as pension decisions in a decentralized way,

or that some of the parent-subsidiary relationships consolidated here were
then (and may still be) too recent to have had much impact on the structure
of the subsidiaries' pension assets and liabilities.

The third reason for caution in interpreting the results presented
here is simply that they reflect evidence from a cross—section of firms

(a quite comprehensive cross-section, to be sure) in one year only. Despite
its portfolio-theoretic approach, therefore, the analysis entirely omits
any account of effects due to changing yield relationships over time.
For the same reason, the analysis is also subject to all of the usual

problems associated with observing only one point in time. Was 1977 a
"typical" year, in any or all of the many senses that matter here? It is
never possible to answer such a question adequately. At the least, however,
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Pension Benefit

Guarantee Corporation were both very recent as of 1977, and neither may
yet have had its full impact on corporations' behavior.
Each of these three reservations about the analysis presented in this

paper points to potentially fruitful directions for further empirical research.
Taking account of cross-firm variation in pension actuarial decisions, more
carefully treating the range of possible parent—subsidiary relationships,

and working with additional data as it becomes available would all be major
extensions of this work which could importantly alter the conclusions reached.
No doubt additional lines of investigation would provide new insights also.
This paper only begins to analyze the interrelationships connecting private

pensions and corporate finance. As private pensions continue to grow, in
both absolute and relative terms, those interrelationships will almost
surely become more powerful and more important for understanding financial
behavior.

1. The 1977 "plan year" for purposes of Form 5500 is either the 1977
calendar year or the plan's fiscal year beginning in 1977. The plan
sponsor has until seven months after the plan year ends to file the
return.

2. A one—by-one inspection of the 384 plans reporting over $100 million
in assets suggested few obvious omissions among large corporate
sponsors.

3. By contrast, the Federal Reserve System's flow—of—funds accounts
reported

total assets of private pension funds as $178 billion at

yearend 1977 and

therefore

$198

billion at yearend 1978. The Form 5500 data

confirm the widely acknowledged under-reporting in

the

flow-of-funds sample.

assets of $3.8 billion.

11. In many situations, a corporation's principal means

of

flexibility in

this regard is its ability to choose what assumptions (interest rate,
inflation rate, etc.) to use in calculating the actuarial value of the

liabilities to be funded. See, for example, Pepper and Affleck (1974).
A careful empirical study of corporations' behavior in this regard
represents a potentially fruitful line of research, but one that lies
beyond the scope of this paper; see Section VI below.

to note

that regressions of the form (4) and also (5) below, estimated

with BA instead of NW as the scale variable, typically show a small
negative value of y which is marginally significant at the .05 level.
By contrast, most of the results reported in this paper are essentially

invariant

to the choice of NW or BA as the scale variable; see footnote

16 below for the one other case in which this choice makes a substantive

difference.
15. See also the paper by Harrison and Sharpe in this volume.
16. Defined benefit plans report total assets explicitly on Form 5500
and implicitly (as the difference between liabilities and unfunded
liabilities)

on Schedule B. The two asset

measures need not coincide.

For the 1977 sample, the simple correlation between the two is .92 in

the disaggregated sample, and

.95 in the aggregated sample. The

results reported here and below rely on the asset measure implicit in
Schedule B because it is more likely to be consistent with the

liability measure. Here, as in (4), using vested liabilities VL
in place of PL also consistently results in a significant positive

relationship,

but with smaller y values. In the regressions of the

form (7) as well as (8) below, replacing NW by BA as the scale

variable typically leads to small (in absolute value) values of 1
of either sign, that are not statistically significant; see again

19. These aggregate data are from the Federal Reserve System's flow—offunds

accounts

for yearend 1980. Although the proportions vary over

time, primarily as a result of fluctuations in equity prices, the 1980
values are not atypical.

20. See Pesando (1981) for evidence on beneficiaries' implicit sharing in
these returns, however.

it is -.75, with t—statistic —2.2.

24. Again this result carried over to all measures of earnings.

25. The corresponding

values in the PAD and PAO equations were both

negative, though not statistically significant.

26. This distinction between equity investment in the accumulation and
the annuity phases of defined contribution pension plans corresponds
to

what many participants in TIAA-CREF voluntarily elect when they

switch
of

their pension reserves from CREF

to TIAA at or near the time

retirement.

27. If the observations in the sample corresponded to different dates
for the same firm, then

a positive relationship between

balance

sheet leverage and pension asset allocations to debt securities
would be evidence that firms behaved over time as Black (1980)

and Tepper (1981) have suggested that they should for tax reasons.
In a cross-section sample, however, no such inference would be

warranted. At most, a positive cross-section relationship would
indicate differences among firms in their extent of implementation
of Black and Tepper's advice.

28. This positive relationship is opposite to what I found in earlier
work based on a limited sample of Form 5500 and related data for
plan year 1976.

29. Using vested liabilities VL in place of PL in (15) does not substantially affect the estimated y values, but does reduce the associated
t—statistics; for the two samples reported above the results based

on VL are, respectively, y =

.31,

with t-statistic 6.4 (R2 =

03),

and y =

.26,

with t—statistic 5.0 CR2 =

.07).

30. The variability of the rate of return on equity affects other
liabilities negatively in both the full sample and the PL/TA >

.10

subsample.

31. Using vested liabilities VL in place of PL in (17) also consistently
results in a significant positive relationship, but with smaller y
values.

32. These results apply to the Schedule B value of assets. For the Form
5500 asset totals, which need not have the same date as the liabilities
reported in Schedule B, corresponding results are y = .46 and

= —.32,

with respective t—statistics 8.9 and —4.9 CR2 = .06) for the full
sample, and y = .58 and 5 = —.40, with respective t—statistics 8.7
and —4.7 (R

2 =
.23) for the subsample.

33. The results for estimating (6) are comparable.

34. As Jay Light

points

out in his discussion in this volume, there is

also a problem if managements use differing actuarial concepts in

defining pension "liabilities"
used,

if

or, even if a single concept is

that concept differs importantly from that assumed here.

The concept of pension "liabilities" used here (as in all of the
previous literature cited above) is the actuarial present discounted

value of accrued obligations for future benefit payments. This
concept is identical to the notion of "actuarial present value of
accumulated plan benefits" as defined by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) in its Statement No. 35, adopted March, 1980

(see especially pp. 6—9). What matters here, however, is what
concepts managements used at the time when they submitted their

companies' reports for the 1977
reading

plan

year.

the

basis

of a close

of the pension handbooks and texts available at that time,

as well as the few available surveys of pension actuarial practice,
it is not possible to determine whether — or to what extent
managements relied on the concept used here,
formalized

which was later

by FASB-35, or the different net concept suggested by

Light, or yet some other interpretation. The question does bear
importantly on the empirical work in this paper, as well as in

all other empirical studies involving pension liability data before
FASB-35.
