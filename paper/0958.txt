The Reaction of Stock Prices to
Unanticipated Changes in Money
ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the short—run effect of unexpected changes in

the weekly money stock on common stock prices. Survey data on money market
participants' forecasts of money changes are employed to construct the

measure of unanticipated movements in the money stock. The results indicate
that an unexpected increase in money depresses stock prices and, consistent

with the efficient markets hypothesis, only the unexpected part of the weekly

money announcement causes stock price fluctuations. The October 1979 change
in Federal Reserve operating procedures appears to have made stock prices
somewhat more sensitive to large money surprises.

THE REACTION OF STOCK PRICES
TO UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN MONEY

Much of the past work on the money—stock market relationship centered
on the question of whether money is a leading indicator of stock prices.

Studies by Sprinkel [23], Homa and Jaffee [11], and Hamburger and Kochin [9]
supported the view that past increases in money lead to increases in equity
prices.

The implication

of this work was that investors could earn above

normal profits by using a trading strategy based on the observed behavior

of the money stock. This contradicts the efficient markets hypothesis which

asserts

that current asset prices reflect all available information so that

no such trading strategy can exist. Subsequent research by Cooper [31,
Pesando [18], Rozeff [22], and Rogalski and Vinso [20] has shown that past
money changes do not contain predictive information on stock prices, upholding
the efficient markets view.

This paper investigates whether the response of common stock prices
to weekly money announcements is consistent with the prediction of the

efficient markets hypothesis. Unlike the above research, therefore, the
focus is on the very short—run response of stock prices to both anticipated

and unanticipated announced changes in money. Recent work by Berkman [1],
Grossman [8], Urich and Wachtel 1261, and Roley [21] indicates that short—
term interest rates respond only to the unexpected component of the announcement, with short—term rates rising when the announced change in money exceeds
1/
the expected change.—
Berkman also examined the reaction of stock prices,
.

finding that an unanticipated increase in the money supply depressed share

prices. Lynge [13] found that positive money announcements lowered stock

—2—

prices, but since he did not distinguish expected from unexpected money
growth,

his results do not bear directly on the efficient markets issue.

In investigating the response of stock prices to weekly money announcements, survey data on market participants' forecasts of the announced
weekly change are used to distinguish expected from actual changes in money.
Using these data, the usual representation of the efficient markets model
is generalized by allowing the possibility that responses to unanticipated

money are both nonlinear and asymmetric. Three further questions are then
considered: has the reaction of stock prices changed since the Federal
Reserve altered its monetary control procedures in October 1979; does the
impact of unexpected money on stock prices extend beyond the opening quotes;
and do stock prices move in anticipation of the money announcement.

The paper is organized as follows. In the first section, the theoretical framework linking money and stock prices is reviewed. The data on
money announcements, the survey measure of expected money changes, and changes

in stock prices are described in the second section. In the third and fourth
sections, the empirical results are presented, while the final section
summarizes the main conclusions.

—3—

I. Theoretical Framework
At least two explanations are consistent with the notion that stock
prices are negatively related to unanticipated announced weekly changes in

money. One explanation is that when money rises faster than expected, agents
revise upward their expectations of future inflation. In turn, higher
expected inflation is thought to depress stock prices through a number of

channels. Feldstein [6] argues that inflation decreases real after—tax
profits because of the nonindexation of inventory and depreciation charges.
Lower expected profits require equity prices to drop in order for stock to

provide a competitive return. Empirical support for this view is reported
by Summers [25] in an analysis of firm data. Increased expected inflation
would also depress stock prices if it raises the expected return on an

alternative asset such as owner—occupied housing. Hendershott and Hu [101
and Summers [24] provide evidence that this effect was significant in the

1970g. Finally, higher anticipated inflation would cause stock prices to
fall if, as Modigliani and Cohn 115] contend, investors mistakenly compare
the nominal return on bonds, swelled by inflation, to the earnings—price
ratios of stocks (a real rate of return).--"

An alternative interpretation is that the response of stock prices to
unexpected money reflects agents' expectations of the reaction of the Federal

Reserve to the surprise. In particular, market participants may believe
that the Federal Reserve will move rapidly to offset a surge in money with

the consequence of higher short—term interest rates. Moreover, with lagged
reserve accounting, short—term rates may rise even in the absence of overt
Federal Reserve actions if market participants increase their assessment of

-.4—

the excess demand for reserves in the current statement week.-' Through
either of these channels, the anticipation of higher rates in the very near
future prompts sales of short—term securities immediately after the announce-

ment, forcing rates to rise. Since the stock market closes before the
announcement but the money market resumes trading after the announcement,

stock market participants will have already observed the rise in short—term
rates associated with the money surprise when planning their activity for

the next business day. If some holders of stock view short—term securities
as substitutes in their portfolios, the higher short—term yields will cause
these agents to place sell orders, and opening stock prices will likely fall

below the closing prices of the day before. Since this theory hinges on
market participants guessing the future actions of the Federal Reserve,
asymmetries in response or changes in response due to different Federal
Reserve operating procedures would not be unlikely.
As a first step in investigating the reaction of stock prices to
announced weekly changes in money, the usual linear model is employed.
This model may be represented as

SP =
where

a ÷

b(M—iM) + e

LSP = change in stock prices observed after the money
announcement
= announced change in the money stock
=

expected change in the money stock

et = random error term.

The basic proposition of the efficient markets theory is that only the

(1)

—5—

unexpected change in money should influence stock prices so that the data
should not reject the restriction that the coefficients on

and

sum

to zero. The hypothesized behavior of security market participants outlined
above further stipulates that b should be negative.

II.

The Data

The weekly data used in this paper begin on September 29, 1977,

and end on January 29, 1982. Specific details about the data on announced
changes in money, expected money, and stock prices follow.

A. Changes in the Money Stock
The money stock data consist of announced weekly changes in the
narrowly defined money stock, in billions of dollars, as reported in the

Federal Reserve's H.6 release. Both a revised estimate of the previous
week's announced level and the change in money for the statement week ending

on Wednesday of the previous calendar week are reported. Until January 31,
1980, the data used here correspond to announced changes in "old Ml" on

Thursdays at 4:10 p.m. Since then, the announcements have been made on
Fridays at 4:10 p.m. For this period, the data employed are those for Ml—B,
and more recently, Ml, where the definition of this latter aggregate is

equivalent to that of M1—B.-" Over the entire sample period, money announcements were made after the stock market closed.

B. Expected Changes in the Money Stock
The

measure of the expected change in the money stock is the median

forecast of about

60 money

market participants who are surveyed each week

by Money Market Services, Inc.' When the money announcement was made on
Thursdays, this firm solicited forecasts of the change in Ml on both Tuesdays

and Thursdays. The Thursday median prediction is used here

of

as the measure

the expected change during this period. Since February 8, 1980 (when the

Federal Reserve switched to Friday announcements), the survey has been
conducted only on Tuesdays, and the aggregate predicted until the beginning

—7—

of 1982 was Mi—B, and since then, Ml. The median of these anticipated
changes is used as the measure of the market's expected change for this
6/

period.—

Based on the results of other studies, the survey expectations

measure appears to be rational. Grossman [8] examined the survey data
for the pre—October 1979 period, and found that they were efficient and
outperformed a simple autoregressive model in predicting weekly money
7/

changes.—

For the post—October 1979 period, Roley [21] found that the

null hypotheses of unbiasedness and efficiency could not be rejected at
the 5 percent level of significance, and that the survey data again outperformed an autoregressive forecasting equation.

C. Stock Prices
Since the efficient markets theory asserts that current stock prices
reflect all available information, the change in stock prices should be from
just before the announcement to the first observation of prices after the

announcement. For stock prices, this amounts to subtracting the closing
prices on the day of the announcement from the opening prices on the first

business

day following the announcement. Since market participants have

overnight (or over the weekend for the latter part of the sample) to plan

their

response to the new information in the announcement, their reactions

should be reflected in the buy and sell orders given to the specialists for

each stock before the market opens. Hence, the specialists' opening prices,
which attempt to balance supply and demand for each stock, should embody

all the effects of the money surprises.' The possibility that the effect
of unanticipated money persists is, however, explored in section IV. The

—8--

particular stock index employed is the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA).2-" Thus, the dependent variable is the Friday opening value of

the DJLk less its Thursday close for the period up to January 31, 1980,
and the Monday opening less the Friday close for the remainder of the

sample period)21

—9—

III. Estimation Results
In this section, the effects of anticipated and unanticipated announced
changes in money are examined using the basic linear model of equation (1).

The robustness of the results from this model is then checked by testing for
reactions to announced revisions of the money stock and for nonlinear responses.

All models are estimated and tested over three subsamples. The first
period begins on September 29, 1977, when the money survey was initiated,

and ends on October 4, 1979, two days before the Federal Reserve announced

the switch in its operating procedures. Period two covers the weeks after
the policy change when the money announcement was still made on Thursdays.
Period three starts on February 7, 1980, when the money announcement was

shifted to Friday, and runs to January 29, 1982. Observations were dropped
if the money announcement was not made on the usual day or if a holiday inter-

vened between the announcement day and the next business day)-"

A. Basic Model
Table I presents the estimates of the simple linear—response model (1)

for each of the subsamples. Dummy variables were added to the model to allow
for the possible effects of changes in the Federal Reserve's discount rate

announced after the stock market closed)-' The reported F—statistics test
the hypothesis that the coefficients on

and iM sum to zero so that only

unanticipated changes in money affect stock prices. As these test statistics
indicate, this implication of the efficient markets hypothesis cannot be
rejected at conventional significance levels.
The results from Table I also support the theories, given in section I,

which predict that unexpected changes in the money stock have a negative impact

stock prices. In particular, an unanticipated increase in money of $1

billion is associated with a subsequent fall in the DJIA of about .7 points.
Moreover, the coefficients on unanticipated money are statistically less
than zero at the 1 percent level except for the middle period which has
only 14 observations.

B. More Generalized Models
The model used above imposes several implicit constraints which, if not
appropriate, might bias the estimated effects of anticipated and unanticipated

money. This section relaxes two such constraints and reestimates the effects.
One constraint involves the reaction of stock prices to revisions in

the previous week's announced level of the money stock. The basic model (1)
assumes that stock prices react only to unanticipated changes in money,

although new information about the level is also announced. If this information also affects stock prices the model becomes

discount rate at time t.

Furthermore,

an equal response to both the unexpected change and the announced

revision, i.e., b =

c,

means that agents respond to the errors in predicting

the current level of money stock and not just to the unanticipated changes

in money. In this case the model becomes"

When equation (2) is estimated, the hypothesis that b = c

is never rejected

14 /

by the data implying that equation (3) is preferred.—

The response to anticipated money is therefore reexamined by estimating

and M

equation (3) and testing the constraint that the coefficients on

sum to zero. Panel A of Table II presents these results. The reported F—
statistics are for the hypothesis that only a surprise in the level of money

matters—as opposed to the expected level—and this hypothesis cannot be
rejected at high significance levels. Thus, this specification also supports
the efficient markets hypothesis.

The other constraint which is considered is that the response of stock

prices is linear. This restriction can be relaxed by specifying a quadratic
functional form

(4) allows both the unexpected and expected money levels to affect

stock prices nonlinearly. If only the unanticipated level matters, the
coefficients on M, c1 and c2, should be jointly equal to zero.
Panel B of Table II presents the estimates of equation C4)

for

each

subsample, with the restriction imposed that c1 and c2 are zero. The reported
F—statistics indicate that this hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5 percent

significance level. The estimated model for the first period strongly supports
the nonlinear specification and implies that the stock price response

IV.

A Further Examination of the Stock Price Response

Three aspects of the response of stock prices of money surprises are

considered in this section. First, the evidence concerning any change in
the response as a result of the Federal Reserve's adoption of a reserve—

aggregate monetary control procedure is reviewed. Second, the question of
whether the stock price response is complete within one day is examined.
Finally, the behavior of stock prices prior to the weekly money announcement
is investigated.

A. Did the Response Change in the Post—October 1979 Period?
As a result of the Federal Reserve's adoption of new monetary control
procedures in October 1979, Roley 1211 finds that 3—month Treasury bill

yields have become much more responsive. Thus, if stocks and money market
instruments are close substitutes, stock prices may be more responsive

as a result. HOwever, if investors are more concerned about the inflation
consequences of an unanticipated change in money, the reaction of stock

prices may be the same, or even less, than before. In particular, if the
new procedures correspond to a greater commitment by the Federal Reserve
to reduce inflation, any given surprise may contain less information about

future inflation since it may be offset in the near future. Thus, it is
not possible, a priori, to predict whether the reaction of stock prices
should increase in the post—October 1979 period.

The equality of stock price responses in the pre— and post—October
1979 periods was tested for both the basic model (1) and the nonlinear model.
In the case of the basic model, the hypothesis that the response was the
same in the one pre—October 1979 period and the two post—October 1979 periods

—14—

cannot be rejected even at the 50 percent significance level)1 For the
nonlinear specification, however, this hypothesis is rejected at the 10
percent level, and the hypothesis that the response in the first and

third

periods is the same is rejected at the 5 percent level.--' As is apparent
in panel B of Table II, stock prices appear to have reacted less sharply to

small surprises and more sharply to large surprises after the Federal Reserve
began employing the reserve—aggregate approach to monetary

control.

To further investigate the effect of monetary policy, money surprises

were disaggregated according to the relation of money growth to the Federal

Reserve's long—run ranges)1' Following Urich and Wachtel [26], surprises
were divided into three groups: positive surprises when money was above its
target range, negative surprises when money was below the range, and all other

surprises. Both the basic model (1) and the nonlinear model were estimated
with these additional terms. In each case, the results indicated that the
coefficients on the disaggregated surprises are not significantly different..121

Since Urich and Wachtel [26) and Roley [21] found significantly different
Treasury bill yield responses when money was outside Federal Reserve policy

the lack of such differences for stock prices appears to provide some
support for the expected inflation channel. Nevertheless, the tests across
ranges,

periods

using the nonlinear model did suggest that the response differed in

the pre— and post—October

1979 periods.

Thus, it

appears

that no clear choice

between the policy expectations and expected inflation channels can be made.
B. Is the Stock Price Response Complete Within One Day?
In
stock

to investigate whether the effect of unanticipated money on
persists beyond the opening prices of the day after the

order

prices

—15—

announcement, the linear and nonlinear models were reestimated using two

alternative dependent variables. The first, iSPl, is the change in the
DJIA from the opening quotes to 11:00 a.m. EST, one hour after the market

opens. The second, SP2, is the change in the DJIA from the opening to the
close for the day after the announcement.

Panel A of Table III presents the estimated nonlinear models for each

subsample. As these results indicate, the only evidence of persistence
occurs in the third period when the dependent variable is SPl, and the
estimated response is substantially smaller than the initial reaction (compare
equation 3.5 with equation 2.6).---" Thus, these results generally support
the view that the response of stock prices to money surprises is immediate.

C. Do Stock Prices Move in Anticipation of Money Announcements?
The final area examined here concerns the movement of stock prices to

money announcements. If the stock market is efficient, and if investors view
money announcements as a source of significant information, then stock prices

may respond to any new information related to the forthcoming announcement.'
To investigate this aspect of stock price behavior, it is assumed that
equilibrium stock prices at the close of day i may be represented as

Thus, the effect of new information on equilibrium stock prices from

the money announcement on Friday may be expressed as

A consistent estimate of the effect of new information concerning the money
announcement on stock prices may therefore be obtained by combining equations

To implement this specification empirically, the additional assumption is
made that changes in the expectations of other relevant variables may be
represented solely by the change in the 3—month Treasury bill yield from
Tuesday to Friday; i.e.,
Ma — Ma = a + b•(SPF—SPT) + c*(RF_RT) + eF

where

RT,Rp = 3—month Treasury bill yield at 3:30 p.m.

on Tuesday and Friday, respectively,
and

the

coefficient definitions follow from (8).

The estimation results for equation (8) are reported in panel B of
Table III. The results indicate that the movement in stock prices prior
to the announcement is not significantly related to the unexpected part of

the money announcement, unlike the movement in interest rates. This result
could follow either if stock prices do not reflect new information concerning
the announced level of money which became available during the week or if
stock prices move in response to new information about a variety of other
relevant factors, thereby causing a low correlation between money surprises
and stock prices.

IV. Summary and Conclusions

This paper has examined the short—run reaction of stock prices to
weekly

money announcements. The results of this analysis can be summarized

as follows: (1) stock prices respond only to the unexpected change in the
money stock as predicted by the efficient markets theory; (2) an unexpected
increase in money depresses stock prices; (3) stock market participants take
into account the revisions in the level of the money stock as well as
unexpected changes; (4) the stock price response is symmetric with respect
to the sign of the money surprise and does not depend on the relationship

target ranges of the Federal Reserve; (.5) the stock
response appears to be nonlinear and has changed since the Federal

of money to the long—run

price

Reserve

switched to a reserve—aggregate approach to monetary control in

October 1979; and (6) the stock price response is essentially complete early
in the subsequent trading day.

The absence of any asymmetrical or policy range effects contrasts
with the results of studies on the interest rate response to money surprises.
While these effects were not evident, the results nevertheless indicate
that the October 1979 change in policy regimes has affected the response

of stock prices to money surprises. In particular, large money surprises
since October 1979 have been associated with larger changes in stock prices.

1. Using the same survey data as those used here, Urich and Wachtel [23]
obtain this result in tests over individual years, but not over the entire

period corresponding to the availability of the survey data. Using a different
time interval to measure changes in short—term interest rates, Grossman [8]

and Roley [21] find that anticipated announced changes in money as represented
by the survey data are not statistically significant over the same sample
period.

2. A number of empirical studies have found a negative relationship between
inflation and stock prices, including those by Bodie [2J, Jaf fee and Mandelker

fl2], Nelson [17], and Faina and Schwert {5J. The results in these studies are

in sharp contrast to the traditional view that stock prices are either unaffected

by or perhaps positively related to expected inflation. See, for example,
Williams [27].

3. See Grossman [8] and Roley [21] for more detailed descriptions of these
arguments.

4. Announced

placed on
It

changes in Mi—B are analyzed here because of

the

emphasis

Mi—B by the Federal Reserve policymakers and market participants.

should also be noted that the Mi—B data for 1981 are not the shift—

adjusted

Mi—B figures which reflect the introduction of nationwide NOW

accounts. While the Federal Reserve's target range was in terms of shif t
adjusted Mi—B, weekly announced changes were not shift adjusted.

5. We are grateful to Mr. Raul A. Nicho of Money Market Services, Inc.,
for supplying the survey data.

6. An alternative measure was also used for this latter era which adjusted
the Tuesday forecast to take account of relevant information which became

available between Tuesday and the Friday announcement. Following Roley [21],
this new information was assumed to be reflected by the change in the 3—month

Treasury bill yield from 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday to 3:30 p.m. on Friday. To
capture this new information, the announced money change was regressed on

the median predicted change and the change in the Treasury bill yield. The
fitted values from this regression formed the "revised" expectations of

weekly changes in money. However, despite the difference between estimation
results using the survey and revised expectations measures for the Treasury
bill market found by Roley [21], the two expectations measures yielded

virtually the same results for the stock market. Thus, only empirical results
using the survey measure are reported in what follows. For a further discussion of the rationale for using a revised expectations measure, see the
related discussion in section IV.C.

7. The basic notion behind the efficiency test is that if weekly changes
in money are generated by an autoregressive process, the market's expectation

should be generated by the same process. See, for example, Modigliani and
Shiller [15] and Pesando [181. While Grossman [8] could not reject efficiency,
unbiasedness could be rejected. However, the rejection resulted from a
statistically significant constant term. This measure could therefore be
adjusted by adding the estimated bias to the survey measure. However, the
response of stock prices estimated in this paper would be unaffected since
a constant term is always included in the specifications.
8.

For evidence that opening prices are as representative of equilibrium

prices as subsequent intra—day transactions prices, see Garbade and Sekaran [7].

9. The DJIA was used because opening prices of broader stock price indices,
such as the Standard and Poor's 500, are not publicly available. Since
opening prices are calculated by specialists in each stock, the use of the
DJIA may also be preferable given the large trading volumes of the stocks
included in this index.

10. We are grateful to Morgan Lynge, Jr., for the DJIA data through 1979.
The observations for 1980—82 are from Barron's.

11. Four observations were dropped in the first time period, three in the
second, and 13 in the third.

12. The discount rate dummy variables are defined as follows:
D1 = 1 when discount rate raised 1/4 point
= 0 otherwise
D2

= 1 when discount rate raised 1/2 point

= 0 otherwise
D3 = 1 when surcharge raised 3 points
= 0 otherwise

D4 = 1 when discount rate lowered 1 point
= 0 otherwise
D5

= 1 when surcharge lowered 1 point
= 0 otherwise

D6 = 1 when discount rate lowered 1 point and surcharge lowered 1 point
= 0 otherwise.

The estimated coefficients on changes in the discount rate—in cases where
they are statistically significant—imply that an increase in the discount
rate depresses stock prices, and vice versa. For example, the lowering of
both the discount rate and the surcharge by 1 percentage point on October 30,
1981, is estimated to have raised the DJIA by over 11 points.

13. The equivalence of equation (2) and

equation

(3), under the assumption

that b = cS', can be seen by noting that
=

—

and, under the assumption that agents expect no revision in the previous
week's announced level,
= Me

—

M1.

14. The relevant F—statistics for the three periods are F (1,97) =
F (1,11) =

.97,

.17, and F (1,81) = .39, with marginal significance levels of

.325, .686, and .544, respectively.

15. Note that in each period the nonlinear term reduces the magnitude of
the response per dollar of money surprise as the surprise becomes larger.

This behavior is consistent with the notion that, due to seasonal or other

factors, large surprises are sometimes offset in subsequent weeks.

16. The F—statistic is equal to 0.643 with (2,192) degrees of freedom. As
is the case for all tests across the three subsamples reported in this paper,
the estimated equation for the pooled sample was corrected for heteroscedas—
ticity by weighting the observations in each subperiod by the reciprocal
of the estimated standard error from the subperiod regression.

17. The F—statistic for the hypothesis that both linear and nonlinear
coefficients are constant over time is 2.048 with (4,189) degrees of freedom,

which has a marginal significance level of 0.088. The F—statistic for the
hypothesis that the first and third periods had the same coefficients is
3.758 with (2,189) degrees of freedom, which has a marginal significance
level of 0.025.

18. While Urich and Wachtel [26J employ short—run ranges, the Federal
Reserve's long—run ranges are used here. Long—run ranges are used for two
reasons. First, market participants probably made more accurate assessments
of

the long—run ranges. Second, the short—run ranges (and later, paths)

were, in principle, set to be consistent with eventually obtaining money
growth
19.

within the long—run ranges.

For the linear model (1), the relevant F—statistics for the three sub—

samples

are .878 (2,96), .583 (1,11), and 2.506 (2,80) with marginal significance

levels of .422, .461, and .086, respectively. For the nonlinear model, the
relevant F—statistics were .815 (4,93) and 1.047 (4,77) for the first and
third periods with marginal significance levels of .521 and .389, respectively.
The second period was too short for a meaningful test.

20. The linear model yielded identical conclusions. As in the nonlinear case,

the only significant response occurred in the third period for the LxSP1

measure. The point estimate in this case was —. 345 with a t—statistic of
—3.714. This response is roughly half of the initial response and, again,
disappears over the entire trading day.

21. Because only the data for the third subsample is particularly well
suited to investigate this aspect of stock price behavior, the other two

subsamples will not be considered further. In particular, the time interval
between the market survey and the money announcement must be of sufficient

length to allow two stock price observations. Since the exact time of
the day that the market survey is taken is somewhat uncertain, the Thursday
survey and announcement data used here for the first two periods do not
lend themselves to this analysis.

22. Note that the methodology employed here is similar to that used, for
example, by Fama [4] and Mishkin [14] in investigating real interest rates.

23. There are at least two possible rationales for including the observed
change in the Treasury bill yield in equation (.8). First, since a Treasury
bill is an alternative asset, the expected bill yield may be relevant in the

determination of stock prices. If this is the case, and if the bill yield
follows a random walk, then the observed change in the bill yield represents

the relevant change in the expected bill yield. Second, following Fama [4],
the change in the bill yield may represent a change in expected inflation.
