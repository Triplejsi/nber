OPTIMAL CURRENCY DIVERSIFICATION
FOR A CLASS OF RISK AVERSE
INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS

ABSTRACT

In the framework of continuous—time finance theory, this paper derives the
optimal consumption and portfolio rules for an international investor with constant
expenditure shares c, and constant relative risk aversion l—y in a dynamic context.
The index of value obtained from the consumition rule is used to obtain real
returns on N different currencies in terms of their purchasing power over N goods.

The portfolio rule is expressed in terms of the determinants of the purchasing

powers, namely exchange rates and prices expressed in the numeraire currency. The
optimal portfolio is interpreted as a capital position given by the expenditure

shares and hedging zero net—worth ortolios depending on unnticioated inflation
and risk aversion. It is shown that the minimum variance portfolio is independent
of returns, but depends on expenditure patterns.while the speculative portfolio

depends on risk aversion and real return differentials. When the effect of
preferences on real return differentials is made explicit, it is shown that the mini-

mum variance portfolio is affected by risk aversion. In that case, the effect of
an increase in

on the portfolio proportions x will be positive when relative

risk aversion is greater than one, as generally presumed.

Actual data from eight major countries is used to compute optimal 'ortfolios
based on real return differentials for different weighting schemes, degrees of
risk aversion and sample periods,when exchange rates and prices are assumed to be
Brownian.

OPTIMAL CuRRENCY DIVERSIFICATION
FOR A CLASS OF RISK-AVERSE
INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS

Jorge Braga de Macedo*
Princeton University and NBER
The theory of finance from the perspective of continuous time, due

mostly to Robert Merton, was first applied to international finance under

the assumption that only the domestic good was consumed or, alternatively,
that purchasing power parity obtained, so that again there was only one

good.1 Extending earlier work by Pentti Kouri,2 these assumptions were
relaxed in Kouri and Macedo (1978), where a time—invariant portfolio rule

was derived for an "international investor" consuming in fixed proportions

N composite goods produced in N different countries and holding a portfolio of the respective N currencies. This paper retains the convenient
assumption of constant expenditure shares and relative risk aversion, also
treats national outputs as composite goods and ignores nominal interest on

currency holdings,3 but derives the consumption and portfolio rules in a

dynamic context (Section I). In Section II, the properties of the dynamic
optimal currency portfolio are indicated and contrasted with the special
cases of perfectly anticipated inflation and purchasing power parity. The
effect of an increase in consumption shares on portfolio

shares is also

analyzed. Section III presents and interprets portfolios computed under
the assumption of stationarity of the covariance between prices and exchange
rates in eight major countries during the floating rate period.4

Consumption and portfolio rules derived
Consider an individual consuming in fixed proportions

.

goods

produced in N countries and holding a variable portfolio of the N respective

currencies. This international investor takes as given the domestic currency
prices of the N goods as well as the N—l bilateral exchange rates.

Defining

currency N as the numeraire,5 we will assume that exchange rates against the
numeraire as well as prices in terms of the numeraire are generated by
continuous stochastic processes of the Ito type:
=

*.(S1,

P.) dt + a.(S1, P.) dz., i=l,... ,N—l;

=

p.(S.,

P.) dt + .(S., P.) du., j1,...,N;

where S. is the price of currency i in terms of the numeraire
(so that SN =

P. is the price of the good produced

in country j expressed in terms

of

the numeraire,

mean proportional change per unit of time of

unit of time of S(P).
and

dz1 and duj are Wiener processes.

By assumption, the individual's instantaneous indirect utility function

Similarly, the individual's real wealth W is defined as the purchasing

power of the holdings of the N currencies:

W= EN.Q.

where N. are holdings of currency j

Each instant, the level of real consumption and currency holdings are
chosen simultaneously, so that the rate of real consumption is equal to
income from reshuffling the portfolio:

from (4), the change in wealth is equal to the difference

between capital gains and consumption. The real return on the holdings of
currency i(r.) is given by the proportional change in its purchasing power.

It is convenient to measure currency holdings as a proportion of wealth,
so that we can use the constraint

II Properties of the optimal currency portfolio
The portfolio rule for the N—i assets in (17) can be related to some

special cases analyzed in the literature and used to find out the effect

—7—

of changes in

on x.

Suppose first that purchasing power parity holds continuously and

therefore that relative numeraire prices cannot change. The covariance
matrix between numeraire prices and exchange rates reduces to a vector of
covariances between the domestic good of country N and the N—i exchange
rates. In other words, the 'I' matrix defined in (16) decomposes into:

=

(18)

where

'i'N =

e is a N column vector of ones.

Taking (18) into account, and the fact that

1 is invariant

to

a

change

in all prices, we see that the vector of expenditure shares and

the j

terms drop out:
x = S1'Y + —--N
l—y

(19)

[S1r

JS ]

Since there are no relative price changes, the N goods can be aggregated

into a single good when purchasing power parity holds. If, in addition,
inflation in the Nth country is known (so that 5N =

o and

=

O),the

portfolio only depends on real return differentials, as in the case analyzed
by

Kouri (1977) in

the framework of a model with a richer menu of assets.8

As shown in Section III, however, using actual data to compute optimal portfolios suggests not only that inflation is not known with certainty but also
that preferences do matter.
Indeed,

preferences

also enter real return differentials. Writing

the first equation in (7) in vector form, we have:

Then substitute (20) into (17) and use (16) to obtain:

Thus, even when inflation is perfectly anticipated andFis a zero
matrix, the effect of an increase in

will only be a one to one increase

in x. if risk aversion is infinite, so that, from (17) we have x.

In particular, if risk aversion is unity (y =

0) portfolio shares are

insensitive to expenditure shares; if risk aversion is one half, an increase

in o. leads to a one—to—one decline in x1. For the effect in (22) to be
positive we have, therefore, to accept the conon presumption that y < 0.
so that risk aversion is great'er than one.9
We now derive the portfolio rule for the N assets, recalling that, by
definition,
(23)

where e is a N—l column vector of ones.

Using (17) and (23),we define as the vector of minimum variance portfolio

proportions for the N assets, m, the capital position adjusted for the
effects of inflation on utility:

where I is the N identity matrix

—9—

The minimum variance portfolio proportions sum to unity. Given that
the cx's are the capital position, inflation is hedged against by zero net

worth portfolios and, in particular we have:

e' =

0'

where 0 is a N column vector of zeros.

In turn we define a zero net—worth portfolio based on real return

differentials, adjusted for the effects of exchange rates on utility. The vector
of speculative portfolio proportions for the N assets, xS, is constructed by
imposing the requirement that the augmented matrix of own and cross effects

is symmetric. It can be written as:

Since the speculative portfolio proportions sum to zero, we have by
the symmetry of

e'E =

The total portfolio is then given by adding m and
(26)

The optimal currency portfolio in (26) can equivalently be interpreted
as showing the difference between expenditure shares and portfolio shares.
Where inflation rates are known

two shares are

equal. Larger variance of inflation and lower risk aversion are the two

factors contributing to the zero net—worth hedging portfolios. Thus o
hedges against the covarianpe of inflation and exchange rate changes, and

is independent of real returns and risk aversion while r incorporates real
return differentials and is scaled by risk aversion. The other determinants
of optimal currency diversification,

and J, are dynamic adjustments to

the direct effects of price and exchange rate changes on utility. Using
the presentation in (21) , on the other hand, we could define a modified

speculative portfolio based on nominal return differentials, i.,

As an illustration of the usefulness of a rule like (27), consider an

international investor who holds a

basket of goods included in these countries'

consumer price indices. Using

the average quarterly percentage changes in the purchasing powers of these

eight currencies to deflate call money rates and to generate the matrices
and

in (27) and taking a given capital position, we can compute optimal

portfolios. This is done in Table 1, using as

weights the share of each

country in U.S. dollar income in the mid—seventies, for

two sample periods

and two degrees of risk aversion.

Table 1 suggests that inflation was not fully anticipated because,
even under the assumption of stationarity, in both sample periods the

portfolios differ from the capital position more than they differ from

each other (given the same degree of risk aversion). Note also that
when risk aversion is infinite the optimal portfolio is the minimum
variance portfolio

but when risk aversion is two (y=—l) it is the sum of

the minimum variance portfolio and one—half of the speculative portfolio

defined on real return differentials. Furthermore, the comparison of
the two sample periods suggests the usefulness of a time—invariant rule

like (27). In fact, except for sterling and lire, where real returns
changed substantially in 1979 and 1980, the shares do not change too
much."

Now if inflation were perfectly anticipated, an increase in the
share of goods from country I in expenditure would imply an equal increase

in the share of currency i in the minimum variance portfolio. The larger
the variance of inflation relative to the variance of excharge rate
changes the less an increase in c. will be reflected in an increase in

Furthermore, the effect of the covariance of inflation and exchange

rates can be estimated from the elements of : if risk aversion is two,

for example, 3x./a1 =

i../2

while if risk aversion is four, 3x./ci. =

Using the same data as in Table 1, left panel, we can thus estimate the
size of the effect before it is scaled down by risk aversion, provided that

risk aversion Is larger than one. It turns
entries of the computed

out

that about half of the

matrix are less than .1 in absolute value, but

that the effects of the Japanese share on the Canadian dollar and on the
U.S. dollar shares, the effect of the British share on the French franc
share or the own effect of Italy are larger and should not be neglected.11
This suggests that even national infinitely risk—averse investors will
hold a diversified currency portfolio,

so that the

usual presumption that the domestic currency is the "preferred monetary
habitat" should be used with caution. On the other hand, as risk aversion decreases,

the effect of consumption preferences on optimal currency diversification
also decreases, until

it vanishes when relative risk aversion is unity.

Conclusion

This paper has derived the optimal consumption and portfolio rules for
an international investor with constant expenditure shares

and constant

relative risk aversion l—y in a dynamic contest. The index of value
obtained from the consumption rule was used to obtain real returns on

different currencies in terms of their purchasing power over goods. The
portfolio rule was expressed in terms of the determinants of the purchasing

powers, exchange rates and prices expressed in the numeraire currency. The
optimal portfolio was interpreted as a capital position given by the expenditure shares and hedging portfolios depending on unanticipated inflation and

risk aversion. It was shown that, when exchange rates and prices are Brownian
motion there are only two zero net worth portfolios, the minimum variance
portfolio independent of risk aversion and real return differentials but
depending on expenditure patterns and the speculative portfolio independent
of preferences and inflation, but depending on risk aversion and real

return differentials. When the effect of preferences on real return differentials (and hence on the speculative portfolio) is made explicit,
this separation is blurred and the minimum variance portfolio is affected by

risk aversion. In that case, the effect of an increase in c. on the
1
portfolio proportions x. will be positive when relative risk aversion
is greater than one, as generally presumed.

Actual data from eight major countries is used to compute optimal
portfolios based on real return differentials for different weighting
schemes, degrees of risk aversion and sample periods and thereby show

the empirical usefulness of this application of the theory of international
finance from the perspective of continuous time. In particular, the results
presented cast doubt on two popular hypotheses, purchasing power parity
and the preferred monetary habitat.
