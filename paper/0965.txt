Government Debt and Private Leverage:
An Extension of the Miller Theorem

ABSTRACT

This paper shows how government financing decisions can influence the

corporate decision to use debt or equity finance. In particular, it is
shown that an increase in the stock of taxable government debt reduces the
equilibrium quantity of corporate debt, and that an increase in the stock
of tax—free government debt reduces the equilibrium quantity of corporate

equity. The effects of inflation rate and tax rate changes are also considered.

"GOVERNMENT DEBT AND PRIVATE LEVERAGE:

AN EXTENSION OF THE MILLER THEOREM"
INTRODUCTION

This paper shows how government borrowing decisions can influence the

corporate decision to use debt or equity finance. In particular, it is shown
that an increase in taxable government debt reduces the equilibrium quantity
of corporate debt, and that an increase in tax-free debt reduces the

equilibrium quantity of corporate equity. This provides a possible
explanation for
and

the post-war increase in the corporate debt-to—equity

ratio,

may explain the constancy of the debt—to—GNP ratio noted by Friedman

(1981).

It

is

well-documented that U.S. corporations have made increasing use of

debt finance in
Malkiel

the

the post-World War II

years [Ciccolo (1981),

Gordon and

(1981), and Holland and Myers (1978)]. The reason for this rise in

corporate debt-equity ratio is not well documented.

The most compelling explanations are micro—economic. For example, Gordon
and Malkiel argue that corporate leverage is determined by a trade—off between
bankruptcy cost and a tax advantage to debt, and that a burgeoning belief in
the stability of the economy lowered the estimated probability of bankruptcy,

and hence raised optimal leverage. Friedman (1981) notes that the aggregate
nonfinancial debt—to—GNP ratio has been roughly constant the last thirty

years, but does not explain why corporations have increased their use of debt
over

this period.
In view of the typical micro—economic approach to corporate leverage

decisions, the seminal paper by Miller (1977) takes an ingenious twist in
showing that the aggregate leverage ratio may be determinate even if leverage
at the level of the individual firm

is

not determinate. The Miller model thus

2
raises the possibility that macro—phenomena may have something to do with the
post—war increase in corporate leverage.

In addition, because the Miller

model explains aggregate leverage, it offers some hope of explaining the
constancy

of the debt-to—GNP ratio.

If the wealth-to-GNP ratio is

approximately constant, then Friedman may merely have measured a constant
debt—to—wealth ratio.

The basic point of Miller's paper is that the tax treatment of both the
suppliers and demanders of assets affect the equilibrium configuration of

supplies. For example, interest payments on debt are a tax-deductible

asset

expense for corporations, while payments to equity holders are not.
Considering only the supplier, tax laws favor debt over equity. On the other
hand, debt returns are taxed more heavily than equity returns at the personal
level, so considering only the demand side, tax laws favor equity over debt.
This paper shows that in a model like Miller's, an exogenous increase in
government debt will reduce the (endogenously determined) supply of similarly
taxed,

privately—supplied assets.1 This result will hold as long as the

distribution of wealth across tax brackets is approximately unchanged by the
increase in government debt.

it

This argument is presented analytically in Section 1, where' is assumed

that equity is riskiess. The argument is not particularly sensitive to
assumptions

this

about whether government debt is or is not net wealth. Much of

paper is devoted to analyzing the above argument in a model where it is

assumed that there is risky equity, and three riskless assets: tax-free

municipal debt, federal debt, and corporate debt. There is a progressive
income tax, with a lower tax on equity income than on debt income, and a

corporate income tax. There are no bankruptcy or other costs to issuing

debt.2 The principal conclusions are that

3
1) An increase in taxable government debt always reduces the supply of
corporate debt but has an uncertain effect on the quantity of equity; an
increase in tax-free government debt reduces the supply of corporate equity
but has an uncertain effect on corporate debt.

2) Changes in the inflation rate have no effect on the equilibrium
aggregate

debt—to—wealth or corporate debt-to-equity ratio, despite the

taxation and deductibility of nominal rather than real interest payments.
This

assumes that there are no costs to debt finance. If there are bankruptcy

or other debt costs, increases in the inflation rate raise leverage.
Section

2 introduces the model under uncertainty, and Section 3 derives

the comparative static results discussed above. Section 4 explores the
implications of government debt

not being net wealth, and shows that

government debt issues can have real effects in this model even if future tax
payments

are capitalized. Section 5 discusses one implausible predicion of

the model and Section 6 concludes.
Before presenting the argument explicitly, it will prove useful to examine
some historical time series which bear on the theory. The argument is that
increases in taxable government debt are associated with reductions in the
private supply of taxable debt.

The first column of Table 1 presents the market value of taxable debt

outstanding as a fraction of total wealth.3 This series is not completely
constant

series

during the post—war years, but it appears reasonably constant. This

is more striking when examined in conjunction with Column 2,

in which

the federal debt-to—wealth ratio is displayed. Despite a substantial
reduction in federal indebtedness, the total taxable debt-to—wealth ratio in
the seventies was at about the same level as in the fifties.

4

Figure 1 plots the ratio of taxable debt--excluding government debt—-to
wealth (the rising curve) against the ratio of taxable government debt to

wealth (the falling line). Again the inverse relationship is dramatic.
Figure

2 depicts the market-value—of-debt to firm-value ratio for the

business sector as a whole. This has risen throughout the postwar period.

It

is not perfectly correlated with the debt—to-wealth ratio in Figure 1 because
the latter includes household issues of debt, and also because the firm
value—to-wealth ratio has changed over the period.4 It appears clear that

Figure 1 is potentially useful in explaining Figure 2.

1.

EQUILIBRIUM UNDER CERTAINTY

This

section develops Miller's model under certainty and demonstrates that

an increase in taxable government debt lowers the corporate debt to equity

ratio. The purpose is heuristic, so the model is as simple as possible.
There are three assets: equity, which is untaxed, and corporate and
government debt, both of which are taxed. There is a progressive tax at the

rate u on interest income, where i indexes the tax bracket. Within each
tax bracket, there are n1 identical individuals, each with wealth W..

Corporate income is taxed at the rate e, and interest payments are a
tax—deductible expense.

It is assumed that

Because all assets are riskless, individuals choose
the

basis of after-tax return.

among assets solely on

This model is exactly that of Miller (1977),

but with the trivial addition of government debt as an additional asset.

1.1 Demand Equilibrium

Let a be the return on equity, and let r be the gross-of-tax return on
debt.

It is easy to see that individuals will hold equity if a > (1

-

u)r

5

and they will hold debt if the inequality is reversed. Define u, the
marginal tax bracket, by
a

means that the summation is taken over all investors in tax brackets

than u*.

greater

1.2 Supply Equilibrium
Take

the quantity of government debt as given. The advantage to a firm of

using debt instead of equity finance is given by a - r(1 — e). Fl-ms are
indifferent between debt and equity finance only if

0a_r(1_e)r(1_u*)_r(1_e)r(e_U*)

(3)

Miller's important insight was that if u < e, firms will find debt finance
cheaper and they will issue more debt and use the proceeds to retire equity.

From (2), we can see that if E falls and F + B rises, u will rise. Thus
there

is a natural mechanism ensuring that u* = e

The equilibrium conditions (2) and (3) are graphed in Figure 3, where the

vertical line at e =

u*

represents (3), and the line OB represents the demand

for debt as a function of u*, which is given by (2). Equilibrium occurs at
point A, where B =

- F.

6

1.3 Changes in Government Debt
Suppose now that the government issues additional debt, increasing F to

F'. In general, this will change interest rates and savings behavior, as
investors absorb the debt issue in their portfolios. The important point,
however, is that as long

and we know that u* is unchanged, since by (3) it must equal the corporate tax

rate, e. Thus, as long as the distribution of wealth across tax brackets is
unchanged, the debt—to—wealth ratio is unchanged.

debt—to—wealth

If the government

ratio rises, the corporate debt-to—wealth ratio falls. This is

a consequence of maximizing behavior by both investors and firms.

1.4 Comments

i) This analysis has ignored the issues which arise when government debt

is not net wealth. That interesting case is treated in Section 4.
ii) In writing the equilibrium conditions (2) we implicitly imposed a no
short—sale constraint on investors. If short-sales were allowed, there would
be

the

no equilibrium because high tax—bracket investors would

issue debt, deduct

interest payments, and use the proceeds to buy equity, earning a positive

return on a zero net investment.

This is known as tax arbitrage, and would be

pursued infinitely by investors.

In a model like this, it is necessary to

assume (as does Miller) that only corporations can borrow.5

7

ifl) When there is municipal debt, the analysis is similar, except that
municipal debt becomes a perfect substitute for equity, since both are

untaxed. Auerbach and King (1981) analyze the certainty case with taxable
equity, taxable debt, and tax—free debt. They show that in equilibrium, there
will be three clienteles, with investors in the top tax brackets holding only
tax-free debt, investors in middle brackets holding only equity, and low
bracket investors holding only taxable debt.

EQUILIBRIUM WITH UNCERTAINTY

2.

This section presents a model similar in spirit to that in the previous

section, but with more realistic assumptions. Specifically
i) Equity returns are assumed to be risky and taxed at the rate

u.

<

ii) There is perfectly anticipated inflation at the rate ii, and the tax
system is not indexed.

iii) There is tax—free municipal debt, M, with a real safe rate of return,
p.

iv)

All investors may short—sell equity.

Investors in high tax brackets

may not sell taxable debt, and those in low tax brackets may not sell tax—free
debt.

It is still assumed that corporate and federal debt are riskiess and that

they receive the same tax treatment. Note that there is no safe asset which
receives the same tax treatment as equity. Thus, Auerbach and King's (1981)
spanning condition does not hold. Markets are incomplete in the sense of
Taggart (1980).

is an interesting question in its own right, but it is a subsidiary issue in
this paper.6

We will introduce uncertainty by using the model of intertemporal

consumption and portfolio allocation introduced by Merton (1971). This has
the

dual advantages of allowing investors to have arbitrary utility functions,

and yet resulting in a mean-variance model of asset pricing.

In addition, the

intertemporal nature of the problem imposes multiple sources of uncertainty on
the investor, and Merton's continuous—time asset-pricing model provides a
convenient way to handle this analytically.

It is assumed that the

corporation generates a gross real cash flow, the dynamic behavior of which is
given by the stochastic process7

We can also calculate the expected real after-tax returns to investors on

Investors will

never hold both taxable and tax-free debt, unless they are in the marginal tax

(8)

Investors with tax rate u are indifferent between taxable and tax-free debt,
Investors for whom u >

u will hold municipal debt, and those for whom u < u

will hold taxable debt. A change in r will generally require a change in p if
(8) is to be satisfied.

To ensure that an equilibrium exists, we must constrain high—bracket
investors not to issue taxable debt, and we constrain low—bracket investors

not to issue tax—free debt. There will be no other constraints, however; all
investors are free to short-sell equity and the one kind of debt they are
permitted

to hold.

and Et is the expectation as of time t.
There are other sources of uncertainty besides equity returns, however.

If the government issues additional debt (taxable or tax-exempt) it is

simultaneously endowing future tax liabilities (to be denoted L) upon
investors. In general, this also induces a change in equilibrium interest
rates. The rational investor will take into account this uncertainty, and
will treat L and r as additional state variables when choosing an optimal

2.3 Asset Supplies

The purpose of this section is to derive an expression for the value of

the firm, which will enable us to see how the Miller equilibrium is
characterized

under uncertainty. Equation (12) tells us the investor's dollar

demand for the risky asset. We will now use (12) to solve explicitly for the
market value of the firm; this will permit us to solve for the equilibrium u*,

given the assumption that firms maximize their market value. By aggregating
across investors, we obtain the equilibrium condition comparable to (2) in the

model [Jensen (1972)]. For future reference, note that the value of a

firm

behaves like a consol when the interest rate changes.
In a model such as this, with distorting taxes, investors usually will not

be unanimous about the choice of financial policy. Auerbach and King (1981)
show that if the firm's financial policy has any effect on investor's
opportunity sets——as it will unless investors can undo on personal account any
action the firm takes-—then investors will disagree about financial policy.
Nevertheless, I assume that the (competitive) firm

will

choose financial

policy so as to maximize its market value.

By choosing u to set the bracketed expression equal to zero, the right-hanc

rate. This demonstrates that changes in the inflation rate leave unaffected
the condition for the firm to be in financial equilibrium. Since financial
equilibrium is unaffected by inflation rate changes, I henceforth assume that

The d(e) schedule is a graph of

We saw that increases in the quantity of equity raise the demand for equity by

those who also hold municipal debt; this is why the d(e) schedule is
upward—sloping.

If the system were at point A, u would be too high, and

firms would have an incentive to issue additional equity, from (17). This
increase in the supply of equity leads to additional equity demand by

municipal debt holders, who in turn sell some of their municipal debt. This
lowers u, and leads to a greater fraction of investors holding municipal

debt. The process stops at A.

2.5 Effects of Tax Rate Changes
The equilibrium condition (20) allows us to infer ininediately what will be

the effects of tax rate changes on financial equilibrium. Any general tax
rate change will induce an offsetting change in equilibrium u in order for

(20) to be satisfied. Previous arguments have shown that if u rises,
corporate leverage rises, and if u falls, corporate leverage falls.
Therefore, increases in the corporate tax rate e or in the equity tax rate
will raise private leverage, while increases in the personal tax rate or

ordinary income will lower private leverage. While it is common to speak of
u* as
will

the marginal

tax bracket, changes in rates in

inframarginal

tax brackets

affect u. The Miller model under certainty predicts that changes in

only the maximum tax rate will leave financial equilibrium unaffected; under

uncertainty this is no longer true.

COMPARATIVE STATICS

I will consider two comparative static experiments: a change in the
quantity of taxable government debt outstanding (municipal debt may be treated
analogously) and a change in the scale of the firm.
remains unchanged, i.e. ,

that

I will assume that w

the distribution of wealth across tax brackets

is constant, and that government debt behaves like a consol in response to
changes in the interest rate.

I will also assume throughout that consumption

is unaffected by interest rate changes, i.e. that

is zero.

To perform the comparative static calculations it is necessary to make an

assumption about the effect of government debt issues on saving. To
understand the importance of this, it is necessary to digress briefly on the
implications of whether or not investors perceive future tax liabilities.

When the government uses debt finance instead of tax finance to pay for
current expenditures, it obligates itself to collect taxes in the future to

pay off the debt. With perfect capital markets and no distorting taxes, the
present value of these future tax collections is equal to the value of the

current debt issue. The current value of an investor's wealth is lowered by
expected future tax liabilities.

If individuals are aware of these future tax

liabilities, Barro's (1974) argument implies that in equilibrium, investors
will purchase the newly-issued government debt in proportion to their

endowment of future tax liabilities.14 The increase in government debt is
absorbed entirely through new saving; given a level of government spending,
gross aggregate wealth will rise by the amount of the debt issue, and each
individual's net wealth will be unchanged by the use of debt finance in lieu
of tax finance.

In effect, when capital markets are perfect, investors are

indifferent between paying taxes now and paying taxes later. This implies
that interest rates are unchanged by a new issue of government debt.

19
Suppose on the other hand that investors do not perceive future tax

liabilities. When the government issues additional debt the price of bonds
falls because the increased demand for bonds (if any) is insufficient to meet

the increase in supply. The interest rate increase lowers the price of assets
generally. The most extreme case would occur when wealth was unchanged in the
new equilibrium. The increase in debt would have then been completely
absorbed through an increase in interest rates.

I will use s to measure the extent to which aggregate wealth rises when
there is an increase in the stock of (taxable or tax-free) government debt. 15

debt has been absorbed into the economy through an increase in interest

rates.

signifies that the debt issue has been absorbed through an

increase in saving, and that interest rates have not changed. The use of

is

a device which makes use of Barro's elegant insights and avoids complicating
the analysis needlessly.

It is assumed throughout that tax rates are unchanged. The increase in
government debt can be viewed as resulting from increased government spending

oras due to a reduction in a lump—sum tax, but not from a change in the
personal or corporate tax rates. Money is excluded from this model, so the
possibility of an inflation tax as a third means of finance is ignored.
The main results are that an increase in the stock of taxable government
debt always reduces corporate debt, but has uncertain effects on the quantity

of equity. There is ambiguity only when the market value of the firm changes
due to an interest rate increase, i.e., when

3.1 Increase in Taxable Government Debt18

With (25), we are now in a position to ask what happens to the quantity of
corporate equity and debt when there is an increase in the stock of taxable
government debt.

The Quantity of Corporate Debt

An increase in the quantity of taxable government debt reduces the
equilibrium quantity of corporate debt.

effect on the quantity of corporate equity.

The sign of (25') is ambiguous, since the elasticity of EH with respect

to E is greater than one. When o is close to one, f-will be positive.
o close to one implies that the increase that the increase in government debt

is absorbed by saving. Consequently, interest rates do not change much, the
market value of the firm does not change much, and the unambiguous drop in the
quantity of corporate debt implies that there must be a concomitant
unambiguous rise in the quantity of corporate equity.

3.2 Increase in Tax-Free Government Debt
Similar results may be derived for changes in the quantity of municipal

debt. An increase in municipal debt always "crowds out" equity, but has an
ambiguous effect on debt, except when a is close to 1.

value of the firm is unaffected by the increase in the stock of tax—free

debt. Thus, a decrease in the quantity of equity outstanding will imply an
increase in the quantity

of debt.

Changes in the Scale of the Firm
If government debt is net wealth, then a rise in the stock of taxable or

tax—free government debt will in the short run increase interest rates. Given
the stock of capital, the value of the corporate sector will fall. The
corporate sector will in turn reduce investment, and in the long run the
capital stock will fall, causing a change in the mean and variance of cash

flows. The value of the firm will fall further as the capital stock drops
(real crowding out occurs). What is the effect on the quantity of equity and
debt as the scale of the firm changes?

24

Suppose that the value of the firm changes by dV. The equilibrium change
in EH will then be dEH = w*d4 = w*dV assuming that interest rates and
hence the market values of taxable and tax-free government debt do not change

and hence that d4 = dV.

25
The increase in taxable government debt lowers B, from (29). As interest
rates have risen, the firm will invest less and for any given interest rate, V

will fall. The fall in V lowers B still more. The initial drop in B is
reinforced by the later decrease in the scale of the firm. The net long—run
effect

is greater than would be suggested by calculating (28) alone.

4. WHAT IF GOVERNMENT DEBT IS NOT NET WEALT}
The implications of the model developed in Sections 2 and 3 hinge on the

important

assumption that the distribution of wealth across tax brackets is

unchanged by changes in the composition and level of government debt. This is
a plausible assumption (or at least a reasonable approximation) when
government debt is net wealth, since every individual has a fixed rate of time

preference, and individuals have identical utility functions. If there are
tax clienteles for government debt, however, then the Barro theorem can be
false.19

If all future tax liabilities are endowed upon those who are in the

clientele which holds government debt, the Barro result still holds. In this
case, however, the results in Section 4 do not hold——increases in government

debt will have no effect on corporate leverage. High bracket investors will
have unchanged portfolios, and low bracket investors will completely absorb
the

increase in government debt.

To examine the other extreme, suppose that all

future tax liabilities are

endowed upon those who hold only tax-free municipal debt. A possible
equilibrium

would be for those in high tax brackets to nevertheless hold the

new taxable debt, but this would conflict with the principle that the same

investor never hold riskiess assets with different after—tax

Instead,

returns.

high bracket investors in the aggregate would try to increase their

26
holdings of tax-free debt, and low—bracket investors would be left to absorb

the increase in taxable debt. The market return on tax-free debt would fall

and that on taxable debt would rise. From (8), u would rise. Corporations
would then retire debt and issue more equity, taking advantage of the relative

inexpensiveness of equity. The process would halt eventually, with a new u

than the u that existed in the beginning.20 The aggregate equity

greater

to wealth ratio would rise.

It

is possible to show in this model, however, that individuals in

inframarginal

corporate

tax brackets will have their utility changed by changes in

leverage. To see this, consider equation (10) in which, for
I will show that leverage

simplicity, wealth is the only state variable.

changes necessarily affect the utility of investors in inframarginal tax
brackets.

Equation (11) defines the optimal portfolio weights. Substitute (11) into

(10). This gives

equity as corporate leverage decreases (E rises, for a given B + E).
Expression (34) shows that utility is independent of leverage only if the

equity share rises as corporate leverage decreases. Thus, I have shown that
with a progressive tax system, changes in leverage will in general affect

22
investor utility, even though corporations are indifferent about leverage.
Several comments are in order:

1) The comparative static analysis in Section 4 ignores the kind of effect

I have just discussed. Even if future tax liabilities are distributed in such
a way that all investors change their wealth proportionally, there can still

be real effects operating through the portfolio decision. The case in Section
4 where

= 1 (increases in government debt are fully absorbed by increased

saving) is therefore at best only an approximation to the case where
government debt is not net wealth.

2) The result that changes in the level of government debt have real
effects is not surprising since the structure of the model prohibits investors

from

having Hcomplete access" to capital markets.

If all investors could buy

and sell unlimited qualtities of all assets,23 government debt would have no

real effects, and

it is certain

that the

model would not yield a plausible

equilibrium (see the previous comments about the need for constraints which
prohibit tax arbitrage).

28
5.

PLAUSIBILITY OF THE MODEL
In this section 1

wish to consider a prediction of the model which

appears to be false: that the tax rate at which investors are indifferent
between taxable and tax—free debt is greater than the corporate tax rate.

While this conclusion is troublesome for the model, I will argue that there

are

mitigating circumstances in practice so that the main conclusions of the

model could nevertheless be basically correct.

5.1

The Predicted Marginal Tax Rate
Whether or not there are capital gains taxes, we have seen (see footnote

11) that the model predicts that u >

individuals

e, i.e. , the tax rate at which

are indifferent between taxable and tax-free riskless debt exceeds

the corporate tax rate. Gordon and Malkiel (1981, Appendix B), however, show
that the actual marginal tax bracket is around 25 percent,24 which is
substantially less than the statutory corporate tax rate of 46 percent.

The condition u* > e will be an equilibrium property of any Miller-type

model. To understand this result, one can think of firms as being a conduit
for equity holders, who do their borrowing through the firm. Because of the
interest deductibility, firms can offer a higher interest rate on debt and
still find borrowing profitable relative to the cost of issuing equity.

In a

certainty world, borrowing will be profitable for the firm until the return on
debt has been increased by the full amount of the saving due to the interest
deduction—-only then will the firm be indifferent between debt and equity

finance. The model in this paper shows that the same kind of result holds
even when there is uncertainty-—in fact, uncertainty raises u above e, even
when there are no capital gains taxes.

29
An increase in corporate leverage raises u, so that if u' in the real
world is lower than theory predicts, it can be because firms

issue

less debt

than the theory predicts, which would occur if there were costs to issuing

who use Treasury data to show that, on average,

U.S. firms an additional dollar of interest expense results in only Z.33

for

of additional tax deductions. This is without taking account of tax
carrybacks and carryforwards, but Cordes and Sheffrin show that inability to

use tax credits tends to persist among relatively unprofitable firms. This
minimizes the value of the carrybacks and carryforwards.
Another possibility is suggested by the results of Skelton (1980) who
finds that for short—term taxable and tax-exempt debt, the marginal personal
tax rate is close to the corporate tax rate, while for long—term debt, the

marginal personal tax rate is lower. This finding may allow a reconciliation
of the empirical finding of Gordon and Malkiel that the marginal personal tax
rate

is low, and the theoretical prediction of this and other Miller—type

models that the marginal personal tax rate should be close to the corporate
tax rate.

5.2

Inflation and Leverage Revisited

If there are costs to debt

finance, as there

must be to

reconcile the

Gordon and Malkiel finding with the implications of this modeL, then a change
in the inflation rate will have an effect on corporate leverage.

When there are costs to debt finance, the firm's equilibrium condition
becomes

then (20) is still the first—order condition for optimal leverage.

If

out.

Inflation leaves leverage unchanged when there are no debt costs because

the tax advantage to debt finance vanishes in equilibrium. When the inflation
rate changes, it affects the after-tax costs to borrowing and returns to
lending in the same way, and thus has no effect, because there is no marginal
tax advantage to debt.

When there is a cost to debt finance, the marginal tax advantage to debt
finance (the negative of the first term in (36)) is equated to the marginal
cost of debt finance (the second term in (36)), which is greater than zero.
Hence there is a positive tax advantage to debt in equilibrium,24 and when
the inflation rate changes, it lowers the after—tax borrowing cost by more

than it raises the after-tax return. Hence the tax advantage to debt for any
given interest rate is increased by a rise in the inflation rate, and it
follows that if there are costs to debt, firms will use more debt finance if
there is an increase in the inflation rate.

6. CONCLUSION
This paper has shown that government financing policy has important
implications for private financial decisions. Two important facts about the
postwar U.S. economy——the constancy of the debt-to—wealth ratio and the rise
in the corporate debt—to—equity ratio-—are consistent with the predictions of

the model. An important caveat is that the results were derived in a model

where financial intermediation is ignored. At the very least, intermediaries

31

have the potential to transform the tax and risk characteristics of the asets
they hold, and thus could affect the conclusions of this model in an important
way.

The model presented here, if developed more fully, may also provide a
useful way to think about severa] other issues, such as the effect of
government debt policy on investment and output, and the commingled effect of
inflation and taxes on investment.

With respect to the latter issue, this model has the implication that,
despite the deductibility of nominal interest payments on corporate debt,
changes in the inflation rate need not affect the corporate after-tax
borrowing rate, because there is no tax advantage to debt in equilibrium.

that

the annual rate of retirement of book debt was four percent; that the

average maturity of the debt was 15 years, and that market value

equaled book value in 1947.26 It was assumed (based upon a breakdown in the
1980 Economic Report of the President) that 55 percent of federal government

debt

and 75 percent of business debt was long-term. Equity was valued at

market, and tangible assets (for the household and non-corporate business
sectors) were valued at replacement cost.

FOOTNOTES

1This crowding out" is financial, and should not be confused with real
crowding out (which may or may not occur), where government purchases of goods
and services lead to a reduction in private investment.

2The model in this paper is essentially an extension of that in Auerbach
and King (1981).

3Federai debt is measured here as net financial liabilities of the
federal government-—thus excluding agency holdings of federal assets——less
state

and local government holdings of federal liabilities. The idea is to

present a measure of the stock of federal libailities which must be absorbed
by the private sector. By the same token, Column 3 displays the tax-free
government debt—to-wealth ratio, and this is measured as net financial
liabilities of state and local governments, plus state and local holdings of

federal debt instruments. Again, this is a more accurate measure of the state
and local debt which must be absorbed by the private sector than net state and
local financial liabilities would be.

4Financial intermediaries are conspicuous by their omission in Table 1.

It is reasonable to ignore intermediaries and to take seriously the movements
between private and government debt in Table 1 provided that we take either of

two views of financial intermediaries: that they are a "veil," so that
households view the assets held by intermediaries as if the households held
them directly (see Friedman (1981) for a discussion of this view);

alternatively, we can view intermediaries as independent economic actors, with
asset demands that respond to exogenous changes in much the same way as the
asset demands of other sectors.

5Auerbach and King (1981) contains an exhaustive treatment of the need
for borrowing constraints in Miller—type models.

19The argument that Barro's result fails in the presence of non lump—sum
taxes is also made by Tobin (1980, Chapter 3).

20From (20'), if the relative wealth of high—bracket individuals rises,

u must rise to reattain equilibrium.

be affected by leverage changes.

for every investor, then a change in leverage

will have no effect on utility.

23Recall that high bracket investors are allowed to buy and sell
unlimited quantities of equity and municipal debt, and low bracket investors

can buy and sell unlimited quantities of taxable debt and equity. Government
debt has real effects because there are investors in inframarginal tax
brackets in this model.

24Gordon and Malkiel compare the yields on bond issues by the same

firms, with the same indenture provisions, except that one issue is tax exempt

and the other taxable. This is as pure a measure of u as could be asked.

25Debt costs must be a convex function of B in order for (41) to define
an optimal leverage position.

argument was made by DeAngelo and Masulis (1980), who did not,
however, explore the implications of inflation for leverage policy.

27Appropriate interest rate series were obtained from the Troll Citibank

database to use in adjusting the debt to market value. All business debt was
adjusted using the average yield to maturity on all ong-ten corporate debt
outstanding; federal debt using the yield on government bonds with a maturity
in excess of ten years; municipal debt using an average yield on high quality
municipal issues, and household mortgage debt using a mortgage rate.
