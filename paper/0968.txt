An Extended Accelerator Model of R&D
and Physical Investment

ABSTRACT

Using a multivariate autoregressive framework, we have found a simple
causal structure for the variables of interest q, s, r, and i, which is

consistent with our data. As expected from the stock market efficiency
hypothesis, q, the stock market one period holding rate of return, is
exogenous relative to the other three variables (or Granger causes them).
As postulated in the traditional accelerator model of investment, the rate
of growth of sales, s, can be also treated as exogenous to the rates of

growth of R&D and physical investment, r and i. Moreover, no strong feedback interaction is detected between the last two (r and 1).

Within the simple structure of the extended accelerator model, the
substantive conclusion is that R&D and physical investment react very
similarly to the growth of the sales and to movements in q; the response
of R&D is, however, more stable or less irregular than that of physical

investment. Expected demand and expected profitability thus both appear to
be important determinants for R&D expenditures and physical investment.

I. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the present study is to investigate the determinants of

both R—D and physical investment using a panel of firm data, In a standard
neoclassical model of investment, the firm is assumed to choose an investment
plan so as to maximize the present discounted value of net cash flows subject to
the production technology, cost of adjustment function, initial capital stocks
and other appropriate constraints (or else to minimize the present discounted
total cost of production subject to the same constraints and an expected produc-

tion plan). In full generality, this involves considering non linear stochastic
control problems, and explicit solutions of the first order conditions are

intractable without very restrictive assumptions. Assumptions such as static
expectations about
absence

prices,

a simple form of the production function, the

of an explicit cost of adjustment function and the imposition of a given

la structure are usually made in order to derive the specification of the
investment function.

In view of the complexities of a formal modellin of
sions, and also because of a lack of data on

level, we

to settle for a looser approach in the spirit of data analysis as advocated

by Sims (1912, 1977, 1980; Sargent and Sims, 1911). A priori, expected dend
and profitability are important determinants for investment decisions. Bath are
unobservable. Following Fakes (this volume), we propose to use the stock
market one period holding rate of return, q, as an indicator of changes in

expectation about the firms future profitability. For expected demand, we have
used a more traditional distributed lag fornulation in the rate of growth of

sales s. These two variables plus the rates of growth of R—D and physical

—

investment, r and i, are embedded in a multivariate autoregressive model. We
perform a series of exogeneity tests to investigate the appropriateness of

restrictea versions of this general model which are of interest. In particular,
we vindicate an extended form of the traditional accelerator model:

extended

both because it applied to R—D as well as to physical investment, and because it
takes expected profitability, and not only demand, as a major explanatory fac-

tor. Considerations on our model specification are developed in Section II,
while our results are presented in Section III.

We end with a few remarks.

MODEL SPECIFICATION: STATISTICAL AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS

We start from what we call our general model and derive our extended
accelerator model, discussing the meaning and specification of each equation in
turn.

1. A general model —

First

of all let us denote the four variables which our

study concentrates on by qt, ant, rnt, and tnt, where n and t represent finn
and year subscripts (n = 1 to N, t = 1 to T) respectively. To simplify matters
we shall suppress the firm subscript n in general and when convenient we shall

is the stock market one period holding rate of return and is defined

— —i

+

d)/p,

where Pt is the price of a share at the end of year

t, and dt is the dividend per share paid during this year. q is thus equal to
the rate of change of the value of a one dollar share over the year plus the

corresponding dividend. st, rt and it denote the first difference between year
t and year (t—i) of the logaritl]ms of sales, R—D expenditures and gross invest-

ments respectively, and are thus approximately equal to their rate of change

from year to year: St = Log (S/St..), rt =

Log(R/R...1),

it = Log

(It/It_i).1

Given our focus on these four variables, we are interested in investi-

gating thoroughly their mutual dynamic interrelationships. Without pretending
too much a priori knowledge about these interrelations we start by assumin5
that they can be represented by an autoregressive model:

Ci)

where A(L) is a matrix of polynomials in the lag
operator (L),

also called the vector of "innovations"

in the variables. We can write (1) more simply

(i')

A(L)

as:

their year means, as we shall assume from now on.2
With an adequate number of lags, the autoregressive model is flexible

to account well for the correlation structure of our variables and

enough

their dynamic behavior. From a pure statistical standpoint, equivalent

formulations

can be obtained by

practical interest: especially one that corresponds to the causal ordering we
are

going to hypothesize between our variables: i.e. causality running from q

to s, and from both q and s to r and i. This particular recursive forldulation
can be written as:

which transform them into

It' 2t

Among the many statistically equivalent foriulations, we endeavor to
give a specific structural economic meaninb to the pure autoregressive form (1),

and we refer to it, therefore, as our general model. All four equations of the
general model (q, s, r and i) can be interpreted and motivated by more or less
precise economic considerations, and we can test whether the restrictions
suggested by such considerations are compatible with our data.

2. Interpretation and Motivation
We can justify our i—equation as an investment demand equation,
referring
(1980;

directly to Malinvaud's recent book

see also 1981). In this

investment

on unemployment and profitability

book, Malinvaud studies the implications of

model in which net investment depends on

an

expected capacity need and

expected profitability. While the influence of capacity needs corresponds to the
well known accelerator phenomenon and is supported by the bulk of the vast number of econometric studies of investment, he stresses the importance of profita-

bility as another major determinant. If we

The revision in the expected profitability q1 is presumably due
to new information about the future which become available between (t—2) and
(t—i).

ces during the same period, and hence will be reflected in the lagged values

in the investment equation.3
In the absence of any direct inforiaation on expectations about capa-

city, the usual and simple procedure in most econometric studies is to treat

them as a function of past levels of output or sales. We can take, likewise,
the revision in the expected capacity need

as a distributed lag function of

past changes in sales 5tT' justifying thereby why lagged values

should

appear in the investment equation. ]bre generally we can consider s1 as a
forecast function depending not only on the past sf1, but also on the past

values of other relevant variables. Assuming rational expectations, the actual

change in sales s should

be itself

an unbiased "forecast't of the expected

conditional on all the information available in period (t—l), and s1
should

only differ from s by an uncorrelated forecast error. In particular,

one would think that

value for both s1 and s, and will, therefore, enter significantly in the
forecast function even in the presence of lagged

find

Finally, the change in the desired net investment variable

itself

is also unobservable, and its relationship with the actual change in gross in-

vestment must be specified. The various kinds of delays occuring between
the decision and the execution of investment plans, as well as an approximate
proportionality of retirements to past investments, suggest reasons why laiged
investment terms should also appear in the investment equation.
In sum, starting from Malinvaud's theoretical equation and taking
into account all the necessary transformations for its einpirical implementation,
we get to an equation which is very close to the investment equation of our

general model. Clearly, such a tentative and informal derivation involves many

problematic assumptions and issues. Be that as it may, our investment equation
consists of two main factors: scale and

intensity, as indicated by sales and

stock market profitability respectively, and allows for a quite flexible lag

structure. The standard objection one could raise is that more explanatory
variables should have been included, mainly the relative cost of labor and capital and the financial liquidity of the firm.

It is difficult though to get

relevant information about factor prices at the firm level; it is also plausible
that they tend to move roughly parallel for all firms, and that will be taken

care of by the year dummies in the equation. As for financial liquidity of the
firm, it could
worthwhile

be gauged by the importance of past profits, and it

to consider

may be

this possibility in further research.

The r equation can be justified along the same lines as the i
equation and interpreted in terms of an R—D demand equation. One of our basic
topics of interest is to assess whether R—D and physical investment behave more
or less similarly.

—B—

From what we have already said the s or sales equation can be

as a forecast fuxiction purjxrting to account for the expectations of
firiis about their future sales. It seems plausible, however, that these expecunderstood

tations might also depend on other variables besides the ones already included
in the equation.
The q or stock market holding rate of return equation has little eco—

nomic justification. For the sake of symmetry with the s—equation it could be
viewed also as a forecast function of expectations on cit.

However, it is

usually admitted that t cannot be predicted by its own past values or that of
any other variable. This property is known as Fama's semi—strong test of stock
market efficiency (Fama 19T0, 19T6). Conditional on the information available
at the beginning of period t, the expected value of

should, by standard

arbitrage argument, equal the prevailing market rate of interest. In other
words, a trading rule based on public information alone would not allow traders
to achieve any excess return on average.

3. An extended accelerator model — The considerations we have just developed
suggest a causal ordering of the variables and specific restrictions on the
equations.

We have touched on the issue of stock market efficiency. The
hypothesis of stock market efficiency simplifies our general model importantly,
the q—equation reducing itself to

=

Tt

=

1+). In

nous relatively to the other variables or s, r and

other words, q is exoge-

do not cause q in the sense

of Granger (Pierce and Haugh, 1977 and 1979; Granger, 1980). Such
a hypothesis has been generally accepted in empirical work, but rather than
taking it for granted, it seems

better

to test it also on our data.

—9—

Our

central

interest, however, is in the appropriateness of the tra-

ditional formulation of the accelerator model. This formulation postulates that
sales or expected sales are exogenous relative to investment, thus ruling out

feed—back effects from investment to sales. This is a major assumption since
without

it, not only the usual esti.mates of the so—called accelerator effect

might be biased, but the whole notion itself might not be very meaningful.
Within our general model, the accelerator assumption requires that i, as well as

r by

analogy, does not appear in the s—equation and is directly testable.

Besides the questions of stock market efficiency and appropriateness of the

accelerator assumption, we have also considered two other issues of lesser

sIgnificance. The first concerns the interrelations of physical and R—D investment. There seems to be no reason why physical investment should

R—D

that the converse would not be
true. A successful R—D program would lead to product or process innovations,
which

se. One might

however,

could result in turn in new programs of investment. There is,

little evidence

however,

in our data of such a causal ordering from R—D to investment.

While we do not find any- signi'icant influence of pasti on r, the influence of

past r on I is not significant either, and at best appears to be rather weak.

The second

reciprocal influences,

issue relates to the existence of contemporaneous
or "instantaneou causality", between our variables. In

our general model (i), this amounts to testing the diagonality of the variance—
covariance matrix E (i.e. no correlation across equations arong the disturbances

while in the transformed recursive formulation (1"), it becons the
test of the restriction that the contemporaneous value of a variable does not
enter as a regressor (i.e. B0 is an identity matrix or else fl. ).

A

year

being a long

enough period for interactions between variables to develop,

one would expect instantaneous causality to occur and hence the diaoziality re-

striction to be strongly rejected. This is indeed what
ation why the disturbances in our

happens.

Another explan-

model may be correlated across equations is of

course the omission of relevant (common or correlated) variables. One would
thus expect the disturbances in the investment and R—D equations
to be

correlated

and r)

with each other, and also with the disturbance in the sales

equation (r). Indeed, this last disturbance can proxy for variables
influencing sales expectations but actually omitted from our forecast equation;
as such it should enter in both the investnrit and the R—D equation, accounting

partly for the correlation of their disturbances. The structure of the distur-

,

bances and their correlations is clearly revealed by the appropriate Cholewski
decomposition

=

B'

as previously indicated.

We can focus our interest primarily on two restricted versions of the

general model: the first one assuming only stock market efficiency, and the
second one assuming also the appropriateness of the accelerator formulation.

We call the latter restricted model the accelerator model or the extended
accelerator model since it
research

extends

the traditional investment accelerator to

and developnent expenditures, and also because it tries, through the use

of the q variable, to incorporate expected profitability as an important determinant of

investment and R—D. Since interactions between investment and R—D do

not appear to be significant, we generally consider the extended accelerator
model without them —

but

this need not be so

in

principle.

time). The causal structure of the model is simple and can be illustrated by
the path diagram in figure 1. Changes in q induce variations in s, r and i and
where

changes in s move r and i, but there is no feed—back from r and to s, and from
5 to q; there is also no interaction between r and i.

As we already stated, in

view of this specific structure, there is one appropriate and economically
meaningful decomposition of the correlated fl in terms of uncorrelated

In this form the independent errors

e u, v and w are intrinsically related

to the different equations of the accelerator model. They can be regarded as
the exogenous and unobservable (or unobserved) basic factors of our model
accounting

for the evolution of our observed variables. A change or "shock" in

—12—

an innovation in q, can thus be interpreted as a shift in the firm's

future profitability as expected by the traders on the stock market. We shall

such a shock an expected profitability shock, or q—shock, and the dynamic
responses of our variables to it the q—effects or q—multipliers. Similarly,
a change or a "shock" in u, or an independent innovation in s, can be viewed
call

as

a shift in the expectation of the rate of

growth of sales, and we shall speak

of a demand—shock, or s—shock, and of the s—effects on s—multipliers. It is of
some interest to separate in the (total) q or s—effects the own effects and the

additional or cross—effects. The own effects are computed in the absence of
instantaneous causality (i.e. a=b=c=d=e=f=O or

they result directly

from the initial change in q or s corresponding to a shock in c. or u,, as if
there was no other immediate impact of such shocks.5
In order to illustrate the q and s—multipliers and how a shock in

or u actually affects the movuents of our variables, we can consider a
simplified version of the accelerator model in which we keep only one lagged
variable (i.e. a first order autoregressive model), ignore the correlations of
the disturbances across equations (i.e.

is diagonal) and drop the i—equation

(since i and r behave in the same way). It is enough to consider:

k
one period—one unit shock in C. Thus,
w is the cumulative effect on r
1=1

over a period of k years due to this shock, that is the proportional change in

the level of R—D after k years. It appears that a shock induces decaying fluctuations in growth rates and puts the levels on higher growth paths.
Essentially, the effects on growth rates are transitory, while the changes in
levels are permanent.

The long run effects of a one period—one unit in C or u on the levels
of sales and R—D can be easily computed and are given in table 1. A one percent
increase in u will induce sales and R—D to increase respectively by
I

T=

y/(l—O)(1—a).

The ratio of these two effects:

y/(i—O) is the elasticity of R—D with respect to sales, and thus can be called
the long run accelerator effect or niultiplier. The long run elasticity of R—D

with respect to q is

=

/(l—e)

+ y/(l—O)(l—a). This expression

indicates clearly that q can affect R—D both directly and indirectly through

its impact on sales: the direct effect being /(1—0) and the indirect effect
being

the product of the impact of q on sales /(i—cx) and the long run accelera-

tor y/(l—O).

III. — EMPIRICAL RESULTS

1. Tests and estimates
The empirical implementation of our study is based on a sample of 93

firms with data from 1962 to 1977. This sample derives from the Griliches and
Mairesse (this volume) restricted sample of 103 firms with no major merger

problems. We had to discard 10 firms

because

of the lack of all of the

necessary information to construct the variable. Although our sample may

seen

small in terms of number of firms and cannot be taken as representative of the
corporate sector in any definite sense, it is, in fact, of aboit the largest
size possible for R—D doing firms over a sufficiently long period (at least 10
good years for our type of time—series cross—section analysis).
The sample means and standard deviations of our variables over the
twelve years 1966—1977, as well as the standard deviations of our variables
measured relative to their year means, are the following:

q =

As could be expected the stock market rate of return is extremely variable. So
is physical investment; it is not rare that for a firm physical investment

doubles (or goes down by half) from one year to the other. Note that R-D expenditures are also quite variable, though much less so than is true for physical
investment.

We have estimated all our models by Zeilner's seemingly unrelated
regression least squares method (based on the variance—covariance matrix

estimated once and for all for the general model case). The parameters
estimates of the general model, the extended accelerator
simplified

all

first order autoregressive version

model and also its

are given in tables

2 and 3,

while

the different test results are brought together in table 4•

The general model uses four lagged values of each of the four
variables and is therefore estimated over the twelve years period 1966—1917,

including also twelve year dummies. We have experimented some with shorter
lags, but four lags

seemed to

be necessary to capture the dynamic behavior of

our variables adequately. We have also checked for the possibility of serial
correlation of the disturbances. It is apparently negligible, the first and
second order autocorrelation coefficients of the residuals fl in each equation being rather small uniformly (—.01 and —.06 for the q—equation residuals,
respectively; —.02 and —.03 for the s—equation residuals; —.03 and —.01 for the
r—equation residuals, and —.01 and —.01 for the i—equation residuals).
On the contrary, the contemporaneous correlations of the residuals

across equations are rather high (.19, .01, and .01 between the q equation
and the s, r and i equations residuals respectively; .18 and .26 between the s
equation and the r and i equations residuals; .18 between the r and

equations

residuals). The test of diagonality is indeed strongly rejected. Using the
Cholewski decomposition we can write:

the standard deviations of the uncorrelated

Ct, Ut, Vt and w., being .358,

.101, .1914 and .380, respectively. It appears from these estimates that u,

the independent innovation in s, has an immediate and strong impact on and a
more moderate one on r, while the immediate effect of C, the innovation in q, is

quite weak. Note also that the independent innovation in r has a sizeable
effect on i as well.

Considering the estimated equations of the general model in turn, it

is clear that all the implications suggested by the economic interpretation are

by and large supported. All the coefficients of the q—equation (i.e. the i6
coefficients of the lagged values of q, s, r and i except for the time dummies)

are insignificant and even taken together the hypothesis of their joint nullity

cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level. This is another confirmation
of the unpredictability of q from past information and thus also of the hypothesis of stock market efficiency.

All

eight coefficients of the lagged r and i

terms are insignificant

in the s equation. Assuming stock market efficiency their joint nullity
(together with that of the coefficient of q2, q3 and q14 which are also indi-

vidually insignificant) cannot be rejected at a 5% level of significance. We

—17—

can accept thus the hypothesis that s and q are exogenous relatively to r and i,
that

the

accelerator model is a reasonable specification, even though at first

it appeared to be a rather strong simplification.6

In the r equation, the four lagged i terms and likewise the four
lagged r terms in the i equation are all insignificant, except for the coefficient of r1 on i which is on the verge of individual significance at the 5%

significance level. As a group, they are insignificant at the 5% significance
level. We can accept the absence of interactions between r and i, other than
instantaneous, and hence the accelerator model without such interactions. On
the other hand, the hypothesis (considered by way of illustration) that the
accelerator is first order autoregressive is strongly rejected.

2. Dynamic and long—run multipliers
The

implications of

our results are best described by the dynamic

of our variables to the different shocks and the q and s—effects or
multipliers. All long—run multipliers are given in table 5, while the q and s
responses

dynamic

multipliers are represented in figures 2 to 5.

We

shall comment on then

in turn.
The eight matrices in table 5 consist of the own and total effects
estimated in case of the general model with and without stock market efficiency,
the extended accelerator model (without r and i interactions)

order

and also the first

autoregressive accelerator version. We have not endeavoured to compute

the standard deviations of these coefficients.7

However, the comparison of

their values for the four different specifications gives us a feeling for their

precision. As we have seen the general

model with market efficiency and the

—1 b—

extended accelerator are not statistically different at the 5% significance
level;

indeed all the estimated effects for these two models are very close.

The general model without market efficiency differs mainly from that with market

efficiency by the estimated effect of s (or u) on q; however, this effect should

not be statistically significant, corresponding mainly to the large insignificant coefficient of S1 in the q—equation (see table 2). The largest discrepancies

between the extended accelerator model and its

version

first order autoregressive

occurs in the estimated effects of s (or u) on r and i (and also of i

(or w) on itself); these discrepancies are probably significant since they

correspond

to the significant coefficients of s, and s in the r and i

equations (and also of

and i

in the i equation).
The comparison of the own and total effects shows the importance of
the contemporaneous influences of q and s on r and i (i.e. the importance of
instantaneous causality). This was already clear from the Cholewski decomposition
our

2'

given above, showing the correlation structure of the innovations in

variables. Consider the one very striking case: the long run impact of a

one percent s or u shock on the level of physical investment would amount only
to .35 percent, instead of about .85, if the contemporaneous dependence between
s and i were eliminated.

The four figures 2 to 5 consist each of three graphs, depicting the
yearly q or s (total) effects on the three rates of growth s, r, and i, or on
the three percentage changes in levels AS/s,

estimated

R/R, Al/i (these effects being

for the extended accelerator model). The responses of s and r to the

q or s shocks are similar enough, damping down rapidly with most of the effects

dissipated in three years. The investment growth rate i reacts more strongly

and irregularly. In response to a one percent q—shock, it goes up to about .15
in the first year and down to .10 and —.05 in the second and third years, then
cycles down quickly to zero. In response to a one percent s shock, after an
immediate impact of about 1, it plunges to 0 and —.25 in the first and second

years, then cycles back quickly to zero. In coherence with these patterns of
response,

the levels of sales and R—D expenditures increase steadily toward

new long run values while investment starts by overshooting its own, all

and investment levels are respectively about .15,

to be rather small; however, gauged in terms of the standard

of the corresponding rates of growth, they

are

quite sizeable. A one

standard deviation q shock induces changes in the levels of sales, R—D and
investment of about .55,

.I0

and .25 of their respective standard deviations.

The absolute long run effects of a one percent s shock are much
larger than those of a one percent q shock, moving the levels of sales, R—D and

investment by about l., .95 and .85, respectively. Yet, measured in units of
standard deviations, s shocks are not more effective than q shocks in driving

R—D and physical investments; the changes induced by the formers being about
.50 and .20 to be compared to .!0 and .25

for

the latter. In this regard it

should be noted that only 30 percent of the q effect on R—D and 55 percent of
the q effect on investment relies on the direct influence of q, the remaining
effect resulting from the impact of q on s. This remark shows that
sidering an R—D or an investment equation in

in con-

isolation, one might be led to a

serious underestimate of the significance of the q variable.

—20—

For comparison with the results of other investment studies, it is
interesting to translate the long run s effects into the usual accelerator

elasticities (A[/I)J(ts/s) or (/R)/(L$/S): they are about .7 H.85/1.Lt) and
.6 (-'.85/1.I) for physical investment and R—D respectively. The latter estimate
.6 accords well with the elasticity of R—D capital stock reported to be around
.5 to .8 by Nadiri and Bitros (1980) in the only other study investigating

investment and R—D demand jointly. The former estimate of .7 is, however, lower
than their estimated elasticity of arcind 1. for physical capital stock. A

elasticity is implied by the standard Jorgensonian factor demand framework (i.e., the inverse of the returns to scale in the production function,
unitary

which presumably are not very far from being constant), and is in fact found in
many econometric studies (for example, Jorgenson and Stephenson, 1967;

Jorgenson, 1911). Because of the various differences in specification, it is
difficult to pinpoint the actual reasons for our relatively low

accelerator

estimate. It probably arises from our rate of growth formulation. Using a
similar formulation, Eisner found an even lower estimate of about •)4

(Eisner,

1918; see also Oudiz, 1978).8 Eisner's explanation which is similar to
Friedman's permanent income hypothesis, may also be applicable to our results.
In our specification of the accelerator model, the q and s shocks are assumed to

be free from errors or contamination by any noise. In reality, the fluctuations
in q and s have large transitory components, which will have presumably little

impact on i and r. Our estimates of the accelerator elasticity and, more
generally., of the q and s effects might be larger, if we could disentangle the
transitory variations from the permanent changes in q and s.

IV — FINAL REMARKS

Using a multjvariate autoregressive framework, we have found a simple

causal structure for the variables of interest q, s, r, and i, which is con—

sistent with our data. As expected from the stock

market efficiency hypothesis,

q, the stock market one period holding rate of return is exogenous relatively to
the other three variables (or Granger causes them).

As postulated in the tradi-

tional accelerator model of investment, the rate of growth of sales, s, can be
also treated as exogenous to the rates of growth of R—D and pkysical investment,
r and i.

two

(r

Moreover, no strong feedback interaction is detected between the last

and i).

Within

the simple structure of the extended accelerator model, the

substantive conclusion is that R—D and physical

to

investment react very

similarly

the growth of sales and to movements in q; the response of R—D is however

more stable or less irregular than that of physical investment. Expected demand

and expected profitability thus appear to be both important determinants for R-D
expenditures and physical investment.

It would be important to check our findings against other bodies of

data. Also, our study could be improved by incorporating other variables of
interest (see Ben—Zion; this volume). In further work, it would be particularly
interesting to go deeper in two directions:
1.

The multivariate autoregressive setup proved to be useful and

convenient for studying the dynamic relationships between variables.

However,

a more elaborate specification might help to filter out the permanent from the

transitory components of the variables. This

issue is related to our choice of

growth rates formulation, which has many advantages but also tends to magnify

the relative importance of transitory components or errors in the variables.

—22—

2.

The fact that past q's, though probably error ridden, are signifi-

cantly correlated with s, r and

confirms that movements in stock prices carry

valuable expectational information about future profitability. This interpretation of the q variables should be substantiated, however, more rigorously and

its relation to Tobints QTt clarified. MDre generally, the extended accelerator
model should be grounded more firmly in theory and provided with a more definite
behavioral interpretation.

In the empirical implementation,

is adjusted for stock splits when they

occur. Sales are deflated using industry price indices; R—D and investment
expenditures are also deflated by an overall price index. There is the possibility of some mismatch in timing between
companies' fiscal year, and

5r

and i which are based on the

which is based on calendar year. From previous

work, we know that fiscal and calendar years do not coincide for a large enough
proportion of firms; an attempt to correct for this probln had, however, very

little impact on our results. We preferred not to make any such correction in
the present study.

2. Our adoption of a formulation in terms of rates of growth of the variables
or log differences results from a number of considerations. Using first differences is usually advised in the time—series literature in order to get more

stationary processes (Granger and Newbold, 1978). Actually, when we tried to
estimate the autoregressive model in the levels of variables, the results
suggested a first difference formulation (some of the roots of the characteristic equation associated with the model being close to one in absolue values).

Going to first differences is also a simple way to avoid dealing with firm
specific effects, while the formulation in terms of levels raises the well
known

difficulties of estimating

a dynamic model with such effects (Balestra and

1966). First differences have, however, the drawback of magnifying the
problems of errors in the variables (augnnting the ratio of error to true
Nerlove,

variance).

The

Grunfeld (1960), and more recently to the literature on "Tobin's Q"

(Tobin

1971). Our q variable will be equal to the percentage change in Tobin's

variable,

Q

if debts are proportional to equity and there is no change in the

replacement value of the firm. Actually, the correlation between our q
variable and the change in Tobin's Q

among others.

Doubts have been recently expressed about the efficiency of stock markets.

.

Schiller (1981) pointed out that the actual stock prices fluctuate too much to
reconcile with the stable and smooth series of the present value of subsequent
real dividends. See also F4alinvaud (1981) and Summers (1982).

The formulations (1') and (1") of the general model can be also written:

own and total effects with: P(L) =

The fact that we cannot reject both exogeneity tests of q (stock market

efficiency) and of s (accelerator model) is all the more meaningful as our
sample

has a large number of observations (see, for example, Learner 1978, Chapter

1).

the derivation of their standard deviations

problematic task (see footnote 5).

mean of the investment—capital ratio, or the rate of growth of the capital stock
plus its rate of depreciation.
