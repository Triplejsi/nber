Labor Force Participation:
Timing and Persistence

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the relative importance of timing and persistence

elements in explaining cyclical fluctuations in labor supply. Data from
the natural experiment provided by World War II and cross—sectional data
on American local labor markets, as well as aggregate time—series data

are used in the empirical work. We find little evidence that timing
effects play an important role in labor market dynamics. The evidence
suggests that views emphasizing persistence are more accurate, and that
previous employment tends to raise the probability of subsequent employment.

Much of the development of applied economic theory within the past
25 years has emphasized the importance of viewing economic decisions in a

life cycle context. Consumption decisions are today frequently viewed
as being determined by wealth or permanent income. The human capital
revolution has brought life cycle considerations to the forefront of

modern labor economics. While the life cycle dynamics of labor force
participation decisions have important implications for macroeconomic
theory and policy, they have received relatively little empirical at-

tention. With the notable exceptions of Lucas and Rapping (1969) and
Hall (1980), none of the large body of work on cyclical fluctuations
in employment has explicitly relied on a dynamic model of labor supply.1
This paper uses several types of data to examine two elements of

participation dynamics. The first is the aspect of "timing" which is
implicit in the work of Lucas and Rapping, and in Mincer's (1966) early

discussion of hidden unemployment. The timing argument, which is presented
most explicitly in Ghez and Becker (1975)? holds that leisure is easily

substitutable across periods. Hence relatively small transitory movements in the perceived real wage or real rate of return can have large
effects on the path of labor supply as individuals time their partici-

pation to coincide with periods of high transitory wages. On the other
hand, permanent changes, because they do not affect the timing decision,
are expected to .have a much smaller effect on participation.

It is this view of labor supply which underlies new classical macro—

economic models. The dependence is made explicit in Lucas (1975), who

—2--

claims that "what we do know indicates that leisure in one period is an

excellent substitute for leisure in other nearby periods." The ability
of classical macroeconomic models to explain fluctuations in employment
depends on the presence of strong intertemporal substitution effects.

Unless leisure is very substitutable across periods, large observed
cyclical variations in employment could not possibly be caused by the
response of labor supply to the relatively small fluctuations which are
found in real wages and real interest rates.

It is by now clear that models in which only timing elements are

present cannot fully account for cyclical fluctuations. The restrictions
imposed by rationality imply that the expectational errors which gene-

rate business cycles are serially uncorrelated. The serial correlation
which is characteristic of business cycles can only be explained in terms
of mechanisms which cause shocks to be propagated over several periods.
While Lucas (1975), Blinder and Fischer (1980) and Sargent (1980) have
considered alternative explanations of persistence in the demand for
labor, little attention has been devoted to the question of persistence

in labor supply, To a substantial extent, a demonstration of substantial
persistence in labor supply decisions undercuts the plausibility of models
based on a high elasticity of labor supply with respect to transitory wage

movements since it is difficult to see why a long—run decision should be
strongly responsive to transitory developments.

The second element of labor force dynamics which we consider is

embodied in the "persistence" hypothesis, In this view, past work ex—

—3--

perience is a key determinant of current employment status. Because of
high separation costs and costs of finding new employment, those who are

employed tend to remain employed. Persistence of employment might also
be rationalized on human capital grounds. Those who are employed longer
tend to accumulate more human capital, which raises the return to work

in the future relative to leisure. Those out of the labor force may also
develop household—specific capital or commitments (i.e., children) which
reduce the return to working relative to remaining outside the labor force.
There is also some reason to believe that the taste for work may be af-

fected by work experience. Such habit formation effects have been well
documented in demand analysis.2
This aspect of labor force dynamics appears to be quite important

in microeconometric studies of employment patterns. Freeman (1977) presents extensive evidence indicating that the probability of separation

from employment declines with the duration of employment. This result
is obtained separately for voluntary separation (quits) in Freeman

(l977b) and for voluntary separations (layoffs) in Medoff (1979). Of
course it is possible that this pattern results from individual hetero-

geneity. Those with high withdrawal possibilities are less likely to be

observed as employed than those with low probabilities. Heterogeneity
has been considered by Heckman (1978) and Yatchew (1977) as an explanation of persistence in labor force participation; both conclude that at

least for married women, true state dependence exists. Chamberlain (1978)
has devised a methodology for estimating the size of the persistence effect.
He finds that, after controlling for individual differences, prior experience

—4—

raises the odds of participation by a factor of seven. Other researchers
have found evidence that persons with employment experience are more likely

to be re—employed quickly when unemployed. Persistence effects of this
magnitude imply that any measure which affects employment will have important long—run effects.

The differing macroeconomic implications of models in which timing or
persistence effects predominate are highlighted by the following example.
In an economy which is initially in equilibrium, the government unexpectedly

undertakes expansionary policy.3 Irrespective of whether timing or persistence predominates, the initial impact of the change is an increase in

employment and labor force participation. However, timing and persistence

effects are opposite in the longer run. An extreme version of the timing
hypothesis would hold that individuals desire to spend a fixed proportion
of their lives in the labor force which they schedule to coincide with peri-

ods of maximum opportunity. If this is the case, labor supply after the
shock will be less than it would have been had the shok never occurred,
as individuals "schedule" themselves out of the labor force.
Such scheduling effects have been used to counter arguments that the
fluctuations in participation that accompany changes in the unemployment

rate imply a significant discouraged worker effect.4 What appears to be
discouragement is actually the effect of individuals timing their parti-

cipation to coincide with periods of maximum opportunity. When timing
predominates, output gains from expansionary policy are illusory. They
will be cancelled by a reduction in subsequent output as workers time

—5—

their withdrawal from the labor force. Thus, models with strong inter—
temporal substitution effects imply that a transitory increase in the

real wage will reduce subsequent labor supply. Moreover, a permanent
upgrading of opportunities in a timing world would imply a much smaller
increase in participation than observed in the short run because scheduling effects would no longer occur.

Persistence effects, however, yield a long—run increase in labor

supply. Short—run increases in employment will tend to persist as workers
remain in the labor force because of habit formation, adjustment costs,

or human capital accumulation. Hence, concurrent changes, on this view
understate the total increment to output from expansionary policy. The
effects of persistence described here potentially complement the process
5

of worker upgrading discussed in Okun (1973), and Thurow (1976).

The relative empirical importance of timing and persistence effects in
labor supply is an issue with important implications for macroeconomic theory

and policy. Both effects essentially deny the "natural rate" hypothesis

as a medium—run proposition. They imply that policy can have an extended
impact on the rate of employment without repeatedly fooling economic agents,
because in both views labor supply is conditioned by past employment ex—
pe.rience.6 It is this link which translates short—run policy effects into

longer—run impacts. As is clear from the preceding discussion, timing and
persistence effects have exactly the opposite implications for the long—run

direction of expansionary policy. This paper is directed at determining
their relative importance in economic fluctuations.

The next section of the paper examines a natural experiment which

potentially can shed light on the question at hand. During World War II,
the level of female employment and participation rose precipitously. We
examine the aftermath of the conflict to see whether the war had a positive

or negative impact on subsequent female participation. The third section
of the paper lays the groundwork for the econometric analysis, by outlining
a simple model of life cycle labor supply which is capable of embodying both

timing and persistence effects. The model developed in this section can be

examined using several types of data. Section 4 of the paper uses the model
to examine the relative importance of timing and persistence effects in accounting for the time—series behavior of the aggregate labor force partici-

pation rate. The fifth section of the paper examines the timing and persistence effects using cross—section data. Essentially, the analysis relies
on the observation that differences in unemployment over time are dominated
by transitory movements, whereas geographic differences are for the most

part permanent. The sixth section of the paper summarIzes the empirical
results and discusses their implications.

—7—

Section 2: The Impact of World War II
Before developing a formal model of life cycle labor supply, it is
instructive to examine the one natural experiment which history has pro—
vided.

The Second World War period and its aftermath offer an ideal

testing ground for timing and persistence effects. From 1940 to 1944 real
output in the United States increased 46.4% while the unemployment rate

fell from 14.6 to 1.2 percent and averaged 1.3 percent from 1943—1945.
The expansion in real output occurred at a time when large numbers of men
were drawn into the Armed Forces increasing the job prospects and potential

earnings of women, After 1945, unemployment rose slightly but remained
below 4.0 percent through 1948. In the recession of 1949, the unemployment
rate rose 2.1 points to 5.9%. The decade of the 1940's provides a good
example of a large spurt in aggregate demand followed by a return to normal
growth,

In perhaps the first statement of the timing hypothesis Milton Friedman
underscored the instructive quality of the World War II period:
the reaction to a higher wage rate expected to be temporary
and then to revert to a lower level will tend to be very different
than the reaction to a higher wage rate expected to be permanent.
The temporarily higher wage rate would seem more likely to bring
forth an increased quantity of labor from a fixed population than
a pernianently higher one, since there would be strong temptation
to take advantage of the opportunity while it lasts and to buy
leisure later.
An interesting case in point is the experience of the United States
during World War II, when both the fraction of the population in
the labor force and the average number of hours worked per week
were substantially higher than during the pre—war period.7

Friedman proyldes no explicit empirical analysis of changes in participation

oyer the period yet it is implicit in his discussion that World War II marked

—8—

a period of transitory wage gains which ought to be followed by an increased

purchase of leisure in later years. This effect should have been accentuated
by the large buildup of wealth which took place during the War. In contrast,
if persistence effects were dominant market attachment would have increased
with increased work experience, and World War II would have had a long—run
positive impact on observed participation.

The issue of long—run versus transitory effects seems particularly im-

portant for the female labor force, and particularly for married women. Since
almost all able males are always in the labor force, there is little variation
in male participation and thus little to be learned about the impact of tran-

sitory movements in job opportunities and wages. Females participate much
less than men, and their behavior appears to be much more sensitive to labor

market conditions. Moreover, because of the large increase in the Armed
Forces and the consequent increase in job opportunities, women were particularly affected by the expansion of demand during World War II.
The impact of World War II on the participation oT adult women is docu-

mented in Table i.8 From 1890—1940, the participation rate of adult women
25—64 increased from 13.9 to 25.7 percent, a compounded annual rate of in-

crease of 1.2 percent per year. In striking contrast, between 1940 and 1944,
the participation rate rose 23.5 percent (25.7 to 32.5) or 6.0 percent per

year. Among married women, participation increased 2.5 percent per year
from 1890 to 1940 (4.6 to 15.6), but a remarkable 11.3 percent from 1940 to

1944 (15.6 to 23.9), The marked increase in participation of married women
was not confined to a specific age group. After rising very slowly in the

women whether husband is present or not. As in line 1,
the data for 1944 and 1947 were adjusted to accord with
Census definitions. The CPS values were 25.6 for 1944
and 21.4 for 1947.
The data in lines 3 and 4 were taken from Census publications as follows:

1920: U.S. Census, 1920, vol. 4, p. 694, table 5 — data
refer to married women with no distinction based
on absence or presence of spouse. The entry for
women 45-64 is the rate of participation of women
45 and over.

p. lA-lOl. Data refer to married women, spouse
present. Data for 1950 suggest that the category
married—spouse present dominates the married-total
group. Total married participation rates were 25.8
for women 25-44, and 20.4 for women 45-64.

twenty—year period before 1940, for example, participation by married
women ages 45—64 more than doubled in the early years of the war.

The data in Table I suggest that the war had a major impact on the

market behavior of adult women, particularly those who were married.9 The
data also suggest that the increase in participation was not short—lived.

Table lipresents projected values of labor force participation, based on

trends estimated dyer the periods 1890—1930 and 1890—1940, for married
women and adult women 25—64. Comparison of actual and predicted values
confirms the long—term effects of the war. For adult women 25—64, the
trend fitted through 1940 predicts the 1940 participation rate, but the

actual rate remains above the trend throughout the subsequent decade. The
results for married women are even more striking; the actual rate averages
24.7 percent above the trend for the three time periods noted.

10

The failure of the participtin rate to fall below the trend after
the transitory developments of the war had passed seems to be evidence

that persistence effects dominated the effects of timing. It is important
to note that both effects seem to have been present. The fact that we observe
a decline in participation after 1945 suggests that a significant number of
women responded to the extraordinary opportunities of that period, and then

scheduled themselves out of the labor force in subsequent years. Yet there
is little support for a strong version of the timing hypothesis, which would

have predicted a fall of labor supply below trend after the war. It seems

evident that strong persistence effects were at work. Indeed, the labor

force

participation rate of women, especially married women, appears to
11

have been permanently increased by World War II.

To alternative explanations of the apparent positive long—run effect
of the war experience deserve further comment. First, it is frequently
argued that the war brought changes in social attitudes towards women in

the workplace. However, these changes were caused in large part by the
increase in the number of women working during the war. Changes in attitudes should be viewed as factors through which the effect of employment

experience on long—run increases in participation is mediated. That work
experience during the war affected attitudes is evident in a 1944 survey

conducted by the United Auto Workers)° Half of the women surveyed, who
had never worked in a factory before the war, professed a desire to con-

tinue in a factory after the war. Over 85% desired to remain employed in
some capacity.11 The view that the increased participation of women was
due to a general change in attitudes rather than the conditioning effect
of wartime experience is also belied by a comparison of cohort participa-

tion rates. The participation rate of women 20—24, who were not directly
affected by the war actually fell between 1940 and 1950. If the change
in attitudes were general, it would have been expected to rise along with
other participation rates.

A second explanation of the long—run increase in female participation
following the war relies on the argument that reduced discrimination and
increased productivity led to a rise in the permanent relative wage of women

— 14 —

following

World War II, and thus to an increase in participation. Insofar

as this reflected human capital accumulation during the war, it is consistent

with persistence effects. However, there is not much evidence that the
male—female wage differential fell between the immediate pre— and post—war
12
periods.

The results presented in this section, while quite suggestive, are

based on relatively fragmentary data. While there is an indication in the
data that persistence effects dominated timing effects, this conclusion de—

serves much more careful scrutiny. In the next section we develop the model
which underlies the more sophisticated econometric analysis of the timing
and persistence effects presented in subsequent sections.

— 15

Section 3: The Model
This section outlines the nxdel which provides the basis for the

empirical work in this study. The model follows closely that of Lucas—
Rapping (.1969), However, it does differ in several respects, notably
the treatment of expectations and our focus on participation rather

than aggregate labor supply, Because much of the focus of this study
is on how past behavior as well as expected future developments influ—

ence participation it is necessary to employ a three—period framework,
rather than the more common two—period formulation.
Individuals are assumed to maximize an intertemporal utility func—
ton of the forrn;

U

(1)

where c represents consumption and 9 represents leisure, measured as a

prcporton of total time endowment, The period t—l is assumed to represent the entire past, and the period t+l embodies the whole future. It

is assumed that the ndiyidual at time t

takes

consumption and labor

supply decialons in period t—l as given.
Individuals maximize the utility function (1), taking as predetermined previous employment experience, and the level of assets At, which

may be positive or negative, The solution to the maximization problem
will depend on their expectations of future nominal wages, w+i, future
prices

and the interest rate r. The budget constraint holds that

1ifetime consumption cannot exceed lifetime earnings,

— 16 —

Since the focus of this analysis is on the participation decision,
the first—order conditions for the maximization of (1) are of little con-

cern. It suffices to observe that an interior maximum with positive
participation will occur if the market wage w, exceeds the reservation

wage w*, The reservation wage, w, is the minimum wage at which an in—
dividtial will supply a positive amount of labor, that is, join the labor
force.

For the moment we assume, following Lucas and Rapping, that the

labor market is in equilibrium, though this assumption will be relaxed

subsequently. If the iabpr market is in equilibrium, the prevailing
market wage is potentially available to any possible participants. The
reservation wage will depend on tastes, past employment, future oppor-

tunities and assets, This may be written as:
e

w f((1_Zi) p ,

••,

wtl_l

e
Pt+1

(l+r) (l+r)

, A)

(2)

Notice that we assume here that economic agents know the true price
level at each point in time and so rule out misperceptions of the types
stressed in same recent macroeconomic models,

The central qustion of this paper can be posed in terms of the
signs

of

the derivatives of w with respect to the arguments in (2). The

standard assumption that leisure is a normal good yields the unambiguous

that f4 > 0, that is, an increase in wealth, ceteris paribus,
raises the reservation wage, The signs of the effects of the other
conclusion

variables

in (2) depend on the form of the utility function (1).

— 17 —

Consider first the sign of f1, the impact of previous employment
experience on current labor supply. With assets held constant, previous
employment will affect the reservation wage only insofar as it affects
the marginal rate of substitution between current leisure and consump—

tion. The types of arguments usually put forward in discussions of

is negative. In-

intertemporal substitution suggest that
'-

t—l

creases in previous work effort raise the marginal disutility of cur-

rent labor. Formulations adopting this assumption explicitly have

been used by Sargent (1980) and Kydland and Prescott (1981). The
effect however is theoretically ambiguous. In the presence of adjustment costs, habit formation effects, or accumulation of "leisure capital"
the sign can easily be positive.

The effects of changes in the other arguments of (2) can be analyzed

in a similar fashion. Both expected future wages and prices have uncertain effects, Increases in future wages have a negative income effect

on current labor supply. The substitution effect depends on the sign

of U+i, If it is positive, the substitution effect is positive and
leisure today and in the future are complements. In the case of an ad—
ditively separable utility function _____

is unambiguously negative.

13

This illustrates that past experience and future opportunities do not
have symmetric effects, since past employment experience has no effect

in this case, The difference arises essentially because of the income
effects of future wage changes. Increases in expected future prices
have a positive income effect on labor supply, and an ambiguous substi—

— 18 —

tution

effect depending on U
t+1

So far the theory has been developed for a single individual. People
will in general differ in both their tastes and market opportunities as

well as in their previous experience and asset accumulation. As a result
there will exist a joint distribution of market and reservation wages.
The aggregate participation rate L5 is then given by:

LS =

fJ

w >

g(w,w*) dw dw*

(3)

w
0:

>

It is readily apparent that

an increase in wages available to

all workers will unambiguously raise the participation rate. The so—called
"added worker" effect cannot exist in this model. Essentially, this is
because at zero labor supply, increases in the wage do not change income.
Income effects could be brought in if labor supply was modelled as the

result of joint maximizaton by individuals within a family. They may also
arise from changes in non—contemporaneous wages.

It follows from (3) that the participation rate is a function of the

wage level, and the determinants of the shadow wage. Recognizing that the
labor supply relation is homogeneous of degree zero in wages and and prices
leads to the labor supply function:

where LS is the fraction of the population in the labor force. For convenience we assume a logarithmic functional form. Equation (5) may then be

Equation

(5) differs from the Lucas—Rapping formulation in that the

term (l_Pi) is included, reflecting the assumed dependence of the demand
for leisure on leisure enjoyed during the preceding period. While such a
dependence would seem to be a clear property of the Lucas-Rapping model,

it is lost in the translation into their estimating equation. The term

(l-.i)

does appear in their equation but only as a result of a Koyck

transformation. While they expect and obtain a
vious labor supply, it is

clear from the above

positive impact of prediscussion that the effect

is actually ambiguous. A strong form of the timing hypothesis would predict a negative effect of lagged labor supply (apart from its role as a
distributed lag generator).

At this point, it is useful to consider the expected signs of

. ,t3.

The signs depend on the relative importance of persistence and timing elements

in luctuations in labor supply. A key parameter is , the elasticity of
current labor supply with respect to past employment experience. Sufficiently
large intertemporal substitution effects would insure that

< 0 so that in-

creases in experience reduce subsequent participation. On the other hand,

persistence effects imply l > 0 so that increases in employment experience
raise the participation rate.

The coefficient of

is expected to be posi-

tive, as increases in contemporaneous real wages raise the attractiveness

— 20 —

of

seeking work. The sign of

depends on the relative size of timing and

persistence effects. If timing elements predominate,

increases in expected wages cause labor supply to decline because of inter—

temporal substitution effects. In the context of a model like that of Lucas

and Rapping, one would expect that 2 +

0, since the long—run wage

elasticity of labor supply is expected to be small. If adjustment costs or
capital accumulation effects cause labor supply decisions to have a permanent character, the sign of

ambiguous while

will be positive. The sign of

is expected to be negative.

Equation (5) as it stands is a labor supply curve. If the labor market
were always in equilibrium, it could be estimated directly using the employment ratio (proportion of the population who are employed) as the dependent

variable. If, however, the labor market does not always clear, the level of
employment cannot be taken as measure of desired labor supply. However, a
measure of supply is provided by the labor force participation rate, the

proportion of the population looking for work or workihg, This variable is
the measure of labor supply used in this study. However, estimates using
employment as the dependent variable are also discussed.

It is important to be clear about the issues involved in choosing between the employment and participation rates as dependent variables in

equation (5). Lucas and Rapping take the position that an equation like
(5) characterizes the level of employment, not the participation rate. On
their hypothesis, workers who choose not to work because of a transitory
decline in wages show up as unemployed and so are counted as labor force

participants. Thus their argument implies that studying the labor force
participation rate would obscure the important intertemporal substitution

— 21 —

effects

of wage changes. Although estimates of equation (5) using employment

are presented below, we regard the Lucas—Rapping interpretation of the unem-

ployment rate as problematic for several reasons. First, it provides no
explanation for the fluctuations in the participation rate which account for

a sizeable part of observed employment fluctuations. Second, unemployment
is defined as inability to find work at prevailing wages. Individuals who
are intertemporally substituting out of employment presumably know the pre-

vailing wage, and do not desire work. They should therefore not report
themselves as unemployed. Finally, our previous analysis, Clark and Summers
(1979), of individual unemployment experience suggests that the assumption

of continuous labor market equilibrium is very problematic.
Once the possibility that the labor market may not clear is recog-

nized, it is necessary to modify equation (5). When involuntary unemployment exists, the assumption that all who want them can get jobs at the pre—

vailing wage is no longer appropriate. Individual decisions regarding labor
supply will be affected by the knowledge that search costs are higher when

unemployment is higher. Since the mean duration of a completed spell of
employment in the United States is only about 20 months (Clark and Summers
1979a), relatively small changes in the duration of pre—employment search

can have a large impact on the return to seeking employment. By increasing
the duration of search as well as by reducing the pooi of good jobs, and

increasing the risk of layoff, unemployment discourages labor supply. We
thus include the unemployment rate as an additional explanatory variable

in some of our empirical work. In the next two sections we estimate alternative forms of (5) using both aggregate time—series and cross—section
data for different demographic groups.

Section 4: Time—Series Evidence
This section describes the estimation of (5) using time—series data.

Before the model can be estimated, it is necessary to develop operational

measures of the variables. Both the proxy for previous employment expert—
ence and the measurement of expectations of inflation and the real wage re-

quire discussion. In equation (5) previous experience is represented simply

by (l_tl). This term is supposed to represent

of

the entire past experience

a population group. Using simply the previous yearTs employment experi-

ence would be inappropriate since the logic of both the timing and persistence effects suggests current labor supply is conditioned by a longer

history. We therefore follow the work of Houthakker and Taylor (1970) in
developing a measure of the "stock" of past employment. We assume that
the labor supply of a cohort depends on a set of variables Z (such as those

contained in (5)) and on its past employment experience. Past employment
experience is assumed to be represented by;

t—l

where L is the lag operator. Since participation is a function of this

Alternatively,

as discussed in the previous section, the employment ratio

could be taken as the dependent variable. Using equation (5) and (8), and
appropriate measures for participation, employment and Z, the most general

unemployment rate, and v is an error term in M.

The time trend has been

included to reflect the possible influence of slowly changing determinants

not captured by other included variables. In this formulation, the coefficient

measures the persistence of labor supply, while A reflects the lag

in formation of the habit stock. The long—run impact of an increase in em—
ployment experience is

.

This

may be interpreted in two different ways.

It represents the increase in the participation rate at time t,

if employment

in all previous periods were raised by one unit. It also can be interpreted
as the sum over all future periods of the increases in participation arising
from a one—shot increase in employment.

Equation (6) gives us a way of measuring the employment stock and deriving the estimating equation in (9); the second issue which must be con-

sidered is the development of measures of expected wages and prices. Most
standard econometric procedures seem inappropriate because theory suggests

— 24 —

that

labor supply should depend on the expected discounted value of wages

and prices over a long horizon. Our procedure for medelling expectations
begins with an estimate of a set of vector auto—regressions relating wages,

prices, and real output.15 These vector auto—regressions are then simulated
using data for each year in the sample to generate forecasts of wages and

prices for the succeeding 5 years. These variables,

are then ad-

justed to an after—tax basis and discounted back to year t,

This procedure is somewhat arbitrary in its choice of horizon and in

the specification of the vector auto—regressions. However, it seems to be

— 25 —

the

only computationally feasible way of handling the modelling of expecta-

tions which are more than one period ahead. Rational expectations techniques
of the sort developed by McCallum (1976) are not applicable in the. current

example because of the quasi—differencing involved in moving to equation (8).

The data used in the actual estimation cover the period 1951— 1981. We
have chosen to use annual data because timing and persistence effects are

likely to be badly confounded with seasonal fluctuations in higher frequency
data, Our measures of the participation rate and employment ratio are age—
adjusted rates calculated as fixed weight averages of age-specific rates.
This age—adjusted participation rate is used to avoid biases introduced by
the changing age structure of the population.

In the results reported below, we have omitted assets from the estimating
equation. Like others before us (e.g. Lucas and Rapping (1969)), we found

assets to have no significant relationship to participation. This conclusion
is based on an assets measure which includes the real value of household finan-

cial holdings, excluding equity. A variety of other aèsets measures which
included equity, housing and social security wealth were tried with little
change in the results,

Several econometric issues arise in the estimation of equation (9).
First, the equation is highly non—linear in the parameters, necessitat-

ing non—linear estimation. Second, the error term v is likely to be
serially correlated. Even if the error term in equation (7) relating
participation to Z and E* were not serially correlated, the transformation of E* involved in deriving the estimating equation would induce

moving average error. Serial correlation in the error term is parti—

—26—

cularly serious in this case because both lagged participation and employment

are included in the regression equation. Since there is no reason to suppose
that the error in (8) follows a simple auto—regressive scheme, the usual

corrections (e.g. Cochrane-Orcutt) are not appropriate. We have chosen to
estimate the equation using two—stage non—linear least squares, treating

both lagged participation and employment as endogenous. The instrument
list includes a time trend, a squared trend, real Federal government spending,

the rate of money growth and the real per—capita stock of non—residential
capital, along with the included exogenous variables. In addition, to
allow for simultaneity, the contemporaneous wage is treated as endogenous.
A third econometric difficulty is collinearity,which frequently precludes disentangling estimates of A, which determines the mean lag of the
"past employment" effect, and

the impact effect of changes in employment

experience. Frequently, the estimated values of A lie outside the range
o <

A<l,

and so the equations are not meaningful. Therefore, in many of

the equations reported below, the value of A is constrained to the a priori

plausible value of .9. None of the qualitative conclusions were affected
by the imposition of this constraint. In particular, all of the conclusions regarding the effects of transitory wage changes are wholly unaffected
by the choice of A.

Table III presents estimates of several variants of equation (9) using

the log of the participation rate as the dependent variable. The results
do not suggest that timing effects have an important role to play in ex-

plaining cyclical fluctuations. The estimated elasticity of labor supply
with respect to a transitory wage change is always small and sometimes

negative. Nor is there any clear evidence of a negative relationship

between expected future wages and labor supply, as predicted by models
which emphasize timing effects. No clear conclusions emerge about the
effects of changes in the price of future consumption. It is noteworthy
that the increases in the unemployment rate of mature men do appear to reduce
the participation rate, as theory predicts.

The data provide weak support for the importance of persistence in

explaining fluctuations in labor supply. It is not possible to interpret
the estimated effect of employment experience in equations

(3)—(5) of Table

III because the estimated value of X lies outside its permissible range.

In equation (8), where a time trend is not included, the estimated effect
of the "employment stock" variable is both substantivcly and statistically

significant. However, when a time trend is included as in equation (6)
and (7), the "employment stock" coefficient remains positive but becomes

insignificant. Estimates using the employment—population ratio as a dependent variable are reported in Table IV. The results are qualitatively
similar to those obtained using the participation rate as a dependent

variable. Here the evidence of persistence effects is very weak. Even
when the time trend is omitted as in equation (6) of the table, the em-

ployment stock variable is statistically insignificant. Not surprisingly,
the cyclical indicator, UN, enters the employment equations in a highly
significant way.

The time—series evidence presented here suggests that transitory variations in the perceived real wage have little effect on the rate of labor

force participation. We find no indication in the data of the strong inter—
temporal substitution effects which are the basis of classical macro models.

These findings on the effect of transitory wage changes are consistent
with the positive impact of lagged employment found in Table III.
While the quality of the evidence on lagged employment precludes
strong conclusions, the results suggest that work may be habit—forming.

Clearly, if experience in employment persists so that the decision to work
is a relatively long—term commitment, it is not surprising that transitory
wage changes have no discernible effect on labor supply.
These results conflict quite sharply with those of Hall (1980), who

finds that the data support the intertemporal substitution hypothesis. Part
of the conflict may lie in Hall's inclusion of fluctuations in hours per

worker. The most serious problem, however, is Hall's measurement of the
"intertemporal substitution parameter." He assumes that labor supply decisions are driven only by the price of future consumption in terms of today's

labor, It is difficult to see what utility function would have this property in which the current price of consumption and future price of leisure

are irrelevant. Our findings are consistent with the generally negative
results obtained by Altonji (1982), and Mankiw, Rotemberg and Suirners (1982)

regarding the intertemporal substitution hypothesis.

— 31 —

Section 5: Cross—Section Evidence
The comparison of the relationships between labor market variables
which are observed in time—series and cross—section data can shed light

on the importance of timing and persistence effects. In particular,
this section shows that recognizing the distinction between transitory

and permanent effects embodied in the two hypotheses provides a framework for reconciling the large differences between cross—sectional and
time—series estimates of the relationship between unemployment and

participation rates, The conflict between these two types of evidence
emerged in the early 1960ts when several studies found large discouraged
worker effects using decennial census data on local participation and
unemployment rates, while other studies found very small effects using
time—series data (Long 1958, Barth 1968, Bowen and Finnegan 1969).

Attempts to reconcile the divergent results have generally focused

on possible biases in the cross—section evidence, In his often cited
review of the evidence Ni-ricer (1966) conjectured that cross—section

estimates were biased by omission of migration, seasonal differences
across SMSA's in census timing and common errors in the rate of participation and unemployment which give rise to a spurious association.

Mincer also noted but did not pursue the permanence of state unemploy—
merit differentIals. Bowen and Finnegan (1969) have examined each of
these possibilities and suggest that none can satisfactorily explain

the difference between the two sets of estimates.'7 More recent attempts to resolve the anomaly (e.g. Fleisher and Rhodes 1976) have

also been unpersuasive18

— 32 —

These results suggest that cross—section and time-series estimates
cannot be reconciled by pointing to biases in the cross—section data. A
potentially more fruitful approach is to recognize the fundamental differences between intertemporal and interspatial variations in unemploy-

ment. At any point in time in any labor market the rate of unemployment
is composed of both a permanent and a transitory component. In cross—
section data, most yariation in unemployment is presumably due to vari-

ation in the permanent component across regions. This is in contrast
to the aggregate tijne—series data where variation in the transitory

component is likely to be dominant. Cast in these terms, the cross—
section data provide estimates of the long run or permanent effect of
unemployment, while transitory effects are captured with time—series

data
At this point, it is important to be clear about the interpreta-

tion of the measured unemployment rate. In this section, we adopt the
'traditional'T interpretation, which holds that the labor market does

not clear and that the unemployment rate affects the attractiveness

of seeking work. It is then meaningful to speak of the effect of
changes in differences in unemployment rates on labor force partici—

pation rates. We prefer the traditional interpretation of the unemployment rate to that of Lucas and Rapping for several reasons. Most
important, the substantial permanent component in the differences between local unemployment rates suggest that they are not consequences

of transitory wage movements, In addition, the evidence that participation and unemployment rates are negatively correlated is difficult

—33—

to account for in the classical view, Indeed, in its strong form, it
lacks an explanation for fluctuations in the participation rate. Other
results described below also incline us towards the "traditional" interpretation of unemployment fluctuations,

In order to reconcile the time—series and cross—section estimates, it is necessary to examine the relationship between transitory
and permanent effects, and to establish the conditions under which the

permanent effect dominates, This is precisely the issue discussed in
Section 3 which distinguishes the timing and persistence effects. There
we found that persistence effects imply that employment in previous

periods raises current participation. Short—run effects persist. If
persistence effects predominate, the response of labor supply to perma—
rient changes in demand should exceed the response to transitory changes.

This prediction, which is borne out by the data, is not consistent with
strong forms of the timing hypothesis, which imply that the response to
transitory fluctuations should exceed the response to permanent changes.

It thus would seem that the predominance of persistence effects receives substantial support in the comparison of cross—section and time—series

evidence, Similar support emerges from a comparison of transitory and
permanent effects using cross—section data. Use of cross—section data
provides a strong test of the relative importance of timing and persistence effects since the two views of labor force dynamics have sharply
different implications for the appropriate demand variable in cross—

sectional equations, The timing view holds that the important determ—
Inant of participation is the deviation of demand from its normal level.

—34—

When it is above its normal level, workers schedule themselves into
the labor force, leaving when it falls below normal.

The persistence

view, on the other hand, implies that the normal level of demand is
the appropriate variable since workers make labor supply decisions on
a long—term basis.
The model embodied in this discussion can easily be made explicit.
It is assumed that the level of demand may be represented by ER, the
proportion of those desiring work who have it (1 — the unemployment rate).

We postulate that participation in region i, PR., depends on the permanent level of demand, ER1, and the level of transitory demand, ER, defined as (ER1

ER'5, A simple characterization of the participation

equation is given by;
PRi

(10)

f(ER', ER, z1)

where Z. is a vectbr of variables other than demand conditions which
1

influence

the participation rate.

As the discussion in the preceding paragraph makes clear, the per-

sistence view predicts that ER will be large while ER is not important; the timing hypothesis has the opposite implication.

The distinction

between the two hypotheses may be drawn more sharply by considering their
implications for a change in the normal rate of employment holding con—

stant the current rate, It is apparent from equation (10) that

(11)

The preceding discussion implies that this expression should be positive

if persistence dominates and negative under the timing hypothesis. Intu—

— 35 —

itively,

with current opportunities held constant, a decline in future

opportunities will increase labor supplied by a worker who can easily

substitute leisure across periods. On the other hand, it will make
current employment less attractive to a worker for whom leisure is complementary across periods.

These implications of the timing and persistence hypotheses are

clearly subject to empirical verification. To test the conditions laid
out above we have estimated a basic labor supply model using the
data from the 1970 U.S. Census on partici-

pation and selected determinants by state. Time-series data (1966—1974)

on unemployment by state were taken from the power Report of the
President, These series are based on a combination of data on unemployment insurance, payrolls and, for some states, the monthly CPS. In addition to variables measuring the permanent and transitory effects of un—

employment we have included measures of the permanent or expected real
wage as well as structural and demographic variables which affect parti-

cipation through the shadow wage, As a first approximation we assume
that variation in nominal wages across states reflects primarily van—
ation in the permanent component of real wages, so that the level of prices
is excluded from the model. 19

The expected effects of the structural and demographic variables included in equations (12) and (13) have been dealt with at length in a variety

of places and will receive only brief mention here. Education and degree of
urbanization are expected to have a positive effect on participation through
their effects on labor force attachment and the costs of transportation.
Nigration is expected to raise participation in the receiving areas and

— 37 —

lower participation in states with net outflow. The proportion of black
men (women) in the population is included to control for well—known dif-

ferences in participation behavior between blacks and whites. The variable
is expected to have a positive sign in the female equation, and a negative

sign in the equation for males. The proportion of women in the population is
incauded as a measure of potential competition among women; the expected

sign is negative. The proportion of women with a child under six is expected to raise the shadow wage and thus to reduce participation. The expected sign of own—wage variables (1nWW. in (12) and 1nWM. in (13)) is positive.

Male earnings have been included in the female equation to allow

for the effects of joint decision—making in the family and are expected to

reduce female participation. Female earnings on the other hand are specified to have no effect on male participation,

difference between the permanent and transitory components is less than zero
in only three cases, and in no case is the negative coefficient significant.
We find the strongest evidence of the persistence effects among women for
whom the timing phenomenon was expected to be particularly relevant.

In

each of the female age grQups, except women over 65, the transitory employ—
inent rate is totally insignificant, often entering with a negative sign.

In contrast, the permanent effects are large and significant. For women

45—64, for eampie, thepermanentef!ect (a10) is 2.46, which implies that
a decline in the permanent rate of unemployment from 0.06 to 0.05 would

raise the participation rate by 2.46 percent. The trahsitory effect for
this group, on the other hand, is —3,15, clearly reflecting the dominance
of the permanent employment rate which enters negatively in the deviation.

The total effect of the permanent rate is thus 5.61. Similar positive

effects are found for younger women as for women 45-64. Only among women
over 65 does the timing hypothesis find any support and here the estimates

are not particularly precise. The sum of the permanent and transitory ef—
fects is —,10, which may be marginally important in determining the parti-

cipation behavior of women over the age of 65. A somewhat stronger finding

for

men over 65 leads to the paradoxical conclusion that the timing view,

a construct based on life cycle considerations, finds its support only among
those nearing the end of their adult lives.

The results in rows 10 and 11 of Table V clearly suggest that changes
in the expected rate of unemployment strongly influence the participation

decisions of most demographic groups. This conclusion is buttressed in
row 12 of Table V, which presents estimates of the effect of unemployment
assuming no transitory effects (i.e.,

=

0).

Among most demographic

groups the expected rate of employment enters significantly with a relatively

large positive coefficient. Differences in the size of the employment effect
within and across demographic groups are consistent with the theoretical role

of unemployment laid out in Section 3. We find that unemployment is more
important in those groups where employment durations are short. Thus within
the male and female categories teenagers are more sensitive to variations

in unemployment than are older persons. Similarly, within age groups, women
tend to be more responsive than men. It should be noted, however, that the
coefficients for the older adult men are far from trivial. We estimate
that a 1 point decline in the long—term unemployment rate (0.06 to 0.05)

leads to a 0.6 percent increase in the participation of men 25—44, and a
1.3 percent increase in the rate of participation of men 45—64.
The evidence on the relative importance of timing and persistence in

the cross—section data relies on the use of the unemployment rate to capture market opportunities. We have already discussed some of our reasons
for preferring this kind of interpretation in section 3. But there are

- 42

two additional issues that need to be addressed. In the first place,
classical models would call for the use of permanent and transitory real

wages rather than unemployment rates as explanatory variables. The results
of including real wages in time—series regressions have been discussed in the

preceding section. We have made an attempt to gauge their effect in the
cross—section analysis by calculating real wages by state. We used the
BLS Standard of Living Estimates for 35 cities to construct state price

indices; wages were based on data for manufacturing by state. Both permanent and transitory wage variations had only minor effects on state par-

ticipation and employment rates. Therefore the unemployment rate has been
used as a proxy for th,e attractiveness of entering and remaining in the

labor force. The role of wages and prices in explaining cross-section
differences in participation remains an important area for future research.
A second problem concerns the effect of omitted variables. Although

we have included a number of

structural characteristics of each state in

the equation, there is always the possibility

that omitted common third

factors account for the observed correlations between unemployment and par-

ticipation rates. We explored this issue by using other variables such as
the employment—population ratio in place of the unemployment rate. This
20

had little effect on the qualitative conclusions.
The analysis in this section has shown the predominance of the expected
or natural level of demand in explaining participation differences across

states. Except for those over 65, there is no evidence for the notion that
transitory changes in opportunities play a

significantrole in decisions

about participating in the labor force. These results suggest that a

— 43 -

rise

in expected opportunities, holding current opportunities constant,

will call forth an increase in participation, a response consistent with

the implications of persistence in labor supply. The notion that individuals
schedule their labor supply according to variations in current opportunities
finds little support in these data.

—44—

Section 6: Conclusions
The results in this paper suggest the importance of persistence

in

labor market decisions. A variety of types of evidence suggest that previous employment experience has an important effect on subsequent labor

supply. This implies that labor supply decisions are not very responsive
to transitory changes in employment opportunities.

While no one of the

tests presented in this paper can be regarded as decisive, in conjunction
they suggest that persistence elements are more important than timing 'ele-

ments in explaining fluctuations in either the number of persons employed
or the number participating in the labor force.

Our results leave open

the possibility that timing elements are important in explaining cyclical
fluctuations in average hours worked and in work effort.

Acceptance of these conclusions has important implications for both

macroeconomic theory and policy. These results cast doubt on the medium—
run relevance of the natural rate hypothesis. Because policy affects the
level of employment in the short run, it has a long—ruh effect on the po-

sition of the labor supply schedule. Workers drawn into the labor force
by cyclical upturns tend to remain even after the boom has ended. The converse is true for shocks which reduce employment.

At this point, the quan-

titative importance of these effects is uncertain, although our interpretation of the evidence reported here suggests that they are quite important.
This paper has only begun to touch on the implications of alternative

life cycle labor supply models for macroeconomic questions. Both the empirical and theoretical work des-cribed in this paper could usefully be extended

— 45 —

in

several directions. It would be valuable to develop tests which can

distinguish different aspects of persistence. In particular, the model
developed here completely ignores the accumulation of human capital. The
explicit inclusion of human capital in the model would provide a more

satisfactory basis for rationalizing the observed persistence in labor
supply, and would also suggest relationships between employment experi-

ence and subsequent wage levels. It would be valuable to extend the empirical work reported here by attempting direction estimation of utility
function parameters using recently developed rational expectations tech—

niques. Unsuccessful estimates of a relatively simple utility function
which takes no account of persistence effects are presented in Mankiw,

Rotemberg and Summers (1982). While these extensions would be valuable,
it is unlikely that they would call into question the main conclusion
reached here that a proper theory of labor supply must come to grips
with the persistence of participation,

FOOTNOTES

1. At the conference where this paper was presented we became aware of
the important paper by Altonji (1982). His work provides a comprehensive set of econometric tests of what this paper calls the timing
hypothesis.
2.

The most extensive empirical work is reported in Houthakker and
Taylor (1970). Theoretical analysis is surveyed by Pollack (1978).

3.

In a Keynesian framework, this may. be interpreted as temporarily
increasing aggregate demand, and Increasing employment opportunities.
In the context of a classical model, it can be thought of as an unexpected increase in the money stock, leading to a transitory increase
in the perceived real wage. In either case t±e expansionary policy
is taken to be temporary in its direct effect.

4, For a, recent statement of this argument, see Wachter (1977).
5.

It is tempting but inaccurate to regard persistence effects as argu—
ments in support of expansionary policy. If the economy is initially
at an optimal Walrasian equilibrium, locking additional workers into
employment is not an efficiency gain. Of course this conclusion does
not hold if the "natural rate" of unemployment is inefficiently high,
as Phelps (1972) suggests is likely to be the case. If, as has been
suggested, work is habit—forming, no clear basis exists for welfare
judgments,

6. Such hysteresis effects in which the equilibrium level of employment
is affected by the transition path have been discussed by Phelps
(1972), but have, to our knowledge, received no enpirical attention.

8. Ideally one ought to look at the participation of women
ages rather than different cohorts. Thus, for example,

was also obtained using employment instead of labor force
participation as a measure of labor supply. It should be noted that
the participation rates for married women have not been adjusted for
differences in fertility. As others have noted, adjusting for ferti—
lity would accentuate the divergence between actual rates and extra-polation of 1930—19.40 trends (See; Bowen and Finnegan, 1969, pp. 200
- 201), Fertility in 1940 was exceptionally low, while 1950 was part
of the post—war baby boom, It may be that a fertility correction is
inappropriate since ferti1ity is jointly determined with labor supply.

It might be argued that the purportedly permanent shifts in. participation
induced by the World War II experience actually reflect the very weak
economy of 1940. In order to test this possibility, trends were estimated in 1930. This leads to even greater discrepancies between predicted
and actual participation, both during and after the war. As a further
check, we estimated trends using data for the whole 1890 — 1980 period.
The results werequalitatively similar, although the estimated effects of
the war on subsequent participation were significantly reduced. Of course,
this procedure may be inappropriate because the war presumably affected
post—war data.

Both in aggregate and within occupations, there was virtually
change in the ratio of male and female hourly and/or
yearly earnings
between 1939 and 1950. The data must be interpreted cautiously because of a plethora of selection effects.

Strictly speaking, all that is required is that (1) can be represented

14. In the empirical work below, we use the unemployment rate for 35—44
year old men. This avoids problems of demographic adjustment.

15. The estimateswereperfoed using annual data for the period 1949—1981.
Two lags on each variable were included. Wages are measured using an
index of compensation in the private business sector. Prices are measured using the consumption price deflator, and output is measured as
real GNP.

16. The tax rate is the sum of the average marginal tax rate imposed on
labor income, Federal income taxes, state and local taxes and Social
Security taxes. The municipal bond rate is then used, as a crude proxy
for the other tax interest rate.
17.

In the empirical work reported below, we control for migration so
this difficulty does not arise. In results which are not reported,
measures of demand were used other than the unemployment rate with
very little effect on the results. The problem of seasonality in
the census sampling is not dealt with.

18.

Fleisher and Rhodes argue that the unemployment rate is properly
treated as endogenous in participation equations. However, the
instrumental variables they employ, such as the growth rate of
employment are probably at least as likely as unemployment to be
correlated with the error term in the participation equation.

19.

In the results reported below, earnings are used as a wage proxy.
This creates an obvious upwards bias in the estimate of wage effects
on labor supply.
