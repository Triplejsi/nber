MONETARY POLICY WITH A CREDIT AGGREGATE TARGET

Benjamin

Monetary policy procedures typically have short life spans.
Some basic elements endure, of course, but experience suggests

that central banks frequently overhaul the specific operating
procedures they use to implement monetary policy. These adaptations,
which occur at irregular intervals, can be responses to changes

in

the underlying economic and

policy

financial

environment, to

shifts in

objectives, or even to advances in economic science.
In the United States the past decade or so has been an

especially fast—moving period from, this perspective. The emergence
of rapid and volatile price inflation in the late 1960s had made
nominal interest rates, which the Federal Reserve System had
emphasized since world War II, clearly less reliable as a focus

for monetary policy) At the beginning of the l970s, therefore,
the

Federal Reserve shifted to a policy framework based on monetary

aggregates as intermediate targets.2 During most of the l970s

interest rates remained an important part of the policy process,
but

primarily as the instrument used to influence the growth of the

targeted monetary aggregates. In a widely pub1iized action in
October 1979, however, the Federal Reserve abandoned interest
rates altogether and adopted new procedures based on controlling

the monetary aggregates via the quantity of bank reserves. In the
meanwhile, a series of innovations in financial institutions and

—2—

practices during the 1970s had progressively blurred the meaning

of "money." Early in 1980, therefore, the Federal Reserve implicitly
changed its operating procedures once again, this time by redefining
the monetary aggregates used as the intermediate targets.

As is nearly always the case when central banks change

operating procedures, these most recent changes —to a reserves
instrument instead of an interest rate instrument, and to new

monetary aggregate intermediate targets — have raised new questions
and revived old ones. Indeed, as a measure of its own active
concern with these questions, the Federal Reserve Board in 1981
published a two—volume study, New Monetary Control Procedures,
consisting of thirteen staff papers on various aspects of the subject.
Although these studies addressed a broad range of specific topics,
the main focus was on the same issues that have always been central
to the analysis of monetary policy procedures under an intermediate

target strategy: what aggregates to target, what instruments to
use to achieve those targets, and what variation of both instruments

and intermediate targets to seek (or tolerate) over time. Apparently
these basic issues are as open today as they have been at any time
in the past.

The object of this paper is to consider the evidence bearing
on the most central of these choices determining monetary policy

procedures under the intermediate target approach —the selection
of the intermediate target itself — and to do so in the context of
a specific alternative to the current exclusive reliance on the

monetary aggregates. In particular, in a series of recent papers

—3—

(Friedman 1981, 1982a, 1982b) I have documented the stability of

the relationship between credit and income in the United States,
and have gone on to suggest several implications of this regularity
for both monetary arid fiscal policies. The chief implication for
monetary policy is that the available empirical evidence On the
relative stability of the credit-to-income and money-to-income
relationships does not support a special role for money over credit

in formulating and implementing monetary policy. Since there is
nothing special about (inside) money from an a priori perspective
either, there is therefore little basis for monetary policy procedures
which focus on target growth rates for specific measures of the
money stock with little if any attention paid to credit measures.
Although a close and reliable relationship to nonfinancial
economic activity is perhaps the most important factor determining
the suitability of a financial aggregate as an intermediate monetary

policy target, it is hardly the only consideration. A second
important

criterion is that the relationship of an intermediate

target to

nonfinancial activity must go beyond mere contemporaneous

correlation, so that current movements of the target contain
information

about future movements of the relevant aspects of the

nonfinancial economy. A

target

third

criterion is that an intermediate

must also be closely related to the instruments under the

central bank's direct control —

in

the United States under current

procedures the stock of nonborrowed reserves, or alternatively a

short—term interest rate. Finally, a fourth criterion is that data
on an intermediate target must be readily available on a timely basis.

—4—

Although special strength in some areas may compensate for weakness
in others, gross failure on any one of these grounds would render
any variable unsuitable as an intermediate target for monetary
policy.

This paper presents evidence for the United States comparing
total net credit, the credit aggregate that displays the most
stable relationship with income, to the major monetary aggregates

on each of these four criteria. Section I reviews and updates
the evidence showing that the stability of the credit-to-income
relationship is comparable to that of the money—to—income relation-

ship. section II presents evidence on the degree to which current
movements of either credit or money signal future movements of

nonfinancial economic activity. Section III turns to the question
of whether

credit

the Federal Reserve

could actually

meet predetermined

growth targets, and presents evidence on the relationship

of total net credit and the monetary aggregates, respectively,

to nonborrowed reserves and to the federal funds rate. Section IV
focuses on the timing and reliability of the available credit
data by presenting some preliminary results based on monthly

credit series. Section V briefly summarizes the main conclusions
reached in the paper and highlights their implications for monetary
policy.

The evidence presented in this paper indicates that, on
each of the four criteria considered, total net credit is just
as suitable as any. of the monetary aggregates

for monetary policy. As long as the Federal

—5—

Reserve continues

to use an intermediate target procedure, this

both sides of the publics balance sheet for the set of signals
that govern the systematic response of monetary policy to economic
events.

I.

The Stability of the Credit-to-Income Relationship3
The intermediate target procedure for monetary policy

involves specifying some financial variable Cs) —

in

the United

States today, the monetary aggregates — to stand as proxy for
the real economic targets at which monetary policy ultimately
aims, such as economic growth, price stability, employment, and

international balance. The result is, in effect, a two—step
procedure.

The central bank first determines what growth of the

intermediate target is most likely to correspond to the desired
ultimate economic outcome.
over which it can exert

either

It

then sets some operating instrument

close control — in the United States

a short—term interest rate or, since October 1979, the

quantity of bank reserves — so as to achieve that growth rate for
the intermediate target itself.

The first, and most obvious, criterion for selecting a
suitable intermediate target is that the targeted measure must be
closely and reliably related to the nonfinancial objectives of
monetary policy. Despite the proven seductiveness of discussions
about whether any given monetary aggregate will or will not be
within the announced target range on some chosen date, it is
important

never to lose sight of the simple truth that any such

aggregate

has no policy significance in and of itself. What

matters is the effect of monetary policy on the nonfinancial
economy,

effect

and intermediate targets not reliably related to that

have no role at all to play in the monetary policy process.
Results based on a variety of methodological approaches

consistently indicate that total net credit in the United States —

—7--

that is, the aggregate outstanding indebtedness of all U.S.

nonfinancial borrowers — bears as close and as stable a relationship
to U.s. nonfinancial economic activity as do the more familiar
asset aggregates like the money stock (however defined) or the

monetary base. Moreover, in contrast to the familiar asset
aggregates, among which there seems to be less basis for choice
from this perspective, total net credit appears to be unique in

this regard among major liability aggregates. Unlike the asset
aggregates, the stability of the relationship for total net credit
does not just represent the stability of a sum of stable parts.
The U.S. nonfinancial economy's reliance on credit, scaled
in relation to economic activity, has shown almost no trend and

but little variation since World War II. After falling from 156%
of gross national product in 1946 to 127% in 1951, and then rising
to 144% in 1960, total net credit has remained within a few

percentage points of that level ever since. (The yearend 1981
level was 143%.) Otherwise it has exhibited a slight cyclicality,
typically rising a percentage point or two in recession years
(when gross national product, in the denominator, is weak) and

then falling back. Although the individual components of this
total have varied in sharply different directions both secularly
and cyclically, on the whole they have just offset one another.
In brief, the secular rise in private debt has largely mirrored
a substantial decline (relative to economic activity) in federal
government debt, while bulges in federal debt issuance during
recessions have mostly had their counterpart in the abatement

—8—

of

private borrowing.

The first four columns of Table 1 summarize the stability
of the ratios to gross national product of six financial aggregates

— total

net credit and

five others — by

showing the coefficient

of variation (standard deviation normalized by mean) for each
ratio computed from both annual and quarterly U.S. data over the

4
1959—80 sample period.

In each case the table shows the coefficient

of variation computed from raw data, and also computed from detrended

data. Total net credit consistently displays the smallest coefficient
of variation among the six aggregates, and by a substantial margin,
regardless of whether the data are annual or quarterly, or raw or
detrended.
What matters for monetary policy, of course, is not just
the absence of a time trend, and not even stability at each
individual moment of time, but stability in a dynamic sense.
Simple ratios of precisely contemporaneous observations may
therefore fail to capture what is important in the relationship
among variables that move over time with some general lead or

lag pattern between them. The remaining columns of Table 1 present
the

respective standard errors, coefficients of determination and

Durbin—Watson statistics of six estimated regression equations, in

each case relating the growth of nominal gross national product to
a moving average of the growth of one of the six financial aggregates

listed

in the table, plus a moving average of a fiscal policy

measure. The equations are estimated, using quarterly data for
1959—80, in

In part

because

of the extent to which regressions of the

form (1) have been discredited by a variety of criticisms, researchers
examining the money—to—income (or, here, credit—to—income) relationship have increasingly turned to methods that allow for a richer
dynamic interaction by relating the variation of income not to
the entirety of the variation of money but only to that part of
it which cannot already be deduced either from the past history
of money itself or from the joint past history of both money and

income.7 In this context a key indication of the stability of the
relationship

to income of any

financial

aggregate is the behavior

of that relationship following just such an "innovation," or
unanticipated

movement, in the aggregate (or in income). A more

general representation of (1) that is consistent with this interpretation (but that omits the fiscal variable, so as to keep the order
of the system small) is the vector autoregression

The upper panel of Table 2 summarizes simulations of (4),
estimated in the form (1) using 1959—80 quarterly data for nominal
gross national product and each of the six financial aggregates
from Table 1, with eight quarters of lags on each variable in each

equation. For convenience the table reports the response of F/Y
rather than the individual responses of F and Y separately. Each
column in the table presents values, for the initial quarter and
then for the final quarter in each of the first five years,
indicating the time path followed by F/y (for the definition of
F indicated) in response to a 1% innovation in F.9
Although it is impossible to interpret these simulation
results in other than a descriptive way, th.e responses suggest

quite different degrees of dynamic stability among the six aggregate-

to—income relationships. By construction, Y remains unaffected
contemporaneously, so that in the initial quarter each F/y ratio

rises by 1%. Thereafter the bulge disappears from most of the
ratios as Y rises or F declines, or both. The time pattern by
which it disappears varies from one aggregate to another, however.
The

Ml money stock ratio quickly returns to (and remains approximately

at) the initial base line, and the M2 and total net credit ratios
do also, albeit with some delay. By contrast, the bank credit
and M3 ratios show little tendency to decline until after two years.
The monetary base ratio over—corrects and then remains persistently

negative. Overall, Ml exhibits the most stable dynamic relationship

A further aspect of the tendency in recent research to
avoid simple nominal income regressions of the form (1) has been
a reluctance to ignore the distinction between the real and price

components of nominal income variation. The lower panel of Table 2

(both in natural logarithms). Here the total net credit and Ml
ratios are the two that quickly return to, and remain nearly at,

the initial base line. Once again, the stability of the total net
credit ratio is comparable to that of any

of

the monetary aggregates.11

Finally, it is useful to point out that the stability of
the credit—to—income relationship is a phenomenon in no way
restricted to the United States in the post World War II period.

The U.S. nonfinancial economy's reliance on credit relative to
economic activity has shown essentially no trend not just over the

past thirty years but over the past sixty. (The 1921 level was
142%.) Nonfinancial borrowers' outstanding debt rose
significantly in relation to gross national product only during

—13—

the depression years 1930—33, when the economy was deteriorating
rapidly and many recorded debts had defaulted de facto anyway.
Otherwise the postwar stability in the United States appears to
be a continuation of a pattern that dates back at least six decades.
Among foreign economies, empirical research thus far has demonstrated
a similar comparability of the credit-to-income arid

income relationships in Britain, Canada, Germany
In

money-to-

and Japan.

sum, there is ample ground for believing that total net

credit, measured by the total outstanding indebtedness of all of
the economy's nonfinancial borrowers, is as closely related to
nonfinancial

economic activity as are the monetary aggregates

which are so central to today's monetary policy framework.

-14-

II. The Information Content of Money and Credit
The

essence of the intermediate target procedure is that,

under it, the central bank is required to respond quickly (and fully)
to any information reflected in the movements of whatever the

intermediate target happens to be. Under the current framework

in the United States, with monetary aggregates used as the interme-

diate

targets, any movement

creates

in the public's money holdings therefore

a presumption that the Federal Reserve System should

react. In principle the Federal Reserve is always free to change
the money growth targets, of course, but in practice it is typically

reluctant to do so. The intermediate target strategy instead
calls

for actions

aimed at regaining the stated targets, so that

the economic signals contained in thovements of the monetary

aggregates create a presumption of immediate response. By contrast,
the presumption of this strategy, strictly implemented, is that
there will be no response to signals arising from other sources
but not reflected in the intermediate targets.
This procedure makes sense only if the relationship of the
intermediate target to the nonfinancial objectives of monetary
policy is more than just that of a mirror providing a reflection.
Targeting a financial aggregate that merely moved in step with
nonfinancial activity, without signaling subsequent non financial

outcomes,

would provide no advantages over directly targeting

some aspect of nonfinancial activity itself.12 Instead, current
movements of the intermediate target must contain information
about

the future movements of nonfinancial monetary policy objectives.

Hence

the finding that the credit-to—income relationship is as

—15—

regular and

as

stable as the money—to—income relationship would

be of little interest in a policy context if the economic behavior
underlying these results were such that money "causes" income
while income in turn "causes" credit, in the sense of causality
that, as Granger (1969) and Sims (1972) have shown, corresponds
to econometric exogeneity.

Table 3 summarizes the evidence on the interrelationships
among money, credit, income and prices, based again on quarterly

data for 1959-80. The top panel of the table presents F-statistics
for the test of the null hypothesis that all of the eight coefficients
in each respective polynomial are zero, in each successive equation

These results are not consistent with any simple proposition
that money "causes" income while income "causes" credit. If anything,

they suggest the opposite. Past credit innovations contain more
significant information about

the variation of either real income

or prices than do past money innovations. Similarly, both real
income innovations and price innovations are highly significant
in the money equation in the top panel, but only the price innovations are (marginally) significant in the credit equation in the

middle panel. Moreover, the corresponding results shown in the
bottom panel of the table, for the four—variable analog to (5)

including both money and credit as well as real income and prices,
are also inconsistent with any simple money—then—income—then—credit
13

reasoning.

It is also possible to examine in greater generality the
extent to which movements of money and credit contain information
about the subsequent movements of nonfinancial economic activity.

Table 4 presents a dynamic decomposition of the respective variances
of real income and prices, based on the moving—average representation
of the four-variable autoregression (including both money and
credit as well as real income and prices) underlying the bottom

panel of Table 3. Specifically, Table 4 shows, for both real
income and prices, and for time horizons extending from one
quarter to two years, the percentage of variance accounted for by
innovations in each of the four variables in the system (including,
14

of course, the variable under study itself).

Because the

results of a variance decomposition (unlike the exogeneity test
results presented in Table 3) clearly depend on the ordering imposed
in orthogonalizing the moving—average system,15 the table presents

corresponding sets of results for four different orderings: for
the two financial aggregates ordered either before or after real
income and prices, and for money ordered either before or after
credit

within the pair of financial variables.
The variance decomposition results shown in Table 4

that

indicate

the comparisons based on statistical significance in Table 3

generally carry over to comparisons based on quantitative significance.

one—third or more of the variance of real income after the initial

quarter. If money is ordered before credit, the division between
the two aggregates depends on the time horizon, with money appearing
more

important than credit for a year, and vice versa thereafter.

By contrast, if

credit

is ordered before money, it

appears

more

important throughout. When ordered after the nonfinancial variables,

the financial aggregates together account for less of the variance

of real income, in a pattern that slowly builds toward one-fifth
of

the total. The division between money and credit again depends

on the time horizon if money is ordered before credit, and

again

favors credit throughout if credit is ordered before money.

surprising aspect of these results is that the two
financial variables together consistently account for a smaller
One

fraction of the variance of prices than of real income. When the
financial aggregates are ordered first, that share barely exceeds

one—tenth, even after two years. When the financial aggregates
are ordered after real income and prices, the corresponding share

is almost negligible. Within these smaller amounts, credit usually
(but not always) accounts for more of variance of prices than does
money.

Because

these results change importantly according to not

just the ordering among the variables but also the sample period
used, it would be unwise to rely heavily on them in any very

specific way.16 A conservative interpretation of the results
presented in Tables 3 and 4 is to conclude that current movements
of financial aggregates do contain information, which is at least

—18—

potentially of quantitative importance, about future movements of

nonfinancial economic activity, and that the information about

nonfinancial activity contained in total net credit is at least
comparable to that contained in the narrow money stock. More

generally, yet another mode of analysis that potentially could
indicate a more important role for money than for credit as an

intermediate target variable does not do so.

—19—

III. Controlling Money and Credit
The criteria that determine the suitability of any financial
variable as an intermediate target for monetary policy include
a relationship not Only to the nonfinancial objectives of policy
but also to the operating instruments that the central bank can

control directly —

in

the U.S. context, once again, either reserves

or a short—term interest rate. For example, although common
stock prices in the United States are a well known leading indicator
of business activity, there is little evidence to suggest that the
Federal Reserve could exert sufficiently close control over the

stock market to make it a good monetary policy target.17 There
would be little point in having an intermediate target that the
central bank could not expect to affect reasonably closely, within
some plausible time horizon (like a calendar quarter or a half—year)
determined by considerations of what matters for the economy as
well as what provides political accountability.18

The broader the scope of any financial aggregate — on
either the asset or the liability side of the economy's balance

sheet — and the greater the variety of institutions and individuals
involved

in supplying and demanding it,

the a priori

the

more problematic at

level is the connection between that aggregate and

the instruments under the central bank's direct control. Even
in the case of the narrow money stock, the number and complexity
of the linkages relating its movements to movements of reserves
(or the monetary base) are fairly burdensome at either the analytical

or the operational level)9 This problem is likely to be more

—20—

severe

for the broader monetary aggregates; and, at least in

principle, total net credit could turn out to be even harder to

relate to reserves than M2 or M3. In the end, however, the
potential controllability of any such aggregate, either narrow or
broad, depends on a diverse set of substitution responses characterizing the behavior of many

different

kinds of individual and

institutional portfolios.

The top panel of Table 5 provides summary statistics for
the estimation, using quarterly data for 1959-80, of the relationship

contrast, the Ml and M2 equations both show standard errors of
2.5% per annum, and the M3 equation's standard error is 2.6%
per annum.

It is always possible,

of course, that a close

Although credit is more closely related to the income terms in the

respective

values and their sum indicates, it is not the case

that credit lacks any connection to the reserves instrument. A
comparison of the t-statistics on the respective S

that the connection to reserves is somewhat weaker for credit
than for Ml, but significant nonetheless.

Iv.

Using Monthly Data on Money and Credit
The analysis in Section III in effect proceeds as if the

Federal Reserve System, in seeking to control its money and/or
credit growth targets over a calendar quarter, would decide on
the growth of nonborrowed reserves (or the level of the federal
funds rate) at the beginning of that quarter and then take no

further action until the beginning of the next quarter. Such
a procedure would be sensible only if data describing the withinquarter movements of money and credit were either not available

at all or were sufficiently "noisy" to be useless. In fact, data
on both money and credit are available on at least a monthly

basis (weekly for Ml). The noisiness of these short—run data,
as indicated by subsequent revisions, is well known (especially
for the weekly Ml series); but there is no reason to believe that
the incoming monthly data are so poor as to be of no use at all
in

making within-quarter adjustments 25

Although the standard vehicle

in which the Federal Reserve

System publishes data on the total net credit aggregate is the
flow—of—funds accounts, a publication which appears only once per
quarter, the great bulk of the underlying data is actually a

available monthly. Indeed, the Federal Reserve currently maintains,

on an unpublished basis, a monthly credit data file. As of
yearend 1980, the total net credit measure for the United States
was $3,907.5 billion, of which $3,436.1 billion, or 88%, consisted
of items regularly reported each month and included in the Federal
Reserve's

monthly

data file. Somewhat ironically, many of the items

—25—

not included in this monthly data file represent the lending

activities of various components of the federal government itself.26
Of the $471.4 billion of 1980 yearend total net credit not included
in the monthly data file, $290.7 billion represented credit
advanced directly by the U.S. Government or by its sponsored credit

agencies and mortgage poois. If the Federal Reserve were merely
to collect from the relevant agencies of the federal government
the kind of data it already has on the private sector, therefore,
more than 95% of the total net credit aggregate would be available
monthly.

Even

without any

extra data reporting on the government's

part, however, the information contained in the 88% of total net
credit which is currently included each month is hardly without

value for monetary policy. For the 1963-77 sample period (the
longest interval for which seasonally adjusted credit series now
exist in the Federal Reserve's monthly data file 27), the correlation
between the total net credit series reported in the flow—of-funds
accounts

and the quarterly

"total" net credit series formed by

using only the end-of-quarter months of the corresponding monthly

series is .99985. Moreover, the relationship between nonfinancial
economic activity and this quarterly "total" net credit series is
fully comparable to that shown for the actual total net credit
series in Section I.

Table 7 presents summary statistics for monthly analogs to
the quarterly relationships (6) and (8) in the form

V. Summary of Conclusions
The principal criteria for the selection of an intermediate
target for monetary policy are (1) that the target be closely
related to the nonfinancial objectives of monetary policy, (2)

that it contain information about the future movements of those
relevant aspects of the nonfinancial economy, (3) that it be
closely connected to the instruments over which the central bank
can exert direct control, and (4) that data on it be readily
available on a timely basis.
The empirical evidence considered in this paper supports a

positive conclusion — at least in comparison with the major
monetary aggregates — about the potential use of total net credit
as an intermediate target variable on each of these four criteria.
First, the relationship between total net credit and aggregate
measures of nonfinancial economic activity, judged by several
different methodological approaches, is as stable and reliable as
the corresponding relationship for any of the monetary aggregates

(or the monetary base). Second, dynamic analysis based on exogeneity
tests and decomposition of variance shows that the information
about subsequent movements in nonfinancial activity contained in
total net credit is at least comparable to that contained in the

Ml money stock. Third, relationships between total net credit
and either the quantity of nonborrowed reserves or the federal
funds rate are roughly comparable to the corresponding relationships

for the principal monetary aggregates. Finally, data for a close
approximation to total net credit are available on a monthly basis,

—29—

and the relevant relationships based on the monthly data are also
roughly comparable to the corresponding relationships for the
monetary aggregates.
These conclusions consistently support the use of total
net credit as an intermediate target for monetary policy, either

together with or instead of one of the monetary aggregates —

as long as the Federal Reserve System continues to operate within
the

intermediate target framework, It is important to note

explicitly, however, that the interpretation of empirical results
throughout

this paper is entirely relative in context. The essential

question asked, in each case, is whether or not total net credit
meets a specific criterion at least as well as any or all of the
more familiar monetary aggregates, and in each case the answer is

yes. These results therefore bear importantly on what intermediate
targets the Federal Reserve should use, as long as it uses any
at all; but they leave open the more fundamental question of
whether the intermediate target framework itself is the best
way to conduct monetary policy in the current environment.

1.

In the early post—war years, the Federal Reserve was obligated

to

peg bond

prices. After the 1951 Treasury-Federal Reserve

Accord, u.s. monetary policy followed a "free reserves"
strategy that was essentially equivalent to setting nominal

interest rates; see, for example, Davis (1971). During the
late 1960s monetary policy was focused on short—term nominal
interest rates directly.

2. It is difficult to be precise about when the Federal Reserve

began focusing on monetary targets in an important way.
Congress

did not ask the Federal Reserve to announce its

monetary

targets in advance until 1975, but the Federal

Open Market Committee started including a monetary growth

target in its monetary policy directives in 1970. For evidence
on

the importance of monetary aggregate targets in Federal

Reserve policymaking during these years, see De Rosa and Stern
(1977),

Diggins (1978), Feige and McGee (1979), and Lombra

and Moran (1980).

3. This section draws heavily on my earlier papers, especially
Friedman (1981, 1982a); see those papers for more complete
descriptions of the data and more complete sets of empirical
results.

4. The three monetary aggregates all follow the Federal Reserve's

new (post-1980) definitions. The reason for including bank
credit is that the Federal Reserve currently includes a
bank credit target, along with the targets for the monetary
aggregates, in its semi—annual reports to Congress.

5. This

is the specification originally made popular by the

Federal

Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Its use here is intended

to facilitate ready comparisons. Even so, the precise details
of the specification do not matter much. For example, the
standard errors for the estimation of (1) subject to no
constraints at all on the

and y coefficients are .00738 for

total net credit, .00863 for bank credit, .00709 for Ml,
.00820 for M2, .00835 for M3, and .00825 for the monetary

base, changing the lag length apparently does not matter
much either.

6. The estimated values also look about as plausible for
total net credit as for the monetary aggregates. The estimated
values (and associated t—statistics) for total net credit are
.958 (4.0), .541 (4.0), —.097 (—0.4), —.349 (—2,7) and —.155

(—0.6), with sum .899 (5.0). The corresponding values for Ml,
for example, are .437 (3.8), .437 (5.9), .245 (2.6), .043

(0.6) and —.056 (—0.5), with sum 1.106 (6.3). The sum of

coefficients is near unity in both cases, as expected, while
the

individual coefficients on total net credit decline more

rapidly than do those on Ml and

even

show one significant

negative value, thereby suggesting a more complicated response
pattern of income.
7. 2xnong the most important criticisms of the St. Louis approach
have been those of Goldfeld and Blinder (1972), Sargent (1976),

and Modigliani and 2ndo (1976). The methodology underlying
the tests described below is due largely to Granger and Sims;
see especially Sims (1980).

This orthogonalization is

equivalent to placing F last in the pairwise causal ordering

alternative ordering placing F first, which

that the arbitrarily selected ordering of the orthogonalization

9. Analogous simulations, showing the dynamic response of
each respective F/Y ratio to a 1% innovation in Y, showed
little difference from one definition of F to another; see
Friedman (1981).

10. The full set of results presented in Friedman (1981) showed
sharply unstable relationships for other credit aggregates,
including measures either narrower or broader than total net

credit. Similar instability for these other credit measures
appeared in simulations of the trivariate systems corresponding
to those shown in the bottom half of Table 2.

11, Analogous simulations, showing the dynamic response of each
respective F/(X'P) ratio to a 1% innovation in either x or
P, showed more limited differences from one definition of F
to another; see again Friedman (1981).

12. An exception,

which is probably not of much practical importance,

is the case in which data on the aggregate are available before
data on income. The data—lag case has received a good deal

of attention in the literature, primarily because it is
isomorphic

to the more relevant case of structural economic

lags; see Friedman (1975).

13. The exogeneity test results shown in Table 3 differ in several
interesting respects from those based on the pre—1980 Ml
definition and a 1953—78 sample period in Friedman (l982a),

which indicated more fully parallel roles for money and
credit. For example, the F—statistics corresponding to the
four-variable

system shown in the bottom panel were (by

rows, as in Table 3) 10.77*, 2.42**, 2.47**, 2.l4**; 0.28,
59•53*, 1.35, 0.55; 2.50**, 2.67**, 107.11*, 0.92; 1.01,

1.71, l.95***, 161.10*. Here, in contrast to the results

expresses all movement in each variable in terms of the

history

of innovations corresponding to itself and other

variables in the system.

17. Shiller (1980) has also questioned the central bank's ability
to influence real interest rates. Although most economists
have accepted the central bank's ability to control short-

term interest rates, at least over short time horizons and
in nonpathological circumstances, doubt about the ability to
control long—term interest rates is of long standing.

18. Even in the absence of any

at all, however,
a variable could serve as a monetary policy "information

variable" in the sense of Kareken et al. (1973) and
(1975)

Friedman

19. See, for example, the work of Johannes and Rasche (1979,
1981) and Tinsley et al. (1981).

20. Equations of this form have become standard since the work
of Davis and Shadrack (1974). As in the case of the St.
Louis equations presented in Section I, the use of the
Davis—Schadrack form here is intended to facilitate ready

comparisons. n additional variable included by Davis and
Shadrack, the quantity of government deposits, is omitted

here and in (7) - (11) below because preliminary experimentation indicated that its coefficent was never significantly
nonzero. Experimentation not reported here also indicated
that the nature of the constraint imposed on the respective
distributed lags had no noticeable implications for the results.

21. Interpretation of these relationships is subject to the usual
caveats

regarding whether they are true reduced forms; even

if

so,

to

systematic changes in the conduct of policy; and whether

whether the underlying behavior would remain invariant

the use of within—quarter corrections, based on incoming

data, would significantly matter. Although a structural
approach like that implemented in Friedman (1977) or Sivesind
and Hurley (1980) would be preferable, in that it would at
least address the first of these potential problems, such

an effort lies beyond the scope of this paper. The results
presented in Section IV below bear on the issue of withinquarter corrections.

22. One
and

contrast
those

that

between the estimated 5

values

shown for credit

shown for Ml in the top two panels of Table 6 is

the implied polynomial for credit has an unstable root

while that for Ml does not. Single—minded use of the reserves
instrument

to control a credit target, without any

allowance

for the uncertainty associated with the estimated coefficient
values, would therefore lead to "instrument instability"

in the sense outlined by Holbrook (1972). The relevance of
this result is dubious, however, since credit would probably

not

be the sole intermediate target, and since the optimal

policy

would allow for uncertainty in the manner shown by

Brainard (1967) in any case.

23. Indeed, as of the time of writing there is some debate over
whether it is still doing so.

24. The 5 values shown in the bottom two panels of Table 6 indicate
unstable polynomials with a federal funds

both credit and Ml.

See again footnote 22.

25. A potentially useful exercise, which lies beyond the scope
of this paper, would be to compare the relative extent to
which the monthly credit data and monetary aggregate data,

are subject to revision.
26. In practice the bulk of the credit data is gathered from
respectively,

reporting by lenders. In principle, of course, the relevant
information could be gathered from either lenders or borrowers.

27. After

1977 the Federal Pserve ceased performing seasonal

adjustments to its monthly credit data file. The Federal
Reserve staff is currently developing a seasonally adjusted

monthly credit data file that will be up to date. Once these
new data are available, it will be straightforward to carry
out the empirical work presented below on a current sample.

28. For example, the coefficient of variation of the ratio of
quarterly

"total" net credit to gross national product over

1963—77 is .016 on the basis of the raw data and .010 on

the basis of the detrended data, The summary statistics

for

the nominal income equation (1), estimated for the

1963—77 sample period, are SE = .00762,
DW =

2.25.

2 =

23 and

These results are comparable to the results for

total net credit (and superior to those for the monetary
aggregates) for the experiments in Table 1 redone for the
1963—77 sample.

29. Use of the business sales variable, in the absence of monthly
data on the gross national product, again follows Davis and
Schadrack (1974).

30. Because they tend to be more volatile than credit (or Ml)
on a monthly basis, M2 and M3 show larger

2

values despite

the larger standard errors.

31. As in the results based on quarterly data, the estimated
values indicate an unstable polynomial for credit (though not
Ml) with a reserves instrument, and for both credit and Ml

with a federal funds rate instrument.
