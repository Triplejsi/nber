Identification in Tax-Price Regression Models:
The Case of Charitable Giving
Abstract

Recent cross-section studies of the demand for charitable g~v~ng, owner
occupied housing, capital gains realizations, and the supply of labor hours have
been careful to use prices net of income tax levies. The use of after-tax
prices in a behavioral equation is a direct consequence of utility maximization
under a budget constraint and cannot be objected to. Nevertheless, when most or
all of the variance in prices comes from differences in marginal tax rates,
questions can arise about the identification of structural parameters. The
variables which deterMine marginal tax rates, chiefly income and marital status,
are quite plausible determinants of the behavior being modelled, in addition to
any indirect effect they might have through the tax price. A non-linear dependence amonti the explanatory variables of a linear regression is not a source of
bias provided the linear specification is known to be correct. Because the
function form of a demand equation is not known a priori, this identification
through funct'ional form is not persuasive. In this note we propose an instrumental variable estimation designed to exploit any independent variation present, and which allows unbiased estimates of tax-price elasticities under quite
general conditions. The estimator is applied to the demand for charitable
giving. The tax-price elasticity of the demand for charitable giving is estimated to be -1.23.

The use of after-tax prices and wages in behavioral equations is a

direct consequence of utility maximization under a budget constraint and cannot
be objected to. 5 Nevertheless, when most or all of the variance in prices
across observations comes from differences in marginal tax rates, questions can
arise about the identification of structural parameters in the model.

It is not

the partial equilibrium nature of these regressions -- inevitable after all with
cross section data -- but the functional dependence among the explanator,y variables which causes the greatest discomfort.

The variables which determine

marginal tax rates, chiefly income and marital status, are quite plausible
determinants of the behavior being modelled, in addition to any indirect effect
they might have through the tax-price.

A non-linear dependence among the right-

hand side variables of a linear regression is not a source of bias provided the
linear specification is known to be the correct one.

Because the functional

form of a demand equation cannot be known a priori this identification through
functional form cannot be persuasive.
In particular, there will not

be aQY theoretical basis for

excluding polymonial and interaction terms in the included variables.

As more

of the plausible explanator,y variables are included, the tax price will approach
perfect colinearity with the remaining variables, yet if many are excluded, the
possibility that the tax price is

nator,y variable increases.

exploit sources of independent variation, which allows unbiased estimation of

That is, taxes are the sole source of variance in the

The deduction is also a non-trivial policy issue.

In 1977 1.4% of gross

income was deducted for this reason, about as much as the capital gains deduction.
Since theory is not likely to govern the selection of

functiona~

forlli, the

situation is hopeless unless some independent variation among the right hand
side variables can be found and exploited. 7

Such variance is normally present in

tax-price regressions, and it arises from the complexity of the tax code.
Special provisions, including income averaging, the maximum tax on earned
income, the minimum tax on preferences, other deductions, disability income
exclusions, etc. all contribute to an apparently substantial departure of the
tax-price from perfect dependence on the included right hand side variable.
Nevertheless, these special provisions all relate to personal characteristics
some of which may have a direct effect on the desire or ability to give to
charity.
We use the variation in tax law across the states as a source of variance
in the tax-price which is independent of personal characteristics, and therefore
not subject to the criticism outlined above.

'Ihe approach is made possible by

the recent (1981) release of individual level tax return files with state identifiers for most taxpayers,8 and Qy a program created by the National Bureau of
Economic Research for calculating state tax liabilities from individual data.
We do not merely replace tax prices based upon federal tax rates with a better
number based on federal and state rates.

The more comprehensive tax rate might

still be correlated with variables improperly excluded from the equation.

-3Therefore, we propose a new approach using instrumental variables.

A suitable

instrument must be correlated with the tax price but uncorrelated with any personal characteristics of the taxpayers.

One

possible instrument would be the

subsiqy rate in the taxpayer's state of residence evaluated at some fixed level
of income and deductions.

The instrument used in Section V depends upon the

full distribution of income in the Tax Model sample.
The correctness of our instrument depends on two assumptions:

first, that

state tax laws are inaependent of personal characteristics, and second, that
taxpayers react

siroilar~

to state and federal taxes.

The practicality of such

an estimator depends upon the partial correlation between the instrument and the
after-tax price.

in proportion to the inverse of the square root of that correlation.

Because the charitable giving

is therefore at least a partial determinant of the

tax rate, the observed tax price is endogenous.

This problem is first

recognized by Feldstein and Taylor (1976) who substituted a so called "first
dollar tax rate", i.e. the tax rate that would have been obtained if the taxpayer had no deductions for charitable giving.

Disposable income is subJect to

The price coefficient of -1.28 implies that each dollar of lost revenue
stimulates more than a dollar of charitable giving, i.e. that it is in SOllie
sense "efficient" to allow a deduction for giving.

The low income coefficient

implies that giving is an inferior good.
Because giving is observed only for itemizers, taxpayers who take the standard deduction are typically excluded from the regression.

Since charitable

giving influences the decision to itemize, this rule induces some sample selection bias.

Clotfelter (1980) suggests including only those taxpayers who would

itemize for any level of giving.

Notice that the instrument is not the average price of giving in each
state.

That depends upon the distribution of income in each state as well as

the state law.

Since states are known to have different levels of income (and

therefore quite different average federal tax rates) this would not be independent of the other explanatory variable.

Of course, if states vary in income, it

is possible that they vary systematically in their residents' taste for charitable giving.

Examination of this possibility is beyond the scope of this

paper, but it should be noted that this limited independence assuwption is also
inherent in the traditional OLS tax-price regression.

State Income Taxes
Out of 51 states (including the District of Columbia), a total of 46 levied

some form of personal income tax in 1977.

Only Nebraska's simple excise tax on

federal liabilities was completely dependent upon the federal definitions of
income and deductions.

The remaining 45 states all exercised at least nominal

independence from the federal definition of taxable income, and of course the
bracket rates are quite independent of any coordination.

A number of long con-

sidered changes in the federal law are alreaqy in place in some state tax codes,
including inflation indexing, optional separate filing for married couples,
vanishing exemptions, full taxation (or complete exemption) of realized
gains, and complete elimination of personal deductions.

federal liability on state taxes is included where relevant.

In Minnesota, for

example, federal taxes are deductible from state taxable income, this results in
a surprising decrease in tax rates at higher incomes.

Because the IV estimator

uses for variance across states rather than across income classes, the variety
of subsidy rates is gratifying.

Eight states have rates above 10% for at least

some taxpayers, while 18 have zero rates for all residents.
With the partial exception of Feldstein and Taylor (1976) previous studies
have neglected the role of state taxes in charitable giving.
the price of giving and disposable income are affected.

Notice that both

Feldstein and Taylor

considered only the first; furthermore, the calculation of the marginal rate was
crude by comparison with the detailed iraplementat'ion of the federal law.

The

effect of either omission on the estimated coefficients is ambiguous because the
correlation between state and federal tax rates (which would bias the coefficients away from zero) might overwhelm the pure errors-in-variable tendency to
depress coefficients.
As part of NBER's general program in state and local taxation we have pre-

pared Fortran programs for calculating state tax liabilities from federal Form
1040 data, as available to us.

In spite of the diversity of state laws, the

information on the 1040 is sufficient to model the state laws quite closely.
While the tax treatment of individual items may vary across states, in most
cases the definitions are those of the federal law.

'PresUmab~

this stems more

from a desire to lean on IRS auditing and document matching than on a universal
belief in the correctness of those definitions.

In any case, most deviations

from the federal definitions occur in calculated quantities rather than the
basic data.

For example, state income taxes are deductible on the federal

- 13 -

return but not on most

state tax returns.

Nevertheless the state income tax

deduction is a separate line on the 1040 and this makes possible an accurate
calculation of the state itemized deductions.

The major exception to this rule

is the treatment of interest on government debt.

Interest on state and local

debt is not taxed by the federal government and is not shown on the 1040.
Treasury debt is not taxed by the states, but neither is it broken out on the
federal return.

Since

essential~

nothing is known about the distribution of

holdings of these debts no attempt was made to adjust for this discrepancy.
Deductions and credits for local property taxes are a feature of many state

Aside from the problems mentioned above, these figures match those from TAXSIM.
The reciprocal deductibility of state and federal taxes on federal and
state tax returns does not create true simultaneity because the federal deduction is based on taxes paid rather than tax liability incurred.

Nevertheless it

seemed natural to include the effect on future tax liabilities in the current
price of giving.

Results
Our basic dataset is a one in ten subsample of the 1977 file. The original

file is censored to maintain the confidentiality of possibly recognizable
returns and excludes taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $200,000.
The regression sample is further restricted by the exclusion of taxpayers whose
non-charitable deductions are less than the standard deduction, and b,y the elimination of a handful of

taxp~ers

with non-positive disposable income.

An OLS regression on the new dataset using the conventional specification
previously dominant in the literature yields the estimated equation:

In(G+10)

These price elasticities are substantially less than those reported by
Feldstein and Taylor or Clotfelter for similar data and an identical specification.

If (1) is modified to include only federal taxes, there is a slight chan5e

in the coefficients, but this is not the source of the discreyancy.

The addi-

tion of records from the National Tax Model with adJusted gross income exceedinb
$200,000 (without state tax rates) has similarly little effect on the point
estimates.

It does, however, improve the fit and standard errors to figures

close to those .reported before.
It is not possible to defeat the price effect by the simple addition of
interaction terms and squares (of the continuous variables).

That exercise

yields the equation:

which implies a price elasticity of -1.15 (significant at the 5% level).

Adding

a proxy for wealth (25 times dividend income plus 12 times interest income) to
equation (1) does have a dramatic effect, however:

Although price remains significant the point estimate is now much smaller than
aQY reported since Taussig.

tax rates shown in Table 2, is given in equation (5).

The expected loss of efficiency has more than tripled the standard error on
the price coefficient, however the resulting point estimate is significantly
different from zero and not significantly different from one.

The IV estimates

therefore provide rough confirmation of the importance of the tax-price in
determining charitable giving.
The wealth proxy almost eliminates the price coefficient in the 018

Life-cycle considerations suggest that the wealth

arbitrarily excluded so equation (4) casts some doubt on the importance of
income tax deductability on charitable giving.

The IV estimate shows that this

impotence is an artifact of the correlation between the wealth proxy and the
tax-price.

Conclusion
Our estimate of 1.23 (for equation (7Â»

as the price elasticity of chari-

table giving is not significantly different from earlier estimates based on tax
return data.

Because the IV estimator is robust to

ma~

specification errors,

including the incorrect choice of functional form or the exclusion of variables
affecting tax liability, this result strengthens the belief that taxes are an
important determinant of charitable giving in the United States.
This is an expensive procedure, both in time and in statistical efficiency,
and in the absence of any evidence for bias in the traditional specification the
argument for the general adoption of this technique is weakened.

A similar issue affects the interpretation of regressions corrected for
sample selection bias through the inclusion of a predicted hazard rate
among the independent variables (Hechman 1980). The predicted hazard rate
is a function of the remaining independent variables, and its effectiveness
as a correction for sample selection bias is based on the a priori assumption that nonlinear terJllS in the independent variable could safe~ have
been excluded from the uncensored model.

7.

The remedy is not simply to adopt a more general functional form. The tax
price coefficient may be robbed of its significance if a sufficiently
general functional form is chosen including all relevant variables, but
such an exercise does not begin to answer the question of which variables
belong in the equation and which are mere~ colinear with them.

The stratification overrepresents small states and large incomes to achieve
this end economically. Essential~ everything on the Form 1040 (the basic
tax form) is included, together with a few iteQ5 from each of several supporting schedules. Sample size has ranged from 140,000 to 160,000 returns.

Tax return data are as poor in demographic information as they are rich in
income information. The number of dependent children, marital status, and
the number of taxpayers (one or two) who are 65 years of age or older are
the on~ items available. Age, race and sex are available in a special

To be strictly correct these first dollar rates should have been used as
instruments Â·for the endogenous rates rather than as substitutes. If, as
might be expected, the first dollar rates have less variance than the
actual rate, then the tax price coefficient is biased up.
