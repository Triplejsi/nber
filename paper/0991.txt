Oil Prices, Welfare and the Trade Balance:
Art Intertenporal Approach

ABSTRACT

The paper examines welfare effects and the
trade balance response
to changes in the world oil prices and interest
rates for a small

oil—importing economy. The trade balance is mainly
seen as the
difference between
Saving and investment, and these are derived
from intertemporal optimization
It is shown that the welfare effects
consist of static terms of

trade effects, intertenporal terms of

trade effects, and employment effects. The trade

for temporary oil

balance deteriorates

price increases, whereas its response is ambiguous

for permanent oil

price increases. For a fall in the world interest
rate, the trade balance
deteriorates, if the economy is a net borrower.

Svensson and Razjn 119821 have

developed a two—period maw—goods model of

a

small open econow, for the purpose of examining the classic Harberger—Lau5_
)Ietzler terms of trade effect on aggregate spending and
saving. They can resolve
previous controversies on the determinants of the effect,
precisely because they
develop a model where expenditure and saving are the outcome of intertemporal
optimi-

zation.

Their model also gives rise to a theory of the current
account that explicitly takes the intertemporal aspects into account, and they derive
the effects on
on the current account of
temporary, per1nent, and expected future changes in world
prices, assuming perfect international capital
mobility and a given world rate of

interest. The discussion

is, however, limited to the case with fixed (full employ-

ment) output vectors and no investment, except for a brief
discussion of consequences of static and intertemporal
substitution in production.

With flexible wages and full employment, the effect on welfare of chan5es in

oil prices and the interest rate is independent of the possibilities to substitute
oil for capital or labor in production. The welfare effects can be simply expressed
as a sum of static oil terms of trade effects and an intertemporaj. interest rate
terms of trade effect. With rigid wages and less than full employment, welfare is in
addition affected by enrplment changes, which do depend on the degree of substituta-

bility of oil in production.
With flexible wages and full emplwment we can show that:

(i)

A (present) ttporary oil price increase (at a constant rate of

interest) unambiguously deteriorates6 the (present) trade balance through a decrease
in saving, whereas investment is unaffected.

order to create a deficit in the trade balance vis—a—yis OPEC for the non—OPEC world,
it may be necessary for the world rate of interest to fall.8 Thus we get a possible
theoretical explanation of the alleged fall in world rates of interest during the
1910s after the 1973-i4 oil price rise.
We also show that there is a corçlete analor between the effects on welfare
and the trade balance of (i) exogenous oil price increases at full employ-ment, (ii)
exogenous decreases in employment at constant oil prices, and (iii) exogenous
decreases in productivity at constant oil prices and full employment.9

The paper is organized as follows: Section II specifies the equilibrium of
the small country and defines the trade balance. In Section III the effects on
welfare and the trade balance of changes in oil prices and the interest rate are

derived under the assumption that there is full employment. A graphical illustration
of these effects is provided in Section IV. Rigid wages and changes in employment
are discussed in Section V. Section VI mentions some extensions, draws some general

conclusions, discusses some li.tations of the analysis, and suggests some areas for
future research.

2 in terms of final goods. The (final—goods) discount factor (equal to one over one

the real rate of interest) is denoted by 6.

The country produces final goods, using oil as an imported intermediate

Having defined an equilibrium and the trade balance, we shall go on to

discuss changes in the trade balance. In interpreting the various effects on the
trade balance, we will find it helpful to look at it mainly as the difference between
saving and investment.

Increases in oil prices and the discount factor

In the introduction, we mentioned that there is enirical evidence of a fa.l

in world rates of interest during the 1970s after the oil price increase in 1973—1.
We shall now examine the effect on the trade balance of our small econontr of a

combination of oil price increases and a decrease in
the rate of interest. As a first
step we derive the effects of these changes

on national welfare, assuming constant

(full eloyment) labor input. Differentiating the budget constraint Cl),

Equivalently, the wealth effect on the trade balance is pDsitive. What about

investment? If we assume that oil and

capital are cooperative inputs in the sense of

having positive cross partials in the production function, investment falls when oil

prices increase. This can be understood the

following way: An oil price increase

always decreases oil input (the own substitution effect is always negative). If

and oil are cooperative, this decreases the narginal product of capital,
which causes a decrease in investment.21 Hence, since savings increases and investment falls, the trade balance clearly improves.

the above follows that a permanent oil price increase, when both
and future oil prices increase, (i.e. dq1, dq2 > 0 and do =

(3) From

general to an ambiguous change in the trade balance. Investment falls unambiguously,

but the net effect on savings is ambiguous. Itwever, if

the

change in savings is

small, the trade balance will be dominated by the investment effect, and the trade
balance will improve. This somewhat paradoxical result has been emphasized by Sachs
[1981]. Precise conditions under which this occurs can be derived as follows:

Assume that the oil price increase is the same in both periods

if the marginal propensities to consume are the same at both dates, savings

Hence,

follows that the trade balance unambiguousi.y improves if the period 2 marginal

pro-

pensity to consume does not exceed that of period 1. In Svensson and Bazin [1982] it

is

shown that this condition for the marginal propensities to consume is associated

with a rate of time

wealth increases with the increase in the discount factor.

Then
Put dif-

ferently, the

country gains from the fall in interest, since it is a borrower.

Consequently,

present consumption increases, and since present domestic product is

constant, saving falls. Investment increases with the increase in the discount factor.

(The present value of the marginal product of capital increases, which

increases investment.)25 It follows that the trade balance unambiguously
deteriorates.

The results under (3) and (4) above to some extent support Sachs 119811

towards the origin, since future domestic product is a concave function of the

investment level. The interteqoral budget line has a slope equal to the inverse of
the discount factor. One indifference curve of the utility function is shown. The

consider the effects of a temporary oil price increase, i.e.

We have Cf1 = — z1dq1 C 0, i.e. present domestic product decreases with the

intertenoral transfornation curve ST to the left to S'T' as in Figure II. The net
domestic product point shifts horizontally to F, with unchanged investment level.
The spending point shifts southwest to F', along the wealth expansion curve through

A'. If the marginal propensity to consume is positive at both dates (consumption is
normal at both dates), this curve has a positive slope. Saving shifts from the

—13—

horizontal

distance between A' and T to that between F' and T'. Since T has
moved to
the left but A' to southwest, it is clear that saving falls.
The present trade

consider the additional effects of a future oil price increase, i.e.

We have d12 =

12q(1, q2 11)dq2 = —z2(l,

q2, 11)dq2 C 0

,

for

each

level of investhent, where 12(1, q2, Ii) denotes future oil inort, which is
an
increasing function of investhent, since

oil and investment are assumed to be

cooperative. That is, the

transfortjon curve shifts vertically down with the static future terms of trade effect, the shift being larger with
increasing investment,
from S'T' to SPtTT?.

At a constant level of investment, the net domestic product point
shifts from F to G. However, the oil price increase has decreased the (marginal)

Profitability

of investment. This appears in the diagram as the transforwation
curve

being less steep at G than at F.

Hence, the equilibrj level of investment

decreases, and the net domestic product point shifts to H. The consumption
point
shifts

to H'. Saving shifts from (the negative of) the horizontal distance between
T' and F' to that between T" and H', and thus increases. The
present trade balance
is now given by the horizontal distance between H' and H. Clearly,
the additional

effect of a future oil price increase has unambiguously improved the trade
balance,
from the horizontal distance between F' and F to that between H' and H.
However,
the 2ermanent oil price increase, has shifted the

trade balance from the horizontal

distance between A' and A to that between H' and H. The net change in the
trade
balance depends on the relative

slopes of the straight lines througii HA and H'A',
respectively and is in general ambiguous.

The special

case of

a permanent oil price increase discussed above, when the

static terms of trade effects on the trade balance cancel and only

the

investment

effect matters, is when the two straight lines GA and WA' both have a
slope equal to
unity. Clearly, the same result occurs whenever the two lines have the

same slope. We

also see that then the investment

substitution effect from G to H unabiguousj.y im

proves the present trade balance.

Finally, consider the additional effect of an increase in the discount
factor, i.e. do > 0.

This decreases the slope of the intertporal budget line. The

level of investment increases, the net

domestic product point shifts from H to J, and

the consumption point shifts to J', the shift consistthg of the wealth effect from H'

J" (resulting from an intertemporal term of trade improvement) and the substitution effect from J" to J'. Saving falls and the trade balance unambiguously
to

deteriorates.
Since welfare increases monotonically along the income expansion curve

through H' and A', it is clear that the diagram also illustrates the welfare effects
of

the changes in oil prices and the discount factor.

maximizing employment level is given by the condition that the demand price for

is equal to the given wage. For each date we consequently
get the employment functions Lt(qt, kt, wt) defined
qt kt, Lt(qt, kt, wt))

an increase in the present oil price.

The effect on future employment is more conçaicated, since the employment

level and the investment level are sinzltaneously determined. First, we realize that

if there is constant returns to scale, in the sense that future domestic product is
linearly hongenous in (k2, £2), an arbitrarily given real future wage is in
equilibri incompatible with the given discount factor. The latter implies a given
future rate of return to capital which with constant returns to scale fixes the
future wage rate (for a given future oil price). Let us avoid this problem by
assuming that the future domestic product function is strictly concave in (k2, ),
which excludes the constant returns to scale case.
Next, the changes in present and future employntnt from an oil price
increase will be given by

Similarly, for an increase in the discount fact, it can be shown that both

the full employment case. To isolate these separate effects,

us make a digression where we regard the employment changes as exogenous. We

follows that a pxanent decrease in employment has an ambiguous effect on the

trade balance.

—17—

At this stage we realize that the effects on welfare and the trade balance
of exogenous decreases in employment are completely analogous to the effects of oil

price increases. It follows that the effects of exogenous decreases in employment
can be graphically illustrated in Figure II, in exactly the same way as we demonstrated the effects of oil price increases.
We also realize that as loris as we regard the employment levels

and

£2

as exogenous, we may as well interprete them as parameters representing productivity levels, say. Hence, we have implicitly derived the effects on welfare and the
trade balance of exogenous changes in productivity, and indeed shown the analor bet-

ween oil price increases and productivity decreases. This analor has recently been
emphasized in Bruno

11981]. Fornally, the analor between oil price increases,

decreases, and decreases in productivity, arises simply because they all
appear as parameter changes affecting the domestic product functions in the same way
employment

and

hence cause similar negative supply shocks.

After

this digression, we return to regarding the employment changes as

endogenous, given by (11) and (12)

because

of rigid wages. Since an oil price

increase leads to a decrease in employment at the same date, and we have seen that
the effect of a decrease in employment is the sane as the effect of an oil price

increase, we can directly conclude that the existence of rigid wages and the
resulting changes in employment will simply reinforce all the sepirate effects of oil
price increases that we derived in Section III. Thus, combining (6) and 14), for

instance the effect of a

Let

us finally r_ark on the reasonable case when there is real wage

dity in the present (the short run) but flexible wages and full

enloyment

rigi-

in the

(the long run). This case is also consistent with constant returns to scale
in capital and labor in the future, for which case future real wages will be deterfuture

mine by future oil prices and the discount factor. We realize that the
asymmetry
caused by a decrease in eloyment only in the present will tend to deteriorate the

trade

balance. In particular, the previous result in the full eiloyment case, that a permanent oil price increase y under some circumstances inçrove the trade balance, is
then further qualified.
In the full employment case, we also noted that welfare effects are indepen—

dent of the d%ree of substitution in production between oil, capital, and labor. We
realize that with rigid wa€es this is no longer so, since the maitude of the
enloyment

effects depends on the degree of substitutability between oil and

and labor. Hence, with rigid

wages

and

capital

variable employment, the degree of substi—

tuion in production does indeed directly influence welfare.

VI. Extensions, conclusions, and limitations of the analysis

Let us
assumed that

first mention some extensions of the above analysis. So far, we have

oil is

used exclusively as an intermediate input in production. If

—19—

some oil is also consumed directly by consumer,3' the static teruis of trade
effects
on welfare are larger in magnitude, since oil import is larger. This

itself

should reinforce the effects on the trade balance derived in the
case when oil is not
consumed, in the same way

as

do changes in employment when there are ri6id wages, as
we noted in section V. However, it can be shown32 that additional
substitution

effects on consumption enter, making

overall effects on the trade balance ainbi—
guous, except for a pure increase in the discount factor. The ambiguity arises

because oil price increases induce substitution in consumption of final goods for
oil, when oil and final goods are substitutes. This substitution effect is opposite

to the

consumption wealth effect.

is natural to nasure the trade balance in tern of final goods, when oil
is used as an input in production only. However, when both oil and final
It

goods are

consumed, it is less obvious in what units the trade balance shall be measured. One
solution is to deflate the trade balance by an exact consumer price index, hence

constnict a 'real' trade balance. This

can be done by asstzaing that preferences are

weakly homothetically separable over time, as in Svensson and Eazin 119821. Then it
can

be shown33

that the real trade balance is affected by what can be called real

ternE of trade effects and changes in the

real discount factor, the latter being the

present value of the future consumer price index

deflated by the present consumer

index. In particular, a temporary oil price increase then also changes the
real discount factor tbrcigh changes in the present consumer price index, which can

shown to give rise to ambiguity in the trade balance response.
The analysis can be extended to an arbitrary number of goods along the lines

—20—
Let us also make some general comments

on the above analysis. It involves,

as do several other recent works, a microeconomic
behavioural functions explicitly derived

approach, in the sense of using

from optimizing behavicxir, to

proble that

mst2y been attacked with the usual macroeconomic tools. The present analysis
hopes to help to demonstrate the fruitfulness and power of such an approach. The

method of using 'dual' functions, expenditure
and domestic product functions,
although formally equivalent to using 'primal'

substitution effects.

analysis in terms of various price indices.
l'bre

fundamentally, the above analysis attexts to contributed to
demonstrate, also with several other recent works, the fruitfulness and, may be, even

the necessity, to look at the determinants of the trade balance and the current
account in an explicitly intertemporal setting.
Although many of our results may not be new, our method of deriving them has
made it

to express them in rather general, yet easily interpreted, forms.
Our results on the welfare effects on oil price and interest rate changes have highpossible

lighted the

irrelevance for the (first order) welfare effects of the degree of

substitutability in production and consumption when there are flexible wages and
full

employment, and

welfare
results

the crucialness of such substitution to the (first oFder)

effects when there are rigid wages and varying employment. Our rather
on the effects on the trade balance have made clear how incomplete and

rich

possibly misleading a static view of the trade balance is. The results emphasize the
different and even opposite impacts of temporary, future, and permanent oil price

—21—

changes.

The analysis of interest rate changes has clarified the role of the inter—

temporal terms of trade effect on

wealth, welfare, and saving in addition to the

intertemporal substitution effects on saving and investuent.
There are numerous and obvious

limitations of the analysis, some of which

for additional research. ly the most simple small open
econorn4' case has been
analyzed, the case when the country faces given prices on oil and final goods and
call

a

given world rate of interest. The case with a two country world,
consisting of a
final—goods producing Industria and an oil—producing OPEC, where the world rate of

interest is endogenous, is stucied in ?&rion and Svensson
three

[19811. The case with a

country world consisting of a home country, a foreign country, and OPEC, in

which both the rate of interest and the relative price between home and foreign
produced final goods are endogenous, is taken up in Marion and Svensson [1982aj. That
case makes possible a discussion of how structural difference between industrial
countries explain differences in their responses to oil
price increases.

the present paper, there is no government and no policy, there is perfect
international mobility of capital, and monetary factors are coxletely abstracted
In

from.

One of ny policies that is of obvious relevance is the restriction of inter-

national capital movements.
The present analysis abstracts from the allocation between
traded and non—
traded

goods. The determinants of the current account when there are non—traded
goods are treated in an intertemporal setting by Razin [l980J, and, when there is
import of oil, by Marion [l9ol] and Bruno 11982].

The response to oil price increase depends crucially on whether there is
home production of oil or not. A net exporter of oil will benefit from positive static term of trade effects. The investment response to a future oil price increase

could very well be overall positive, since the profitability of investment in the oil

—22—

production

industry will increase. The present analysis uses the simplifying, but

not unrealistic, assumptions that capital, labor and oil are all cooperative.
Implications of other assumptions can easily be examined.

The effects on emplwment of oil price changes have been examined in a very
rudimentary way, and there is obvious scope for analysis of various wage indexation

schemes and other labor market specifications. Neither have direct welfare effects
of emplrment changes been dealt with.
The

restriction to only two

periods nay appear severe, but has nevertheless

clear that as lon6 as the only intertenporal distinctions we need are binary, for instance between the 'present' and the
'future', or the 'short run' and the 'long run', two periods are indeed all that is
made possible rather rich results. It is

required and with suitable interpretations we can get an almost surprisin5 richness
of results. For other problems, finer intertemporal distinctions nay be needed, for

expected and present unexpected price changes. Or suppose we want to

examine the consequences of the possibility that the observed fall in the world rate

of

interest during the 1970s is not permanent but temporary. Then we

1. Sachs L19811 provides an excellent discussion of these events, both theoretical
and

empirical, together with data on many countries' current accounts and on world

interest rates.
2. An intel-temporal view of foreign trade and different stages in the balance of payments was very fashionable in the Trade and Development literature of the 1960s, as
for instance in Bardhan [1966] and Bruno 119611, see also Bazdarich L19181.

An

excellent early reference, which contains a synthesis between static international
trade theory and Fisherian capital theory, is Miller [1968]. More recently, Razin

119801, first version distributed 1918, discusses the current account in a rigorous
intertnpora1 model with non—traded goods and investment. Sachs l1982a] and Lipton

and Sacha 11980] offer a theoretical framework for discussing the current account in
a two—country growth model, with perfect international capital mobility and far-

sighted optitzlng agents. The models are too complicated to solve ana1ylitca11y

the current account in an Uzawa [19681—type continuous tint model with

intertnpora1 optimization behavior. This Ijzawa—type analysis involves several, for
the results crucial, simplifying assumptions, as shown by Svensson and Razin [1982].
Recently, McKinnon [1978, 1981] and Sachs 119811 have argued the fruit-

fulness of looking at the current account as the difference between saving and
investment, rather than as a time—independent difference between exports and
imports. Sachs 11981] also develops a two—period model of the current account and

provides an excellent discussion of its response to tanporary and permanent oil price

increases with results similar to those of Svensson and Bazin [1981] and the present
paper. See also Bruno 11982] and Sachs 11982b1

Dixit [1981] presents a very neat intertemporal general equilibrium model of

trade in goods, capital, and oil. He does not consider trade balance issues but concentrates
countries

on problems of income distribution and strategic behaviour between

with different endowments.

Taking monetary factors into accowit as in Helpman [1981], Persson 11981]

uses an explicitly intertesçoral framework in discussing the balance or payments in
different currency areas and exchange rate regimes. See also Eelpman and Razin
[1982].

Since there is no initial foreign debt and no interest payments on foreign assets
in the first period, the current account and the trade balance in the first period
are identical. Henceforth, we shall only refer to the trade balance.

4. let us note that in our analysis an 1oil price increase' ntans 'a (rgina1)
increase in the present oil price' relative to what the present oil price otherwise
would have been, or 'a (marginal) increase in the future oil price' relative to what

—25—

the future oil price increase would otherwise have been.

It should not be interpreted to mean an increase over tiz in the sense that future oil prices are

(rginala,y) above present oil prices. That latter interpretation is however
included as a special case, if the before-change situation is one with present and

future oil prices being equal, and the change is an increase in the future oil price
with the present oil price held constant.
More precisely, for exogenously given oil pirces q1 and q2 in the two

periods, we get an equilibrium of endogennas variables (welfare, trade balance, out-

put, etc.) in the two periods. We let the vectors

5. Any established termino1oy for this kind of complementarity (technical
compleznentarity7) is unknown to me. The term 'cooperative' has been suggested by
Elhanan Helpman, according to whom it is used in Hebrew
technolor. Note that the
usual definition of

comPlementarity/substitutability is in terms of the cross par—
tials of the conditional (i.e.
constant output) input demand function. A thorough
discussion and empirical evidence
on such (Hicksian) complementarity and substitutability between captial, labor,

enerr and materials inputs is in Berndt and Wood

119791. They discuss separable production functions of the fonu, for
instance,
