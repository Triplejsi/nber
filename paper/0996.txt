Arbitrage, Factor Structure, and Mean—Variance
Analysis on Large Asset Markets

ABSTRACT

We examine the implications of arbitrage in a market with many assets.

The absence of arbitrage opportunities implies that the linear functionals
that give the mean and cost of a portfolio are continuous; hence there exist

unique portfolios that represent these functionals. These portfolios span the
mean—variance efficient set. We resolve the question of when a market with
many assets permits so much diversification that risk—free investment
opportunities are available.

Ross [12, 14] showed that if there is a factor structure, then the mean

returns are approximately linear functions of factor loadings. We define an
approximate factor structure and show that this weaker restriction is

sufficient for Ross' result. If the covariance matrix of the asset returns
has only K unbounded eigenvalues, then there is an approximate factor struc-

ture and it is unique. The corresponding K eigenvectors converge and play
the role of factor loadings. Hence only a principal component analysis is
needed in empirical work.

1. INTRODUCTION

Two

of

the most significant developments in finance have been the

formulation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the working out
of the implications of arbitrage beginning with the Modigliani—Miller

Theorem and culminating in the theory of option pricing. While the principle
that competitive markets do not permit profitable arbitrage opportunities
to remain unexploited seems unexceptionable, the same cannot be said for

the crucial assumptions of the CAPM. Few believe that asset returns are
well described by their first two moments or that some well—defined set of
marketable assets contains most of the investment opportunities available

to individual investors. Casual observation is sufficient to refute one of
the main implications of the CAPM ——

that everyone

holds the market

portfolio. Nonetheless, the CAPM seems to do a good job of explaining
relationships among

asset

prices. Ross [12,14] has argued that the apparent

empirical success of the CAPM

is

due to three assumptions which are more

plausible than the assumptions needed to derive the CAPM.

These

assumptions

are first, that there are many assets; second, that the market permits no
arbitrage opportunities; and third, that asset returns have a factor struc-

ture with a small number of factors.2 Ross presents a heuristic argument
which suggests that on a market with an infinite number of assets, there
are sufficiently many riskiess portfolios that prices of assets are determined by an arbitrage requirement ——

riskless

portfolios which require no

net investment should not have a positive return. Asset prices are linear

2

functions of factor loadings. Although Ross' heuristics cannot be made
rigorous, he does prove that lack of arbitrage implies that asset prices
are approximately linear functions of factor loadings, and Chamberlain [3]
and Connor [4] have given conditions under which the conclusions of Ross'

heuristic argument are precisely true.3 Nonetheless, all of Ross' investigations of the implications of the absence of arbitrage opportunities take

place in the context of a factor structure. Furthermore, Ross' definition
of a factor structure Is sufficiently stringent that it is unlikely that any
large asset market has, by his definition, a usefully small number of factors.

This paper has two purposes: The first is to examine the implications
of the absence of arbitrage opportunities on a market with many assets

which does not necessarily have a factor structure. We show in Sections 2
and 3 that an asset market with countably many assets has a natural Hubert
space structure which makes it easy to examine the implications of the no

arbitrage condition. Our second goal is to define an proximate factor
structure —— a concept which is weaker than the standard strict factor
structure which Ross uses. We show in Sections 4 and 5 that this is an

appropriate concept for investigating the relationship between factor loadings
and asset prices.

In Section 2 we introduce our model of the asset market. We consider a

market on which a countable number of assets are traded. As is customary in
investigations of this sort, we take a given price system and ask if it could

possibly be an equilibrium price system. Since prices are fixed we normalize
by assuming each asset costs one dollar. For a dollar an investor may purchase a random return with a specified distribution.

3

The assets on the market may be arranged in a sequence. The first
two moments of the joint distribution of returns of the first N assets are

a mean vector

and a covariance matrix

In the paper we often look at

what happens to various objects (such as the mean—variance efficiency frontier

or the eigenvalues of 1N as N increases to infinity. Such limits have
meaning, in part, because our model of the asset market may be embedded in

a Hubert space. In Section 2 we list some of the basic facts about Hilbert
space which we use.
Section 3 defines the absence of arbitrage opportunities and explores

the implications of the definition. Our definition, essentially the same
as Ross', is that it should not be possible to form a portfolio which is

riskiess, costless, and earns a pOsitive return. If prevailing prices permit
such a portfolio to be formed, investors, at least those whose preferences

satisfy some weak conditions, will want to buy arbitrarily large anounts of
that portfolio; consequently the prevailing prices cannot be equilibrium
rri

-

There is a close link between the absence of arbitrage opportunities and
mean—variance analysis. If the asset market permits arbitrage opportunities
then investors do not have to choose between mean and variance. They can
for a given price acquire portfolios which have arbitrarily high expected

returns and arbitrarily low variances. If market prices do not permit
arbitrage, investors must choose between mean and variance. An object of
considerable interest on an asset market without arbitrage opportunities is

the mean—variance efficient set. This is the set of all portfolios for which

4

variance is at a minimum subject to constraints on cost and expected return.
One of the reasons the mean—variance efficient set is of such interest is
that Roll [10] and Ross [13] have shown that the CAPM is equivalent to the

statement that the market portfolio is mean—variance efficient. We show
that on a market with an infinite number of assets the mean—variance efficient
set is the same kind of object as on a market with a finite number of assets.
In each case the mean—variance efficient set is contained in a particular
two—dimensional subspace.4
For portfolios of a given cost which are efficient, there is a linear

tradeoff between mean and standard deviation. We call the slope of this
tradeoff 6. The constant 6 will play an important role in our analysis of
factor structure; 6 is also the distance, in a certain norm, between the
vector of mean returns from each asset and a vector of ones.

Our model of the asset market assumes that all of the assets on the

market are risky. We investigate the question of whether investors, by
allocating their purchases among many assets, can create a portfolio that

is riskiess, costs a dollar, and has a positive return. If the answer to this
question is yes, then we say there is a riskless asset. it is commonly
believed that if all assets are affected by the same random event, the
market will not allow investors to diversify risks so effectively that they

can create a riskless portfolio with a positive return. Our necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of a riskless asset sharpens this

intution. A riskless asset will exist unless the sequence of covariance
matrices has the same structure as it would have if there were a random
event which affected the returns of all assets in precisely the same way.

5

If there is a riskless asset, then the mean—variance efficiency frontier
must be a straight line in mean—standard deviation space -— not the curve
that is usually drawn.
Sections 4 and 5 explore the relationship between factor structure

and asset pricing. We say the asset market has a strict K—factor structure
if the return on the i- asset is generated by

(1.1)

x. =

p. + .1f1 + ... + 1KK +

where p. is the mean return on asset i and the factors k are uncorrelated
with the idiosyncratic disturbances

which are in turn uncorrelated with

each other. An implication of (1.1) is that the covariance matrix may be
decomposed into a matrix of rank K and a diagonal matrix. That is, for any
N,

\•1
'1 2'

where

NNNB' + DN'

Z —

B

is the N X K matrix of factor loadings and

is a diagonal matrix.

Ross proved that if (1.1) holds, then asset means are approximately linear

functions of factor loadings. If there is one factor (K = 1) and a riskless
asset with a return of p, then Ross's conclusion may be stated as

which is almost indistinguishable from the CAPM pricing equation.5 In Section
4 we extend this result by showing that the same conclusion holds if there

is a sequence il' ••

iK i=l

such that for any N,

6

(1.3)

where the 1, j element of the N X K matrix N is

and {R.} is a sequence

of matrices with uniformly bounded eigenvalues.

If condition (1.3) is satisfied, then we say that the market has an

approximate K-factor structure. In Section 5 we characterize approximate
factor structures. The idea which decompositions like (1.1) and (1.2) are
meant to convey is that for all practical purposes the stochastic structure
of asset returns is determined by a small number (in this case K) of things;

everything else is inessential and may be ignored. Our characterization

captures this notion. Since the rank of BNB in (1.3) is no more than K,

the K+lSt elgenvalue N is smaller than the largest eigenvalue Of RN

and is thus bounded. An asset market has an approximate K—factor structure
if and only if exactly K of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices EN
increase without bound and all other eigenvalues are bounded.6

The concept of approximate factor structure is useful for exploring the

theoretical relationship between asset prices and factor loadings. It
should also prove to be a useful tool for examining this relationship

empirically. If there is an approximate factor structure, then mean returns
are approximately linear functions of the s's. The approximation error
(that is, the sum of squared deviations) is bounded by the product of the
constant

and the K+lSt largest eigenvalue of

The eigenvectors corres-

ponding to the exploding eigenvalues converge to factor loadings (in the

sense that one can use the elgenvectors to approximate the matrix BNB of
(1.3) arbitrarily well). Furthermore, the approximate factor structure is

7

unique in the following sense: Suppose that there is a nested sequence of
N X K matrices {GN} such that7

and the elgenvalues of WN are uniformly bounded. Then GNG =

NN and

=

These results suggest that extracting the elgenvectors of

is as

good a way as any of finding approximate factor structures. Thus, principal
component analysis, which is computationally and conceptually simpler than
factor analysis, is an appropriate technique for finding an approximate
factor structure.8 A common objection to principal component analysis is

the eigenvectors of EN relative to an

matrix —— one

rather than relative to some other positive—definite

which is in some

sense more natural for the problem at hand.

We show that for the problem of investigating the approximate factor

structure of an asset market this objection is groundless. Since the
approximate factor structure is unique, all positive—definite matrices
lead to the same approximate factor structure.

2. THE HILBERT SPACE SETTING
We examine a market in which there are an infinite number of assets.

'

One dollar invested in the i- asset gives a random return of x1. A portfolio
formed by investing c

in the i-- asset has a random return of Ejl a1x1;

the portfolio is represented by the vector
allowed, so cv., may be negative.

of all random variables with finite variances defined on that space. The x.

It is well—known that L2(P) is a Hubert space under the mean—square

is also a Hubert space. If pCF, then there is a sequence

with

returns are arbitrarily good approximations to p.

Let x =

3. ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES AND MEAN-VARIANCE EFFICIENCY

3. 1 Lack

of Arbitrage Opportunities

We now consider what it means for there to be no arbitrage opportun-

ities on the asset market. By defining x1

as the

return available for

dollar, we have assumed prices are determined. These prices can be
equilibrium prices if no trader would want to make an infinitely large
one

trade. We define the absence of

arbitrage opportunities in terms of

conditions which, if they failed, would make some risk—averse traders
want to take infinitely large positions.
Let

be a sequence of finite portfolios (pCF). Then we shall

say that the market permits no arbitrage opportunities if the following

11

two conditions hold:

Condition (A.i): If V(pN) + 0 and C(pN) then E(pN) -

(A.ii): If V(pN) +

E(PN)

0,

0.

0, C(p)

1, and

- a, then a > 0.

Condition (A.i) simply states that it is not possible to make an invest-

ment that is costless, riskiess, and yields a positive return. Ross [12]
has shown that if (A.i) fails, many (but not all) risk—averse traders will

ant to take infinitely large positions. A similar argument justifies
(A.ii). Suppose that (A.ii) does not hold; that is, suppose that the
market allows investors to trade aportfolio that, approximately, costs
a dollar and has a riskiess, nonpositive return. Then investors face no
budget constraints; by selling this portfolio short they can generate
arbitrarily large amounts of cash which can be used to purchase investments
or, in a complete model, for current consumption, while incurring no future

obligations. In fact, if a < 0, then investors could consume infinite
amounts both now and in the future without risk.

2 Mean- Variance

Efficiency

Roll [10) and Ross [13] have shown that the empirical content of the
capital asset pricing model is contained in the observation that the market

portfolio is on the mean—variance efficiency frontier. If arbitrage
opportunities exist on an infinite market, then there is no tradeoff
between mean and variance; there exist costless finite portfolios with

12

arbitrarily large means and arbitrarily small variances. If (A) does hold,
there is a well—defined tradeoff between mean and variance. The mean—
variance efficient set has the same structure in our infinite market as on

any finite market. In each case it lies in the subspace generated by the

(limit) portfolios that represent the linear functionals E( ) and C( ).
To prove this, we must show first that E( ) and C( ) are continuous.

C(q) = 1, then p — qC[h]

We shall see that 6 plays an important role in our treatment of factor
models.

3.3 Riskiess Asset
In

this section we shall examine the implications of the existence of

a riskless limit portfolio.

DEFINITION

1:

There is a riskiess

with V(p*) = 0 and E(p*)

limit portfolio if

there is a p*CF

0.

If (A.ii) holds, then C(p*) is well—defined and C(p*) = 0 violates (A.i).

15

Hence we can set a

p*/C(p*). We shall refer to a as a riskiess asset.

If there is an s'CF with C(s') = 1 and V(s') =
V(s—s')

0, and (A.i) implies that E(s—s')

0,

then C(s-s') =

0. So $

= a'

0,

and the riskiess

asset is unique. Let P = E(s) be the return on the riskless asset; (A.ii)
implies that P >

0.

Note that (sIP, p) = E(p) for all pCF; hence m =

1,

and C(p) =

s/P.

If p[m, c]

then setting q = s in (3.2) gives the following tradeoff

between mean and risk along the efficient frontier:

JE(p) — p1 = cSV¾(p).

(3.3)

Thus,

if there is a riskiess asset,

(i,o)

space) is a straight line rather than a curve as it

usually drawn.

We now develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence

of a riskiess asset. We also show that if there is no riskiess limit

then the covariance is a natural inner product for the space

E(p)

implies that

E(p) = Cov(m, p)/(l — E(tn))

So we can generate the mean functional from the

covariance with m. If (A) holds, we can also use covariance to generate
the cost functional:

Cov(c, p) + E(c) E(p)

Cov(c, p) + E(c)Cov(m*, p) = Cov(c*,

where
c' = c + E(c)m*.

FACTOR STRUCTURE AND ROSS' THEOREM

Strict Factor Structure

The phenomenon that a factor structure trys to capture is that the
covariance matrix EN can be approximated by a simpler, lower dimensional

structure. We shall say that there is a strict K—factor structure if the
return on the

asset is generated by

x. =

(4.1)

p. +

where the factors

f1 +

+

iK K +

are uncorrelated with the idiosyncratic disturbances

v., which in turn are uncorrelated with each other. We assume that

column space of B is well—defined, since we can form new

by taking linear combinations of the k A convenient normalization

specifies that the factors are uncorrelated with each other, with zero mean

and unit variance. Then E. may be decomposed as follows:

(4.2)

N N N + N

where

(N=l,2, ...),

is a diagonal matrix whose elements are uniformly bounded by

for all N.

Of course rank (RN B') < K.

The following theorem is due to Ross [12].

there is a riskiess asset with a return of p,

Theorem 2 is a special case of Theorem 3, whose proof is given below. The
theorem states that if there is a strict factor structure, then the absence
of arbitrage opportunities implies that the vector of mean returns is

approximately a linear function of the factor loadings. Suppose that there
is a riskiess asset. Since 1.11 is the mean return available for one dollar,

we can interpret (ti.i + ... +

as the risk premium on asset i.

Thus if there is a strict factor structure, Ross' theorem implies that an
asset's risk premium is determined by its factor loadings in a particularly

simple way. If there is but a single factor, then

P + I

which is almost the capital asset pricing formula, with factor loadings
playing the role of beta.
The assumption that a strict factor structure holds with a small

number of factors seems overly strong. Suppose, for example, that

Cov(w1, w.) = 0 if i—jl > 1. Then we must let the number of factors grow

We shall present a weaker condition that is still sufficient for Ross'
theorem to hold.

to construct the factor loadings (risk premia) from

If an approximate

factor structure does exist, we would like to know whether the decomposition

Furthermore, there is a unique sequence {BNB} that gives the approximate
factor structure, and it can be obtained from the eigenvectors of {EN}
corresponding to the K largest eigenvalues.

We show first that if there is an approximate K—factor structure, then
only K of the eigenvalues can be unbounded.

2That is, the covariance matrix of asset returns may be written as the
sum of a diagonal matrix and a matrix of short rank as in equation (1.2)
below.

3Chamberlain requires that there be a mean—variance efficient portfolio
which is so well—diversified that it contains only factor variance and no

idiosyncratic variance. Connor requires that the supply of the assets be
well—diversified.
4See [2] and [10] for the case with a finite number of assets.
5Since all assets cost a dollar, a formula which explains the mean

return of the i' asset is an asset pricing formula; it determines the
mean return per dollar spent on asset 1. If there is a riskiess asset with
rate of return P, then 1J — P is the risk premium which investors get if
they buy asset i.

6We assume also that the smallest eigenvalue of ZN is uniformly
bounded away from zero for all N.
7Let {GN} be a sequence of matrices where

has rN rows and

columns. Then {GN} is a nested sequence if the rN by CN

upper

left—hand

submatrix of N+l is G. Clearly {BN} and {EN} (of both (1.2) and (1.3))
are nested.

and Ross [11] have used factor analysis in their empirical work
on arbitrage pricing.

See, for example, [9, Chapters I and II].

10The relationship between arbitrage and the continuity of price
functionals is examined in a more general setting by Kreps [6].

See Huberman 15]

for

an alternative proof.
