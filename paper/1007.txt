The Transition from School to Work:
The Experiences of Blacks and Whites

ABSTRACT

Because much of the concern about youth unemployment is motivated
by the large differences between the rates for blacks and whites, we
have pursued our earlier work by analyzing separately for black and
white youth the relationship between high school preparation and early
labor force experience. We find no striking differences between the
determinants of weeks worked by whites and non-whites upon graduation
from high school. Although vocational training in high school bears
little relationship to weeks worked upon graduation, hours worked while
in high school bear a strong relationship to later employment for
students and non-students, white and non-white. Academic performance
as measured by standardized test scores and high school class rank is
also positivelyrelated to later weeks worked by non-students, both
white and non-white. Young persons find jobs in large part through
friends and relatives or through direct application to employers or
possibly a combination of the two. Persons who are not looking for
work--and would then be classified as out of the labor force, according
to standard definitions--are apparently quite distinct from persons
who are looking for work. Those out of the labor force seem not to
be "discouraged workers" for the most part. Controlling for other
individual attributes, non-whites are much more likely than whites to
be in a post-secondary school full-time (although without controlling
for these attributes the reverse is true). A large proportion of
young men in school are also working part-time and a significant number
are working full-time. A sizeable proportion of persons in postsecondary schools would be classified as unemployed based on official
definitions. Indeed the unemployment rate among these full-time
students is generally more than twice the rate among young men not in
school. Few high school graduates are chronically unemployed.

THE TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK:
THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACKS AND WHITES
by

Robert H. Meyer and David A. Wise

In an earlier paper (Meyer and Wise [1979]), we analyzed the rela-

tionship between high school preparation and the early labor force

experience Of youth. We were particularly interested in the effect of
vocational training in high school on wage rates and weeks worked after

high school graduation and upon entry into the labor force. Our
findings showed no relationship between job related training in high

school and post-graduation weeks worked and wage rates. We did find,
however, a strong relationship between hours worked while in high
school and both weeks worked and wage rates in the first four years

after graduation. High school class rank and test scores were also
found to be positively related to early weeks worked and wage rates in

the labor force. These findings and others led us to conclude that to
prepare persons for the labor force, programs that emphasize work expe-

rience for youth may be the most likely to succeed; "the weight of our
evidence is that it offers the best chance of enhancing future labor

market experience." We also concluded on the basis of our findings that
general academic preparation would have a greater payoff than the current
forms of high school vocational training as well.

In our earlier paper, however, we did not attempt to distinguish
the relative effects of different types of high school preparation on
the early labor force experiences of white youth from those of black

-2-

youngsters. Because much of the concern about youth unemployment is motivated by the large differences between the rates for blacks and whites,
we have been motivated to pursue our earlier work, in particular by ana•lyz-

ing separately for black and white youth the relationship between high

school preparation and early labor force experience. Specifically, we ask
whether work in high school among black youth bears a quantitative relationship to early labor force experience that is comparable to the rela-

tionship that exists among white youth. Concomitantly, we ask whether job
training in high school is unrelated to the job success of black youth, as
well as white youth.

In addition, in contrast to our earlier work, we have

estimated weeks worked equations for both students and non-students. A
major motivation for treating both is that much of unemployment is accounted
for by full-time students.

The analysis presented in this paper is subject to limitations and

advantages similar to those of our early paper. It is based on male youth
who graduated from high school. A large portion of young persons enter the
labor force immediately upon graduation from high school. Many receive no
further formal education. For these youth, as well as those who continue
their education, high school preparation is a potentially important deter-

minant of early labor force experience. Because the study is limited to
high school graduates, its implications for high school dropouts must be

indirect. Among all groups of youth, high school dropouts, and in particular
black school dropouts, have the poorest labor force experiences. Nonetheless, labor force statistics suggest a high youth unemployment rate, even

among high school graduates. And our results for high school graduates we
think have strong implications for future generations of persons like those

-3—

who now drop out, if these future generations were to remain in school.

The analysis is based on data collected by the National Center for
Educational Statistics through the National Longitudinal Study of the High

School Class of 1972. The Study collected a wide range of school, family
background, attitude and aspiration information from approximately 23,000

high school seniors in the Spring of 1972. The 1972 survey was based on a
nation—wide sample of high schools, stratified in such a way that schools

in lower socioeconomic areas were somewhat oversampled. In addition to the
base survey, the Study included three follow-up surveys in 1973, 1974, and

1976. The follow-up surveys were used to obtain information on postsecondary school and work choices as well as labor force experiences.'

Unlike most other data sources, this one allows us to follow a single cohort
in their transition from school to work.
We shall begin in Section I with a series of descriptive statistics

that are intended to describe the nature of the transition from school to
work, with a particular attempt to present data in such a way that differ-

ences that should exist between the experiences of black and white youth
would be apparent. The descriptive, statistics cover patterns of postsecondary school and work, labor force statistics, methods of job search,

distinctions between "out of the labor force" and "unemployed," and descrip-

tions of the extent of persistence of early labor force experience. These
descriptive statistics reveal findings--some of which parallel the conclusions of our earlier paper--that may be summarized as follows:

1. Non-whites are less likely than whites to be in a post-secondary

1.

-4-

school full-time (although after controlling for individual attributes the
reverse is true).

2. Among both whites and non-whites, most youth who go to school
enter in the first year after high school and attend only in consecutive
years; in and out sequences of school and work are the exception, although
not rare.

3. Young persons find jobs in large part through friends and relatives
or through direct application to employers or possibly a combination of the
two.

4. Only a small proportion of out-of-school youth were looking for
work--and thus unemployed--although the ratio was somewhat higher for non-

whites than for whites. The unemployment rates implied by this survey are
much lower than the official government unemployment rates based on the
Current Population Survey.

5. A large proportion of young men in school are also working part—time
and a significant number are working full-time.

6. A sizeable proportion of persons in school would be classified as
unemployed based on official definitions. Indeed the unemployment rate among
full-time students is generally more than twice the rate among young men not

in school. Few high school graduates are chronically unemployed.

7. Persons who are not looking for work--and would then be classified
as out of the labor force, according to standard definition--are apparently

quite distinct from persons who are looking for work. Those out of the labor
force seem not to be "discouraged workers" for the most part.

8. The hourly wage rates of white and non-white high school graduates

are very close. Among men out of school, non-whites work fewer weeks per

-5-

year than whites, but the difference declines continuously over the fouryear period following high school qraduation.

9. There is only a weak relationship between weeks worked in the first
year or two after graduation from high school and weeks worked two or three
years later, but as young persons grow older there is increasing consistency
between weeks worked in one year and weeks worked in the next.
The model that we have used to describe the relationship between high
school preparation and weeks worked upon graduation is described in Section

II. A major motivation for the procedure we have adopted is to provide
estimates that represent the experience to be expected for any individual
in the population even though in large part we observe wage rates and weeks
worked for persons who are either not in school and have chosen to work

instead or who are in school full—time. In a formal sense, we will correct
for the selection bias attendant on relating weeks worked to high school
preparation only for persons who elect not to be full-time students, or only

for those who are full-time students. As we shall see, many students also
are in the labor force, but we judged that the labor force experience of
these youth should not be considered comparable to that of persons who are
in the labor force full-time.

The results of our estimation procedure are presented in Section III.
They may be summarized briefly.

1. We find no striking differences between the determinants of weeks
worked by whites and non-whites.

2. Although vocational training in high school bears little relationship to weeks worked upon graduation, hours worked while in high school
bear a strong relationship to later employment for students and non-students,

-6-

white and non-white.

3. Academic performance as measured by standardized test scores and
high school class rank is also positively related to later weeks worked
by non-students, both white and non-white.
Concluding comments and discussion are presented in Section IV.

I. Descriptive Statistics
To facilitate exposition, we have in many instances presented in
the text simplified tabulations of more detailed information that is
contained in several appendix tables, with the relevant appendix

table cited in the text. Because for recent high school graduates both
working

and further schooling are comon post—secondary choices, we will

present data first on the schooling patterns followed by high school
graduates. We

will then present in turn information on how youth find

jobs, their labor force status as students and as non-students, distinctions between the unemployed and those out of the labor force, hourly wage
rates and annual earnings, and the relationship between weeks worked in
successive years following high school graduation.

A. School Status
The percent of white young men that attend a post—secondary school
is considerably higher than the percent of non-white males who attend.
The percent of youth in school part-time does not vary greatly by race.
The percents of high school graduates in school in October 1972 and

October 1976 are shown in Table i)
Although a lower percent of non-white youth than white youth are

in school--about 12 percentage points until 1976 when many
had completed four years of college--among youth with comparable
scholastic aptitude, high school class rank, and socioeconomic background, non-white youth are considerably more likely than white youth

here but are detailed in Meyer and Wise [1979], and Venti and Wise
[1980].

B. School Attendance Patterns
Most

youth who go to school enter in the first year after high

school and attend only in consecutive years; in and out sequences of
school and work are the exception. In Table 2 are shown the percent
of persons in school full-time in each possible number and sequence of

time periods. For example, the sequence 10101 indicates in school
full—time in October 1972, October 1974, and October 1976, but not in

school full—time in October 1973 and October 1975 (0.2 percent of white

males followed this sequence). The sequences have been grouped by year
of entry and number of interruptions.

Although there is some movement into and out of school, it is not

the norm. Of young men who qo to school at all, 70 percent of whites
and 65 percent of non-whites begin in the first year after high school

and attend only in consecutive years. Eighty-four percent of whites who
attend at all and 78 percent of non-whites attend during the year imme-

diately after high school. The table reveals,however,that non-traditional
attendance patterns,although the exception,are not rar9. For example, 14
percent of whites and 21 percent of non-whites who attend at all delay

entry by one or more years, but then attend without interruption; while
another 14 percent of whites and 15 percent of non-whites interrupt their

schooling for one or more years. The differences between whites and nonwhites mirror those shown in Table 1, although it can be seen in Table 2
that the lower percent of non—whites than whites in school is accounted
for largely by the lower percent of non-white youth that enter school
right after high school graduation.

Some explanation of the delayed entry sequences is provided in Table

1972 to the extent that an

45 percent

individual delays school attendance. While

of young men in the vocational-technical track delay entry by

one or more years, only 13 percent of the individuals in the college

track delay by one or more years. Of men who eventually go to two-year
colleges, 25 percent delay entry. In aggregate,

of men not in school in

October 1972, about 32 percent eventually attend some type of school.
To some extent the school sequence data may

understate the movement

in and out of school since they do not incorporate

changes in academic

status during the school year. Some evidence for this is provided by

who have not obtained an academic degree. About 71 percent of the first
group and 26 percent of the second group have not obtained a "four year"

college degree. Thus, a substantial number of individuals exhibit much
slower academic progress than is commonly assumed. Unobserved movements
in and out of school may contribute substantially to slow academic progress.
(Furthermore, even measured years of school may overstate actual school

attainment, defined in terms of a measure of academic progress such as accumulated credit hours.)

Furthermore, many persons who enter post-secondary schools do not
obtain a degree. As of October 1972, in addition to the large number

C. How Young Persons Find Jobs
Young persons find jobs in large part through friends and relatives
or through direct application to employers or possibly a combination of

the two. Youths who were working in October 1973 were asked which of
several possible methods they had used during 1972 and 1973 in looking

for and obtaining jobs. The alternative methods presented to the
respondents together with the percent that used each method and the

percent of those who used the method that obtained a job by that method

are shown in Table 4. The alternative methods are not mutually exclusive so a given individual could have responded in the affirmative with
respect to more than one alternative.
Close to 70 percent of all of the groups said that they made direct

application to employers and among those who did, 80 percent or more

used it successfully to find a job. About 60 percent used friends and
relatives and among those who used this method, 80 percent or so did

so successfully. Other methods were used much less often and in general
with less success.

Public and private employment agencies and school employment
serviced were used about twice as frequently by non-white men as by
white men.

Unions are a conduit to employment for only a small percent of
either;

but among those who register with a union, white young men are

considerably more likely than non-white youth to obtain a job through
a union.

Labor Force Status of Persons Not in School

Only a small proportion of young men not in school were looking

for work. The unemployment ratios implied by this survey are much
lower than the official government unemployment rates based on Current

-14-

Population Survey data)
While the percent of youth not in school rose very substantially
between October 1972 and October 1976, the percent of out-of-school youth

who were working full-time increased significantly, and the percent of
out-of-school youth who were working part-time or who were out of the labor

force fell dramatically (Table 5.) The percent of non-white men looking
for work declined substantially, while the percent of white men looking for
work increased slightly.

The percents of both white and non-white men working part-time
fell by 1976 to less than half their 1972 levels, as did the percents

out of the labor force. Although the percents of non-white youth in
these

categories were in general a bit higher than the percents of

white youth, the differences were not large, especially by 1976.2 In
October 1972, the percent of non-white youth looking for work was about
twice as high as the percent of white youth in this category, but by
1976 the percents of the two groups were quite close--5.7 percent for
whites and 6.9 percent for non-whites.

These numbers suggest a rather consistent progression from school
to work, but on average non-white youth get full-time jobs less quickly

than white youth. After four years, however, the differences between
white and non-white youth by these measures are not for the most part

striking. By October 1976, a little over four years after high school

true for the last 2 or 3 October periods for which data are available.

young men who were not in school were looking for work. As we concluded
in our earlier paper, youth unemployment does not appear from these data
to be a severe problem for this group of high school graduates, neither
whites nor non-whites.

E. Labor Force Status of Men in School
A large proportion of persons who are in school are also working

part-time and a significant number are working full-time. As shown in
Table 6, over 25 percent of youth in four-year schools work part-time,

as of October 1972, while in 1976 almost half of white youth in four-year

schools and a third of non-white youth were working part-time. The percent
of youth in two-year and in vocational and technical schools who worked in
1972 was generally higher than the percent in four-year schools, ranging as

high as 45 percent for white men in two year schools. By 1976, however,
among white men the percent working part-time was larger for those in four-

year schools than for those in two-year and vocational schools. Many men
who are full—time students in two-year and in vocational and technical

schools also have full-time jobs--for example, 24 percent of white men and
27 percent of non-white men in voc-tech schools in 1972 and even larger

—17—

percents in 1976. Thus for many youths, and in particular those in voctech schools and to a lesser extent those in two-year colleges, school
and work are joint activities.

Many students are also looking for work, with the percent of nonwhites that is looking considerably higher in most instances than the

percent of whites that are looking for work. This is in contrast to
the quite similar percents of white and non—white youth not in school

who were looking for work. Also, the percent of two-year college
students and voc—tech students that is looking for work is in general
substantially higher than the percent of four-year college students.
In neither 1972 nor 1976 were more than a third of vocational-technical

and two-year college students out of the labor force. Among four-year
college students, approximately 60 percent were out of the labor force
in 1972, but of those in school in 1976 only 40 percent were out of the

labor force. That many students who had been in school for four or five
years had not obtained a degree is likely to be associated with working
while in school.

These labor force participation statistics are consistent with the
supposition that two-year college and voc-tech programs are more commensurate with work that persons in these programs obtain than four-year
college programs are with work that persons in these programs want to
or are able to obtain.

Labor Force Statistics for Men Not in School and for Full-Time
Students
A sizeable proportion of persons in school would be classified as

unemployed based on official definitions. Indeed the unemployment rate
among full-time students is generally more than twice the rate among

young men not in school. Unemployment rates by school status, together
with labor force participation rates and the percent of the population
employed,

are shown in Table 7.

While in 1972 for example, only 5.3 percent of out-of-school white
youth were unemployed, 12.3, 10.9, and 12.2 percent respectively of men
in

vocational-technical, two-year, and four-year schools were unemployed.

In 1976, only 8.1 percent of non-white out-of-school young men were
unemployed, whereas 28.6 percent of those in

vocational-technical schools

-19-

were unemployed, 25.8 percent of two-year students, and 16.7 percent of
four-year college students.

At least two-thirds of persons in vocational-technical and two-year

schools are also in the labor force. From 36 to 60 percent of four-year
students are in the labor force.

According to this survey, 7.7 percent of all white male youth were
unemployed in October 1972, while only 1.9 percent were both not in school

and looking for work. Only 39.1 percent of those looking for work in 1972
were not in school. Among all non-white youth 16.2 percent were unemployed
in 1972, while only 5.7 percent were both not in school and looking for
work; and only 49 percent of those looking for work were not in school.

Apparently many youth search for work while in school--either for current
employment or for employment upon leaving school.

It is also likely that

some youth are in school because they were unable to find desired employment while not in school; they may have been unemployed when they entered

school. By 1976, although the unemployment rate among persons in school
was considerably higher than among those in school in 1972, because fewer
youth were in school about 65 percent of unemployment was accounted for by
persons out of school.

Are there chronically unemployed or out of work youth among these

high school graduates? According to the figures in Table 8, not many.
This table gives the percent of young men without work and the percent
unemployed for each possible number of the five October periods for

which data were available. Although consistent with the data above, nonwhite youth are without work more than white youth, there are few chroni-

cally unemployed among either group. For example, 80 percent of non-white
and 89 percent of white youth were out of school and unemployed in none of

classified in only one of the five periods. Somewhat more youth in both
groups were not in school and not working, but very few were often in
this position.

—21—

G. Unemployed Versus Out of the Labor Force
In considering the possibility that some persons could be chronically
without work, even though the average unemployment rate is rather low, we
considered both the unemployed and those unemployed together with those

out of the labor force. The latter classification suggests by implication that in their desire for work the unemployed may not be unlike those out

of the labor force. But evidence from this survey tends not to favor
this possibility. Persons who are not looking for work--and would thus
be classified as out of the labor force, according to standard definitions--

are apparently quite distinct from persons who are looking for work. Those
out of the labor force seem not to be 'discouraged workers' for the most part.
It is sometimes argued that to measure the extent of youth
unemployment in particular, the distinction between unemployment and

being out of the labor force is not a meaningful one. Indeed, it is
sometimes suggested that all youth who are not employed should be
thought of as unemployed, largely because it is argued that they would
like to work but are so discouraged about the prospects for finding

work that they donotlook for jobs.
In several October periods young persons in the survey who were

not employed were asked why they were not working. The form of the
question allowed the respondents to indicate which of several possible

reasons for not working applied to them. Although there were many
possibilities and although respondents could answer affirmatively to
several possibilities, thus complicating interpretation of the
responses, the answers to at least three of the questions seemed clearly
to distinguish those out of the labor force from those unemployed.

-22-

Presented to the respondents as one of the alternative reasons for
not being employed was that there were "not enough jobs."

The percent

of the unemployed and the percent of those out of the labor force who
indicated that this reason applied to them are shown in Table 8A for

two October periods, by school status. It seems clear from the table
that persons who are not looking for work do not say that a shortage of
jobs is a reason for not working nearly as often as persons who are looking

for work. The results seem to us to be inconsistent with the possibility
that a large proportion of youth who are out of the labor force are discouraged workers; on the contrary, these responses suggest that at most only a
small proportion could possibly be considered as though they wanted to work
but had given up searching.

Most persons who were out of the labor force also did not give as a

reason that they had 'no career opportunities." The percents that said
that this reason applied to them are shown in Table 8B. Again, only a
small proportion of persons out of the labor force gave this as a reason
for not working, although the proportions for each group except one were

higher in 1976 than in 1972. In general, the percent of the unemployed
who gave this as a reason was two to three times as high as the percent
of those who were out of the labor force.

Finally, in Table 8C are shown the percents of those not working

This reason also applied to a small percent of those out of the labor

force, but to a much larger proportion of the unemployed. In short,

these responses suggest that unemployed youth are quite distinct from
those out of the labor force and that this latter group is not composed
in substantial part of discouraged job seekers.

H. Wage Rates, Weekly Earnings and Hours, Annual Employment and
Unemployment, and Number of Employers
The hourly wage rates of white and non-white high school graduates

are very close. If anything, non-whites tend to earn a bit more per
hour than whites. This is true in particular for young men who are in
school. But because non-white males who are out of school work somewhat fewer hours per week on average than white males, their weekly

earnings are somewhat less than weekly earnings of out—of-school white

young men. Average hourly wage rates, weekly earnings, and weekly hours
worked for persons not in school and for those in school are shown in

Table 9. They cover all persons in the sample who were working in the

Wage rates for white and non-white young men out of school are

virtually identical right after graduation. After four years, whites
earn about 6 percent more per hour than non-whites, presumably due in
part at least to the different schooling patterns of the two groups

and to post-high school work experience. Non-whites also work about 2
hours per week less than whites in each of the time periods and thus
have lower weekly earnings--about 8 percent in the first year and 11

percent after four years. On the other hand, non-white men who are in
school work 1.5 to 3 hours per week more than whites, earn somewhat
more per hour in all but the 1676 period, and have higher weekly earnings
in each of the periods——between 5 and 19 percent depending on the period.

force, and number of employers, by school status, are shown in Table 10.

Among men out of school, non-whites work fewer weeks per year than

whites, but the difference declines continuously over the four-year

period. Non-whites work 13 percent less in the first year and 5 percent
in the fourth. The differences are accounted for by both weeks looking
for work and weeks out of the labor force. Differences among white and
non-white men who are in school are somewhat less in gcneral, although

-27as among persons not in school non-whites who are in school spend niore

weeks than whites looking for work.

I.

Does Early Experience Persist?
There is only a weak relationship between weeks worked in the first

year

or two after graduation from high school and weeks worked two or

three years later, but as young persons grow older there is increasing
consistency

between weeks worked in one year and weeks worked in the

next.

To describe the observed relationship between weeks worked in the
first four years after graduation from high school, we have constructed

a series of transition matrices. For each year we classified weeks
worked

into four intervals: 0 to 20, 21 to 40, 41 to 51, and 52. For

each pair of years we calculated the transition probabilities of moving

from an interval in the earlier year

to each of the intervals in the

second year. They are presented in Table hA for

white youth and in

Table 118 for non-white youth with the entries shown as percents. For
example, the matrix headed "1974-75" in the middle of Table hA says that
71

percent of the young men who worked 52 weeks

weeks in 1975; 4

percent worked between 0

in 1974

also worked 52

and 20 weeks. The numbers

below and to the left of each matrix are marginal proportions (percents).
In 1974, for example, according to Table llA, 50 percent of young white

men worked 52 weeks. All entries have been rounded to the nearest percent.
The tables can also be used to calculate for each pair or years

the joint probability of each of the interval combinations. For example,
the matrix headed "1973-76" in the lower left of Table hA says that 1.3
percent of the 2235 white men who were not in school in both 1973 and 1976
worked less than 20 weeks in each of those years (13 percent of 10 percent).

Some persistence over time is due to measured attributes of individuals

that are similar from one period to the next. Therefore the persistence
that is observed cannot be attributed to a causal relationship between
the number of weeks worked in one year and weeks worked in subsequent

years. More detailed analysis revealed little effect of early weeks worked
on weeks worked three or four years later (see Meyer and Wise [1979]))

The transition matrices reveal several phenomena. We will direct our
remarks first to the results for white men (Table ilA) and then discuss
only briefly particular aspects of the results for non-white young men.
The upper bound on weeks worked is reflected in the large probabilities
of remaining in the 52-week "interval" from one period to the next, much

larger than for any other interval. This is apparently because many persons
who work 52 weeks are indeed constrained by this limit. Any who "would
work" 52 weeks or more are observed to remain at the limit. Even persons
observed to work 52 weeks in one year may still be at 52 weeks in
the second even if their "propensity" to work declined between the two

time periods. From the diagonal matrices it can be seen that those who
remain at the limit for consecutive years increases from the 64 percent between the first and the second, to 71 percent between the second and the
third, to 82 percent between the third and the fourth.
Persistence in general increases over time, as can be seen from a

comparison of the diagonal elements of the three diagonal matrices. For
example, only 12 percent of persons who are in the lowest interval in the

1. Comparable conclusions were reached by Ellwood [1979], based on a
different data set.

-31-

first year are also in that interval in the second. But 28 percent who
are in this interval in the second are also there in the third, and 49

percent who are in this interval in the third year are also there in the
fourth.

Apparently

individual patterns

become increasingly established.

This finding suggests that our ability to identify from experience
immediately after high school those persons who will be without work

for long periods in subsequent years is quite limited, but that after
a few years, experience in one year becomes a much better predictor of
subsequent experience.

While experience in the fourth year seems strongly related to
that in

the

third, the relationship between experience in the last

year and earlier years declines rapidly with increasingly distant time

periods. This pattern can be seen best by looking at the last row of
matrices that compares experience in each of the first three years with

experience in 1976. Of persons in the four intervals in 1975; 49, 11,
4, and 2 percent respectively are in the lowest interval in 1976. Of
persons in the four intervals in 1973, the corresponding percents are

13, 14, 4, and 4. Whereas the likelihood that a person who was in the
lowest interval in 1975 was also there in 1976 was 25 times as high as
if he worked 52 weeks in 1975; if he were in the lowest interval in

1973, the likelihood of being in the lowest interval in 1976 was only
about

3 times as high as if he had worked 52 weeks in 1973.

We conclude that whatever the determinants of weeks worked, they

do not for the most part persist over these four years. Recall that
a small part of the relationship seen in the transition matrices is

-32-

due to measured individual attributes. They are not distinguished in

matrices from unmeasured individual attributes (individual specific

the

terms) commonly referred to as representing heterogeneity. Both
measured and unmeasured individual specific characteristics produce
some

persistence over time. The remainder of the relationship over

time

may be due to a true state dependence effect or to serial corre-

lation induced by correlation over time of other factors that affect

weeks worked. Whatever the reason, however, there seems to be very
little room for a causal effect of labor force experience in the first

year of experience on the last. Any effect there may be dies out
rapidly.

As youngsters age, their patterns of labor force experience become
increasingly stable, as we might expect to find among persons moving
from full-time school to full-time work, a process that is likely to

involve considerable searching, job changing, and the like before
settling into more or less permanent employment)
Transition matrices for non-white males (Table 118) reveal a pattern

that is in major outline like the pattern for all young men. Detailed
comparison of the two tables seems to show, however, that persistence
from earlier to later years may on average be a bit greater for non-whites
than for whites, although the differences between the two groups are not

striking. As judged by a comparison of the diagonal elements of the
1975-76 matrices in the two tables, young non-white men have by these

last two years apparently established somewhat more consistent work patterns

than white youth. In particular, while 49 percent of the 7 percent of white
male youth who worked less than 20 weeks in 1975 also worked less than 20
weeks in 1976, 63 percent of the 13 percent of non-white youth in this
category were also in the category in 1976.

We will estimate jointly a non-school attendance equation together
with a weeks worked equation for students and a weeks worked equation for nczlstudents for two separate year-long periods--the first between

October 1972 and

October 1973 and the secord between October 1974 and October 1975. Estimates will be obtained separately for whites and non-whites.

The school attendance and weeks worked equations are estimated jointly

for two reasons. One is that it is informative in talking about the
transition from school to work to have in mind the determinants of early
work versus school decisions, even when concentrating on the determinants

of weeks worked. In particular we are able to compare the effects of
individual attributes on schooling decisions of whites with the effects

for non-whites. A second reason is that to obtain consistent estimates
of the relationship between individual attributes and weeks worked we must
account for the relationship between unmeasured determinants of weeks
worked and unmeasured determinants of school attendance--that is, of being

in the sample to which the weeks worked equation pertains, whether it be

for students or non-students. We have corrected for "sample selection
bias," which we shall see is substantial.

We have also found a large proportion of both

non-students and students

working 52 weeks per year and a sizeable proportion

working zero weeks as

well. The proportions are shown in the tabulation below.

To account for the downward bias that this limit places on parameter estimates in the weeks worked equation, we have used a "double"-Tobit specifi-

cation of weeks worked. Thus the model estimates jointly a Tobit weeks
worked equation together with a probit specification of non-school atten-

dance. The precise specification can be described briefly.
Suppose that observed weeks worked for persons not in school is
denoted by small y. and the unobserved Hpropensityhl to work is denoted

capital Y. Suppose also that S. is an unobserved latent non-schooling
variable with an associated indicator variable s. that takes the value

1 if individual i is not in school and zero otherwise. Then we have

2. To facilitate comparison, the model is the same one that we used
in our earlier paper to describe weeks worked with the exception that in
that paper we allowed only for the weeks worked limit of 52, while in this
paper we have also incorporated explicitly the floor of zero. In the earlier
paper an insignificant number of individuals worked zero weeks. Explicit
allowance for the zero floor would have had little effect on the results.
We also estimated wage rates in that paper, but will not do so here. We
will find that the experiences of whites and non-whites are very similar
with respect to weeks worked and believe the same would be found for wage
rates. Thus we believe that the results in our earlier paper should serve
as good estimates for both groups. In addition, because the sample of nonwhite youth with wage rates is small, we have found it difficult to obtain
precise estimates for that group, although preliminary analysis reveals
similar parameter estimates for whites and non-whites.

III. Results
The parameter estimates are presented in Table 13, which for convenience

has been divided into three parts. The non-school attendance estimates are in
Table 13A.

The parameter estimates in the weeks worked equation are

presented in Tables 13B and 13C, for non-students and students, respectively.

The estimates of p, , and the likelihood values and sample sizes are shown
in Tables 13B and l3C. We shall briefly discuss first the implications of
the non-school attendance parameter estimates. Then we shall discuss the
relationships between school attendance and weeks worked. And finally we
shall consider the weeks worked parameter estimates, first for non-students

and then for students. Throughout, we shall emphasize comparison of the
results for whites and non—whites.

A. School Attendance of Whites and Non-Whites
Persons have been classified as not in school if in the October begin-

ning the period they were not attending school. We shall discuss the
results only for the October 1972-October 1973 period; those for the later

period are similar. Because the quantitative importance of the variables
is not apparent from the estimates in Tablel3B, we will present simulations
based on these estimates.

First consider the probability of school attendance in either 1972 or

1973 for whites and non-whites, evaluated at mean parameter values. For
whites we have evaluated the probability at the means of the right-hand

variables among whites, as well as the means among non-whites. The results
are presented in the tabulation below.

Although white young men are more likely to be in school than nonwhites, it can be seen from the tabulation that given individual academic
and socioeconomic attributes, non-whites are considerably more likely than

whites to attend a post—secondary school) Given the mean X for either
blacks or whites, the difference between the estimates for whites and non-

whites reflects a race effect. For either race, the difference between
the estimates based on the mean for whites and the mean for non-whites
reflects the effect of differences in measured attributes of the two groups.
We have also evaluated for each group the partial relationship between
attendance and individual attributes, by calculating the difference in
attendance probabilities for selected values of specified variables, with
other variables held at their sample means.2 They are shown below.

The estimates for whites and non-whites are quite

exceptions. Family income is unrelated to the attendance of non-whites,
while it is related to the attendance

of whites. Also, relative to the

effect of test scores, the effect of high

school class rank is smaller for

non-whites than for whites. One explanation of this latter result is
the academic preparation of classmates

that

preparation of classmates of whites; thus a giver class rank represents

B. Weeks Worked Equations
Recall that the parameter estimates in Table 13B indicate the effect of

associated variables on weeks worked Y, except if Y is 0 or 52. Then the
effect is zero. To obtain estimates for a random person in the sample,
some of whom could be working 52 or 0 weeks, evaluated at the mean X over
the total sample, either for persons in school or for persons out of school,
the estimated coefficients must be multiplied by the relevant adjustment

factor. They are as follows:

We shall present results based only on the estimated parameters. These indicate the effect of the variables as long as neither limit is reached. If
you were to want the expected effect for a person selected at random, not
knowing whether the person were at a limit, the estimated values should be
multiplied by the adjustment factors.

The estimated relationship between hours worked in high school and
weeks worked upon graduation and entry into the labor force is very substantial for both whites and non-whites and the estimated parameters for the

two groups are very similar. The relevant estimated parameters are presented
in the tabulation below.

There appear to be no appreciable and consistent differences among the

estimates for whites and non-whites. It can be seen from the tabulation
that the relationship between hours worked in high school and weeks worked
in the labor force could be very substantial .

For example, among non-

students, those who worked over 20 hours per week in high school are estimated to work on the order of 10 weeks more per year than those who did
work at all in high school

Evaluated at the mean X and using the appropriate adjustment factor,
twenty or more hours of work in high school for an individual selected at

random from the population is estimated to be associated with about 4 more
weeks of work after graduation than the estimate for a person who did

work in high school. In none of these cases do the estimates for whites
differ in general from those for non—whites.

The relationship between work while in high school and subsequent
employment is if anything even more striking for students than for nonstudents.

-53-

Whether these relationships reflect individual specific characteris-

tics that affect both work in high school as well as work after graduation,

or

whether work in high school itself contributes to later employment

possibilities is open to question. We have discussed this at some length
in our earlier paper and will not repeat the discussion here. We observe,
however, that the strong relationship between working while in high school

and working while in a post-secondary school suggests to us the effect of
individual specific attributes of youth that play a role in determining
work in both situations.

Both class rank in high school and the test scores are substantially

related to weeks worked for non-students. The standard deviation of class
rank is about 25 and of the test scores is about 1. The estimated effect
on weeks worked of standard deviation changes in high school class rank
and test scores are shown below.

Test Score Total

Among youth in both groups, by these measures, the effect of test

scores is much greater than the effect of class rank. This is true in
particular for non-whites although in general the differences between whites

and non-whites are not great. Evaluated at the mean of X for the total
sample, a standard deviation increase in test scores for a white youth

selected at random is associated with an increase in weeks worked of 4.2

-54-

and 2.6 respectively in 1972—73 and 1974-75. For a non-white the increases

are 5.4 and 5.2 respectively. The relative

difference between whites and

non-whites may result from differences in the qualities of the high

schools attended by the two groups. Relative to test scores,

class rank

may be a poorer indicator of ability in lower quality than in higher quality

high schools. The effects of high school class rank and test scores on weeks
worked by students are not significantly different
thus we have not reported standard deviation

from zero in any case and

simulations for students.

The estimated effect of job training in high school is positive in
all cases, but by standard criteria significantly

different from zero only

for non-student non—whites in 1972-73 and student whites in 1974-75. The
estimated effect for non-whites is larger than for whites in each comparison

except students in 1974-75. Marginal effects are as follows:

These numbers suggest the possibility
youth, vocational training in high

that for non-student non-white

school may have had some effect on

in this
employment after graduation, at least in the first year. Even

the estimated
year, however, these estimates appear small relative to

—55—

relationships

between test scores and weeks worked or between hours worked

in high school and weeks worked upon graduation. We are hesitant to make
too much of a single statistically significant coefficient because in our
earlier work although in general we found no effect of vocational training
in high school, we found a statistically significant estimate for one year.
It happened, however, to be for the 1975-76 October to October period.
Here we find that for neither whites nor non-whites is the estimate signif-

icant for the 1974-75 annual period. The results for students are also
ambiguous, as is the relationship between the effects for students versus
non-students.

Finally, we find that parents' income bears a statistically significant

and substantial relationship to weeks worked by non-students, especially for
non-whites. The estimated effects of a standard deviation increase in
parents' income (more accurately 5.5 thousand which is approximately one
standard deviation) are as follows:

A possible explanation for the differences between whites and non-whites
is

that the relationship between income and weeks worked is non—linear

with

the largest marginal effects for youth from low income families. The

mean value of parents' income for non-whites is much lower than the mean

-56-

for whites. In general, family income may be related to weeks worked because
as shown above a large proportion of youth find jobs through family contacts.
Those from higher income families may have better contacts.

The income

effects for students are not statistically different from zero in 1974-75.
For the 1972-73 period the estimated effect is negative for whites and
positive for non-whites.

Finally, students in vocational and junior college work considerably
more than those in four-year colleges, especially among

whites, as shown

in the following tabulation:

These results appear plausible since both junior college and vocational
school programs are more likely than four-year programs to be closely

related to particular jobs. The courses of study in these schools may also
be academically less time consuming.

IV.

Summary
Our intent has been to distinguish possible differences in the deter-

minants of school attendance and labor force experience of white and non-

white high school graduates. The paper parallels in many respects our
earlier work on high school preparation and early labor force experiences.
Among these high school graduates, we find no striking differences between
the determinants of the work experience of the two groups, nor of their
school attendance, although after controlling for measured attributes
non-whites are much more likely than whites to attend a post-secondary
school.
