The Proper Measurement of Government Budget Deficits:
Comprehensive Wealth Accounting or Permanent Income Accounting
for the Public Sector: Its Implications for Policy Evaluation and Design

ABSTRACT

The paper studies budgetary, financial and monetary policy evaluation
and design using a comprehensive wealth or permanent income accounting
framework. A set of stylized balance sheets and permanent income accounts
is constructed for the public, private and overseas sectors. These are
then contrasted with the conventionally measured balance sheet and flow
of funds accounts. This permits a new look at the issues of "crowding out"
and the "eventual monetization of fiscal deficits."
The conventionally measured public sector financial surplus, even
when evaluated at constant prices or as a proportion of GNP, presents a
potentially very misleading picture of the change in the real net worth
of the public sector. One reason is that capital gains and losses on out—
standing stocks of marketable financial assets and liabilities are not
included in the flow of funds. This includes changes in the real value
of nominally denominated public sector debt due to inflation. A second
reason is the omission of revaluations in non—marketable (and often merely
implicit) assets and liabilities such as the future stream of tax receipts
and the future stream of benefit payments.
The paper then proposes some general rules for the design of stabilization policy——policies to facilitate expenditure smoothing by avoiding or
minimizing the incidence of capital market imperfections. Both national
governments and international agencies should design fiscal, financial
and budgetary policies so as to induce an evolution of the conventionally
measured balance sheet and flow of funds accounts that permits private agents
and national economies, respectively, to approximate the behavior that
would be adopted if comprehensive wealth or permanent income were the only
binding constraint on economic behavior. This can be achieved by keeping
disposable income in line with permanent income and by ensuring an adequate
share of disposable financial wealth in total wealth.

Introduction

This paper studies budgetary, financial, and monetary policy

evaluation

and design using a comprehensive wealth and income accounting framework.
The focus is on the public sector accounts, but inevitably some attention

is paid to the private and overseas sectors. After constructing a stylized
comprehensive balance sheet for the public sector and its "fiow counterpart——the change in real public sector net worth——they are compared with
the conventionally measured balance sheet and flow of funds accounts.

actions of private agents and national governments

to depart from the

under which international organizations

should extend or restrict credit

to nation states to enable them to develop in line with their long—run
potential'. Financial evaluation exercises such as the IMF's

financial

programing should, therefore, start from two sets of accounts. The first
contains the conventional cash—based flow of funds accounts, the SNA

d
income expenditure accounts, and the

conventional

balance sheets of

marketable assets and liabilities. The second set of accounts contains
the comprehensive balance sheets or wealth accounts outlined in the paper
and their "flow" counterparts describing the changes

accounts.

national economies, to appro-

Conventional financial planning is, therefore, an essential input
into optimal (or even merely sensible) policy

design. Without a set of

comprehensive wealth and permanent income accounts, however, financial
analysis does not possess the minimal data base required for proper policy

evaluation and design. Conversely, without the conventional accounts,
analyses based just on the comprehensive wealth and permanent income
accounts will fail to take into account many of the actually binding
constraints on economic behavior.

II. A Stylized Set of Public Sector Accounts
Table 1 contains a stylized and simplified "comprehensive" balance

sheet for the public sector. Many definitional problems are ignored:
throughout this paper the terms "government" and "public sector" are used
interchangeably. 1/

It is assumed that a very heterogenous set of assets

and liabilities can somehow be expressed in common value terms. This in
spite of the fact that some of the assets are not marketable (KS0C) or,
even if potentially marketable, may lack a current observable market

price (KG). Some assets and liabilities are neither marketable nor
tangible and merely represent implicit, noncontractual (and reversible)

political commitments (T and N).

Referring to T, N, and 1 as present discounted values of future
streams of payments or receipts involves a rather cavalier use of certainty
equivalence: the conditional mathematical expectations .of the uncertain
future revenues or outlays are discounted using "risk adjusted" discount
rates.

If, for example, future tax revenues are highly uncertain, T

would be correspondingly small. The relevant horizon is, in principle,
Infinite.

For many purposes it is better not to try and reduce marketable and

nonmarketable, implicit and explicit claims to a common balance sheet

measure of value. Instead each of the items in the balance sheet would
be modeled as having potentially distinct behavioral effects. The proper
way of handing this will depend on the specifics of the model and appli
cation under consideration.

For a first pass at the problem of comprehensive wealth and Income
accounting in the public sector, the heroic balance she&t of Table 1
does, however, have its uses.
Most of the items in the balance sheet are self—explanatory.
Public sector overhead capital is assumed to yield an implicit rental
KSOC which corresponds to the item pGSOC, public sector consumption

rSOCp
1(° C

of social overhead capital services, on the debit side of the public

sector current account. pGKG is the balance sheet counterpart of the
operating surplus of the public enterprise sector in the public sector

current account. This may well be a negative item for some of the secular
public enterprise loss makers, in which case it should be moved to the
liability side of the 'balance sheet. The present value of current arid

capital grants is not entered separately; it can be viewed as subsumed

under N or T. Net foreign exchange reserves E* are entered separately as

an asset rather than netting them out against B*F or B*F +

BF+ BFp

For simplicity only nominal capital—certain bonds, and real capital—

certain bonds are considered. 1/
The treatment of money in this exposition of the comprehensive wealth

accounting framework is somewhat nonstandard. The reason for adopting
this approach is that it represents the simplest way of introducing a

nontrivial role for money. Specifically, it avoids the economy from
becoming isomorphic to a barter economy when, in Section VI, we consolidate
the accounts of the public and private sectors in our investigation of

As regards Z, the statement that the change in wealth or net worth
equals saving plus capital gains will not come as a surprise to anyone.
The importance of. accounting fully for capital gains and losses on existing

government assets and liabilities in order to obtain a correct understandipg
of the short—run and long—run implications of past, present, and prospective
budgetary, monetary, and financial policies has not, however, been universally appreciated.

Considerable interest attaches to behavior by an economic agent,
sector, or group of sectors that leaves real comprehensive net worth

unchanged. Such agents or sectors consume their permanent income and
their behavior is (ex_ante) permanently sustainable. For policy design,
policies aimed at keeping total national (public plus private) consumption
In line with national permanent income, i.e., policies focusing on the
consolidated public and private sector comprehensive balance sheet

accounts, are of special relevance. These are considered in Section VI.
While there certainly exist valid reasons for optimal consumption to
depart from permanent income, such divergences must necessarily be
temporary, with overshooting and undershooting of the permanent income

benchmark canceling in present value terms. Focusing on spending behavior
consistent with constant real comprehensive net worth should, therefore,

come naturally in policy evaluation and design. Note that equations (7),
(8a), and (8b) represent

or realized measures only. For planning.

including consumption planning, the ax ante measures are relevant. They

are obtained by replacing actual changes in prices by anticipated changes
in prices in equations (7) and (8a), and by substituting anticipated

— 16 —

changes in the value of implicit assets and liabilities for actual changes
in equations (7) and (8b).

In what follows, anticipated capital gains and

losses replace the. ex post measures whenever planned private or public

sector behavior is discussed.

III. Amortization of Public Debt Through
Inflation and Currency AppreciatlO
Consider first changes in the public sector balance sheet due to

"pure' or general inflation. This is defined as a situation in which all
money prices (including the prices of real capital assets) change at the

Proper wealth accountinng requires that the amortization of public
debt through inflation should be put "below the line" in measuring the

financing of the government's net "real" borrowing. 1/ Above the line, a
higher rate of inflation will (if interest rates are free) swell the
measured deficit as nominal interest rates rise with the rate of inflation.
If the Fischer hypothesis holds and real interest rates are invariant
with respect to the rate of inflation, the increased nominal interest
payments associated with a higher rate of inflation will be matched
exactly by the reduction in the real value of the government's stock of
nominally denominated, interest—bearing debt, Q''', defined by

models that do not exhibit "pre—Ricardian' debt neutrality, changes iü
the real value of the stock of government interest—bearing debt are the

major proximate determinant of "financial crowding out"—the displacement
of private capital formation by government borrowing, holding constant

the size and composition of the government's real spending program. The
exact nature (degree, scope, and time pattern) of financial crowding out

will, of course, be "model—specific". A number of simple examples will

This could be called the inflation—corrected government current account

deficit. Debt service payments and receipts on all assets and liabilities
(including money) are evaluated at real rates of return. 1/
Some idea of the magnitude of the overstatement of the government's
true borrowing by the conventionally measured deficit under inflationary

circumstances is provided by Table 3a for the United Kingdom and Table 3b
for the United States.
In 1981 the public sector borrowing requirement in the United Kingdom

was £10.6 billion and the public sector financial deficit £7.5 billion.
The inflation correction In that year atnounts to about £11 billion, using

a variety of estimates. The inflation—corrected deficit was actually a
surplus.

If one notes that during 1981 the United Kingdom economy was

also experiencing the worst recession since the 1930s, there can be no
doubt that the inflation—corrected and cyclically adjusted (trend or perma-

nent) deficit was actually a very sizeable surplus. It is a matter of some
practical importance whether that constitutes wise countercyclical fiscal

policy. The United States during the period 1979—81 also had an inflation

IV. Budgetary Policy and Monetary Growth:
The Eventual Monetization of Deficits
If bond financing of deficits causes concern

about crowding out of

adverse
private capital formation and, in the open economy, about possible
consequences for external indebtedness,

monetization of deficits is a

source of concern because of its inflationary

implications. We saw that

it was necessary to correct the conventionallY measured budget deficit

appreciation on the real

financial assets and liabi-

lities in order to assess (changes in) the extent to which the public
sector competes for investible resources with the private and overseas
sectors

Similar adjustments are required to understand the monetary implica-

tions of the deficit, as will be shown in this section.

for inflation) of the fiscal

measured deficit should not also be reduced by

the erosion of the real

The evaluation of the long—term monetization implied by the
requires the consideration of a deficit measure which has nominal debt
service payments "corrected" for the effects of domestic inflation,
exchange rate appreciation, and real growth.
In any particular period the economy may well be far removed from

the long—run trend captured in equations (17) and (19) or (19'). Actual
monetary growth in the short run will be given by equations (16) or (18).

would, for example, be the case if velocity were constant, the price
level were perfectly flexible, and output grew at its exogenously given

Authorities concerned with nf1at1on

in the short run may not be much comforted by the knowledge, that the long—
run rate of inflation implied by their fiscal stance is low, if current

monetary growth and inflation are high.

If, as seems more likely, current

inflation is a function of current and past monetary growth and
if current inflation depends also on anticipated future monetary growth
(as it does in models with forward—looking rational expectations) then

the long—run monetary growth expressions in (17),

(19), and (19') become

the relevant ones even for short— and mediumterm policy.

thus store up trouble for the future. Financial markets do, furthermore,

The Public Sector Accounts and Private Behavior

The private and overseas sectors' accouflS
Comprehensive balance sheets analogous to the public sector balance

sheet of Table 1 are drawn up for the private sector and the overseas

sector in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. For reasons of space, the private
sector balance sheet consolidates the household sector, the corporate
sector, and the private financial sector.

For practical applications,

further sectoral disaggregation will often be required.

The balance

sheets require little further explanation. Consumer durables and private
residential housing can be viewed as included in K, and their imputed
service flows as subsumed under private income and

consumption in the

budget connstraint.

For simplicity it is assumed that all claims on or debts to the rest
of the world take the form of interest—bearing

financial claims. Direct

foreign ownership of domestic real capital or of domestic resources is

not considered but could be added without dIfficulty. Human wealth, L,
the present discounted value of future expected labor income, is a
(nonmarketable) asset in the household balance sheet. The total national

stock of land and mineral rights is assumed to be given by R. 1/

These flow of funds and change in real net worth equations require little

explanation. In the case of the private sector, the difference between
the financial surplus (at constant prices) and the change in real net
worth reflects capital gains and losses on existing marketable assets

exchange rate changes) and changes In the value of the intangible and

The positive irrelevance nd normative relevance of debt neutrality,
The simplest theory of the interaction of the private and public

sectors is based on the so—called (pre—) Ricardian debt—neutralitY
hypothesis (see Barro (1974), Carmichael (1979), Buiter (1980), Buiter

and Tobin (1979), and Tobin and Buiter (1980)). This hypothesis holds
that, given the level and composition of the public sector's real spending

program on goods and services, private sector behavior will be invariant
with respect to changes in the taxation—borrowing mix that finances this

spending. Most of the formal models dealing with this issue concern
closed barter economies and the formal invariance propositions tend to be
stated in terms of borrowing versus taxing without explicit consideration

Debt neutrality is bad positive economics. It requires private
agents to be infinite—lived or to have operative intergenerational bequest
and child—to--parent gift motives in every generation. Perfect capital

markets are another necessary condition: future labor income is a source
of current spending power on a par with current disposable income and
current holdings of government debt. 1/
The economic behavior that would be generated under debt neutrality
is, howefer, a useful guide to what policy should try to achieve in a
world in which a variety of capital market imperfections prevent the
"unaided" private sector from acting according to permanent income
principles.

1/ Debt neutrality, i.e., invaiiance of the solution trajectories of
real economic variables under changes in the borrowing—taxation mix of
the government also requires the taxes to be lump—sum. With nonlumpsum
(distortionary) taxes, transfers and subsidies, public sector claims on
the private sector and private sector claims on the public sector still
are netted out in the balance sheet. Real behavior will be altered when
the borrowing—taxation mix changes because the familiar allocative effects
of nonlump—sum taxes, etc., will alter equilibrium prices and rates of
return.

Through their budgetary and financing policies, governments (within
a national economy) and International organizations (with the international economic system) can act as a superior financial intermediary,

changing the composition of private sector portfolios (respectively nation

state portfolios). Well—designed policy interventions of this kind can
minimize the extent to which disposable income, current cash flow and
the portfolio of liquid, marketable financial assets become binding
constraints on consumption, Investment, production and portfolio allocation, enforcing undesirable departures from behavior according to

permanent income principles. Governments, through their unique ability
to impose taxes, through their monopoly of legal tender and through the
superior quality of their debts, have a "comparative advantage" over the

private sector in borrowing to smooth out income streams. 2/ The same

1/ The first—best policy of eliminating capital market imperfections
as far as possible, should of course be pursued to the full. Budgetary
policies should aim to neutralize those imperfections that cannot be
eliminated.
2/ Because governments have the unique power to impose taxes (unrequited transfers to itself) and because of their ability to declare
certain of their liabilities legal tender, the risk of default on
government bonds is les than that on private debt. Total current and
future natural income is in a sense the collateral for government
borrowing. National income tends to be much less variable and uncertain
than the incomes of individual private agents. Governments effectively
pool individual risks and thus eliminate diversifiable risk. An obvious
question is why this risk—sharing cannot be done equally well through
private insurance markets. One answer is that even if this were possible,
it would be more costly than making minor alterations to a tax structure
that is required in any case.
A second answer relies on familiar moral hazard problems in insurance

transformation of future tax cuts into present tax cuts the nation

can consume in line with its new, higher permanent income:

the government

has transformed future tax cuts into disposable income.
An alternative proposal to handle the same problem has been made by
Sam

Brittan

of the Financial Times. His proposal amounts to a capital

gift o the private sector by the public sector: the equity in the newly
discovered oil riches is transferred to the private sector.

If this

newly privatized wealth takes the form of marketable financial claims,
private spending in line with permanent income is again likely to be
encouraged relative to a policy of cutting taxes in line with current

oil revenues: the government has transformed future tax cuts into
disposable financial wealth.
In this paper I have used the same symbol T for the present value

of the (uncertain) expected stream of future tax payments and receipts {r},
both where the present value to households of expected future tax payments
and where the present value to the government of expected future tax

receipts was concerned. Similarly N represented both the household asset
and the government liability corresponding to the stream of future

benefits n}.
The presence of an impact on private spending of offsetting changes

in say T, N and BH that would prima fade appear to leave household net
worth unchanged was then attributed, in a rather ad hoc manner, to

differences in the liquidity, inrketabi1Ity and usefulness as

of T, N, and B11. An alternative, but still ad hoc, way of avoiding the

satisfactory treatment of these issues requires the tools of the new
microeconomics of credit rationing, collateral and other capital market

periods of time.

There are good reasons for letting taxes net of transfers vary with
the current level of economic activity rather than making them functions

of long—run or permanent income. Assume, as seems reasonable, that
during the downswing a significant number of private agents are con-

strained in their spending by current disposable income. 1/ By reducing
taxes and increasing borrowing during the downswing, public spending
during the downswing will be financed to a larger extent by private agents
who are not constrained by current disposable income (the purchasers of

the bonds). Total consumption will, therefore, decline by less than if

taxes (which we assume to fall equallyondispoSableiflComeC0flStt'th
and permanent—income—constrained private agents) had been kept constant.
In the upswing, the additional debt incurred during the downswing can

be repaid out of higher than normal taxes. 2/ The net result is that
consumption is smoothed out over the cycle. This would be desirable on
grounds of intertemporal allocative efficiency even if product and factor

1/ One may wish to replace the phrase spending constrained by current
disposable income" by the following: the effect of current disposable
income on spending exceeds that of permanent income multiplied by the
share of current disposable income in permanent income (allowing for the
effect of changes in current income on expectations about future income
streams).
2/ These higher taxes during the upswing fall on a population which,
on average, is likely to be less constrained by current disposable income
than it was during the downswing.

make the total demand for domestic government bonds considerably more

cyclical money issues and withdrawals need not imply any increase in the
trend rate of growth of the money stock.

Note that this view of stabilization policy suggests that taxes and

transfers rather than exhaustive" public spending on goods and services
should be used to dampen fluctuations in economic activity. Public
consumption spending, like all consumption spending, should be smoothed

over time in line with permanent income. Public sector capital formation
should have its time profile determined largely by the optimal public

sector consumption programme, Public works and other public spending
on goods and services can be effective in regulating the overall level
of demand and of economic activity, but are likely to distort the optimal
private sector—public sector consumption mix, unlike well—designed changes
in the taxation, borrowing, and money financing mix.
Public sector asset sales and cosmetic changes in the PSBR
Sales of existing public sector financial assets do not appear in
the SNA public sector financial surplus but do appear in the public
sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) and similar transactions records.

A "stock—shift" sale of government—owned natural resources rights _dRG
or of claims to public enterprise capital —dxc to the private sector
would not by itself alter public sector or private sector net worth.

There may, of course, be efficiency reasons for wishing

to nation-

ownership transfers If the efficiency with which the resources are managed

differs between sectors. The financial consequences, however, are
virtually nil: bonds in private portfolios are replaced by other
financial claims.

If the government sells its assets gradually to finance

policy and one of conventional financing by borrowing is also largely

cosmetic. 1/ When it borrows, the government incurs an obligation to
service the additional debt. When it sells assets it loses the future
income from the assets it sells. It makes little sense, therefore, to
attribute economic significance to the distinction between sales of
public debt (below the line) and sales of government financial assets
(above the line) as is done with the PSBR in the United Kingdom..
Conclusion
The general conclusions have been stated in the introduction.
In this concluding section I shall confine myself to some more specific
and, I hope, practical remarks.

Comprehensive wealth and permanent income accounting requires
explicit judgments concerning expectations

about the future. This arises

from the need to evaluate nonmarketable and often intangible and merely
cay eat abo ut d Ifferences in the effic iency with

— 56 —

implicit

assets and liabilities such as future tax and benefit streams.

I consider. this to be a salutory aspect of comprehensive wealth

accounting. It brings out the distinction between mechanistic bookkeeping
and recording of transactions, on the one hand, and, on the other hand,
accounring for economic policy evaluation and design.

Inflation accounting in the public sector is long overdue. Money
illusion in the public sector should cease to be an obstacle to sensible

budgetary policy. By themselves, the public sector financial deficit and
the public sector borrowing requirement (at current or constant prices or

as as proportion of GM?), are not very informative statistics. They must
be corrected for the change in the real value of the outstanding stocks
of interest—bearing public debt to evaluate either the implications of
the deficit for financial crowding out or the "eventual monetization"

implied by the government's fiscal stance. Analogous corrections should
be made to the conventionally measured external current account deficit

or surplus: changes in the real value of external assets and liabilitieS
due to changes in the price level and the nominal exchange rate have to
be allowed for.

.

To omit government—owned capital and public sector property rights

in land and natural resources from' the public sector balance sheet can

give a very misleading picture of the net worth of the public sector and

of its present and future fiscal and financial options. This holds true
especially for countries where the government owns significant mineral
rights (e.g., Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and many of

- 57

the

—

oil—producing nations) and countries in which the nationalized sector

accounts for a large share of economic activity (e.g., the United Kingdom

and many developing countries). The sign of the effect on public sector
net worth of including publicly—owned capital is not self—evident:
virtually open—ended commitments to subsidize loss—making public enterprises depress net worth.

The implicit assets and liabilities of the public sector represented
by the streams of future tax revenues and of future benefits and transfer
payments may well dwarf the marketable financial assets and liabilities
in the government balance sheet.

Transitory (e.g., cyclical) deficits and surpluses are a mechanism
enabling current—disposable—income—constrained private agents to smooth
out consumption and keep it more closely in line with permanent income.
By permitting consumption to be maintained in the face of a transitory
decline in income they also mitigate m-iemployinentand exces capacity if

price and wage rigidities prevent an instantaneous market—clearing

response to demand shocks, For governments to borrow in the downswing
on behalf of" private agents with less favored access to capital markets
and to retire these countercyclical debt increases during the upswing,
is sound fiscal management, regardless of what the rate of inflation

happens to be. Alternatively, cyclical increases in the deficit could
be financed (partly or wholly) by money creation, to be reversed during

the upswing. The optimal financing mix of cyclical (i.e., transitory
and reversible) deficits need not be the same as that of permanent

deficits. Aconsideration of this important issue would require the

analysis

of specific, detailed models. It is, therefore, well beyond

the scope of this paper which has tried to focus on general propositions
that rely on as few detailed, model—specific properties as possible.
