Optimal Financial Aid Policies for a Selective University

ABSTRACT

Recent federal cut—backs of financial support for undergraduates have
worsened the financial position of colleges and universities and required
them to debate how they will allocate their scarce financial aid resources.
Our paper contributes to the debate by providing a model of optimal financial
aid policies .for a selective university——one that has a sufficient number
of qualified applicants that it can select which ones to accept and the type
of financial aid package to offer each admitted applicant.
The university is assumed to derive utility from "quality—units" of
different categories (race, sex, ethnic status, income class, alumni relatives, etc.) of enrolled students. Average quality in a category declines
with the number of applicants admitted and the fraction of admitted applicants
who enroll increases with the financial aid package offered the category.
The university maximizes utility subject to the constraint that its total
subsidy of students (net tuition revenue less costs including financial aid)
is just offset by a predetermined income flow from nonstudent sources (e.g.,
endowment). The model implies that the financial aid package to be offered
to each category of admitted applicants depends on the elasticity of the
fraction who accept offers of admission with respect to the financial aid
package offered them, the propensity of the category to enroll, the
elasticity of the categorys average quality with respect to the number
admitted, and the relative weight the university assigns in the utility
function to applicants in the category.

While the latter must be subjectively determined by university
administrators, the former parameters are subject to empirical estimation.
The paper concludes with a case study of one selective institution's data
and illustrates how they may be estimated. Based upon data from the
university's admissions and financial aid files, as well as questionnaire
data which ascertained what alternative college most admitted freshman
applicants were considering and the financial aid packages at the alternative, probit probability of enrollment equations are estimated as are
equations that determine how average quality varies with the number admitted
for each category. These estimates are then applied to illustrate what the
"optimal" financial aid policy would be for the university.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent and proposed future cut—backs of federal financial support
for undergraduate students from lower— and middle—income families have
worsened the financial positions of colleges and universities and required
them to rethink how scarce financial aid resources should be allocated.
For example, the Ivy League universities and a number of other highly
selective universities have been following a policy of meeting the "full

financial need" of all accepted applicants who enroll. That is, after
evaluating how much an applicant and his or her family should be able to
contribute to the applicant's education, the difference between the total
cost of attending the university (tuition and fees, room and board, books,
and other expenses) and this sum was provided to the applicant in the form
of a package consisting of scholarships, loans, and in—school employment

opportunities. This policy was designed to assure equal access for all
qualified students to these universities; family income ceased to be a key
determinant of whether, a student could enroll at one of them. The worsening financial situation that these universities face has, in many cases,
called the continuation of these policies into question.
What options do these universities, and other universities that have
never had the resources to meet the need of all accepted applicants, face?

What financial aid policies will maximize a university's welfare? Out
paper contributes to the debate by providing in Section II a model of
optimal financial aid policies for a selective university —— one that has
a sufficient number of qualified applicants that it can select both which

ones to accept and he type of financial aid package to offer each admitted
applicant.

The university is assumed to derive utility from "quai ft—units" of
different categories (race, sex, ethnic status, income class, alumni
relatives,

declines

etc.) of enrolled students. The average quality of a ccteory

with the number admitted and the fraction of admitted

students

who enroll increases with the financial aid package offered the category.
The university maximizes utility subject to the constraint that its total
subsidy of students (its tuition revenue less costs including financial
aid) is just offset by a predetermined income

flow from nonstudent sources

(e.g., endowment). The model implies that the financial aid package to be
offered to each category of admitted applicants should depend on (1) the
elasticity of the fraction who accept offers of admission with respect to
the financial aid package offered them and, in some cases, the propensity
of applicants to enroll (2) the elasticity of the category's average quality
with respect to the number admitted, and (3) the relative weight the

university assigns in its utility function to applicants in the category.
While the latter must be subjectively determined by university
administrators, the former parameters are subject to empirical estimation.
Section III presents a case study using data from one selective university,
Cornell University, that illustrates how the parameters may be estimated.

II. A MODEL OF OPTiMAL FINANCIAL AID AND ADMISSIONS POLICIES FOR
A SELECTIVE UNIVERSITY
By a selective university, we mean one in which the number of applicants far exceeds the number of available positions, and thus the university

exercises considerable discretion in the admissions process. For example,
Cornell University admits only about one—quarter of its freshman applicants,
and undoubtedly a large number of potential applicants fail to apply because
they believe that their chances of admission are so low.

Selective universities

can increase their applicant flows by publicly announcing slightly lower
admission standards.2

Suppose that a selective university faces N

different categories of

applicants. The categories may depend upon family income, minority
status, academic quality, region of the country, parent alumni status,
student athletic ability, or any other attributes that the university is

concerned about. To take an example, if the university was concerned only
about whether an applicant had an alumni parent and whether the applicant
was a minority, there would be four categories (yes/yes, yes/no, no/yes,

no/no). Let X denote the number of applicants from category I that
are admitted. Since the university's applicant pool is assumed to far
exceed the number of available freshman enrollment opportunities, we treat

the X as choice variables.3
To simplify, we assume that over the range of potential total enroll-

ment levels, the university faces a fixed marginal cost per student of C.
Although it may establish a tuition level, which doesnot vary across

.4
students, it awards different financial aid packages (treated here entirely
as scholarships) to different categories of students. Let

denote the

total net cost of attending the university for applicants from category i.

Then the share of the costs that the university bears for students from

this category, S.,, is given by

accepted applicants in category i that actually enroll,

to depend on the share of the costs that the university bears.4 Other

things equal, the proportion that will enroll (which is sometimes called
the yield) will increase as the university's share of the cost increases.

That is,

Note that (2) asserts that the lower the net price charged applicants,
the more likely that they will enroll. Also, there is nothing in this

formulation that prevents F1 from also depending upon

the level of the

university's costs.

The product of the number of admitted applicants and the fraction who
accept admission is the number of students who actually enroll in each

category. The university is not indifferent, however, to the composition

of the enrolled students. Specifically suppose

that we can rank admitted

applicants by some objective measure of their academic quality, such as

5

SAT scores or class rank, and that within each category the average quality

We assume that the university values the total quality units" of students
who actually enroll in each category and that the weights it places on
attracting different categories of students can be summarized by the quasi—
concave utility function

(4)

where

U = U
[F1(S1)X1q1(X1), F2(S2)X2q2(X2), ...,

represents the total quality units of enrolled students

from category i.

Note

that this formulation distinguishes between the academic quality

of applicants and their relative attractiveness to the university. Quality
is an objective measure, and depends upon measurable academic attributes

as noted above. Relative attractiveness, however, depends upon the subjective valuations of university decision—makers of applicant characteristics
such as minority status, athletic ability, family income class, and whether
the applicant has relatives who are alumni, that are summarized by the
form of the utility function in (4).

We can define category I applicants as being relatively more attractive
to the university than category j applicants if for any equal number of
quality units of enrolled students of each type, the university obtains
greater marginal utility from enrolling an additional quality unit of

type I applicants. That is, if for equal numbers of enrolled quality
units

The university seeks to maximize its utility from enrolling different
categories of students subject to a constraint that the net revenue it
receives from students plus its revenue from nonstudent sources that can
be applied to subsidizing students' education can

not be less than the

total cost of the students.7 Let R denote the total applidable revenue

from nonstudent sources; one can think of this as the revenue that is

A is a Lagrangian multiplier that has the interpretation of minus the

admit applicants from different categories and vary the share of the per
student cost that it bears across categories up until the point that the
ratio of the marginal utility to the marginal cost of obtaining an additional quality unit is equal for each action.

One can make use of equations (12) and (16) to derive a number of
propositions about how financial aid resources should be allocated across

different categories of applicants. These propositions, which are formally
proven in the appendix, can be summarized as follows.
Suppose we first consider the case when the elasticity of the fraction
of admitted applicants who enroll with respect to the university's share of
costs is constant within each category (but may differ across categories).

In this case,, for each category F. =

and larger values of

indicate greater propensities to enroll, other things equal.
'Proposition 1:

Suppose the enrollment elasticity c. is equal across

two categories, both face the same elasticity of average quality function,
and the elasticity of average quality varies with the number admitted.

Then

the relative price the university should charge to each category of applicants

depends only on their relative weights in the university's utility function

and on their relative propensity to enroll if admitted. Other things equal,
the group which is relatively more attractive to the university should be

charged a lower price. Similarly, other things equal, the group with a greater
propensity to enroll should be charged a higher price.
Proposition 2:

Suppose the elasticity of the fraction of admitted

applicants who enroll differs across groups but that the two groups have
the same elasticity of quality function, the same values of the propensity

to enroll parameter (K), and are equally relatively attractive to the
university.

Proposition 3: Suppose at any given number of admitted applicants,
the elasticity of quality with rcspect to applicants differs across groups,
but that the two groups have the same (constant) elasticity of yield with
respect to the university's share of cost, the same values of the propensity
to enroll parameter, and are equally relatively attractive to the university.
In this case, the group whose elasticity of quality with respect to admissions is larger (in absolute value) should be charged the lower price.

Intuitively, these propositions all make sense. The first asserts the
university should charge lower prices to categories of applicants who it

derives more utility from and/or who are less likely to enroll at any given

price. The second asserts that applicants whose enrollment decisions are
more sensitive to price should be charged a lower price. Finally, the
third asserts that applicants whose average quality falls off more rapidly

with the number admitted should be charged a lower price to increase the
yield and thus reduce the number who need be admitted to reach any desired
enrollment figure.

In an anlogous manner, one can consider the case when the elasticity
of average quality with respect to the number admitted is a constant for each

category. Here, for each category q

and larger values of

Proposition 4: Suppose nj is equal across two categories and both
face the same probability of enrollment function.

In this case, the relative

number of applicants the university should admit depends only on the relative
weights it places on the different categories, with relatively more attractive students being admitted with greater frequency.
categories should be charged the same price.

Moreover, both

11

Proposition 5: Suppose the elasticity of average quality with respect
to the number admitted differs across two groups but that both face the

same elasticity of yield function. In this case, the university should
charge a lower price to the category whose elasticity of quality with
respect to the number admitted is more elastic (larger in absolute value).

Proposition 6: Suppose n is equal across two categories and that,
at any given share of cost that the university bears one category's elas-

ticity of yield is larger than the other's. In this case, the university
should charge a lower price to the group whose elasticity of yield with
respect to the subsidy is higher.

Given the explanation of the earlier propositions these latter three

are almost self—evident. Moreover, as Table Al in the appendix summarizes,
most of these six propositions continue to hold when several alternative
forms of utility functions are used.

Our model implies then, that the financial aid package to be offered
to each category of admitted applicants should depend on (1) the elasticity
of the fraction who accept offers of admission with respect to the financial
aid package offered them and the propensity of the applicants to enroll,
(2) the elasticity of the category's average quality with respect to the

number admitted, and (3) the relative weight the university assigns in the

• utility function to applicants in the category. While the latter must be
subjectively determined by university administrators, the other parameters
are subject to empirical estimation,
this may be done.

and the next section illustrates how

ESTIMATING THE RELEVANT PARAMETERS: A CASE STUDY

A number of prior studies have presented estimates of the determinants
of the college enrollment decisions of high school seniors, using data on
national or regional samples of individuals.2 While such studies are of
use in simulating the effects of various federal financial aid policies on
the level and composition (say by race or income class) of aggregate college
enrollments, they are of little use to an individual college or university
that is trying. to optimally set its own financial aid policies. What is

required in the latter case are institutionally based studies of the deter-

minants of the

enrollment

decision and in the first part of this section,

we indicate how such a study can be conducted, using data from one selective
university, Cornell University.13 Similarly, to optimally frame financial
aid policies, university decision—makers need
ination on the elasticity of average quality

institutionally based inf or—

with respect to the number

admitted for the various categories of applicants they

face. The second

part of the section shows how these parameters can be estimated, again
using data for Cornell University freshmen applicants.

s, and also at an alternative university, o. The decision as to
university to enroll at presumably is based upon a comparison of the rtet

utility, V, that the applicant would receive from each option, with the
net utility in each option depending upon observable characteristics of the

individual (Xk) the net costs to the applicant of the two options (N,N),
other characteristics of the two options (Z,Z0), and random variables

13

that represent unobservable differences in tastes that the

Here Hk is an unobservable continuous variable that represents the net

utility individual k would obtain from choosing to enroll at university s
rather than at the alternative. Although it is unobservable, we can arbitrarily
scale its cutoff value so that when it is greater than zero we observe

individual k enrolling at university s (Bk =

1).

Conversely, if it is

less than zero, the applicant will turn down the offer of admission from s

and enroll elsewhere (Hk =

0).

If we further assume that the ek and

that are uncor—
eok can be treated as normally distributed random variables

related with the explanatory variables in the model, equation (18) represents
a probit model of the determinants of the probability of enrollment at the

selective university)4 Put another way, estimates of it can be used to
generate the yield curve faced by the university

(F(S) in (2)).

Variants of equation (18) are used below to obtain estimates of the
determinants of the probability of enrollment for freshmen applicants who

14

were admitted to Cornell University for the year that began in September of

1981 (the class of 1985). Cornell is a selective Ivy League university that

has approximately 6,000 graduate and 11,000 undergraduate students. The
latter attend its seven undergraduate divisions —— the Colleges and Schools
of Arts and Sciences, Architecture, Art and Planning, Engineering, Hotel
Administration, Agriculture and Life Sciences, Human Ecology, and Industrial
and Labor Relations.

A unique institutional feature of Cornell is that it is partially

privately supported and partially State supported. The first four divisions
mentioned above are in the private part of the university and are referred

to as the endowed sector. The latter three are operated by Cornell under
contract with the State of New York and have some relationship with the
State University of New York; these are referred to as the statutory sector.

Because tuition charges differ substantially between the sectors, as does
the subject matters taught, and because the statutory sector draws students
primarily from New York State, all of the estimates below are done separately
for the endowed and statutory sectors.'5
The data required to conduct,the study came from a variety of sources.
The university's admissions file had data for all freshmen applicants on the
division the student applied to, objective measures of student ability (SAT
scores, rank in class), characteristics of the student (e.g., race, sex,
alumni parents, region of the country), the admission decision, and, if

admitted, the applicant's enrollment decision. The university's financial
aid management information file had information for all admitted financial
aid applicants on family income, and the financial aid package offered the
applicants from Cornell and other sources (grants or scholarships, loans,

academic year earnings opportunities).16 A university admissions research

15

questionnaires mailed to all admitted freshmen applicants and returned
by approximately 60 percent of them, yielded data on the name of the other
college the applicant was considering (or enrolled at), the distance of
both that college and Cornell from the applicant's honre, and the financial
aid package offered to the applicant at the other college.17 Finally,

once the name of the other college was known, published sources provided
data on the total costs of attending the other college and the average
SAT scores of the entering freshman class there.

These estimates conform quite well to what one would expect from a model

standing; these students tend to find their way into even more prestigious
universities.

16

Financial aid and cost variables at both Cornell and the other option

are also seen to play an important role. Other things equal, a $500
increase in the scholarship offer at Cornell will raise the yield on
accepted applicants by roughly 6½ to 8 percent in the endowed sector and
7 to 10 percent in the statutory sector.18 The loan the student can get
if he or she attends Cornell also marginally (in a statistical sense)
appears to matter, in the endowed sector, although not unexpectedly its

marginal effect is less than that of the Cornell grant)9 Similarly, other
things equal, increasing the size of the scholarship elsewhere decreases the
probability of attending Cornell while increasing the total cost of the other

college increases the probability of attending Cornell. Finally, while the
provision of employment opportunities at Cornell does not seem to influence
the enrollment decision, the provision of a loan or employment opportunities
elsewhere does reduce the probability of attending Cornell.
How sensitive are these results' to the specification chosen?

Additional

estimates, not reported here for brevity, suggest that allowing family income
to nonlinearly influence the enrollment probabilities or including the region
of the country that the applicant is from in the model does not alter the

other results. The results are also quite similar between the two specifications ((1) and (2)) reported in Table 1; in the latter the coefficients of
the Cornell total cost and scholarship offer are constrained to be equal and
opposite in sign, as are the analogous coefficients for the other college.20
Since a key parameter is the sensitivity of different applicant groups
to the Cornell net cost of attendance, attempts were made to ascertain if
the probit coefficient of the net cost variable varied with four sets of
characteristics that the university might use to define applicant groups.

17

These are the SAT range that the applicant falls in, the family income class
he or she is from, whether the applicant has an alumni parent, and whether

he or she is a minority applicant in Cornell's minority admissions program
(COSEP).21 The results are reported in Appendix Table A3; the interactions
with only one set of characteristics at a time (columns (1) to (4)) would
be relevant if the university's financial aid policy was to vary along only
one dimension, while the interactions with all sets simultaneously (column
(5)) would be relevant if the university's financial aid policy was to consider all of the factors.

Most strikingly, the probit coefficient of the Cornell net cost variable
does not appear to vary with the applicant's SAT score, nor does it vary
significantly with the applicant's parent alumni status.

In the endowed

sector, however, the response of yield to net cost does appear to be lower
for minority applicants and there is some evidence that it is higher for
applicants in the $18,000—$36,000 family income range than it is for applicants from lower—income families.
Table 2 summarizes the implicatIons of these results for the elasticities
of the probabilities of enrollment with respect to Cornell's net cost; the

variable that is analogous to c In our model. Elasticities are calculated
for the probit net cost model without interactions (Col. 1), the model with
one type of interaction at a time (Col. 2) and the model with all four sets

of interactions occurring simultaneously (Col. 3), Because most of the
interactions in the latter specifications proved to be statistically Insig—
nificant, most attention should be directed to the results in the first
column.

18

In both the statutory and endowed sectors,

it appears that the

elasticity is lowest for the lowest income class of finaucal aid recipients.22
There also is evidence, especially in

the endowed sector, that the elasticity

is higher for applicants with alumni parents
that it is highest for the highest quality

scores). Finally, again especially in

than for other applicants, and

applicants (as measured by SAT

the endowed sector, there is evidence

that the elasticity is lower for minority

applicants than it is for non—

minority applicants.

This latter result may not square with some readers' a prior expectations given the intense competition

at selective unversities for minority

Cornell's
students and probably warrants some explanation. Applicants to
who enroll at Cornell receive academic

that seeks to provide them with study skills,
support through a program

verbal and quantitative SAT scores as the measure of quality. For
simplicity, we have considered only two functional forms f or q, the

constant elasticity form q(X) =

Among the different ability classes, the elasticity of average quality

range. Among the different income classes the elasticity tends to decline
in absolute value as family income increases, although for statutory applicants it levels out rapidly after an initial decline.23 Finally, the
elasticity of average quality with respect to the number of applicants
admitted is much larger for minority (COSEP) applicants than it is for non—
minority applicants and, in some specifications, it is larger for applicants
from alumni families than it is for other applicants.24

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND IKPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
What are the implications of the results presented so far for the
optimal financial aid policy of one selective institution, Cornell University.
Subject to the proviso that all of our results should be considered preliminary
and that one should not seriously recommend any policies
that the pattern of relevant parameters remains

categories over several years, the following

until it is shown

roughly constant across

tentative conclusiOnS are in

order.

The model of optimal financial aid policies that we presented in
Section II suggested that, other things equal, financial aid packages should

be more generous for groups that the university considers relatively more
attractive (i.e., that have greater weight in the utility function), for
groups that have lower propensities to enroll, for groups that have higher
elasticities of the probability of enrollment (i.e., the yield) with

respect to the universitys share of costs, and for group.s with higher

21

(in absolute value) elasticities of average quality with respect to the

number of applicants admitted. Table 4 summarizes the implied effect of
each of these parameters for four classes of appUcants, those with alumni
relatives, minorities, those from low—income families (defined here to he
less than $18,000) and those who are from the highest ability class (SAT
scores that exceed .1300). We arbitrarily assume, for expository purposes

that the university finds applicants from each of these groups relatively
more attractive than the average Cornell freshman applicant.25
Our results unambiguously suggest that the highest ability students
should receive above—average financial aid packages, since they tend to

have a lower propensity to enroll, a higher than average elasticity of
yield (in the endowed sector) and higher than average elasticities of
average quality with respect to

the number admitted. A financial aid policy

based on scholarly merit, within each need

class, appears to make sense for

the university.

They also support the notion that

minorities should receive larger aid

packages, other things equal, because, in addition to being relatively
attractive to the university, minorities have a lower propensity to enroll
and a higher elasticity of average quality.

The optima]-ity of such a policy

of more generous financial aid for minorities is not unambiguous, however,
in
because minorities have a relatively low elasticity of yield, especially
the endowed sector.

Results for applicants who are relatives of alumni and for applicants
from low—income families are more ambiguous.

While alumni applicants are

assumed to be relatively attractive to the university and there is some
evidence that they have higher elasticities of average quality and of yield,
their high propensity to enroll in the endowed sector may offset these

22

effects. Similarly, while

applicants

from low—income families have high

elasticities Of average quality, which call for larger aid packages they
also have low estimated elasticities of yield, which call for less—generous

packages.26 On balance, then, the model probably yields no unambiguous
implications for these groups.27

Numerous extensions and implications for future research are suggested

by our paper. In addition to the ones we have discussed so far, one might
note that our optimal financial aid model takes the financial aid packages

at other universities as given. At the theoretical level one might attempt
to model optimal financial aid policies for interdependent selective
universities, using either a cartel framework or a framework that incorporated competitors' reaction functions and seeks to ascertain the "market

equilibrium". Such a framework would make the yield functions in equation
(2) explicitly dependent upon the costs and financial aid packages at other
universities; a generalization already incorporated into our empirical work.
At the empirical level one could use the empirical results to simulate the
effects of simultaneous changes in both the institution's and its competitors'
financial aid policies.

Finally, we must stress that one's ability to apply the theoretical
model to particular institutional settings hinges on the stability of the
relative ranking of key parameters across categories of applicants over time

at an institution. For example, are the quality elasticity for minorities
and the sensitivity of yield to net price for high quality applicants both
always relatively high vis—a—vis the comparable parameters for other appli-

cants. While we have pointed out the tentative implications of our current
results for the financial aid policies at one selective institution,

23

obviously repeated replication of the empirical estimates at individual
institutions are required before the institutions should seriously consider

implementing policies based on such studies. This is especially true in a
period like the early 1980's when the external environment facing
universities is changing so rapidly.

If increases in X. led to proportionately greater reductions in

q., it would always be in the university's best interests to reduce
to zero. To avoid this, we make the innocuous assumption that total quality

units of type i applicants never decrease with the number admitted; this
requires that the elasticity of average quality with respect to the number

admitted, n. (=q!X./q1) always be greater than minus one (—1 <

7. Alternatively, one could model the university as maximizing the
indicated utility function subject to constraints that (a) its total enrollment not exceed a specified capacity and (b) that the difference between
its total student costs and the net revenue the students actually provide
not exceed the available revenue from nonstudent sources.

With a constant

marginal cost per student, unless the enrollment constraint is binding, the
two models would yield the same form of solution.

8. There is no general agreement on how one measures the adequacy
of endowments, either over time for a given university, or across universities

at a point in time (references will be added here). Equation (7) suggests
that, at least for the former, a reasonable measure is r,

the total number

of students the university can enroll if it bears the entire cost of education, perhaps computed as a fraction of its actual enrollment.

11. Although we do not pursue it here, the model can also be used to
generate results concerning the effects of increases in nonstudent forms of

revenue, such as income from endowment (R). For example, in the Cobb—

Douglas utility function case, with c = c. = constant

13. There have been several earlier institutionally based studies.
See, for example, Donald Elliot and Jerry Hollenhorst (1981), Randall Chapman

(1977), James Scannell (1980) and David Hopkins and William Massy (1981), Ch. 8.

None of their models are as general as ours, for example none contain data on
the characteristics of the other institution the applicant is considering
including the explicit financial aid package offered to him or her there.

14. One complication is that an individual's being observed in the sample
is conditional on his or her having applied to Cornell and been admitted.
Because of this, the error terms in (17) and (18) may not be uncorrelated
with the explanatory variables and we may confound the effects of an explana—
tory variable on the yield, with its effect on the probability of being

observed in the sample. This is nothing more than the now standard "selection
bias problem" (see James Heckman (1979)), complicated by our not observing
the characteristics of individuals who fail to apply to Cornell. We leave
it to future research in the area to address this problem.
We should also stress that different assumptions about the distribution
of error terms (e.g., log—normal) would lead to different

statistical models

(e.g., logit). While in most cases, conclusions derived from the two methods
are quite similar, individuals applying the model in future applications
might want to test for the sensitivity of their
form estimated.

of the loan package on enrollments would be smaller for classes subsequent
to the class of 1985.

20. While Table 1 suggests that the latter constraints may

be

formally valid, imposing them facilitates our testing for interactions below.

21. We include interactions with SAT scores because Cornell University
adopted a financial aid policy for the class of 1986 in which the share of
the aid package in the form of grants was higher for more tattractiveU

applicants. Attractiveness was to be determined by the individual college
admissions committees and the criteria to be applied were intentionally

left to the colleges' discretion. However, it was understood by everyone
that academic quality would play a major role. Since the ranking scheme
was not in effect for the class of 1985, the data which we have analyzed,
we use SAT score as a proxy for the ranking scheme.

22. Previous researchers have often found that students from low—
income families have larger elasticities of enrollment with respect to net
cost than do students from higher—income families (see Gregory Jackson and
George Weathersby (1975) for a review of the evidence).

These studies,

however, are typically not institutionally based and refer to the decision
to attend any college.

Numerous possible explanations exist as to why the elasticity might be

lowest for lower—income applicants. One is that they may apply to fewer
colleges and have fewer and/or less attractive alternatives. The data in
Table A2, however, suggest that this is not the case.

Lower—income students

do not apply to fewer colleges (Col. 4), do not have fewer alternatives at
which they are accepted (Col. 5), and are equally as likely to have the
option of going to another Ivy League college (Col. 6).

32

On

the other hand, the data also suggest that the scholarship packages

received by lower—income

applicants at Cornell are relativel.y more attractive

vis—a--vis the other college's offer than they

of

are

for other

income classes

applicants. Contrasting the Cornell net cost (Col. 2) with the net cost

of the alternative (Col. 3), one observes that Cornell is substantially
"cheaper" for the lowest income applicants ($5,000 in the endowed and $4,200

in the statutory) than the alternative college. The differential for other
income classes of aid applicants is much smaller; in some cases the Cornell
net cost proves to be higher.

Given that Cornell has chosen to be more generous to its lower—income
applicants than other colleges, it is not surprising t1iat their applicants'

net cost elasticity is lower. Two factors enter in here. First, a 10 percent increase in their Cornell net cost represents a uiuch smaller absolute
increase in costs than it does a comparable percentage increase for higher—

income applicants (Col. 2). Second, such a percentage increase in the Cornell
net cost would hardly influence the gap between the net cost at Cornell and
the alternative, for lower—income applicants, while it would virtually
eliminate the gap for other income classes of applicants.

23. Family income data is available only for accepted financial aid
applicants and hence the elasticities by income class cannot be computed
for the larger sample.

24. One statistical issue should be noted here.

Since the SAT score

of the th applicant is used in the construction of the average quality
score for the first m applicants, for all m great.er than n — 1,

it is

likely that a complicated form of serial correlation is introduced into the

residuals implicit in (20) and (21). Because of this, the reported standard
errors in Table 3 probably overstate the precision of the estimates in the
table.

33

One way around this problem, suggested to us by our colleague Bob
Hutchens, is to try to estimate the parameters of the average quality functic'ri

from data on themarginal quality of each applicant. For example, suppose

the quality of the th ranked applicant is given by

(i)

cl0j

or log q. = log

+ n log j

In this case, the average quality of the first j applicants is

- f qdX = -- JcL0XdX =

(ii)

q(j) =

(iii)

log q(j) =

log

in

or

(cz0/n+l) + n log j

But (iii) is nothing more than (20) in the text and hence estimation of (i)

will allow one to recover estimates of n, without worrying about the serial
correlation problem.

When this was done, the pattern of results proved to be virtually identical

to those reported in the text. Since not all average quality equations
correspond to easily estimable marginal quality equations, we have chosen to
emphasize the former in the text.

25. Children of alumni might be considered relatively more attractive
because of the belief that failure to admit them will result in reduced

alumni giving. To our knowledge, there is no evidence on this point, however.
26. Note that if the elasticity of the yield curve had been greater
for low—income students, as previous studies suggest (see footnote 22),

unambiguously it would be optimal to give low—income students more generous
financial aid packages. Moreover, one should recall that we have argued
(see footnote 22) that it is the university's relatively generous financial

34

aid policies for these students that in fact leads to their less elastic
yield curve.

categories if one were willing to adopt explicit functional forms for

all of the equations in the model, including the weight each category should

receive in the utility function. Hoenack (1971) adopted such a strategy.
