The Effects of Overseas Investment on Domestic Employment
Tain-Jy Chen and Yin-Hua Ku
NBER Working Paper No. 10156
December 2003
JEL No. F13, F15
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we study the effects of FDI on domestic employment by examining the data
of Taiwan’s manufacturing industry. Treating domestic production and overseas production as two
distinctive outputs from a joint production function, we may estimate the effect of overseas
production on the demand for domestic labor. We found that overseas production generally reduces
the demand for domestic labor as overseas products serve as a substitute for primary inputs in
domestic production (substitution effect). But overseas production also allows the investor to expand
its domestic output through enhanced competitiveness. The expanded domestic output leads to more
employment at home (output effect).
The net effect of FDI on domestic employment is a combination of substitution and output
effects. For Taiwan, the net effect is positive in most cases but it differs across the labor group.
Technical workers tend to benefit most from FDI, followed by managerial workers, and blue-collar
workers benefit the least; indeed they may even be adversely affected. This suggests that after FDI,
a reconfiguration of division of labor within a firm tend to shift the domestic production toward
technology and management intensive operations.

INTRODUCTION
It has long been a concern of policymakers that foreign direct investment (FDI) may
cause job losses at home; indeed, labor unions generally consider FDI to be the
equivalent of job exporting. The logic is simple; as production lines are relocated
overseas, gone with them are the workers that served the domestic lines. This
reasoning is of course over-simplistic, because there could never be any guarantees
that the production lines that were relocated overseas would have been able to survive
the competition had they remained at home. If these production lines were to be
eliminated anyway, then their relocation does not result in any job losses.
Conversely, there is always the possibility that overseas investment might well
enhance the overall competitiveness of the investing company and therefore boost job
opportunities at home which would otherwise have been swept away by competition.
Ku (1998), for example, found that FDI enabled Taiwanese enterprises to restructure
themselves, and therefore increase their tenacity. They showed that firms engaging in
overseas production had a better chance of survival than those that were not.
Those who are concerned about the adverse effects of overseas investment on
domestic employment basically assume that overseas production is a substitute for
exports; hence, as exports fall, so does employment. This is a conventional argument
along the lines of Mundell (1957) who showed very elegantly, in a 2×2 model, that capital
movement is equivalent to trade. Products produced in overseas locations not only replace
exports, they may also in fact be re-imported back home to substitute the product lines
that were previously imported to serve the home market (Liu and Lin 2001). There are,
however, counter-arguments to Mundell’s ‘perfect substitution’ theory. Markusen
(1983), for example, demonstrated the theoretical possibility that FDI and trade are
complementary rather than substitutes; therefore, the relationship between FDI and
job opportunities at home is indeed an empirical question.
1

Brainard and Riker (1997a, 1997b) directly estimated the substitution elasticities
between employment in parent companies and their foreign affiliates, as well as those
between different affiliates, and found a very low degree of substitution between
parent and affiliate employment, although there was a high degree of substitution
between affiliates in developing counties. They also found that the relationship
between employment in industrialized country affiliates and in developing countries
was complementary rather than substituting.
Slaughter (1995) had earlier found a similar low degree of substitution between
parent and affiliate employment when only production workers were considered. He
noted that the employment of production workers did not seem to be systematically
related to relative wages between the parent and the affiliate. This suggests that
overseas employment corresponds only weakly to the wage gap between home and
host countries, although it may correspond strongly to the wage gap between different
overseas locations. Hatzius (1997) and Döhrn (1997) found similar results for Sweden
with overseas employment of Swedish multinational firms corresponding to wages in
actual and potential host countries, but not to wages in Sweden. Blomstrom and
Kokko (2000) also discovered that Swedish multinationals relate to domestic policies
rather than wages in determining whether to keep production at home.
This evidence suggests that overseas production and domestic production is
closely related, but not necessary substitutable. In fact, there must be a division of
labor between the parent and affiliates since FDI is an action taken to enhance the
competitiveness of a company. To the extent that FDI reduces the costs of the parent’s
operations, it also helps the parent to expand its level of output, which in turn,
increases employment at home. Blomstrom, et. al. (1997), for example, found that
overseas investment in developing countries by US firms did have the effect of
replacing domestic employment, but the same investment in developed countries did
2

not; the replacement effect was, however, limited to production workers.
Findings that the employment effect from FDI may differ across labor groups are
important, for this implies that FDI has important consequences for income distribution.
For example, the examination of Swedish firms by Blomstrom, et. al. (1997) found that
FDI contributes to growth in employment of unskilled labor at home because Swedish
multinationals were investing abroad to acquire skilled workers to engage in R&D and
other skills-intensive activities. Lipsey’s (1994) study of US multinationals also found
that overseas affiliates allow the parent to employ more managerial and technical staff at
the same level as in their domestic production. Feenstra (1996) showed that FDI in
Mexico by US firms increased the demand at home for skilled workers vis-à-vis unskilled
workers, thus raising the relative wage of skilled workers, and worsening income
distribution for the investing country; whereas the reverse occurred in Mexico.
There is an indirect, but nevertheless very important, linkage between FDI and
domestic employment; that is, the effect of FDI on domestic investment. If FDI
outflows are accompanied by an equal reduction in the amount of domestic
investment, then FDI may still reduce job opportunities at home even if overseas
production is complementary to domestic production; Feldstein (1994) also seems to
suggest such a one-to-one substitution effect. Stevens and Lipsey (1992) also found a
negative relationship between FDI and domestic investment; although not as clear as
one-to-one replacement; however, Bayoumi and Lipworth’s (1997) study of the case
in Japan found no displacement effect on domestic investment from FDI. Again, the
actual relationship is therefore an empirical question.
The purpose of this paper is therefore to examine the relationship between FDI and
domestic employment at firm level, using Taiwan’s manufacturing industry as an example.
We find that overseas production leads to an increase in the domestic employment of
managerial and technical workers, but may also reduce the employment available to
3

unskilled workers. Overseas production partially replaces inputs to domestic production,
resulting in a decline in labor demand at a given output level; however, at the same time
overseas production reduces the costs of domestic production, leading to an expansion in
output. These input-replacement and output-expansion effects combine to a produce a net
effect which is positive in most cases, although the net effect differs with different labor
groups and the geographical location of overseas investment.
AN

OVERVIEW

OF

TAIWAN’S

FDI

AND

MANUFACTURING

EMPLOYMENT
Taiwanese firms made only sporadic outward investment before 1980. Beginning in
the mid-1980s, Taiwanese firms started making more substantial foreign investment,
driven by rising wages and rising value of Taiwanese currency, NT. Between
1987-1990, Southeast Asia and USA were the major destinations of Taiwan’s foreign
investment. In the early 1990s, China emerged in the FDI map and eventually became
the most popular destination for Taiwanese investors. In the second half of the 1990s,
China took up almost a half of Taiwan’s total amount of outward investment (see
Table 1). The manufacturing sector accounted for the majority of overseas investment,
dominating the service and agriculture sectors. In the manufacturing sector, FDI is
most active in the electronics, chemical, and textile industries. FDI appears to have
important consequences on domestic employment.

Manufacturing employment in Taiwan reached a peak in 1987 when 2.821 million
people were working in the manufacturing sector; thereafter, there was a general decline
in manufacturing employment until it hit a trough in 1994, when 2.422 million people
were working in the sector. It then started to recover through the mid- to late-1990s, with
2.655 million people being employed in the manufacturing sector by 2000 (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Manufacturing employment, 1981-2000

The available employment data suggests that the period 1987-1994 was a time
when Taiwan’s industry underwent dramatic restructuring. Whilst there were losses of
399,000 manufacturing jobs throughout that period, there was nevertheless an
increase in employment in the service sector of around 1.385 million, more than
enough to offset these losses. Thus, unemployment rates remained at low levels
throughout the 1990s.
5

It is also worth noting that 1987 was around the time when Taiwanese firms began
to embark on the course of FDI, with more than US$43 billion being invested overseas
from 1987 to 2000. Between 1987 and 1992, FDI was concentrated in Southeast Asia
where Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia took the lion’s share of Taiwan’s overseas
investment; however, from 1992 onwards, the focus for FDI shifted to China. After the
1997 Asian financial crisis, FDI in Southeast Asia came to a virtual standstill whereas
FDI in China continued to surge. In 2001, the global recession saw Taiwan’s
unemployment rate reaching an unprecedented 4 per cent; thus there were heightened
fears that FDI may have led to rising unemployment at home.
Beneath the surface of a relatively stable employment situation in the 1990s,
there was a rather dramatic transformation taking place in the industrial structure.
Amongst 22 two-digit industries in the manufacturing sector, 12 had increased their
employment levels whereas the remaining 10 had seen their employment levels
falling. The most rapid increase in employment occurred in the electronics industry in
which 145,748 new jobs had been generated between 1991 and 2000, representing a
24.3 per cent increase on the 1990 level. It was probably no coincidence that the
electronics industry was also the industry that was most active in undertaking outward
investment. In contrast, employment in the apparel industry recorded the largest
number of job losses, at 54,104, representing a loss of more than one-third of its initial
1991 employment level. However, FDI from the apparel industry was also substantial;
thus, the relationship between FDI and domestic employment is unclear, to say the
least. In the following section, we will examine this relationship in more detail.
THE STATISTICS ON FDI AND EMPLOYMENT
In this section, we present the employment data revealed by Taiwan’s Manufacturing
Census, and relate this to FDI. The census data are collected at plant level, but are
6

then aggregated into firm-level data; all of the following statistics are reported at firm
level since it is considered that FDI is decided at firm level rather than plant level.
Changes in employment between 1993 and 200 are studied, with 1993 having been
chosen as the starting year because this was the first time that a comprehensive set of
FDI statistics was collected in the census; 2000 is chosen as the terminal year because
this was the most recent census year. A total of 75,101 firms are included in the 1993
census, of which 49,260 had survived until 2000, whilst the remaining 25,841 had
exited the market during the period under study. 27,585 new firms had entered the
market between 1993 and 2000, with these new entries during this eight-year period
representing 36.7 per cent of the stock of firms in the initial year, and the exiting firms
representing 34.4 per cent of the stock, a characteristically high turnover rate for
Taiwan’s industry (Aw, et. al., 2001). All firms that have shown up in either the 1993
census or the 2000 census come to a total of 102,686, which forms our sample for
comparison.
We classify all sample firms into two categories, the FDI group and the non-FDI
group. The FDI group includes all firms that have undertaken overseas investment,
and the non-FDI group includes those that have not undertaken any such investment.
Although there are some missing data, the census does cover the majority of
manufacturing firms. The total employment figures in the sample were 2,155,672
persons for 1993, and 2,291,396 for 2000, representing 89.8 per cent and 92.9 per cent
respectively of the total employment estimated by the statistics authorities during the
two census years.
We tabulate the turnover of sample firms in Table 2, which shows that there were
4,283 firms in the FDI group, and 98,403 firms in the non-FDI group. Although, in
terms of the number of firms, the FDI group accounted for just 4.3 per cent of the
manufacturing sector (ignoring the missing data), it nevertheless accounted for 28.23
7

per cent of total employment within the sector, which suggests that firms engaging in
overseas investment are relatively large in size.

Out of the 4,283 firms in the FDI group, 3,743 firms were already in existence in
1993; the remainder was made up of new firms that entered during the period under
study. From the initial 1993 cohort, 2,843 had survived the competition and remained
active within the industry in 2000, representing a 76.0 per cent survival rate.
Meanwhile, out of the 98,403 firms in the non-FDI group, 71,358 firms were
already in existence in 1993, and 46,417 firms had survived up until 2000,
representing a 65.0 per cent survival rate. Simple statistics suggest that those firms
that were engaged in overseas investment had a higher survival rate, supporting the
findings of Ku (1998) which, in a study of Taiwan’s electronics industry, showed that
FDI did indeed increase the probability of survival.
Within our sample, the FDI group accounted for 28.23 per cent of all
manufacturing sector employment in 1993, but by 2000, this figure had risen to 30.10
per cent. If we count only those firms that were in existence in 1993, the employment
share in 2000 was 27.28 per cent, representing only a slight fall on the 1993
proportion despite the fact that a quarter of them had been eliminated in the interim
period. In contrast, the non-FDI group accounted for 71.77 per cent of all
manufacturing sector employment in 1993, and 69.90 per cent in 2000. However, if
8

new entrants are excluded, the surviving firms in the non-FDI group account for only
46.06 per cent of employment in 2000. Simple statistics again suggest that FDI
enabled investing firms to maintain more jobs at home.
It is worth noting that firms that exited the manufacturing industry during the
period under study eliminated 478,369 jobs, or 22.2 per cent of the total employment
in 1993. These losses were more than offset by the 610,962 jobs created by new
entrants coming into the industry during the eight-year period. Total employment
provided by those firms that survived the period is virtually unchanged; however,
employment per firm increased by 12.0 per cent in the FDI group, in contrast to the
5.7 per cent decline in the non-FDI group.
THE EFFECT OF INVESTMENT LOCATION
As demonstrated by Lipsey (1994) and Blomstrom, et. al. (1997), the employment
effect of FDI may differ by investment location; thus, we should also examine the
data on Taiwan to see whether geographical location matters. Taiwanese FDI has been
concentrated in China since the early 1990s; however, there is one perspective which
argues that investment in China is potentially more harmful to domestic employment
than FDI in other regions. The reason for this, so the argument goes, is because of the
cultural proximity and similarity in labor skills, with production in China being likely
to duplicate what had previously been done in Taiwan and therefore exerting a strong
substitution effect on domestic employment.

In order to examine the location effect, we classify those firms undertaking
overseas investment into four subgroups according to the location of their investment.
The first subgroup contains firms undertaking investment in China only; the second
subgroup contains firms investing in China plus other regions; the third subgroup
9

contains firms investing in regions other than China; and the fourth subgroup contains
firms with unknown FDI locations. Table 3 provides details of the level of
employment for the four respective subgroups in 1993 and 2000.

As the table shows, of the 2,843 firms that undertook overseas investment and
survived the 1993-2000 period, 1,048 had invested only in China, 630 had invested in
China and somewhere else, 692 had invested only outside of China and the remainder
had invested in unknown regions. Those investing only in China were apparently
smaller in size as their average employment was only 116.58 in 1993, substantially
lower than the average employment level for the entire FDI group; furthermore, the
average employment of this subgroup declined again, to 107.55 employees, in 2000.
In contrast, the subgroup investing only outside of China registered the highest
growth rate in employment of all the subgroups, at 33.49 per cent, whilst firms that
invested in China and other regions saw their employment rise by 16.99 per cent.
This seems to suggest that investing only in China undermines the investor’s
capacity to maintain jobs at home; however, this conclusion is somewhat premature as
there are other factors that may affect domestic employment after an enterprise invests
abroad. Two obvious factors are firm size and industry. It is well established within
the literature that firm size is positively correlated to the ability to invest abroad
(Caves 1971; 1996). Large firms may therefore be more capable of undergoing
internal restructuring after they have invested abroad and therefore more capable of
10

maintaining jobs at home (Chen and Ku, 2000).
Industry is also an important factor because a high-growth industry provides more
opportunities for firms to diversify after they have invested abroad. In order to test the
size and industry effects, we make a two-way classification of firms according to their
size and industry affiliations; firms that employ more than 300 persons are classified as
large firms, the rest are small firms. Industries that have grown by more than 30 per
cent in output between 1993 and 2000 are considered to be ‘high-growth’ industries,
otherwise they are ‘low-growth’ industries; the demarcation line of 30 per cent is the
average growth rate in entire manufacturing output for the period under study.
We apply analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine how much FDI location
matters when controlling for industry and size, and vice versa; the results are shown
in Table 4 which indicates that when controlling for investment location, employment
growth is significantly affected by both industry and size. Firms in the high-growth
industries show a significantly higher employment growth rate than those in the
low-growth industries, whilst large firms show a significantly higher employment
growth rate than small firms.

When both industry and firm size are controlled for, investment location becomes
inconsequential, except for the small-firm group where those investing in China only
registered the lowest employment growth rate, as compared to those investing outside
of China. This seems to suggest that job displacement, if there is any, may affect small

11

firms that choose to invest solely in China.
ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF FDI ON EMPLOYMENT
In this section, we estimate the statistical effects of FDI on employment, using a
production function to portray the relationship between domestic and overseas
operations. We basically treat overseas operation and domestic operation as joint
production which can be portrayed by an appropriate production function. The output
from overseas production may serve as an intermediate input to domestic production,
thereby reducing the cost of domestic production; by so doing, this reduces the
demand for domestic primary inputs, including labor. The output from overseas
production may also add to the burden of domestic operations if it requires managerial
and technical support from the headquarters. Here, we treat the output from both
overseas and domestic operations as two joint outputs from centrally-managed
production aimed at minimizing overall costs.
We employ the generalized Leontief production function developed by Diewert
(1971) and Hall (1973) to portray a cross-border operation yielding two distinctive
outputs Y1 and Y2; where Y1 is the output from domestic operations and Y2 is that from
foreign operations. There are three kinds of labor inputs to production, namely
managerial workers, technical workers and blue-collar workers. Labor is finely
classified because we are concerned about the effects of FDI on different kinds of
labor, given the complexity of the international division of labor. Three kinds of
workers constitute a composite labor input underlying which is a sub-production
function. The relationship between this composite labor input and capital is a Leontief
relationship; therefore the demand for labor can be solely determined by output levels
and wages, irrespective of capital input. We can therefore depict the cost function of
the composite labor as follows:

Although generalized Leontief production function restricts the production
technology to be constant returns to scale, it does allow the elasticity of substitution
(or complementarity) between three kinds of labor to be flexible. The
inter-relationship between different kinds of labor in production is the focus of our
study.
Using Shepherd’s lemma, we may derive the labor demand equation for each
kind of worker:

We may use seemingly unrelated regressions to estimate Equation (1), taking into
consideration the fact that disturbance terms in the three single equations may be
somehow correlated. In undertaking the regression, we should impose cross-equation
restrictions on parameters to ensure that the same estimate is produced for any parameter
that appears in more than one equation. From the parameter estimates, we can easily
measure the effects of Y1 and Y2 on each kind of labor demand, as shown in Equation (1).
In order to measure the quantity of labor, data was drawn from the latest survey
on employment undertaken by Taiwan’s Bureau of Labor Affairs (BOLA) in 1999.
The survey classifies labor into nine categories, but these nine categories are far too
many to handle and also contain many zeros; therefore, they are combined into three
categories to suit our purposes: (i) supervisors (managers), administrative and
professional staff are classified as managerial workers; (ii) engineers, technicians and
specialists are classified as technical workers; and (iii) operators, laborers and service
workers are classified as blue-collar workers. The raw data drawn from the three
small labor categories are converted into a large category, using the Divisia index,
with each sample mean being normalized to unity. We thus obtained the measures for

L1 (managerial workers), L2 (technical workers), and L3 (blue-collar workers).
Wage rates W1, W2, W3 are obtained by dividing the respective total wage bills by
the measures of L1, L2 and L3. The data for domestic output (Y1) and overseas output
(Y2) are obtained from the 1999 Survey on Overseas Investment by Manufacturing

Firms undertaken by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA). This survey also
provides information on investment locations, but it only covers manufacturing firms
that possess overseas affiliates. The BOLA and MOEA surveys are combined to yield
394 observations, all of which are firms engaged in FDI. We then randomly drew 140
non-FDI firms from the BOLA survey in order to supplement the observations using
14

firms without overseas affiliates. The total of 140 was taken so as to make the ratio of
FDI to non-FDI firms roughly 3:1. The combined sample of 534 firms form the basis
of our regression analysis, but only 451 of them contain complete data for entry into
the regression estimation. Both MOEA and BOLA surveys covered firms of all sizes,
so there is no selection bias problem associated with size. The regression results are
shown in Table 5.

If we fit the parameter estimates into Equations (2) and (3), we obtain the estimated
effects of Y1 and Y2 on labor demand. The values of Y1 and Y2, and W1, W2 and W3, are
taken to be the sample means. We estimate these effects for firms investing in different
locations as we did in the previous section. The results are shown in Table 6.

Note: Domestic and overseas production is estimated in NT$ billions.

It can be seen from Table 6 that the demand for all kinds of labor increases with an
increase in domestic output. For example, for those firms investing in China only, the
demand for managerial workers increases by 0.1760 for each NT$ billion (Taiwanese
currency) increase in domestic output (as Y1 is measured in NT$ billions). Since the
Divisia index for labor has been normalized, this figure implies that in comparison with
16

the sample mean, there is an increase of 17.60 per cent in managerial workers. Similarly
for each NT$ billion increase in domestic output, the demand for technical workers
increases by 29.88 per cent, and the demand for blue-collar workers increases by 14.12
per cent. The results indicate that by 1999, the expansion in domestic production had
led to an expansion in all three kinds of labor, although technical personnel tended to
benefit the most, followed by managerial staff, and then blue-collar workers the least.
This pattern prevails across all investment locations, despite the fact that firm size
differs significantly across different subgroups. This implies that the output effect on
employment is mainly driven by the nature of technology which, as Taiwanese industry
intensifies its technology content, tends to favor technical workers.
Table 7 lists the mean values of Y1 and Y2 for the different FDI subgroups. It can
be seen that the subgroup of firms investing in China only is the smallest of the three
groups in terms of domestic output, followed by the subgroup investing in China plus
other regions, with the subgroup investing only outside of China being the largest.
However, the subgroup investing in China and other regions also has the highest
overseas production ratio, at 0.702, followed by the ‘China only’ subgroup at 0.475,
and then the ‘outside China’ subgroup at 0.292.

Referring back to Table 6 also shows that overseas production has exerted a
uniformly negative effect on each kind of labor, which suggests that when holding
domestic output constant, domestic employment for a firm engaging in overseas
production will decline by between 2 per cent and 8 per cent. This implies that
overseas production complements domestic production and therefore reduces the need
17

for labor inputs at any given output level. However, we should not jump to the
conclusion that overseas production reduces domestic employment, because such a
complementary relationship also cuts down the cost of domestic production, thus
enhancing the competitiveness of the company as a whole, which in turn, may lead to
an expansion in domestic output. In other words, overseas production exerts a
substitution effect which reduces the demand for labor at any given domestic output,
as well as an output effect which expands domestic production. The net result has to
take both effects into account, thus, it is the output effect to which we now turn.
We take the Manufacturers Census data, and choose the firms that have survived
throughout the period under study, to explore the effects of FDI on domestic output. A
simple regression is employed to estimate this effect:
LY 99 = α 0 + α 1LY 93 + α 2 DFI 1 + α 3 DFI 2 + α 4 DFI 3 + α 5 DFI 4 + α 6 IND

(4)

where the variables are as follows:
LY 99 : logarithm of domestic output in 1999;
LY 93 : logarithm of domestic output in 1993;

DFI 1 : dummy variable for firms investing in China only;

DFI 2 : dummy variable for firms investing in China and other regions;
DFI 3 : dummy variable for firms investing only outside China;

DFI 4 : dummy variable for firms investing in unknown regions;
IND :

dummy variable for high-growth industries.

In Equation (4), we use the output in the base year (i.e. 1993), to project the
output in the future year, 1999. Thus the coefficient α 1 reflects the average growth
rate between 1993 and 1999. The dummy variables, DFI1 - DFI4, capture the extra
growth attributable to overseas investments and the dummy variable, IND, captures
18

the extra growth attributable to industry affiliation. Included in the regression analysis
were a total of 50,164 firms that survived the 1993-1999 period. The results are
reported in Table 8, which shows that the coefficients for dummy variables, DFI1 -

DFI4, were all positive and statistically significant. This suggests that foreign
investment does indeed contribute to extra growth in output after controlling for the
industry effect.

Compared to non-FDI firms, firms investing only in China recorded extra growth
of 18 per cent over the 1993-1999 period; those firms that invested in China and other
regions gained an extra 51.7 per cent; and those whose investment was only outside of
China achieved 46.4 per cent growth. The gains may be different, but other things
being equal, FDI has indeed expanded their domestic output.
We can therefore estimate the output effect of FDI on domestic production, using
these estimates; that is, our aim is to estimate the additional domestic output which is
attributable to FDI.
Taking the estimate of α in equation (4), this would be ∆ Y 1 = Y 1 •  α 1 + α





where α corresponds to the location of investment. This output effect is to be
added to the substitution effect to come up with the net effect of overseas production
on domestic labor demand; thus, the total effect of FDI on domestic labor Li is:

where the first term reflects the output effect and the second term reflects the
substitution effect.
Inserting the relevant parameter estimates into Equation (5), using the relations
established in Equation (4), we obtain the estimates for total employment effect
arising from FDI. These are shown in Table 9.

It can be seen from Table 9 that the total employment effects on FDI are positive
for all kinds of labor and for all investment locations, with the exception of those
investments undertaken outside of China. For the sub-group investing only outside of
China, domestic employment of blue-collar workers is adversely affected by FDI (a
decline of 2.37 per cent). The table also shows that technical workers are the biggest
winners from FDI; regardless of the investment locations, the greatest increase is in the
domestic employment of technical workers. We interpret this outcome as reflecting the
fact that domestic production in recent years has been restructured towards more
technology-intensive methods. Managerial workers also gain substantially from FDI,
but not as much as their technical counterparts. Blue-collar workers gain the least and
they may occasionally even lose. Capital outflow favoring technical workers was also
found in Feenstra (1996), whilst Blomstrom, et. al. (1997) found that it favored
managerial staff. In short, FDI may well affect different labor groups in different ways,
but the overall effect is more likely to be positive than negative. The group which is
most likely to feel any negative effects is the blue-collar group of workers.
It is noticeable that firms simultaneously investing in China and other regions
20

create the greatest proportion of new jobs at home. We take this subgroup of firms to
be truly in pursuit of globalization, since globalization leads to an expansion of
domestic production. This also manifests itself in the largest parameter estimate for
DFI2 amongst all DFIs. Those investing only in China do not create as much demand

for technical and managerial workers at home because production in China is
characterized by a low technology requirement and simple production arrangements.
Going back to Table 3 in which domestic employment is shown to decline for
firms investing only in China, we may conclude that FDI, per se, is not to blame for
the plight of labor; it is instead the fact that these investors belong to low-growth (or
even declining) industries, as well as being small in size, that account for their
inability to maintain their employment levels at home. In addition to the industry
effect, the fact that the ‘China-only’ group did not generate as much output expansion
effect as the other investment groups also contributes to their below-par performance.
Although China production enhances the competitiveness of domestic production, just
like other overseas production, it also takes market opportunities away from Taiwan
because Chinese and Taiwanese suppliers are often viewed by foreign buyers
(particularly in the Western markets) as close substitutes.
CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we study the effects of FDI on domestic employment by examining the data
of Taiwan’s manufacturing industry. In terms of growth in their number of employees,
those firms investing abroad have outperformed those firms that have not undertaken
such investment. Moreover, firms that have invested abroad have a higher probability of
survival than the ‘have-nots’; survival relies upon maintaining jobs at home.
Treating domestic production and overseas production as two distinctive but
interrelated outputs from a joint production function, we may estimate the effects of
21

overseas production on domestic production, and thereafter, the consequences for
domestic employment. Our study of Taiwanese manufacturing data indicates that
overseas production reduces the demand for labor in domestic operations at any given
domestic output. This implies that through ‘joint production’, overseas production
reduces the input requirements at home to yield a given domestic output. In other words,
overseas production substitutes for primary inputs in the domestic production process.
From a presumption of cost-minimization, this implies that overseas production
complements domestic production to reduce the overall costs of cross-border
operations, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of a company; this is to be
achieved through a division of labor between the headquarters and the affiliates. Such
enhanced competitiveness, in turn, helps firms to expand their domestic output, which
leads to an increase in the demand for labor. Therefore, the total effect of FDI on
domestic employment is a combination of output expansion effect and input
substitution effect. Our estimates show that, in most cases, the output expansion effect
more than offsets the input substitution effect to yield a net positive effect on domestic
employment; however, the magnitude of employment effect arising from FDI differs
across different labor groups.
In the case of Taiwan, technical workers tend to benefit most from FDI, followed
by managerial workers, with blue-collar workers benefiting the least; indeed they may
even be adversely affected. This implies that after overseas investment has taken place,
a reconfiguration of the division of labor within a firm will tend to shift domestic
production toward technology- and management-intensive operations.
Different investment locations exert slightly different impacts on domestic
employment mainly because of the differences in output expansion effect. Those firms
that invest only in China contribute the least to the expansion of domestic output,
followed by firms that invest only outside of China, whilst FDI covering both China
22

and other regions is most conducive to domestic output expansion.
