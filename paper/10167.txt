The Formation of International Production and Distribution Networks in East Asia
Mitsuyo Ando and Fukunari Kimura
NBER Working Paper No. 10167
December 2003
JEL No. F1, F2
ABSTRACT
The international production and distribution networks consist of vertical production chains and
distribution networks extended across a number of countries.

This paper claims that the

international production and distribution networks in East Asia present distinctive characters in their
significance in the regional economy, their geographical extensiveness involving a large number of
countries in the region, and their sophistication of both intra-firm and arm’s-length relationships
across different firm nationalities. The paper starts from reviewing crucial changes in policy
framework observed in the developing East Asian countries a decade ago and sketching the
theoretical thoughts explaining the mechanics of international production and distribution networks.
Then, the empirical part of the paper examines the micro data of Japanese corporate firms to make
a closer look at the nature of networks through the pattern of FDI after analyzing overall trade
patterns of the major East Asian countries to confirm the importance of international trade of
machinery parts and components. In addition, the paper quantifies the magnitude of economic
activities of Japanese firms through different channels of transactions, using the firm nationality
approach. The last part of the paper discusses policy implication of the networks.

1. Introduction
The East Asian region has continued to serve as the world’s growth center for
four decades.

In the background of this “East Asian miracle,” the World Bank (1993)

emphasized the existence of well-managed macroeconomic fundamentals and wisely
designed microeconomic policies.

In the last decade, the East Asian economies added

“the formation of international production/distribution networks” to their major
characteristics.
The international production/distribution networks consist of vertical
production chains extended across the countries in the region as well as distribution
networks throughout the world.

The major players are corporate firms belonging to

the machinery industries including general machinery, electrical machinery, transport
equipment, and precision machinery though some firms in other industries such as
textiles and garment also develop the networks.

While the formation of similar

networks is observed between Germany and Hungary/Czech and between the U.S. and
Mexico, the ones in East Asia are distinctive at least at this moment in time in the
following characteristics: first, they have already become a substantial component of
each country’s economy in the region.

Each country’s manufacturing activities and

international trade cannot be discussed without the networks anymore.

Second, the

networks involve a large number of countries at different income levels.

Cross-

country differences in factor prices and other location advantages seem to be effectively
utilized in the formation of vertical production chains.

Third, the networks include

both intra-firm and arm’s-length relationships, partially across different firm
nationalities. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) as well as indigenous firms in each
country are forming sophisticated inter-firm relationships.
The formation of international production/distribution networks in East Asia
was initiated by drastic changes in development strategies of each country.

In the mid-

1980s and the early 1990s, the East Asian developing economies started applying new
development strategies in which the benefit from hosting FDI is aggressively explored.
The new development strategies do emphasize the utilization of market forces, but they
are not simple laissez-faire policies; rather, pursue new roles of government
involvement in the process of development.

East Asia is presenting a model of new

development strategies in the globalization era.
The development of international production/distribution networks in East
3

Asia has also provided substantial impact on our academic thought on trade and FDI
patterns.

The traditional comparative advantage theory still has a certain explanatory

power in the interpretation of across-industry location choices, based on international
differences in technological level and factor prices.

The enhanced importance of the

trade in intermediate goods as well as the industrial clustering, however, has stimulated
the development of new theoretical thoughts in international trade theory, particularly in
the literature of fragmentation theory and agglomeration theory.

In addition, the

sophisticated pattern of intra-firm corporate structure and inter-firm relationship
developed in East Asia has inspired research to incorporate the analysis of corporate
behavior into international trade theory beyond the traditional approach of trade and
FDI.
The purpose of this paper is to confirm the importance of international
production/distribution networks in East Asia.

Although it is difficult to directly

observe the detailed mechanics of the networks with comprehensive statistics, there
exist various side-evidences as well as theoretical discussions reinforcing the argument.
The next section briefly reviews drastic changes in policy framework observed in the
Southeast Asian countries and China in the latter half of the 1980s and the early 1990s.
Section 3 sketches the current status of theoretical thoughts explaining the mechanics of
international production/distribution networks.

Then, the paper turns to statistical

analysis on the characteristics of the networks in East Asia.

Section 4 presents overall

trade patterns of major East Asian countries and confirms the importance of machinery
trade.

Section 5 utilizes the micro data of Japanese corporate firms and makes a closer

look at the nature of networks through the pattern of FDI.

Section 6 quantifies the

magnitude of economic activities of Japanese firms in different channels of transactions
following the firm nationality approach proposed by Baldwin and Kimura (1998).
Section 7 discusses policy implication of the networks and concludes the paper.
2. Drastic changes in development strategies
Why has an extensive international production/distribution networks been
formulated in East Asia, and not in other regions such as Latin America? One of the
crucial factors is the set of policies implemented by the East Asian developing

4

economies from the mid-1980s or the early 1990s.1
Most of the East Asian economies have traditionally applied a “dual track
approach,” that is, an approach trying to foster both import-substituting industries and
export-oriented industries at the same time.

There was, however, an important

difference between forerunners (i.e., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) and latecomers (i.e., the
Southeast Asian countries and China); the latter actively utilized incoming FDI not only
in export-oriented industries but also in some major import-substituting industries such
as automobiles, domestic electric appliances, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and
others.
While the latecomer countries have maintained the dual track approach
throughout their path of industrialization, they have changed the weights between
import-substituting industries and export-oriented industries over time.

From the

1970s to the mid-1980s, these countries introduced selective FDI primarily in importsubstituting industries.

At that time, potentially competing domestic industries were

insulated by policies that limit the activities of foreign companies only in
geographically segregated places such as export-processing zones though FDI for export
promotion was indeed invited.

From 1985 or 1986 in Malaysia and Thailand and 1991

or 1992 in the Philippines, Indonesia, and China, however, they began to switch their
FDI hosting policy from selective acceptance policy to basically “accept everybody”
policy.

They started trying to host as many foreign companies as possible and

formulate industrial clusters while still keeping trade protection for import-substituting
industries.
The dual trade approach requires a complicated policy package.

What a

country has to do to invite export-oriented foreign companies is simple though difficult
to carry it out; it must provide the world’s best or second best location advantages for
incoming investors. Trade protection, of course, negatively affects location advantages.
So as to partially neutralize negative effects of import-substituting industry protection,
the Southeast Asian countries have introduced a duty drawback system, i.e., the system
of refunds of duties and indirect taxes on imported inputs in export production.
1

Kimura (2003) discusses new development strategies applied by the East Asian
economies more in detail. Pangestu (2003) provides the summarized information on
evolution in industrial policies in East Asia in the 1950s-1990s as well as policies and
measures for promoting exports in Asia.
5

Besides, various types of FDI facilitation measures are crucial to attract foreign
companies.

In particular, aggressive policy of inviting foreign small and medium

enterprises (SMEs) effectively works in the formation of industrial clusters.

These

countries have concentrated their public resources on the development of economic
infrastructure including roads, ports, electricity and water supply, telecommunications,
and industrial estate services.

At the same time, they have improved the services of

FDI-hosting agencies, ending up with yielding considerable facilitation.
It does not mean that these countries give up fostering local indigenous firms.
Instead of hastily providing protection for immature local entrepreneurs, however, they
set a short-term priority on quickly building up a critical mass of agglomeration and
hooking their economies up to international production/distribution networks by
aggressively inviting foreign companies.

The focus of local industry promotion is

shifted to enhancing capability to penetrate into vertical production chains.

Although

cleaning up inefficient import-substituting industries still has to be considered, new
development strategies with aggressively utilizing incoming FDI bear fruit in the
Southeast Asian countries and China.

This sets a sharp contrast with LDCs in other

parts of the world.
3. Supporting economic logic
What sort of economic logic explains the mechanics of international
production/distribution networks?

When discussing the international division of labor,

the theory of comparative advantage based on the relative cost of production in autarky
is still valid in a number of circumstances.

Technological gap and factor price

differences explain location patterns of industries to some extent.

In interpreting the

mechanics of international production/distribution networks, however, at least three new
lines of thought must be incorporated into our analytical framework.
The first line of thought is the fragmentation theory.

It is a powerful tool

when we analyze patterns of vertical FDI going to LDCs to formulate vertical
production links or cross-border production sharing system.2

The traditional

international trade theory primarily explains industry-wise location patterns.

2

In East

As for the fragmentation theory, see Jones and Kierzkowski (1990), Arndt and
Kierzkowski (2001), Deardorff (2001a), and Cheng and Kierzkowski (2001).
6

Asia, however, production-process-wise location patterns were often observed.
typical example is semiconductor-related electronics industry.

A

This industry as a

whole is obviously capital-intensive or human-capital intensive, but its production
activities are finely segmented and located in various places.

The fragmentation

theory neatly presents the logic behind such a location pattern.
Deardorff (2001a) defines fragmentation as “the splitting of a product process
into two to more steps that can be undertaken in different locations but that lead to the
same final product.”

Suppose that there is initially a big factory located in Japan

taking care of all the production activities from upstream to downstream.

If we

carefully look at individual production blocks, however, we may find that some
production blocks require close attention by technicians while others are purely laborintensive.

If we can locate production blocks separately in Japan, Malaysia, and China,

for instance, we may save the total production cost.

Since the East Asian countries still

have substantial differentials in labor costs, the concept of fragmentation across
different cones formalized by Deardorff (2001b) seems to be particularly useful in
understanding the nature of vertical production chains.
Fragmentation becomes economical when the cost of service links (SL)
connecting production blocks (PB) is low enough.

SL cost includes transport costs,

telecommunication costs, and various coordination costs between PBs.
heavily depends on the nature of technology in each industry.

SL cost

Globalization, however,

reduces SL cost in general and enables firms in many industries to fragment their PBs
further to reduce the total production cost.

As SL tend to carry strong external

economies of scale, the concentration of fragmented PB is often observed.

The forces

of fragmentation and agglomeration sometimes work in the opposite direction, but
globalization actually accelerates both at the same time, which results in a situation
where some countries significantly enjoy the fruit of globalization while others do not.
The second line of thought is the agglomeration theory.

3

3

This is an extension

Where to locate fragmented production blocs also depends on the nature of the
products. For instance, when case of parts and components are considerably
standardized and the delivery timing is not too delicate, firms try to find suppliers of the
cheapest products in the world. On the other hand, when parts and components are
highly customized, and closer communication with suppliers is important, they would
like to form industrial clusters.

of international trade theory with external economies of scale while introducing the
concept of “space” from city planning and other academic fields.4 Although the microfoundation of spatial agglomeration has not been fully explored, the importance of
agglomeration as a source of location advantage is increasingly recognized in both
theoretical and empirical literature.

Economies of scale or agglomeration effects do

not necessarily depend on the initial condition under autarky; in an extreme case, a
country may start having agglomeration purely by chance.

In this sense, the source of

gains of trade in the “new” international trade theory is logically different from those in
the traditional theory of comparative advantage, and such nature of the “new” theory
addresses the possibility of the new role of government.

Among the factors that

generate location advantages for MNEs to invest, agglomeration is one of the crucial
elements, particularly in LDCs.

Governments in East Asia are obviously conscious of

the potential role of government in formulating agglomeration.
The third line of thought is the internalization theory of corporate firms.
firm typically does not do everything from upstream to downstream.

A

It sets its

upstream-side boundary by purchasing materials or parts from other firms and
determines its downstream-side boundary by selling their products to other firms or
consumers.

Such a boundary setting decision is here called “internalization decision.”

In addition, a firm cuts its internalized activities into thin slices and places these slices
at appropriate places.

This is called “location decision.”

A firm makes

internalization decision and location decision at the same time, considering its own
firm-specific assets such as technology and managerial know-how.
may have different dimensions.

Internalization

For example, internalization decision would be made

across different functional activities such as financial management, personnel
management, R&D activities, parts procurement, sales activities, and others.
In East Asia, particularly in China, various kinds of internalization patterns
with innovative inter-firm relationships emerge in the effort of concentrating on core
competences.
such examples.

OEM contracts, EMS firms, and contractual/ordinary processing are
Such sophistication is particularly salient in machinery industries.

Technological progress in the line of developing “modules” accelerates the formation of

and Venables (1999).

sophisticated inter-firm relationship.

The international trade theory has not fully

digested elements of ownership advantages and internalization advantages that
Dunning’s OLI theory presents yet.5

However, the importance of internalization

choices cannot be neglected when the division of labor is at issue.

Fragmentation

theory and agglomeration theory must be combined with the internalization theory of
corporate firms.
4. Recent trade flows in East Asia
Now let us review the trade pattern of East Asia.

It is a well-known fact that

the East Asian economies have rapidly developed intra-regional trade relationships since
the early 1980s.

METI (2003) presents some basic figures.

Intra-regional trade of

East Asia grew from US$104.3 billion in 1981 to US$333.1 billion in 1991, and then
US$702.8 billion in 2001; i.e., it increased by 3.2 times in 1981-1991 and 2.1 times in
1991-2001.

Trade intensity indices among the East Asian economies also had an

upward trend, suggesting the development of increasingly closer economic
relationships.
Fukao, Ishido, and Ito (2003) decompose trade flows into one-way trade,
vertical intra-industry trade, and horizontal intra-industry trade and compare the trade
pattern in East Asia with the one in Europe.

They find that international trade in East

Asia has still a substantial amount of one-way trade but the share of vertical intraindustry trade rapidly increases.
On the top of these findings, we would like to claim that the most important
changes in the trade pattern of the region is an explosive increase in trade of machinery
parts and components.

Table 1 shows the values and shares of exports/imports of

machineries and the parts and components in major East Asian economies in 1996 and
2000.6 Machineries are here defined as HS 84-92; i.e., they include general machinery,
electric machinery, transport equipment, and precision machinery.7 To capture the
5

As for the OLI theory, see Dunning (1993, pp. 81-). Kimura (2000, 2001) analyzes
the micro data of Japanese manufacturing firms and claims that corporate structure and
inter-firm relationship are jointly chosen with the location of activities.
6
Due to the lack of data available from UN data sources, Table 1 and Figure 1 do not
include Taiwan, which has also played an important role in developing the networks in
East Asia.
7
See Table A.1 for definition of parts and components in our study.
9

features of the trade patterns in East Asia more vividly, Figure 1 summarizes the shares
of machineries and the parts and components for economies in East Asia as well as
other regions such as North/South America and Europe in 2000.

Note that Figure 1

plots countries from the one with the highest share of machinery parts and components’
exports, aiming at addressing the relative significance of machinery parts and
components’ trade among countries in various regions.
==Table 1==
==Figure 1==
An astounding fact is that the shares of machineries in each East Asian
country’s total exports and imports are indeed very large.

Except the cases of imports

for Japan and China and exports and imports for Indonesia, the shares of machinery
trade are as high as 40 percent or even higher up to 77 percent for both export and
import sides.

They imply how significant the machinery industries are in the East

Asian economies.

Furthermore, the shares of parts and components in machinery trade

are also very high; they are 40 percent to 50 percent or even reach 80 percent in cases of
the Southeast Asian countries, and the shares are further increasing even in the shirt
period between 1996 and 2000.

These suggest a large portion of back-and-forth

transactions of intermediate goods in the international production/distribution networks
in machinery industries, which are extended across a large number of countries at
different income levels in the region.
In other regions, on the other hand, higher shares of machinery trade and
those of machinery parts and components’ trade are observed only for some specific
countries such as Mexico, the U.S., Hungary, Czech Republic, and Germany (Figure 1).
These suggest the existence of networks in machinery industries between the U.S. and
Mexico and between Germany and the two East European countries but these networks
are not extensively covering a number of countries.

The fact that the shares of

machinery exports and imports are indeed high but the share of machinery parts and
components’ exports is not such high in Mexico would support the evidence where
Mexico imports machinery parts and components from the U.S., assembles them, and
exports final goods back to the U.S., rather than developing networks across
neighboring countries.
10

Moreover, other countries, particularly the ones in Latin America, present by
far lower shares of machinery exports than countries in East Asia.

At the same time,

the shares of machinery exports are much lower than the shares of machinery imports in
these countries.

They suggest that machinery industries are not well developed in

these economies yet and they are not forming networks.
In East Asia, the trade pattern is not simple one-way trade based on
international differences in resource endowments anymore.

Rather, sophisticated

vertical production chains as well as distribution connection are extended to regionwide networks.

Fragmentation is an obvious phenomenon.

The reduction of service

link costs derives from technological progress in logistics and improved policy
environment, which makes extensive fragmentation possible.

One of the motivations

for fragmentation is to take advantage of factor price differences as suggested by
Deardorff (2001b).

In addition, however, other elements of location advantages such

as service link cost and agglomeration effects are increasingly influential in the location
choices of MNEs.
Note that not all countries in East Asia are effectively connected with such
networks at this moment.

The CMLV (Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam)

countries have not been fully involved with the networks yet.

These countries have

substantially low wage levels but are not entirely successful in attracting labor-intensive
production processes.

This fact suggests that government policies to reduce service

link costs and encourage agglomeration are crucially important in order for a country to
hook up itself to international production/distribution networks.
5. Evidence from the micro data of Japanese firms
Corporate firms in the forerunners of development in the region, Japan, Korea,
and Taiwan have had strong technological competitiveness in machinery manufacturing.
Since machines are typically made of a large number of parts and components, the
competitiveness in machines depends on both the quality/production cost of parts and
components and managerial ability of vertical production networks, in which corporate
firms in East Asia particularly have their strengths.

When these firms became mature

enough to compete in international arena, and the Southeast Asian countries and China
prepared for proper policy environment in the mid-1980s and the 1990s, the formation
of international production/distribution networks was a natural consequence.
11

The networks consist of both intra-firm geographical extension and inter-firm
business relationships.

Up to the 1980s, an important component of the Japanese

economic system was the subcontracting system (shitauke in Japanese) or long-term
relationships between large downstream assemblers and upstream SMEs.8 However,
the inter-firm relationship of Japanese firms has drastically changed since Japanese
firms started to actively conduct FDI in the mid-1980s.

It is often observed that both

large assemblers and SMEs make FDI together to form a certain size of agglomeration
in Southeast Asia or China.

Even in such cases, upstream-downstream relationships

become more competitive, non-exclusive ones.

With strict cost consideration, many

Japanese firms are now open to extend their production chains to firms with other
nationalities as far as the technological level meets.
Although it is very difficult to trace the nature of such corporate relationships
by statistical figures, this section attempts to present some evidence of corporate firms’
behavior to understand the mechanics of international production/distribution networks
in East Asia by analizing the firm-level micro data of Japanese corporate firms.

Tables

in this section are constructed from either of the two sets of micro data, both of which
are conducted by Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), Government of
Japan: 1) the F/Y 1996 and F/Y 2001 Basic Survey of Business Structure and Activity
and 2) the F/Y 1999 Survey (the 27th Basic Survey) of Overseas Business Activities of
Japanese Companies.

The first firm-level database provides detailed information on

parent firms located in Japan and also the number, industry, and regional location of
their foreign affiliates.

In Tables 2 to 5, constructed from this database, foreign

affiliates are defined as those with no less than 20 percent Japanese ownership.
second database presents information on the performance of foreign affiliates.

The
In

Table 6, obtained from this database, foreign affiliates include both “affiliates abroad”
with no less than 10 percent ownership by Japanese parent firms and “affiliates of
affiliates abroad” with no less than 50 percent ownership by “affiliates abroad” (call
both of them “Japanese affiliates abroad” hereinafter). A more detailed explanation of
these databases is given in Appendix 1.
Table 2 presents (a) the number of parent firms with foreign affiliates and the

(2002).

number of foreign affiliates; (b) the number of parent firms with affiliates in East Asia
and the number of affiliates in East Asia; (c) the number of parent firms with affiliates
in North America and the number of affiliates in North America; and (d) the number of
parent firms with affiliates in Europe and the number of affiliates in Europe, by the
industry of parent firms and by the industry of affiliates in 2000.9 In 2000, 3,773 out
of 27,655 firms located in Japan (in the data set) totally have 18,943 foreign affiliates.
Among them, 2,994 firms have 10,224 affiliates in East Asia.

That is, as many as 80

percent of the Japanese firms going abroad has at least one affiliate in East Asia, and 54
percent of the foreign affiliates of Japanese firms are located in East Asia.
==Table 2==
Japanese manufacturing parent firms, particularly machinery parent firms are
active investors in East Asia; close to 70 percent of the Japanese parent firms with
affiliates in East Asia are in the manufacturing sector (Industries 120 to 320) and half of
them are in the machinery sector (290 to 320).

The pattern observed for affiliates in

East Asia by the industry of affiliates also reveals how dominant manufacturing
activities are in East Asia, which is clearly different from the patterns for affiliates in
North America or Europe.

In East Asia, 60 percent of the affiliates in the region are

manufacturing, regardless of the industries of their parent firms, while 38 percent of the
affiliates in North America and 31 percent of the affiliates in Europe are.10

The

number of affiliates actually increased in the five years, 1995-2000, from 9,132 to
10,224 in East Asia while the numbers decreased from 3,928 to 3,499 in North America
and from 3,019 to 2,913 in Europe. Manufacturing activities are dominant and have
been intensified in East Asia in terms of both Japanese parent firms and their affiliates.
Japanese SMEs with regular workers of less than 300 have greatly contributed
to such expansion of manufacturing activities in East Asia by Japanese firms.

Table 3

presents the number of Japanese parent firms with affiliates in East Asia, North America,
and Europe in 2000 by the size of parent firms and by the number of affiliates.

Asia, based on the micro data of Japanese corporate firms.

13

table shows that more than 40 percent of the Japanese firms going to East Asia are
SMEs while the shares are much lower in North America and Europe.

Furthermore,

the fact that a considerable number of firms, including SMEs, have plural affiliates in
East Asia also supports that Japanese SMEs are actively involved in manufacturing
activities in the region.

Such active FDI by Japanese SMEs in East Asia have

contributed to forming a critical mass of industrial clusters.
==Table 3==
As suggested by Table 2, Japanese parent firms do not necessarily establish
affiliates in their own industries where they have main activities.11 In general, parent
firms have various activities across industries and establish foreign affiliates in order to
conduct a subset of those activities.

Table 4 provides the detailed information on

sector switching between parent firms and their affiliates in East Asia; Table 4 (a)
includes all sized Japanese firms with affiliates and Table 4 (b) focuses on SMEs.

The

rows denote the industry of parent firms while the columns the industry of foreign
affiliates.

Thus, diagonal cells of the tables indicate the number of non-sector-

switching affiliates while off-diagonal cells denote the number of sector-switching
affiliates.
==Table 4==
In East Asia, 75 percent of the affiliates owned by all sized manufacturing
parent firms are in the manufacturing sector.12 Among them, we observe many sectorswitching manufacturing affiliates with manufacturing parent firms (in non-diagonal
cells for industries 120 to 340 in both rows and columns), in particular sector-switching
machinery affiliates with manufacturing parent firms (in non-diagonal cells for
industries 120 to 340 in rows and industries 290 to 320 in columns).

11

In addition, even

A firm often has various activities at the same time. The industrial classification of a
firm located in Japan is determined by the largest activities the concerned firm conducts
in terms of the value of sales.
12
In the case of manufacturing SMEs, the share of manufacturing affiliates is much
higher; as many as 87 percent of their affiliates are manufacturing.
14

manufacturing SMEs have sector-switching manufacturing affiliates, particularly sectorswitching machinery affiliates in East Asia, which is not often observed in North
America or Europe.

Such behavior is typical in manufacturing activities aimed at

supplying intermediate goods for other firms or for their own affiliates.

It implies that

Japanese firms have played an important role in developing vertical production
networks in the region.
Moreover, manufacturing parent firms also have non-manufacturing affiliates,
particularly in the wholesale trade sector.

Sector-switching non-manufacturing

affiliates with manufacturing parent firms (in cells for industries 120 to 340 in rows and
industries 480 and others in columns) make up 25 percent of the affiliates owned by allsized manufacturing parent firms and 13 percent of the affiliates owned by
manufacturing SMEs, suggesting that another strategy in East Asia is to establish global
production/distribution networks by internalizing wholesale trade activities.

Note that

these ratios are much smaller than in North America (49 percent for all sized firms and
48 percent for SMEs) and Europe (60 percent and 51 percent).
Before moving to the performance of Japanese affiliates abroad, let us
formally analyze the characteristics of Japanese parent firms going to East Asia.

Table

5 reports (a) the results of logit regression analysis for Japanese parent firms in all
sectors and (b) the results of Japanese manufacturing parent firms.

The dependent

variable for regression No.1 in both tables is whether a firm has foreign affiliate(s) or
not.

Similarly, the dependent variable for regression No.2/No.3/No.4 is whether a firm

has affiliate(s) in East Asia/North America/Europe.

The independent variables are the

number of regular workers (in log), tangible assets per regular workers, foreign sales,
R&D expenditure, and advertisement expenditure.13 For the whole samples, firms with
foreign affiliates are likely to have large employment size, capital-intensive technology,
large foreign sales, and large R&D expenditure.

The coefficients for both the firms’

size and R&D expenditure in the case of affiliates in East Asia are much smaller than
those in the case of North America and Europe.

It can be concluded that firms going

to East Asia are relatively small as we have descriptively discussed, and thus less R&D
intensive, compared with firms going to North America or Europe.

13

Note that variables for foreign sales, R&D expenditure, and advertisement
expenditure are in ratios to total sales.
15

==Table 5==
Table 6, in turn, focuses on the performance of Japanese affiliates in East Asia,
North America, and Europe.

The table presents (a) the destination of sales and (b) the

origin of purchases by Japanese affiliates in East Asia.

produced by Japanese affiliates in East Asia go to the local market, to Japan, or to other
East Asian countries: 49.6 percent for local, 21.9 percent for Japan, and 21.2 percent for
countries within the region except local and Japan.14 By-origin purchases by Japanese
affiliates in East Asia also show that they purchase most goods and services from the
local market (41.1 percent), or import them from Japan (33.4 percent) or from other
East Asian countries (20.7 percent).

Japan’s share in purchases is slightly higher than

in sales, probably due to the supply of complicated machinery parts and components
from Japan.15

These reveal that more than 90 percent of the sales and purchases by

Japanese affiliates are among the East Asian countries, including Japan, and suggest the
presence of active intra-regional production networks in East Asia.
==Table 6==
In the case of North America and Europe, in contrast, sales to Japan are fairly
small; 5.2 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively.

In addition, more than half of the

sales of the affiliates in the regions are from affiliates in non-manufacturing sector (59.2
percent for North America and 63.4 percent for Europe), particularly in wholesale trade
sector (47.5 percent and 44.2 percent).

This indicates that they aim to sell products in

the local market or in countries nearby rather than forming vertical chains of production
networks.
The empirical observation we have discussed may not directly prove the
relevance of three lines of new theoretical thought.

However, active FDI by Japanese

SMEs, the existence of many sector-switching manufacturing affiliates, and intra-

Contrary to popular opinion, sales to North America by Japanese affiliates in East
Asia are small (3.4 percent). Sales to Europe are also small (2.6 percent).

The share of purchases from North America is quite small.
16

regional trade by Japanese affiliates indeed imply how such logics work in developing
international production/distribution networks in East Asia.
6. Evidence from the firm nationality approach
The last section tried to capture the activities of Japanese firms in East Asia
by analyzing affiliate holdings and by-destination sales/by-origin purchases.

These

statistical figures, however, does not directly indicate the magnitude of Japanese firms’
activities in exporting from Japan and producing in East Asia and who is trading with
whom.

The amount of gross sales does not necessarily reflect the importance of each

transaction since intermediate inputs embodied in traded commodities may be counted
multiple times.

One of the ways to quantify the importance of transactions is to

introduce the concept of value added contents.
To quantify the whole Japanese firms’ activities in different locations and
embodied value added contents in international transactions, this section employs the
firm nationality approach, which is first proposed by Baldwin and Kimura (1998) and
Kimura and Baldwin (1998) in a two-country setting and is extended to a three-country
setting by Kimura (1998).

The three-country setting thinks of three geographical

16

territories, i.e., Japan, Asia, and the rest of the world (ROW) as well as three nationals,
i.e., Japanese, Asians, and foreigners (the national of ROW).

"Japanese" consist of

Japanese-owned firms located in Japan, households and governments located in Japan,
and foreign affiliates of Japanese firms (FAJFs) located in Asia and ROW.17
and foreigners are defined in the symmetric way.

Asians

Three nationals reside in three

different locations, and thus 9 blocks are drawn as in Figure 2.

Conceptually,

transactions within a block and between blocks are illustrated as 81 (9 times 9) arrows
in total.

We can, however, fill out 14 arrows of transactions because only statistical

data from the Japanese side are readily available.
The numbers shown for 14 arrows in Figure 2 stand for the estimated
Japanese value added contents of each transaction added at the starting point of the
corresponding arrow in 2000.

Table A.3 provides the summary table and the

16

Asia stands for Asian countries east of Pakistan in this section.
Note that "Japanese" in this definition is different from those on the residency basis or
those in the sense of factor holders; we treat FAJF as controlled by Japanese and count
the whole activities of FAJF as activities by Japanese.

estimation method of each estimate. Additional explanation of estimation method and
data description is given in Appendix 2 as well. Table 7 presents estimates of the value
added contents embodied in sales by Japanese to Asians in Asia and to foreigners in
ROW, estimated based on Table A.3.
==Figure 2==
==Table 7==
Although these figures are only rough estimates with a number of reservations
on the data set, the value added account provides useful insights on the activities of
Japanese MNEs, including intra-firm and arm’s length relationships.
are the following three.
Japan to Asia.

Major findings

First, activities of Japanese firms have gradually shifted from

When we focus on Japanese firms who sell products to Asians in Asia,

value added contents of “to produce in Japan and distributing through FAJF in Asia”
and value added contents of “to produce in Asia and sell locally” increased from 1996 to
2000 (increase in the share by 2.1 percent) while the share of “to produce in Japan and
export directly” decreased by 3.7 percent.18

Also, when we compare value added

contents of “to produce in Asia and sell locally” with “to produce in Japan and
distributing through FAJF in Asia”, the former becomes larger in 2000 though it was
smaller in 1996. This implies that importance of local value added has enhanced vis-àvis inputs from Japan.
Second, international production/distribution networks consist not only of
Japanese firms but also of the mixture of firms of different nationalities.

When value

added in exports by Japanese in Japan to Asians (Asian firms) and foreigners (MNEs
other than Japanese) in Asia is compared with that to Japanese (Japanese affiliates in
Asia) in Asia, for instance, the former is larger than the latter.

Thus, it is not true that

the activities by Japanese firms are solely based on subcontracting relationships or intrafirm relationships between Japanese parent firms and Japanese affiliates in East Asia
though such activities still consist of a significant portion; rather the activities do

18

The same analysis (Figure 2 and Table 7) was also conducted for 1996, but the results
were omitted in the paper.
18

include transactions with indigenous firms and MNEs in Asia.19
In addition, when we again focus on Japanese firms who sell products to
Asians in Asia, the channel for direct exports to Asia from Japan is still important as the
share of “to produce in Japan and export directly” suggests; 58.3 percent in 2000.

In

direct exports from Japan to Asia, capital goods for “Asian” firms are certainly
significant. Besides, intermediate inputs, particularly machinery parts and components,
for “Asian” firms are also large; combined with the information on Japan’s export in
Table 1, roughly one-third to half of them are machinery parts and components.
Third, the connection with North America or Europe is thin for both exports
and imports. Among several channels for Japanese firms to sell products, the shares of
“to produce in ROW and export to Asia” and “to produce in Asia and export to ROW”
are pretty small.

These low ratios imply weak connections with North America and

Europe, confirming that contrary to popular opinion, sales to North America by
Japanese affiliates in East Asia are small.
7. Current policy issues
This paper claimed the importance of international production/distribution
networks in East Asia.

In fact, the formation of the networks carries profound policy

implication. This concluding section provides brief discussion on this matter.
The dual track approach has so far worked pretty well in East Asia.

Figure 3

presents over-time changes in the customs duty import ratios in East Asian developing
countries.

This is the ratio of total customs duty revenue of a country to the c.i.f.-

based import value.

It is immediately noticed that the ratios are much smaller than

average tariff figures that we usually discuss as an indicator for trade barriers.
Moreover, the ratios present clear decreasing trends over time.

These phenomena are

partly due to unilateral tariff reduction for IT-related products in the 1990s and also due
to the effective usage of duty drawback system.

19

In fact, MNEs in export-oriented

The transactions between Japanese firms in Japan and Japanese affiliates in ROW are
indeed large, but the purpose is to sell Japanese products locally (in North America or
Europe) rather than contributing to forming networks. This is consistent with the facts
observed in Section 5 that the large portion of affiliates in North America and Europe is
in the wholesale trade sector and more than 40% of the total sales by affiliates in North
America or Europe are from affiliates in the wholesale trade sector.
19

industries are now paying very small amount of tariffs in these countries.

Such a

policy package has at least partially mitigated anti-export biases with trade protection
for import-substituting industries and has allowed them to attract both importsubstituting FDI and export-oriented FDI so far.
==Figure 3==
However, further activating the international production/distribution networks
requires new policy setting.

First, fostering import-substituting industries was not after

all very successful with a few exceptions, and the cost of protection gradually becomes
unbearable. Indeed, Southeast Asian countries and China still have high tariffs for a
number of import-substituting industries.

To substitute imports by domestic

production, governments of these countries have for long provided trade protection for
domestic firms or incoming foreign companies.

However, trade protection cannot still

be removed because of the long-lasting poor competitiveness of these industries.

The

protection cost is borne by consumers and other industries including export-oriented
industries. It cannot be continued forever, and policymakers gradually recognize that
it is now the time to reorganize these industries in a more competitive environment.
These industries include automobiles, domestic electric appliances, petrochemicals, and
iron and steel.
Second, even if tariffs are properly removed, business environment of East
Asia is still far from borderless.
reasons.

Cross-border transaction costs are high for various

Physical infrastructure in transportation and telecommunications is one of the

important factors to improve the business environment.

Trade facilitation in customs

clearance and other bureaucratic procedures is another vital element.

As a more

abstract form of transaction costs, legal systems and economic institutions such as
standards, intellectual property rights protection, and dispute settlement facilities, are
also crucial.

To keep attracting FDI and encourage the formulation of agglomeration,

policies beyond simple tariff removal become essential.
Third, the sophistication of networks and the development of agglomeration
require extensive involvement of local indigenous firms.

The focus of local industry

promotion is not placed on infant industry protection for import substitution anymore.
Rather, the issue is what the government can do in order to make local indigenous firms
20

penetrate into international vertical production chains.

Policymakers know that

impatient performance requirements for foreign companies such as local contents
requirement and technology transfer requirement have not worked very well.
Government-financed technology development centers for local technicians have also
borne lukewarm results in many cases.

The governments should ultimately make

effort in enhancing human resources for both entrepreneurs and engineers, but human
capital development takes time.

The role of government is obviously important, but

there is no easy policy to reach the goal.
These three issues are, to the authors’ opinion, natural policy agenda in the
formation of the international production/distribution networks, and we hope that
policymakers in this region have clear mind in confronting with these issues.

The East

Asian countries are now actively engaging the effort toward formulating regional trade
arrangements.

The contents of such arrangements are expected to reflect necessary

policy reform in the East Asian countries.

Appendix 1: data sources for section 5
The Basic Survey of Business Structure and Activity (Kigyo Katsudo Kihon
Chosa in Japanese) is the MITI survey, first conducted for F/Y 1991, then for F/Y 1994,
and annually since then.

The Basic Survey has several attractive features.

First, the

samples in the survey are comprehensive, covering all firms with more than 50 workers,
capital of more than 30 million yen, and establishments in mining, manufacturing,
wholesale/retail trade, and restaurants.

Foreign affiliates covered in the survey are

those with no less than 20 percent Japanese ownership.

Second, the ratios of

questionnaire returns are high; the actual ratios are not disclosed, but are about 90 to 95
percent.

Statistics collected by the Government of Japan are legally classified into

two categories: designated statistics (shitei toukei) and approved statistics (shounin
toukei).

The Basic Survey is the first type, and thus firms in the survey must return the

questionnaires under the Statistics Law.
the data on an establishment basis.

Third, it provides firm-level data rather than

Although establishment-level data are useful in

analyzing production activities, firm-level data are much more appropriate to examine
corporate activities as a whole.
The Survey of Overseas Business Activities of Japanese Companies, which is
also conducted by MITI, has been conducted annually since F/Y 1970.

Firms targeted

by the survey are those with Japanese affiliates abroad of Japanese firms, except firms
in finance, insurance, or real estates.

The Survey of Overseas Business Activities is of

the approved type, so that the effective return ratios tend to be as low as 60 percent (in
the case of the F/Y 1999 Survey, the returned ratio is 56.0 percent).

As explained in

section 5, Japanese affiliates abroad include both “affiliates abroad” with no less than 10
percent ownership by Japanese parent firms and “affiliates of affiliates abroad” with
more than 50% ownership by such “affiliates abroad”, but the survey can distinguish the
former and the latter if necessary.
The industry classification used in this paper is presented in Table A.2.
Since the industry classification of the Survey of Overseas Business Activities is
different from that of the Basic Survey, the latter industry classification is matched with
the former to make them comparable.

Unfortunately, services sectors are not fully

covered by both surveys.
Appendix 2: the estimation method and data sources for section 6
24

The detailed estimation method is described in Table A.3.

Japanese value

added in exports of Japanese-owned firms is calculated by subtracting the import
component in the exports.

The proportion of the import component in exports

(8.504%) is obtained from Management and Coordination Agency (1999) (1995 InputOutput Tables).

Exports of Japanese-owned firms are calculated by subtracting

exports of JAFF from exports of Japan.
from METI (2002a).

The data for exports of JAFF are available

Assuming that the ratio of value added to sales is the same no

matter where the sales destination is, we obtain the Japanese value added in exports of
Japanese-owned firms to FAJF in Asia (7,205,530 million JP Yen), to FAJF in ROW
(21,084,637 million JP Yen), to Asians in Asia (10,710,170 million JP Yen), and to
foreigners in ROW (3,132,287 million JP Yen).

There is no information on exports to

foreigners in Asia or exports to Asians in ROW.
Value added earned by FAJF in Asia (8,054,035 million JP Yen) is calculated
as sales minus purchases, which are available from METI (2002b).

Assuming again

that the ratio of value added to sales is the same no matter where the sales destination is,
we obtain the value added by FAJF in goods and services sold to Japanese located in
Japan (1,611,093 million JP Yen), to Japanese located in Asia (2,409,228 million JP
Yen), to Japanese located in ROW (83,975 million JP Yen), to Asians located in Asia
(3,613,841 million JP Yen), and to foreigners located in ROW (335,899 million JP Yen).
Data are not available for sales by FAJF to Asians in Japan and ROW, or those to
foreigners in Japan and ROW.

Value added by FAJF in ROW in goods and services

sold to various places is estimated in the same way.
METI (2002a) defines Japanese affiliates of foreign firms as those with
foreign share of more than one-third.
those by such affiliates.

Therefore, exports of JAFFs in the analysis are

METI (2002b) defines Japanese affiliates abroad as both

“affiliates abroad” with no less than 10 percent ownership by Japanese parent firms and
“affiliates of affiliates abroad” with more than 50% ownership by such “affiliates
abroad” as mentioned above.
those by such affiliates.

Thus, sales and purchases by FAJFs in the analysis are

In METI (2002b), it is known that exports in sales and

imports in purchases by FAJFs are overstated because FAJFs are sometimes reported as
exports/imports when they are selling local but the ultimate destinations/origins are
foreign countries. We therefore regard 30 percent of sales and purchases to/from Japan
and ROW in manufacturing as of local transactions.
25

Moreover, there is no available

information on the magnitude of transactions among FAJFs in METI (2002b).

We

therefore use 0.4 (0.6) as a proxy of the ratio of sales to FAJFs (Asians) in local sales by
FAJFs in Asia, 0.2 (0.8) as a proxy of the ratio of sales to FAJFs (foreigners) in sales to
ROW by FAJFs in Asia, 0.4 (0.6) as a proxy of the ratio of sales to FAJFs in Asia
(Asians) in sales to Asia by FAJFs in ROW, and 0.2 (0.8) as a proxy of the ratio of sales
to FAJFs (foreigners) in local sales by FAJFs in ROW.
Since both METI (2002a) and METI (2002b) are approved statistics, the
returned ratios are not so high. As for METI (2002a), 1,935 out of 3,742 parent firms
returned the questionnaires (the returned ratio is 51.7 percent).

In the case of METI

(2002b), 2,157 out of 3,430 parent firms returned the questionnaires (the returned ratio
is 62.9 percent), and the number of Japanese affiliates abroad covered is 14,991.
