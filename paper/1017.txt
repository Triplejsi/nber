Introd'ction
The extent to which a firm's capital structure influences

capital accumulation has long been a contested theoretical and empirical

issue. On the theoretical side work by Stiglitz [21], King [15],
Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski [8], Auerbach [2] and Brock and
Turnovsky [4] has investigated how alternative financing sources affect

the capital stick selected by the firm. However, in these papers it
is assumed that the capital stock can be intantaneously adjusted so
that capital is treated as a variable factor of production.
There is another view (see Lucas [17], Gould [10], Nussa [19]

and Treadway [24]) which postulates that the process of capital

accumulation involves the firm incurring adjustment costs. In this
framework capital is not instantly variable but rather it is a quasi—

fixed factor, which is altered by the investment decisions. Investment
functions are generated, which are increasing functions of the demand
price of installed capital.

In this paper, by integrating the two approaches, we are able to
analyze the influence that the capital structure exerts on investment

undertaken by the firm. We develop a model with two quasi—fixed
factors——the standard plant and equipment (P&E) capital and research and

development (R&D) capital. We are able to characterize the behavior of
investment over time and establish the existence, uniqueness and
stability of the long run equilibrium.

Financial and real decisions are interrelated in the sense that

the firm determines its debt—equity ratio, capital accnulation and
labor requirements by maximizing the initial share value. We then

2

establish that this program is equivalent to finding the debt—equity
raLio which minimizes the cost of capital and labor requirements

which maximize net operating revenues. The firm then uses the maximized
net operating revenues and the minimized cost of capital to determine
the real investment demands and thereby its capital accumulation plans.

The growth of the capital stocks Is governed by the difference

between the marginal values of Installed to uninstalled capital. The
higher the marginal value of installed relative to uninstalled capital

the greater the demand for investment. The value of the marginal product
denotes the value of installed capital, while the marginal installation
costs and the cost of capital characterize the value of uninstalled

capital. The latter depends on the level of investment, the debt—equity
ratio, the interest and depreciation rates and the price of investment

products. The value of the maginal product, depends ,n the stocks of
the quasi—fixed factors, the relative price of the variable factors of
production and the product price.
Most studies on R&D treat it as a variable input in the production
process (see Nadiri [20] and Grlliches [11] and the references cited
Liierein).

Recently,

though, Nadirl and Bftros [21] developed a partial

cdjustment model with R&D and Schankerman and Nadiri [22] constructed

a model with R&D as the sole quasi—fixed factor. In this paper we
derive, from intertemporal maximization, and estimate investment demand

functions for two quasi—fixed factors, P&E and R&D capital. Moreover,
in none of these studies was the purpose to determine the influence
of alternative financing sources on capital accumulation.

3

Empir .al evidence for the proposition that financial concerns

a fect R&D investment is mixed. There are only a few studies which have
examined the impact of the capital structure on R&D (see Elliot [6] and

Howe and McFetrldge [13].) However, in both of these studies an
intertemporal maximizing model of firm

behavior

was not the basis for

the estimated equation and, in particular, for the hypothesized
relationship between capital stiucture and R&D.

Research examining the influences of financial behavior on
investment in plant and equipment has recently been undertaken by Engle
and Foley [7], Von Furstenberg [28], Von Furstenberg, Malkiel and

Watson [29] and Summers [24). These studies, relying to various
degrees on a dynamic model of the firm,

have

shown that industry and

sectoral investment demand is significantly affected by changes in the
share market values.

.
Our empirical results, based on a pooled time series, cross—
section sample of 49 firms, suggest that the debt—equity ratio exerts

a significant but small impact on P&E and R&D investment. In both
cases the effect is quite inelastic. In addition, for an increase in
the debt—equity ratio, the short—run response for both types of

investment are quite similar. As time evolves, however, the effect on
P&E becomes relatively stonger, with the long—run result that the
percentage decrease in P&E capital is substantially greater than for
R&D capital.

Tests were conducted to determine cross—section variations and

cross—equation correlations. We found that the disturbance terms for
the R&D and P&E investment functions were correlated. Moreover, there

4

were interfirm differences in these equations. Interestingly, the
firms which exhibited distinct P&E investment demands were not the same

group with differences in R&D.investment. Therefore, the majority of
firms did not have an identical pair of P&E and R&D Investment demand.

In section 2 the model is developed, section 3 deals with the
short run equilibrium, while sectIon 4 pertains to the dynamics and the

long run equilibrium. The empirical work bgIns In section 5, with the
model implementation, and in section 6 we describe the data. Section 7
contains the econometric results and we then conclude.

2. The Model
To begin our analysis of the firm's investment and financing
decisions, we assume the technology is governed by

(1)

y(t) =

F[Kp(t)Kr(t)L(t))

5

where y(t) is output, F is the twice continuously differentiable
production function, with positive and diminishing marginal products;

K(t) is the stock of plant and equipment (P&E); K(t) is the stock of
research and development (R&D); L(t) is the labor services input. All
variables are evaluated in period t.

We assume that the services emanating from the capital stocks are
proportional to the stocks themselves.

The flow of funds of the firm is

In the determination of share accumulation, we assume as in
Auerbach [2] and Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski [8] that the rate of

return on equity is dependent on the debt—equity ratio. The larger the
debt—equity ratio the higher the rate of return that the shareholders

require. We formulate this feature by

r + H(v)

(5)

=

D/pN

+

pip,

where r is the net rate of return, H(v) is the premium required by
shareholders when the firm undertakes to issue bonds, where v =

0,

and H' >

B/pN

H" >

The rate of return on shares is comprised of the dividends per
share plus (minus) any capital gains (losses). Let S =

pN,

+ p14 and by the definition ofswe must have s =

S =

so

p5N

then

equation (5) can be rewritte as

S =

(6)

[r

+

H(v)]

S — D +

.

The corporate share value changes by the return on existing shares plus
any new

share

issues minus any distributions to the shareholders.

We assume that the firm maximizes the initial value of equity,
which means that decisions are made in the interest of the shareholders.
The initial value is obtained by solving for S(0) from (6);

The initial share value equals the present value of the stream of
Hividends minus both the premium paid to shareholders when there is
outstanding' debt and any dilution from new share issues.

The program for the firm is obtained by maximizing the right side

of equation (7) subject to (1), (2), (3), (4) and (6). The Hamiltonian
for this problem is

There are, in addition toequations (3) and (4), the transversalityand
the Legendre—Clebsch (or second order) conditions.
Let us investigate the nature of the firm's intertemporal plan.

First, we can see that the determination of the real and financial
decisions are recursive. The debt—equity ratio is found from (9.4),

(9.7) and (9.8). This debt—equity ratio minimizes the cost of capital.
The firm then utilizes this cost of capital to determine the real
capital accumulation paths.

To establish the above conclusion note from (9.4) that 1 —

q4

=

—q3

where q4 is the cost per dol,Jçar of equity, -q3 is te cost per

dollar of debt. From (9.2) (or (9.3)) 0 <

q4

<

1.

Thus the cost of

financing a dollar of real capital is divided between the debt and
equity instruments, since 1 =

-q3

+

q4.

By combining (9.7) and (9.8) and since q3 =
q4,

(10)

r + H(v)

=

rb

+

H' (1 +

v).

The adjusted rate of return on equity equals the interest rate on
corporate debt adjusted for the marginal premium needed in light of the

higher debt—equity ratio. Equation (10) is a single equation which can

be solved for one unknom, the debt—equity ratio. This debt—equity

9

ratio minimizes the cost of capital. Define r(v) =
(1 +

v)

[r

+

H(v)

•'•

vrb]/

as the cost of capital. Minimizing r with respect to v yields
=

rb

+ Ht

where r0 is the minimwn cost of capital. Substituting r° into the
definition of ,r yields equation (10) -

Notice that if rb and r are constant

then the debt-equity ratio isconstant for all time.
Second, the labor input decision given by (9.1) is devoid of any

intertemporal considerations. Since 1 —

> 0,

at each instant the

value of the marginal product is equal to the factor price. The
implication is that we can carry out our analysis in terms of operating

and capital decisions. First, the firm maximizes net operating
revenues, given the capital stocks and prices. This step yields a labor
input demand which depends o1the stocks, Qf, P&E, R&D.,.?nd w/p. To see
this,

maxpF(K ,
(L)

p

r

The optimality condition to this program is given by equation (9.1).

The solution can be denoted as L = g (K, K, w/p).
Substituting the input demand function into the net operating
revenue equation, yields the indirect variable profits function

R(K, K, w /p) =

p

F(K, K, g(K, K, wlp)) — w g(K, Kr w/p).

Using the indirect variable profits function and the minimized cost of

We can summarize the firm's program in the following manner. First
it determines the labor requirements, conditional on the stocks of R&D

and P&E, by maximizing net operating revenues. Second, the debt—equity

decision is taken which miniiizes the costof .capitl. Finally, the.
real investment demands and the capital accumulation plans are deter-

mined (by using the maximized net operating revenues, the minimized cost
of capital) through maximizing the present value of the flow of funds
associated with the two types of real capital.

3. ihe Short—Run Equilibrium

The short—run equilibrium for the firm is denoted by equations

(9.1), (9.2) and (9.3). These equations are independent of each other
because labor does not involve any intertemporal considerations and the
investment costs oriy depend on their respective investment flow.

Consider the labor demand. If we assume that increases in the
stocks of P&E and R&D increase the marginal product of labor, then with

11

diminishing marginal products, increases in the stocks increase labor

demand. In addition, an increase in the real wage decreases labor

requirements. Thus

L =

(11)

g(K,

K, w/p);g1 >0, g2 >0,

g3

0.

The short run investment demand functions for P&E and R&D are given
by (9.2) and (9.3) respectively. We find' that,

(12.1)

I =

(12.2)

'r =

I(q/i

—

J(q2/l

—

q4)

q4)

I' > 0

J' > 0.

Gross investment demand is forward looking and each one is an increasing
function of its respective demand price and a decreasing function of the
per dollar cost of financing the additions to the real capital stocks.
An alternative interpretation of equation sot (12) is that with the

price of uninstalled capital normalized to unity, 1 -

q

is the

marginal cost of uninstalled capital. Hence investment is an increasing
function of the marginal value of installed capital relative to the

marginal cost of uninstalled capital. Therefore gross investment isv.
determined by a mechanism similar to Tobin's [23 1
and

Hayashi

and q

=

[121)

(see also Abel [ii

"q" theory where, in our context,

q

=

q1/l—q4

4. The Dynamics and the Long—Run Equilibrium
In order to be able to characterize the dynamic behavior of the
firm and the long—run equilibrium, we must investigate equation set (9).

12

First, equation (10) suxnina±jzes equations (9.4), (9.7) and (9.8).

Second, differentiating (9.2) and (9.3) with respect to time results in

substituting (9.2), (9.8), (10), and (11) and (14.1) into (9.5) provides

then

gross investment increases such that Ii,> 0.

The converse holds when the marginal return on existing capital exceeds that

on new capital. Clearly, when the marginal returns are equal no additional
gross investment is undertaken.

Similarly we can determne the differential equation for R&D
investment, by using (9.3), (9.8), (10), (11) and (13.2) in (9.6),

ihe dynamic behavior of the firm can now be summarized into four

fqu:ions, (3), (4), (14) and (15). Let us first determine whether or

not there exists a unique long—run equilibrium. Suppose K =

curves depicted in Figure 1 must intersect only once. A set of
sufficient conditions for this to occur are that

5. The Empirical Implementation

The equations summarizing the dynamic behavior of the firm are

denoted by (3), (4), (14) and (15). We assume that (3) and (4) are
non—stochastic and use these equations to define the stocks of P&E and

R&D respectively. In order to carry out the estimation of equations
(14) and (15), we must specify the investment cost functions

E(I), the function denoting the premium on the rate of return to
shareholders, when debt financing is used, H(v), and the production

function F(K, K, L). We define

From equations (31) and (32) we have established that investment (for
either P&E or R&D) in any period depends directly on its past value,

inversely on the financing costs (represented, in particular, by the
debt-equity ratio) and directly on the utilization of the existing
stock, as represented by the sales -to asset ratio.1'

6. The Data

Annual data on several variables were collected from a variety of
sources indicated below for the period 1959—1966 for forty—nine firms.

The selection of firms was dictated by the availability of consistent

time series data on R&D expenditures and the stock of R&D. The pooled
Lime—series cross section sample was designed to provide a richer set of
information in which to estimate the functions under consideration.

The list of variables and their construction are: Plant and
equipment (K) is the measure of net stock generated by a perpetual
inventory formula

K(t) =

1(t)

+ (1 — 6)

K(t — 1)

where 1(t) equals actual expenditures on plant and equipment deflated
by the price of investment in P&E. Investment in P&E and its associated
price (p) were obtained from the McGraw—Hill data series, with the
depreciation rate for each firm calculated by summing over time
depreciation allowances divided by the gross plant and equipment and

then dividing this sum by the number of time periods. The stock of
R&D (Kr) was obtained from a similar procedure,

K(t)

Investment

rr(t) ÷ (1

n)K(t

in R&D (I) and its associated price (p) were obtained from

McGraw—Hill data series and we arbitrarily chose rj = .1 to measure the
depreciation rate for the stock of knowledge. Debt (B) was obtained
from Standard and Poor's data series for long term corporate debt.

Equity (S) was also obtained from Standard and Poor's series for the
closing common share price multiplied by the number of outstanding

common shares. Sales (py) figures were obtained from the Nc—Graw Hill
data series.

7. The Empirical Results
In order to render equations (31) and (32) stochastic, we add a
random disturbance term

to

each equation. Moreover, to reflect the fact

21

that the equations can vary among the firms in the sample, because of

technological differences, we add to A and B parameters which are

firm—specific. Thus (31) and (32) become,

log I(j,t) =

+ A3 log v(j,t) log I(j,t-l)

The estimation results for P&E investment are presented in Table

1. In this estimation we have assumed that a0(j) =

1,... ,49.

for j,k =

a0(k),

b0(j) =

b0(k)

Initially we impose the restriction that the

equations are identical across firms. In Table 1 there are two sets
of estimates. The first row refers to the results from estimating
equation (33) and the second row refers to a restricted version with
a2, which implies that c =

in equation (23), and so A2 =

1

A3

in

equation (33). We see that all estimates have the correct sign and
the equation fits the data quite well. In addition, from the
unrestricted equation, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that
A2 = A3.

Thus, imposing the restriction we see from the second row

that all estimates are significant. In particular, increases in the
debt—equity ratio do indeed decrease P&E investment.

Due to the presence of the interaction between agged investment
and the debt—equity ratio the elasticity varies over the sample. The
formula for the short—run elasticity is

value of the short—term elasticity is -

.028, while the mean value in

the long run is —.193. Thus, in the short run an increase in the
debt—equity ratio of 1% leads to a decrease in P&E investment by .028%,
while in the long run an increase of 1% leads to a decrease in the P&E
capital stock by —. 193%.

As expected, the long—run elasticity exceeds

the short—run. Moreover, both effects are inelastic, with the short—run
highly inelastic, but nevertheless significant.

Turning to the results for R&D investment, we see from Table 2
that the estimation of the restricted version of equation (34) elicits

significant coefficients with the correct sign. Once again the fit is
quite strong. An interesting feature is that changes in the debt—equity
ratio do indeed exert a significant impact on R&D investment. The
short—run elasticity is

The mean value for the

again the short—run effect is less than the long—run. In addition, the
influence of changes in the debt—equity ratio is substantially smaller

than for P&E, both in the short and long runs. Indeed, the initial

impact of a percentage Increase In the debt—equity ratio causes the
percentage decrease in P&E investment to be approximately 65% greater

than the percentage decrease in R&D investment. As time passes, the
spread in percentage changes enlarges, such that in the long run the
mean value of P&E capital elasticity with respect to the debt—equity
ratio is approximately double the R&D capital elasticity.
Differences in investment demand functions among firms can arise

through the different production technologies. In order to account for
any cross section variations, we drop the assumption that the intercepts

in equations (33) and (34) are the same for all firms. In our sample
the 49 firms are classified into 10 different 2—digit SIC groupings.
Hence we introduce 9 binary variables into the regression equations.
The 10 different firm groupings are represented as 10 different

equations, for each investmentcategory,'with the èqution differences
reflected through the binary variable coefficients.

The single equation estimates of this covariance model for the
restricted version of the P&E investment equation are presented in

Table 3. We find that the nonbinary variable coefficients have the
correct sign, they are significant and the fit is good. The coefficient
on the debt—equity ratio is —.005 as opposed to —.008 as found in Table

1. Thus, the mean value of the short—run elasticity is now —.017 and
the mean value for the long—run is —. 103.

The introduction of cross

section variations in P&E investment has caused the effects emanating

from changes in the debt—equity ratio to become weaker. This occurs
in the short and long runs with the short—run elasticity falling by 40%
and

the long—run decreasing by roughly 47%.

With respect to the interfirm differences we see that there is
a suggestion of cross section variation arising from groups 3, 4 and 8

represented respectively by the binary variables d2, d3 and d4.
Table 3 also shows the restricted R&D Investment demand estimation.

The fit, signs, significance and values of the nonbinary variable

coefficients is similar to those found in Table 2. In addition, unlike
the case for P&E the mean value of the short—run elasticity has not

changed, it is still —.017. The mean value of the long—run elasticity
Is now —.06. Therefore, we find that the long—run effect of a change
In the debt—equity ratio, as for P&E, has significantly decreased with

the introduction of cross section differences. Interestingly, a 1%
increase in the debt—equity ratio causes the same decrease, in the

short run, for P&E and R&D investment. However, as time evolves the
effect on P&E capital increases relative to the effect on R&D capital,

such that in the long run the debt—equity elasticity of P&E is 72%
larger than for R&D.

The binary variables also illustrate that groups 5, 7 and 9

(as represented by d4, d6 and d8) exhibit technological differences
such that their R&D investment demand equations are distinct from the

cross section average.. In fact, with group 9 d8 =

.750, and therefoe

the distinct technology for this group causes the intercept in its

R&D equation to be —.049 + .750

.701, which is significantly above

the average value of —.049.

We have proceeded in the estimation as if the P&E and R&D

investment equations are independent of each other. However, as they
are both derived from the same dynamic program characterizing firm

29

behavior, it seems reasonable to expect some stochastic relationship to

be present between the equations. Thus, we drop the assumption that
EEu ut] = 0 and now assume that E[u u] = a

pr

pr

I, where a

pr

pr

is the

covariance between the disturbance terms of the two investment equations.

Equations (33) and (34) are now seemingly unrelated regression
equations and are jointly estimated by maximum likelihood to account for

the cross equation correlation among the disturbance terms. We also
include the binary variables to account for the cross section

differences within each equation. The estimates are presented in
Table 4.

The effect of changes in the debt—equity ratio on P&E investment
in the short run is the same as when the equations were estimated

separately, that is, —.017. However, the mean value of the long—run

elasticities is now —.088. Ths shows a significant decline in the
long—run magnitude from the single equation estimate of —.103. The
effects on R&D do not change when joint estimation is undertaken. The
short— and long—run elasticities are, respectively, —.017 and —.06.

Therefore, we can summarize our findings on the debt—equity effects

in the following way. An increase in tb ratio initially causes the
same response on P&E and R&D investment. As time passes, though, the
P&E effect becomes relatively larger, and indeed in the long run the

effect is about 47% greater for P&E compared to R&D capital. Nevertheless,
for both types of capital the effects, both short— and long—run, are
highly inelastic.

In the context of joint estimation, cross section variations have

also become significant for both types of investment. For P&E, groupings

3, 4 and 8 exhibit differences from the cross section average.

Groupings 3 and 4 invest in P&E more than the average. Indeed, the
intercept term for group 3 is more than twice as large as the average.
The investment for group 8 is smaller, with an intercept of —.189
compared to the average of .296.

R&D investment shows interfirm differences. As observed in single
equation estimates, group 9 invests in R&D substantially more than the

average. Now we also find a tendency for groups 5 and 7 to significantly

vary from the average, with theirR&D investment levels larger. A
final interesting result is that, not only are there cross section
differences, but the firms that have different P&E investment demand
functions are not those which have difference R&D investment demand

functions. Taken together, the package of P&E and R&D equations for
each grouping appears to be qu'ite

8, Conclusion
In this paper we developed a dynamic model of firm behavior which

integrates real and financial decisions. The firm, at each instant,
determines its labor requirements, the debt—equity ratio and the real
investment demands for plant and equipment and research and development.

Although the firm determines these elements simultaneously by maximizirg
the initial value of equity, in effect the decision process is

sequential. The debt—equity ratio is found by minimizing the cost of
capital and the labor input emanates from the maximization of net
operating revenues. Gathering these two parts permits us to
characterize the accumt1ation of the real capital stocks.

33

The estimated equations derived from the theoretical model have
the property that investment demand depends on the lagged Investment
flow, the cost of additional capital (as reflected by the debt—equity
ratio), and the utilization of the existing capital stock as measured

by the sales to asset ratio for each particular type of real capital.

The equations were estimated to account for the statistically

significant cross equation and cross section differences. For both P&E
and R&D the debt—equity ratio significantly affects the investment

demands and the elasticities are highly inelastic. In addition, the
effect is stronger for P&E than for R&D capital in the long run, while
the effects on P&E and R&D investment are quite similar in the short
run.The impact of a percentage Increase in the debt—equity ratio causes

the percentage decline in P&E capital to be approximately one and one

half times the percentage decrase in R&D.

Following the discussion of Mussa [19] the installation costs are

7. The functions satisfy the properties needed in the
specification of the model. The production function is a first order
logarithmic approximation to any arbitrary production function and we
do not restrict the degree of returns to scale.

relates P&E and R&D investment respectively to q

These-are the shadow pricesdefining Tobin's q's for

each type uf capital. However, in order to obtain observable variables
or the shadow prices, the share value of the firm (S) must be
homogeneous of degree 1 in the capital stocks, labor services and the
investment flows (see 1-Iayashi [12] and Summers [24]). This implies

that the technology must exhibit constant returns to scale, unit
adjustment costs are homogeneous of degree 0 in the respective
investment flow and capital stock, and the debt to asset ratio is fixed.
Clearly, at the firm level, the assumption of constant returns to scale

is quite restrictive. In addition, the fixed debt—asset ratio abstracts
from the financing decision and its influence on capital accumulation,

which we are attempting to test.
9. The static expectations assumption yields investment
equations which are of the accelerator variety. In our context the

accelerator is in terms of the'logarithmsof investmett. For the
theoretical development of the accelerator model see Treadway [27]
and for empirical surveys see Eisner [5] and Jorgenson [14].
10. We are treating (rb + 5 + y) and (rb + ri + y) as parameters.
This seems reasonable given that the terms do not vary over the firms,

and 5, r and y do not vary over time. In addition, rb is relatively
constant over this period.

11. In the "q" approach to estimating investment functions It
has been found that investment is related to the lagged value of q

rather than to the contemporaneous value (see Summers [24]). This
result is not predicted by the theory and indeed may be quite

troublesome. The reason is that by relating investment to the lagged
value of the

ratio

of the shadow prices of installed to uninstalled

36.

capital involves an assumption concerning the firm's expectations, which
is not explicitly accounted for in the theory.
