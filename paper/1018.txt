The U.S. Productivity Slowdown:
A Case of Statistical Myopia

ABS TRACT

This paper identifies three major riods: 1900—1929, 1929—1965, and
1965—1978. In contrast to the middle period, the extreme periods are
characterized by rapid growth in private employment and hours worked; because
growth in private productivity increases by less, measured labor productivity

growth falls compared to the middle period. However this fall reflects a
substantial substitution of quantity for quality in labor force growth: after
private employment and hours are adjusted for age, sex, immigration, and
education, no difference is observed among the average quality—adjusted labor

productivity growth rates. Substantial variation in these growth rates
remains within the 1929—1965 and 1965—1978 periods. Slow quality—adjusted
labor productivity growth during 1929—1948 is just offset by unusually rapid
growth during 1948—1965; these variations are attributed to the near cessation
of investment during the Depression and World War II and subsequent recovery

of the capital—labor ratio. Thus no substantial variations in total factor

productivity growth or technical progress is found. Variations in
productivity growth within 1965—1978 are explained by price—control induced

biases in reported deflated output. Correction of these biases results in
equal quality—adjusted labor productivity growth in 1965—1973 and 1973—1978.

A substantial program of future research is proposed. A data appendix is
included.

THE U.S. PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN:
A CASE OF STATISTICAL MYOPIA
Michael R. Darby*
University of California, Los Angeles
National Bureau of Economic Research

The decline in American productivity has come to rival inflation as a

major economic issue for public policy. Indeed something akin to panic has
followed reports that labor productivity growth has declined from an average
annual rate of 2.6 percent over 1948—1965 to 2.0 percent over 1965—1973 to 0.9

percent from 1973 to 1978.1 This paper shows that the productivity panic is
based upon statistical myopia and that a careful analysis within the
perspective of the entire twentieth century discloses no substantial variation
in what is variously described as growth in total factor productivity or
technical progress.

The argument is made in two parts. First, three major subperiods are

identified: 1900—1929, 1929—1965, and 1965—1978. It is noted first that the
early and late periods are very similar to each other and are characterized,
in comparison with the middle period, by rapid growth in labor force and a
less than equal increase in growth in real output so that measured labor

productivity falls. This picture changes dramatically when allowances are
made for age, sex, education, and immigration to obtain a quality—adjusted

labor force. The differential between the growth rates of output and quality
adjusted hours worked is essentially identical across the three periods. Thus
simple demographic adjustments eliminate any secular decline in technical
progress.

2

The second part of the argument focuses on variations in productivity

growth trends within the middle and later periods. It is shown that very slow
growth in the capital—labor ratio from 1929 to 1948 accounts for very slow
labor productivity growth during that sub—period as well as very rapid growth

during 1948—1965. That is, the very rapid growth of 1948—1965 resulted from
our poverty in 1948 and did not reflect desirable economic conditions. The
more rapid productivity growth in 1965—1973 as compared to 1973—1978 is fully
explicable by measurement -error due to underreporting of price increases and

hence overreporting of output increases due to Nixon's price control

program. It is of particular interest that the oil price increases of 1973—
1974 do not appear to have played a major role in slowing productivity growth.
The analysis was made possible by the development of a historical data
base on productivity, labor force, and employment reported elsewhere.2
Extracts of the relevant data are contained in a data appendix.

I. Analysis of Longer—Period Trends

The broad trends of the twentieth century are sununarized in Table 1 for

private employment (PE), average and total private hours worked (AHWP and
THWP, respectively), gross private product (GPP), and private hourly and

employee productivity (GPP/THWP and GPP/PE, respectively).3 Darby (1982b)
notes the periods 1900—1929 and 1965—1978 were characterized by rapid
employment growth with immigration the relatively dominant factor in the early
period and the baby—boom new entrants relatively more important in the recent

period. The intermediate period 1929—1965 was marked by both tight limitation
on immigration and a low rate of natural increase.4 The three major periods
were thus differentiated both by changes in immigration laws and by the post-

war baby—boom's coming of age. Since the rate of decline in average hours
worked was nearly constant, the changes in employment growth were the dominant
factor determining variation in growth in total hours.

Each of the major periods has been divided roughly in half for later

analysis.5 At least for 1929—1965 and 1965—1978, the growth rate of private
employment and total private hours is approximately the same in each subperiod

as the mean for the respective major period. Thus each of these periods is
homogeneous in terms of labor developments. The unevenness of immigration and
estimated average—hours—worked growth in the first 29 years of the century
makes the period 1900—1929 appear rather less homogeneous, but demographic
adjustments discussed below eliminate most of the differences between the
subperiods.

Focusing on the major periods in Table 1, we note that 1965—1978 is

rather similar to 1900—1929 not only in employment and hours growth but also

in output and productivity growth. Compared to 1929—1965, total hours growth

4

is 1.0 to 1.2 percent higher in the earlier and later periods while GPP growth

is only 0.4 to 0.5 percent higher. Thus hourly productivity growth is
recorded as 0.5 to 0.7 percent lower in 1900—1929 and 1965—1978 as compared to

1929—1965. Correspondingly, growth in private output per person employed is
0.4 to 0.6 lower in the extreme periods than in the middle period. Two

(possibly

complementary) hypotheses provide possible explanations of the more

rapid productivity growth in the middle period: (1) The hours and employment
growth—rate declines in the middle period may be overstated due to failure to

adjust for demographic changes, especially immigration and the baby boom. (2)
Slower labor growth results in increased steady—state values of the capital—
labor and output—labor ratios in the standard closed—economy neoclassical

growth model. These hypotheses are examined in turn.

Demographics Hypothesis
Measures of private hours do not adjust for differences in human capital
although the idea that an hour is an hour is as falacious as the idea that a

1962 dollar equals a 1982 dollar. Although elaborate adjustments such as
Chinloy (1980) are precluded by limitations in the historical data, it is
possible to make approximate adjustments for observed differences in
productivity due to age, sex, education, and immigrant status.
Let us first consider the adjustment for the age—sex composition of the

labor force. The private labor force estimates are divided into individual
cells by sex and "young" (Y, under 25) or "old" (0, over 24). Standardizing
on males over 24 and taking young males, young females, and old females as

less productive because of differences In human capital, we compute age—sex
adjusted private employment as

5

(1) APE = PENO + a1PE + a2PEFY + a3PEFQ

where the subscripts M and F indicate sex. The a's are chosen to reflect
differences in average hourly earnings. Using data in Denison (1979, p. 33),

this suggests a of 0.53 to 0.50,

a2

of 0.43 to 0.41, and a3 of 0.56 to

0.57.6 We use 0.515, 0.42, and 0.565 as

a1, a2, and a3, respectively.

New immigrants to the United States on average earn substantially less

than native—born Americans.7 In part this reflects permanent differences in
human capital endowments, but much of the difference is eliminated over time

as the immigrants become acculturated. Since immigration is most important in
the earlier period, Francine Blau's (1980) estimates based on 1909 data are
used to adjust the foreign—born to native—born equivalents by the following
formulas .8

the average years since entry of foreign—born workers of sex s. The average
years since entry was estimated according to the recursive formula

(4) Z5 =

(0.5) .- +

(Z5,_1 + k) (1 —

where I is the inflow of (sex s) immigrants over the preceding year,

is

the corresponding foreign—born population, and k5 is a number between 0 and 1

6

to allow for disproportionate frequency of death and retirement among the less

recent foreign—born. This formula says that the (mid—year) average years
since entry is a weighted average ——

weights

and 1 —

(I/P) — of

0.5 year for those arriving in the last twelve months and Z1 + k5 for those
previously arrived and remaining in the labor force. Benchmarks for 1909 and
1970 were computed from the Immigration Commission data for 1909 and from 1970

Census data.'° These benchmarks implied kM kF

0.603. The estimated

values of Z are reported in the data appendix. Since the adjustments for
years since migration of the foreign—born were made before the adjustment for
age and sex described in equation (1), the variable APE is in fact adjusted
for all these factors.

The final demographic factor believed to be important in determining the

human capital content of the labor force is education. It is assumed that
human capital is increased by 7 percent per year of education," so that
quality—adjusted private employment is

(5) QAPE = (107)EAPE

The education variable E is measured by the median school years completed by
those 25 years and over.'2
Table 2 indicates the relative importance of the various demographic
factors across the period by breaking the difference between unadjusted and
quality—adjusted private—employment growth rates into age—sex, immigration,

and education components.'3 Table 3 displays the differential effects in the
three major periods by subtracting the average 1900—1978 value of each
adjustment from the value of the adjustment for the period. For example,
failure to adjust for age and sex in the productivity measures in Table 1

7

resulted in understating 1965—1978 productivity growth by —0.32 — (—0.01) =
—0.31 percent per annum relative to 1929—1965. Overall, the productivity

growth differential from 1929—1965 was overstated by 0.35 — (—0.27) =

0.62

percent per annum for 1900—1929 and by 0.35 — (—0.37) = 0.72 for 1965—1978.
Table 4 illustrates that after private employment is adjusted for these
demographic factors, both the hourly and employee productivity measures show

no significant variation across the major periods. In particular there is no
indication of a secular productivity slowdown in 1965—1978 versus 1929—1965 or

indeed the entire twentieth century. Furthermore, as noted above, we have
used the hours measure most favorable to finding such a slowdown; the data on
average private hours paid in fact decelerate in 1965—1978 which would imply a
small (0.3 percent per annum) increase in hourly productivity growth.'4

Capital—Deepening Hypothesis
Given the just—demonstrated ability of demographic adjustments to explain
the measured secular variations in productivity growth, it smacks of pedantic
digression to spend any time on the capital—deepening hypothesis ——

particularly

so because the latter will prove at odds with the data.

Nonetheless a little consideration is due this hypothesis since its failure
suggests interesting areas for future research.
The capital—deepening argument can be expressed in terms of the simple

neoclassical growth model. Suppose that investment (k) is determined by
saving to be a constant fraction a of output y:

(6) k=ay

8

Suppose that output is determined by the linear homogeneous production

function

(7) y =

f(k,i)

where Labor is measured in efficiency units so that the given constant growth
rate of labor i/i is the sum of the growth rates of total hours and of the
average quality of those hours.'5 It is well known that in steady—state
equilibrium the growth rates of output and capital equal

with

fixed ratios

k/p. and y/i.16

The capital—deepening argument runs as follows: The growth rate of labor
in efficiency units (i.e., quality—adjusted) was about 0.4 percent per annum

lower from 1929—1965 than before or after. The lower line of Figure 1
illustrates such a protracted slowdown in labor growth. During this
intermediate period, the steady—state values of the k/i and hence yip. ratios

will rise yielding the jump in steady—state output Y at 1929 and
corresponding fall at 1965. Figure 2 illustrates the predicted effect on
actual output assuming that we were initially in steady—state equilibrium. In
the middle period the actual growth rate of output is reduced by the slower
steady—state growth rate of labor, but this is partially offset by the
transitional effect of moving up to the higher ratio of yip.. Thus the growth
rate of productivity would be increased in the middle period as compared to

the earlier period. A transitional effect would be operating in the opposite
direction to reduce productivity growth in the post—1965 period.
Despite its elegance, I believe that the capital—deepening hypothesis Is

not a satisfactory explanation for the productivity trends at issue. Besides
the fact that there are no unexplained secular increases in quality—adjusted

9

productivity growth during 1929—1965, there is no evidence of an increase in

the ratio of capital to output. In fact, over this period GPP grew at an
average rate of 3.0% while corporate capital input as measured by Christensen

and Jorgenson (1978, p. 35) grew by only 2.2%. As we shall see in Section II,
there are reasons to suspect that this may be an underestimate of capital
growth, but capital deepening still seems absent from the period.
An intriguing hypothesis for future research would be that the United
States should not be viewed as a closed economy, as in the previous

neoclassical growth analysis, but rather as a part of a world capital

market. Conditions of saving and labor growth in this larger market would
then control the evolution of the capital—labor ratio in America largely

independently of fluctuations in domestic labor growth. Unfortunately,
examination of international data must be left to the future.

Conclusions on Longer—Period Trends

Changes in immigration laws and the entry of the baby—boom divide the

twentieth century into three maJor periods: before 1929, 1929—1965, and after
1965. From the point of view of growth in employment and hours, each major
period seems reasonably consistent, but the middle period is characterized by

considerably lower growth than either of the exterior periods. Since the
growth rate of gross private product declines by less than the decline in

hours growth in the middle period, measured productivity growth rises. Such a
pattern is consistent with the implications of the neoclassical growth model,
but no evidence of the corresponding sharp increase in the capital input is

found. In contrast, it was shown that the demographic factors of age, sex,
immigration, and education explain all of the measured secular variation in

hourly productivity growth.17 Thus, it appears that there is no substantial

10

variation in trend private productivity growth over the twentieth century to
be explained by variations in regulation growth, oil prices, the failure of

American management, labor, or any of the other popular whipping boys. So far
as broad trends go, the U.S. productivity slowdown appears to be a case of
statistical myopia.

Demographic adjustments also appear to explain observed variations in

private employee productivity growth within the period 1900—1929. The hourly
productivity growth measure shows some residual variation (1.43% for 1900—1916
versus 1.96% for 1916—1929), but this appears to be related to anomolous

growth In average hours. It Is left for economic historians to unravel
whether the hourly productivity measure reflects a real phenomenon or simply
measurement error.

Much more substantial variations in hourly and employee productivity
growth are reported in Table 4 within the periods 1929—1965 and 1965—1978.
For example, quality—adjusted hourly productivity growth is reported as 1.0,
2.1, 2.0, and 0.9 percent per annum for 1929—1948, 1948—1965, 1965—1973, and

1973—1978, respectively. It is the task of Section II to explain this
residual variaton.

11

II. Analysis of Intra—Period Variations

Section I argues that the quality—adjusted hourly productivity growth
rate has had a constant secular value of 1.60 percent per annum throughout the

twentieth century. Then how are we to explain the fact that this growth rate
exceeded 2.0 percent per annum from 1948—1973 and was only 0.9 percent from

1973—1978? In this section it is first shown that the rapid 1948—1965 growth
is explained by the recovery of the capital—labor ratio from its abnormally

low level at the end of World War II and the Great Depression. That Is, the
rapid (slow) growth in labor productivity during 1948—1965 (1929—1948) is due
to abnormal movements in the capital stock relative to labor and output and
therfore is not reflected in total factor productivity growth or technical

progress. Next it is demonstrated that the reported variations within the
1965—1978 appear to be the result of biases in measured output due to evasion

of the 1971—1974 price controls. Correction of these biases eliminates any
tendency for productivity growth to slow in 1973—1978 or to be above 1.6
percent per annum in 1965—1973.

The 1929—1965 Period
The slow growth in 1929—1948 and rapid catch—up growth in 1948—1965 is
attributed here to the very low ratio of investment to output during the Great

Depression and World War II. The idea is that in 1948 we were quite poor in
the sense of a low capital—labor ratio and it took until around 1965 to
recover to the steady—state capital—labor and output—labor ratios as
illustrated in Figure 3.

An implication of the approximately equal quality—adjusted hourly
productivity growth rates for 1900—1929, 1929—1965, and 1965—1978 is that the

12

output—labor ratio is approximately the same in 1900, 1929, 1965, and 1978
after allowing for a constant rate of labor—augmenting technical progress.'8
Therefore, if capital growth explains the observed variation of output growth
within the period, it follows that there was no significant intra—period
variation in technical progress (total factor productivity growth).
A simple and usually serviceable characterization of the aggregate
production function is the Cobb—Douglas form

(8) y =

eTtk

where r is the rate of total factor productivity growth and 2. is now measured

(quality—adjusted) labor input. This can equivalently be written in
logarithmic form as

(9) log y =

where -y

log k + (l_)log(Le1t)

t/(l—$) is the constant rate of labor—augmenting technical

progress. Subtracting log 2. from both sides of equation (9) and using r for
the continuously compounded growth rate operator, we have

(10) r(y/L) =

-y

+ 8[rk — (rz-F-y')]

That is, the growth rate of labor productivity equals the rate of technical
progress plus the product of capital's share and the difference between the
capital and the adjusted labor growth rates.

The capital growth rate has been estimated as about 0.6 and 4.0 percent
per annum for 1929—1948 and 1948—1965, respectively.19 Equation (10) is used

13

to predict the observed quality—adjusted labor productivity growth rate for a

capital share of 1/4 as well as alternative value of 0.2 and 0.3. Table 5
reports the results which indicate that the actual and predicted growth ratio
of quality—adjusted hourly and employee productivity correspond quite closely

for 1929—1948. Thus the near cessation of investment during the Depression
and World War II nicely explains the observed slowdown in productivity

growth. Since the output—labor ratio has already been shown to return to its
trend value by 1965, the solution seems to be complete.
Unfortunately, the second line of each part of Table 5 indicates that the
predicted productivity growth falls short of actual growth by 0.2 or 0.3
percent per annum. It may be that this unexplained growth ref lects a real
temporary increase in technological progress that offsets an unusual fall in
the capital—output ratio of some 24 percent over 1929_1965,20 but a simpler

and economic explanation is also possible, Quite possibly the fault lies in
the capital data themselves: The quantum leap in tax rates during World War
II provides an incentive to write off as current expense as much capital
formation as possible; thus gross investment and capital growth could be

systematically understated in the postwar period.2' Suppose that a consistent
data series would in fact show no decline in the capital—output ratio. This
would imply that the true capital growth rate over 1948—1965 is 5.6 percent

per annum.22 In order for this to be the case, firms would have had to alter
their accounting practices so that reported net investment was reduced

relative to earlier practices by almost 24 percent. Given the large
incentives, this magnitude does not appear unreasonable, but further research

is clearly indicated.23 In any case, the lower halves of each part of Table 5
indicates that a rather smaller capital growth rate would be sufficient to
eliminate any apparent 1948—1965 rise in total factor productivity growth.

14

In summary, measured capital growth variations can explain all of the
1929—1948 slowdown in quality—adjusted labor productivity growth and a large

part of the 1948—1965 increase in that growth relative to trend. The
remaining 0.2 to 0.3 percent excess growth in 1948—1965 can be attributed
either to an unexplained temporary increase in total factor productivity
growth or to changes in net investment reporting in response to increased
income taxes.

The 1965—1978 Period
It is not widely recognized that the main problem with productivity
growth in 1973—1978 is concentrated in the seven quarters 1973 II through 1974
IV:

The productivity decline in 1973—74 was particularly striking.
Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector fell in every
quarter from the second quarter of 1973 to the fourth quarter of
1974, dropping a total of 4.2 percent in a 7—quarter period. On
the basis of the usual relati.onship between fluctuations in
productivity and fluctuations in output, no more than 1 percentage
point of that decline could be attributed to the sharp recession
during the period. The additional drop of 3.2 percentage points
accounts for ich of the difference between the expected 2 percent
annual growth rate between 1973 and 1977 and the 0.9 percent rate
that actually occurred.24
This section will demonstrate not only that the progressive relaxation and
ultimate removal of general price controls during 1973—1974 can fully account
for this anomolous excess productivity decline of 3.2 percent but also that
the imposition of these controls during 1971 II through 1973 I can account for
the peculiarly rapid productivity growth observed during those quarters.25
This rapid productivity growth permits us to reject the popular oil—price
hypothesis in favor of the price control hypothesis.
Bef ore examining the evidence, it is useful to sketch these two competing

hypotheses: The oil—price hypothesis as developed by such authors as Rasche

15

and Tatom (1977, 1981) asserts that higher oil prices will significantly lower
the equilibrium level of output consistent with a given level of labor and

capital and will further induce a fall over time in the level of capital. The
price—control hypothesis as developed in Darby (1976a, 1976b) asserts that
measured real output was progressively overstated (and price understated) from
their imposition in 1971 III through 1973 I and that this overstatement was
progressively eliminated under Phase III and decontrol (1973 11—1974 III).
Sung Hee Jwa (1982) has extended Darby's basic model by a formal analysis of

firm and industry equilibrium. Darby (1982a) examines the oil—price and
price—control hypotheses in detail using both U.S. and international data and
finds that the preponderance of evidence supports the price—control

hypothesis. This evidence will be supplemented below by directly estimating a
productivity growth equation. Additional empirical evidence is presented in

Appendix A.

First we wish to test whether oil price, price controls, or both had a
significant

influence on productivity growth other than via any temporary

effects causing unemployment and employment to differ from their steady—state

values. Standard productivity equations have deflated values on both sides
inducing spurious correlation if the price control hypothesis is true.

Fortunately, a simple dynamic Okun's Law extended by other current and leading
labor—market indicators provides very respectable explanatory power without

potential spurious correlation. The basic equation used corresponds in right—
hand variables to equation (5) in Darby (1982a):

(11) 1og (yh) = a1 + a2TS + a3tu + a4ALR
+

a5log Et + a6tlog Ei ÷

16

is the private—hours—paid definition of labor productivity,26 TSt

where

is a time shift dummy equal to 0 before 1965 and 1 otherwise,27 u is the
total unemployment rate, LRt is the layoff rate, and Et is employment in

manufacturing, mining, and construction. Note that the cyclical indicators
used in this equation are all based on counts of individuals and so not
subject to possible reporting biases (as are deflated series) under price

controls. The estimated equation for 1949 1—1980 IV is:28

(12) slog (y/L) = 0.0069 — 0.0022 TSt — 0.010

(—4.04)

D—W =

2.02

This equation does reasonably well at explaining quarterly fluctuations in
productivity growth, although only the current change in unemployment and the
lagged growth rate of employment are significant among the cyclical
indicators.

To test the price control hypothesis, a simple quantitaitve variable was

formed: CDt grows linearly from 0 in 1971 II to 1 in 1973 I and then falls
linearly back to 0 in 1974 IV. The deflated dollar price of a barrel of
Venezuelan oil was used for the oil price

The following general equation

was estimated with up to a one year adjustment lag permitted for oil prices to
take effect:

17

(13) slog (Yh) = a1 + a2TS + a3Au + a4E1LR + a5log Et

+ a6Alog E1 + a7CD + Ea8.log P_1 +

Table 6 reports the results of various alternative hypothesis tests that might

be conducted. Line 1 pertains to equation (13) as stated while all the other
lines involve various zero constraints on a7,...,a11.29 We see that whenever
the price—control variable is included it is significant at the 5 percent

level or better. The oil variables, in contrast, are never significant except
for line 5 in which, with both the price—control variable and lagged growth in
oil prices forced out, current oil—price growth is significant at the 10
percent level on a one—tailed test.

I conclude that oil—price changes had no

significant effect on productivity growth. Note particularly that a major
Increase in real oil prices occurred between 1979 I and 1980 1, but no direct
effect was detectable.

The final form of the regression is

Consider the implications of this equation for the level of productivity

in the year 1973. The average value of CDt in 1973 is 0.7857 which, when
multiplied by 0.043997, implies that the logarithm of labor productivity in

1973 was overstated by 0.0343.30 This means that the 1965—1973 growth rates

18

of private labor productivity are overstated by 3.43/8 = 0.43 percent per
annum and correspondingly that the 1973—1978 growth rates are understated by
3.43/5 = 0.69 percent per annum. Table 7 shows that applying this correction

to the quality—adjusted productivity growth rates of Section I completely

eliminates any evidence of a 1973—1978 productivity slowdown. Instead the
picture is one of remarkably stable productivity growth over the period 1965—
1978 after accounting for the 1973 measurement biases.

It is of course true that price controls could have had real effects, but
these effects should have operated by changing unemployment and employment.
The estimated coefficient of ACD captures some additional impact which must
either measure output overstatement or some shift in the relationship of

output to labor inputs for a reason yet to be proposed in the literature. For
any yet skeptical reader, additional discussion and evidence is contained in
Appendix A.

III. Conclusions and Areas for Future Research

The results of this study can be clearly summarized by the use of two

figures. Figure 4 illustrates the logarithm of hourly productivity measured
in the standard way by GPP/THWP. It is difficult if not impossible to discern
any overall trend although 1900—1929 and 1929—1948 might be identified as
periods of slow growth followed by rapid growth during 1948—1965 and then

slowing growth over 1965—1973 and 1973—1978. The logarithm of quality—
adjusted hourly productivity (GPP/QATHWP) is plotted in Figure 5. Here a
constant trend line dominates the data except during the Depression—Korean War

era of slow investment and subsequent rapid recovery. With demographic
factors accounted for, the anomolous productivity gains in 1972 and 1973
(which we attribute to measurement biases) stick out like the proverbial sore
thumb.

The major conclusion to be drawn is that there have been no substantial
variations in trend growth rates of private labor productivity since 1900 if
reasonable adjustments are made for the effects of demographic trends on the

average quality of labor. Even if one were to ignore the effects of
demographic shifts, the measured growth rates of productivity, total private
hours, and private employment have essentially the same values in 1900—1929 as
in 1965—1978 so that panic may

be

premature.

The slow labor productivity growth in 1929—1948 can be explained by the
near cessation of capital formation, but measured increases in capital growth
in 1948—1965 are too small to fully account for the catch—up of labor

productivity. Further research is required to determine whether this is due
to problems in the measurement of capital or to other yet undiscovered

factors. The slowdown in productivity growth within the period 1965—1978 can

20

be readily explained by measurement biases induced by evasion of price

controls. Increased oil prices do not play a significant role.
Taken as a whole, the evidence does not support the view that there has
been a substantial, inexplicable decline in total factor productivity growth

since 1965 and especially since 1973. Instead the evidence presented here
indicates that there has been a surprisingly stable growth rate of total

factor productivity throughout the twentieth century. Only in 1948—1965 is
there any evidence of a substantial (0.2 to 0.3 percent per annum) temporary
increase in total factor productivity growth and there are good economic
reasons to suspect that this may be an artifact of tax—induced changes in
accounting procedures.

A considerable program for future research which has been noted in

previous sections can be briefly summarized here: (1) An interesting issue
for economic historians is whether the intra—period inconsistency between
hourly and employee productivity growth for 1900—1929 reflects a real
phenomenon or indicates a measurement problem in the data on average hours

worked. (2) Certainly improvements can be made to the demographic adjustments

reported here. Doubtless others will test these results by doing so. (3) The
failure of the closed—economy neoclassical growth model suggests an

(industrialized) world linked by capital flows which are quite responsive in

the long—run. So like analysis of other economies could similarly explain
their postwar labor productivity recoveries and slowdowns. It further
suggests investment incentives may be more effective than saving incentives as

means of increasing domestic capital stock. (4) In light of the discrepancy
between full recovery in the output—labor ratio and incomplete recovery in the
capital—labor ratio, a reexamination of the consistency of existing estimates

of net investment and the capital stock is in order. (5) The potential

21

importance of price—control induced biases in deflated (and deflator) data

during the 1971—1974 period is once again demonstrated. Further evidence is
called for on this issue, but the time has come to reexamine various claims
for effects of oil—price and other variables which may serve as a proxy for
these reporting biases.

One must conclude with a warning note: The fact that factors such as
regulation, governmental size, oil prices, management practices, educational
quality, moral fiber, and the like have not been required to fully explain
twentieth century variations in labor productivity does not imply that they

have been unimportant. Any or all of them may have been quite important in
determining the trend value of total factor productivity growth. Nonetheless
in the aggregate their impact has caused quality—adjusted total factor
productivity growth to evolve as if following a random walk with constant

drift and small variance. For this type of process the average growth rate of
total factor productivity growth converges over considerable periods to the
constant drift.

22

APPENDIX A
ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND EVIDENCE ON THE PRICE—CONTROL HYPOTHESIS

This Appendix provides discussion and evidence on the price—control
hypothesis supplementary to that contained in Darby (1976a, 1976b, 1982a) and
in the main text of this paper.

There are three popular models of the effects of Nixon's Economic

Stabilization Program (ESP): The first, used as the basic economic support
for the program, argued that sticky expectations and nominal contracts would

delay adjustment to a new lower, noninflationary equilibrium. The ES?, the
argument goes, would accelerate the adjustment process and minimize the

transitional increase in unemployment. The second view, associated with Barro
and Grossman (1974) and Evans (1980), argues that general price controls
reduce real output and inflation by inducing increased consumption of

leisure. The third view, which I have proposed, argues that the ES? was
largely window—dressing and was easily evaded by minor covert quality

depreciation both n physical products and services and in the terms on which
they were sold.

Needless to say, these views are not mutually exclusive. For example,
the ES? most probably reduced the unemployment associated with the existing
macroeconomic conditions so that true output Increased while reported output
increased even more due to covert quality depreciaiton not captured in the

official price indices. For the analysis of productivity growth, we are
interested in the reporting effects and of the real effects.31
It may be useful to look more closely at how these reporting effects

could occur. Recall that the ES? established price controls relative to the
base—period price of each product produced by each firm. New, higher quality

23

products could be introduced at higher prices reflecting their higher costs.
During Phases 1 and 2 (August 1971—January 1973) the controlled prices
generally fell relative to the prices which otherwise would have prevailed.
This provided an increasing incentive to make covert quality depreciations in

existing goods and to claim spurious quality appreciatons in new goods. Or to
say the same thing, there was an increasing incentive to publicize every
quality improvement and to shade the quality of existing products. If firms
reacted to these incentives as we normally suppose, then those collecting data
for computing price indices would likely miss more quality depreciation and

record more quality appreciation than normal. Controls become progressively
less binding under the subsequent Phases III and IV ending de jure on April
30, 1974, with the expiration of legislative authority and de facto in the
third quarter with the expiration of certain pricing agreements negotiated in

exchange for early decontrol.32 So during this period firms had an incentive

to progressively restore their products to their nominal quality. To the
extent price data collectors missed the shading of quality during Phases I and
II, they should equally have missed Its restoratIon during the relaxation and
removal of controls.

Before going any further, we must consider whether this story is

empirically plausible. Some economists, especially those responsible for
collecting the price data, have doubted that any significant quality shading

could have been missed. However, the price—control hypothesis does not
require any huge errors. The estimate in equation (13) of the missed quality

decrease —

or

better, of the decrease in the quality improvement which was

missed — only amounts to about 0.2 percent per month (2.5 percent per
annum). This magnitude is very small not only in absolute terms but also
relative to the supposed margin of error in quality adjustments.33 Missed

24

quality change always imparts some bias to measured real GNP growth, but price
controls impart incentives which change the bias in predictable ways.
Another possible objection is that firms shading quality would be caught

by the I.R.S.'s monitoring of the profit margin ceiling. But this is not the
case in a balanced inflation in which prices, costs, sales, and profits all

rise in proportion. Everyone can accurately report the dollar amounts of
revenues, costs, and profits since the profit margin ceiling was purely window
dressing absent any effective controls on (quality—adjusted) costs.

Thus

nominal value added and nominal GNP will be correctly computed; only its
division between real GNP and the deflator will be biased.
The text and Darby (1982a) have already shown that misreporting under
price controls can explain the anomolous behavior of Okun's Law during the

price control period.34 Okun's Law should underpredict output growth from
1971 III through 1973 I when the growth is overreported and correspondingly

overpredict output growth during th& decontrol period. For 1971 II to 1974 LV
as a whole, Okun's Law predicts total growth in real GNP rather well.35
Let us see what other evIdence can be offered in support of the reporting

hypothesis. A simple check on the hypothesis that the nominal GNP data will
be unaffected involves running a simple reduced—form regression explaining
nominal GNP (Y) growth by a distributed lag on nominal money (NiB) growth
and ACD:

(15) log Y = h0 + Eh11lo N1Bt. + h9ACD

The estimated regression can he summarized as

25

(16) ilog Y = 0.0088 + E h

S.E.E. = 0.0073,

2 = 0.34,

D—W = 1.99,

PERIOD = 1961 1—1980 III

Thus controls do not appear to have any significant impact on nominal GNP.36
An analogous regression ccmfirms the hypothesized negative impact of controls
on the inflation rate as measured by the GNP deflator PD:37

(17) Alog PD = —0.0010 + E k

S.E.E. = 0.0036,

R2 =

0.35,

D—W =

2.22,

PERIOD = 1961 1—1980 III

Thus regression analysIs of U.S. data on real GNP, nomInal GNP, and the GNP
deflator indicates that price controls had no effect on reported total nominal

spending, but only upon its division into prices and output. The fact that
real output and productivity growth appear to rise and fall relative to that
predicted by labor—market conditions strongly supports the reporting
hypothesis.

Separate evidence in support of the reporting hypothesis is to be found
in comparisons of reported deflated GNP not with inputs but with alternative

measures of output. Terborgh (1979) has noted the anomolous behavior of
reported real GNP relative to the Federal Reserve index of manufacturing

production in the period 1971—1974. As noted by Terborgh, the FRB Index is

26

based primarily on counts of physical units. Terborgh shows that although
normally the FRB index grows faster than real GNP, this is not true in 1971

and 1972. Furthermore measured real GNP falls sharply relative to the FRB
index in 1973, 1974, and 1975.38 A formal check on whether or not price
controls move measured real GNP compared to what would be expected from the
Index of Manufacturing Production (IMP) involves running the regression:

(18) tlog y = 0.0052
(9.21)

S.E.E. = 0.0061,

+ 0.3239 tlog IMP + 0.0355 CD
(3.05)

(16.72)

=

0.71,

D—W

2.02,

PERIOD = 1948 11—1980111

Note that the coefficient on t1CD is some 0.009 smaller than that estimated in

the text for the productivity growth equation. Although the difference Is not
significant, it is to be expected since IMP includes some deflated as well as

physical unit series.39 It is proposed in future research to follow up these
very promising results by using the underlying individual data series on
physical units of homogeneous commodIties to construct an Independent estimate
of real GNP for analysis of recent productivity growth.
In

summary, there is a considerable body of evidence that the uneven

productivity growth reported in 1965—1978 can be explained by reporting biases

in 1971—1974 and normal cyclical factors. Darby (1982a) showed that similar
adjustments

may be required in those countries which adopted programs modeled

on the ESP during 1971—1974. These results support the basic conclusion of
this paper: that there have been no substantial variations in secular U.S.
labor productivity growth after adjustment for changing demographic trends.

APPENDIX B
DATA APPENDIX

The primary data base for this paper is reported in Darby (1982c). Table
8 extracts the data on private employment (FE), total hours worked in the
private sector (THWP), the implicit average hours worked in the private sector

(AHWP), and gross private product (GPP) from that source. Table 9 reports the
data for the five main calcu1ated series: quality—adjusted private employment
(QAPE), quality—adjusted total private hours worked (QATHWP), the average
years since migration of foreign—born workers by sex (ZM and ZF), and the
median years of education E.

FOOTNOTES

*This research was begun with financial support received from the
U.C.L.A. Institute of Industrial Relations and the Foundation for Research in

Economics and Education. It has been completed as part of the National Bureau
of Economic Research's Project on Productivity and Industrial Change in the

World Economy. An earlier version was presented as the Goldwater Lecture at
the Arizona State University, September 24, 1982. The participants in the
U.C.L.A. and Berkeley Money Workshops, especially Roger Craine, Sebastian
Edwards, Dan Friedman, John Haltiwanger, Ed Learner, Axel Leijonhufvud, James

Pierce, Mark Plant, Ken Sokoloff, and Ezio Tarantelli, provided valuable

comments. Charles S. Morris, Elizabeth M. Landaw, and Frances R. Hammond
provided able research assistance. Any opinions expressed are those of the

author and not necessarily those of the funding organizations. This is not an
official publication of the N.B.E.R.
i-Productivity trend growth rates are normally computed from high—

employment to high—employment year to avoid the large cyclical variations In
productivity analyzed by such authors as Oi (1962), Fair (1969), Solow (1973),

Sims (1974), and Gordon (1979). The figures in the text are for the private—
nonfarm—output—per—hour—paid—for definition of labor productivity and are
taken from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (1979, pp. 67—68).
2Darby (1982b, 1982c).

3As discussed below, the results are not very sensitive to the particular

measures chosen. The ratio of GPP to total private hours worked indicates the
largest 1965—1978 private hourly productivity slowdown (0.67 percentage

points) and is accordingly used. At the other extreme, total private hours
paid would indicate only a 0.39 percentage point deceleration.

33

4lmmigration was sharply limited by the "national origin" quota system in

effect from 1929 until abolished by the Act of October 3, 1965. The average
ratio of immigrants (16 and over) to civilian labor force was 1.42, 0.20, and
0.34 percent for 1900—1929, 1930—1965, and 1966—1978, respectively.
5The break years 1948 and 1973 are the standard ones in the literature.
The year 1916 was chosen as a convenient high employment year.
6The estimates are computed from relative earnings for 1929—1970 and
1970—1976, respectively, f-or finer age groups. The finer age groups were

weighted for percentage of total hours worked. Note that the relative wages
reflect not only pure age and sex differences in human capital hut also the

relative amounts of education, all taken as approximately constant. Changes
in the average level of education are accounted for in equation (5) below.

7See Chiswick (1978, 1979) and Blau (1980). Previously Friedman (1974)
had noted that the rapid immigration of the early twentieth century reduced
measured growth in real per capita income or, as here, labor productivity.

8These parameters were derived as follows. Blau (1980, p. 32) indicates
gross log differentials in wages at entry for Ethnic Group 2 (the relevant one

for post 1900) of —0.351 for men and —0.183 for women. Now e°35' = 0.704

and e°'83 = 0.833.

These gross differentials were in part due to education,

which is adjusted for separately below. Allowance is made for 1 year of
education (see Chiswick, 1978, p. 907) or 7 percent which approximately

squares with Blau's results for percent literate. (No allowance was made for
differences in mean ages as preliminary calculations suggested any effect was

negligible.) Thus the gross wage differential on entry used was (1.07)
(0.704) = 0.753 for males and (1.07) (0.833) = 0.891 for females. The
estimated effect on the log of real wages of years since migration was 0.0107

for males and 0.0117 for females, and e°°107 = 1.01076 and e°°-'7 =

34

0.01177. Using 1970 data for men, Chiawick (1978) obtained values implying an
z
adjustment factor of about (1.015) M(0•721) for males. A sensitivity check
showed that substituting this factor made no significant difference to the
results.

9Unfortunately, no data was found to make differential adjustments by age
group so the same factor was used f or both young and old.

10The 1909 data came from U.S. Immigration CommIssion (1911, Table 56,

pp. 1521 and 1528). The cells were assigned their mean values (0.5, 1.5, 2.5,
3.5, 4.5, 7.5, 12.5, and 17.5) except for the open cell (20 years and over)

for which Blau's value of 30 years was used. The 1970 data were from U.S.
Bureau of the Census (1973, Table 18, p. 466) using cell values of 2.65, 7.8,
12.8, 17.8, 22.8, 30.3, 40.3, and 53.1 years for the open (before 1925)

cell. The last value was estimated by taking weighted averages of young
immigrants arriving 1904 through 1924 who would be 65 or under in 1970.

"This value was taken from Chiswick (1978, P. 908) and appears
reasonable in terms of such recent cross—section results as reported by Smith

and Welch (1977). Yet lower rates of return to education would lower
productivity growth in the early period relative to the two later periods, but

would not have much effect on the main conclusion of this section: the
absence of a secular decline in productivity growth.
12Mean years of education were not available, but if the difference is

constant the substitution of the median will not affect the growth rates

estimated below. Folger and Nam (1964) retroject the 1940 census data back to
obtain median estimates for 1930, 1920, 1910. These values of 8.6, 8.4, 8.2,
and 8.1 were extrapolated to 8.0 in 1900. Sources for more recent years are

given in the data appendix. Log—linear interpolation was used to fill in
missing values.

35

'3The growth—rate effect of education is separable from those of age,

sex, and immigration, but the latter effects are not separable from each

other. Because the age—sex adjustment is more important for the last two
periods, the effect of the age—sex correction is reported if no adjustment is
made for immigrants and then the additional (marginal) adjustment when APE is
computed according to equations (1), (2), and (3).
14This deceleration is not reflected in the household survey data on

average hours worked per person employed in the civilian economy (AHW) but is

even a bit larger in the establishment data on hours paid per production or
other nonsupervisory employee (AI-1PN).

It might reflect increased moonlighting

(higher hours per person employed but less hours per employee in each

establishment). The growth in average private hours paid per person employed
in the private sector (AHP) is computed as the growth rate of the ratio of
total private hours paid for (all employees, private business sector,

establishment data) to private employment. The deceleration in this AHP
measure is less than in the ARPN measure either due to increased moonlighting

or less negative growth in average supervisory hours, The remaInIng 0.2%
discrepancy between the growth rates of the Al-lW and AHP measures could be

attributed to shifts in the government/private employment mix and to less
negative growth in average hours worked per government employee, but data is

lacking to demonstrate this. Another possibility is a yet unidentified change
in reporting procedures for the establishment data —— such a change occurred
in 1934 with the introduction of the N.I.R.A. codes and minimum wages, but the
hours data were adjusted for that.

'5me growth rate of the average quality of the hours will reflect both
the increasing human capital embodied in the labor force and any labor—
augmenting technical progress.

36

-6Textbook expositions of these results may be found in Solow (1970, pp.
17—38) and Darby (1979, pp. 105—115, 139—140,. 440—441).
171f one makes no allowance for measurement error, one could say that

productivity growth was a bit low in 1929—1965 relative to 1900—1929 and 1965—
1978, but surely this is going too far.

18As is well known, technical progress or total factor productivity
growth is a euphemism for the increase in output which we cannot explain by

the increase in measured inputs. Presumably, the constancy of its average
growth rate over substantial periods reflects the law of large numbers and
numerous independent contributing factors.

19Christensen and Jorgensen (1978, pp. 35, 53) report series on corporate
capital input and private domestic captial input with 1929—1948 growth rates

of 0.7% and 0.4% per annum, respectively. The NBER—Kendrick capital input
series in U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (1973, pp. 192—193, Series A65) has

an average growth rate of 0.6% per annum during this period. For 1948—1965,
Christensen and Jorgensen estimate that private domestic and corporate capital

input grew at average rates of 4,0% and 3.8% per annum respectively. The
NBER—Kendrick data indicate only a 3.4% growth rate. The preference for the
higher growth rate in the latter period is explained in the text below.
20The implied average growth rate of capital is 2.21% per annum while
output grew at 2.98%; exp[(0.022l—0.0298)(36)] =

e°2772

=

0.758.

210verdeflation of gross investment due to undercorrection for quality
changes would have a similar effect.

22That is, [(19)(0.6%) + (17)(5.6%)]136 = 2.96%

ry = 2.98%.

23obviously, I subscribe to the view that consistent data—collection
procedures do not yield consistent data series when incentives or constraints
change so as to alter the behavior of the optimizing agents who provide the

37

data. This differs from the uncertainty principle in that economic analysis
can be applied to estimate the nature of the changes.
24U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (1979, P. 70).

25See Perry (1977, p. 37). In terms of my own short—run productivity

growth function — equation (12) below —— the residuals for these seven
quarters are 0.0123, —0.0064, 0.0040, 0.0084, 0.0011, 0.0049, and 0.0106,

respectively, for a sum of 0.0349. The residuals for the next seven quarters
are —0.0068, —0.0058, —0.0037, —0.0079, —0.0117, —0.0076, and 0.0028,

respectively, for a sum of —0.0407. The difference (—0.006) is statistically
insignificant but could reflect a very small oil—price effect on productivity.
26This was the most convenient measure of private productivity available

quarterly. All

data

for this quarterly analysis were taken from the Citibase

data bank.

27This variable is supposed to capture the differential effects of the
demographic adjustments summarized in Tables 2 and 3 above.

28The t—statistics are in parentheses below the estimated coefficients.
line 6 refers to equation (12) as reported above,

30mis estimate is an estimate of the overstatement in deflated private
output and thus applies equally well to the annual quality—adjusted private
productivity measures reported In Table 4 above.

31mus equation (14) in the main text is a way of estimating the spurious
increase in reported output conditional upon whatever real effect on

unemployment and employment may have occurred. The reporting hypothesis
implies that the official division of nominal amounts into quantities and

prices is generally suspect during 1971—1974. Deriving implications from
(possibly) incorrectly deflated data is a task not unlike that of George

Smiley in LeCarre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Frequently the data seem to

38

tell one consistent story if they are taken at face value and another

consistent story if they are assumed biased by the price—control program. The
challenge is to find cases in which only one of the hypotheses fit.
32Charles Cox (1980) uses October 1973 (i.e., 1973 IV instead of 1973 II)
as the beginning of the decontrol period since that was the beginning of

sector—by—sector decontrol. I believe that the Phase III removal of
requirements for prior approval of price increases was a major relaxation

since —— as explained below ——

the

remaining profit margin ceiling was

consistent with any rate of inflation. Some macroeconomic evidence supporting
1973 II instead of 1973 IV as the start of decontrol is offered below, but the

issue is not crucial. The same evidence is consistent with Cox's view that
the controls had no effect on price levels past 1974 II (as compared to my
1974 III) nor on growth rates past 1974 III.
33Economists have traditionally argued that missed quality improvements
might imply a 2 percent measured inflation even if the "true" price level was

constant. See, for example, Ackley (1961, p. 87), Price Statistics Review
Committee (1961, pp. 35—39), and Griliches (1961).
341n a simple dynamic Okun's Law regression, one obtains:

1og y = 0.0089
(14.18)

S.E.E. = 0.0071,

2 = 0.61,

—

O.0l80Eu
(—13.23)

D—W =

1.99,

+ O.0436ACD
(3.24)

PERIOD = 1948 11—1980111

The coefficient on 1CD is nearly identical to the estimate of 0.04397 obtained

in the productivity—growth equation (14) in the text. Note, that although
Okun's Law is sometimes reversed to explain u given t1og y, that form is not
appropriate to the current case in which relatively large measurement error is

39

hypothesized for tdog y as compared to Au.
35See Darby (1976a).

36These results are inconsistent with the Barro—Crossman—Evans view
discussed above.

37This equation was estimated with a first order correction for

autocorrelation (p =

0.5419).

Without this correction the coefficient

of ACD was estimated as —0.0437 (standard error 0.0082, t—statistic —5.3084)

and the S.EE. was 0.0041 with a D—W of 1.13.
38Terborgh's use of annual data spreads the adjustment period into 1975
since the average 1974 real GNP data will be overstated on the price control
hypothesis.

39A formal F—test was conducted for both this regression and the one
reported in footnote 34 above to test the implicit hypothesis that the

coefficient was the same during the decontrol and control periods. The
hypothesis was not rejected.
