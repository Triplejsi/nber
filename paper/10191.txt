The Rise of the Skilled City

JEL No. J1
ABSTRACT
For more than a century, educated cities have grown more quickly than comparable cities with less
human capital. This fact survives a battery of other control variables, metropolitan area fixed effects
and tests for reverse causality. We also find that skilled cities are growing because they are
becoming more economically productive (relative to less skilled cities), not because these cities are
becoming more attractive places to live. Most surprisingly, we find evidence suggesting that the
skills-city growth connection occurs mainly in declining areas and occurs in large part because
skilled cities are better at adapting to economic shocks. As in Schultz (1964), skills appear to permit
adaptation.

Introduction

Between 1980 and 2000, the population of metropolitan areas where less than 10 percent
of adults had college degrees in 1980, grew on average by 13 percent.

Among

metropolitan areas where more than 25 percent of adults had college degrees, the average
population growth rate was 45 percent. For more than a century, in both the United
States and Great Britain, cities with more educated residents have grown faster than
comparable cities with less human capital (Glaeser, 1994, Glaeser et al. 1995, Simon,
1998, Black and Henderson, 1999, Nardinelli and Simon, 1996, 2002).

There is no

consensus, however, on the causes or implications of this relationship.

Why have people increasingly crowded around the most skilled? Why does education
seem to be an increasingly important ingredient in agglomeration economies? Three
disparate, but not incompatible, visions of the modern city offer different answers to
these questions. The Consumer City view (e.g. Glaeser, Kolko, Saiz, 2002)— cities are
increasingly oriented around consumption amenities, not productivity—tells us that
skills predict growth because skilled neighbors are an attractive consumption amenity.
The Information City view (Jacobs, 1968)— cities exist to facilitate the flow of ideas—
tells us that we should expect cities to be increasingly oriented around the skilled because
the skilled specialize in ideas. The Reinvention City view (Glaeser, 2003)— cities
survive only by adapting their economies to new technologies— tells us that human
capital predicts city growth because human capital enables people to adapt well to change

2

(as in Shultz, 1964, Welch, 1970). Understanding why skills predict city growth will
help us determine if cities thrive because of consumption, information or reinvention.

In Section II of this paper, we use four approaches to address the possibility that the rise
of the skilled city is the result of a spurious correlation between local skills and other
urban characteristics.

First, we show that controlling for a wide range of other factors

makes little difference to the impact of local skills on subsequent city growth and that
local human capital is essentially orthogonal to many of the most important local
amenities. Second, we show that the metropolitan area human capital effect is robust to
including metropolitan area fixed effects. Third, we examine the connection between the
number of colleges per capita in 1940 and growth between 1970 and 2000. The preWorld War II number of colleges seems considerably more exogenous than current skill
levels and it still correlates quite strongly with growth in the modern era.1

Fourth, we examine the timing of skills and growth and test whether skilled workers
flock to cities that are growing. Individuals with low education are particularly prone to
live in declining cities (as in Glaeser and Gyourko, 2001), but exogenous differences in
positive growth rates do not predict changes in the percentage of the population with a
college education. Reverse causation from growth to education seems to be present only
in a handful of declining metropolitan areas, and cannot account for much of the relevant
effect. Overall, the evidence supports the view that skills induce growth.

1

In this we follow Moretti (2003). Card (1995) uses proximity to college as an instrumental variable for
the level of education of an individual.

3

In Section III of the paper, we follow the methodology in Shapiro (2003) and present a
framework for understanding the connection between skills and growth. The framework
tells us that production-led growth should increase nominal wages and housing prices,
while consumption-led growth should cause real wages to fall. Rising nominal wages are
a sufficient condition for productivity growth, and declining real wages are necessary for
the amenity story to be of relevance.

Our empirical work in Section IV shows that productivity drives most of the connection
between skills and growth. At the metropolitan level, we find that education levels have
a positive impact on future wage and housing price growth. With almost any reasonable
set of parameter values, the connection between education and population growth is the
exclusive result of rising productivity and has less to do with rising amenity levels.
Indeed, real wages may actually be rising in high-education metropolitan areas, which
suggests that consumer amenities are actually declining in high skill areas.

At the city level, the results are less clear. In small municipalities within metropolitan
areas, low levels of human capital predict urban decline and falling housing prices. At
the city level (not at the metropolitan area level), it is the bottom end of the human capital
distribution that matters. High school dropouts predict urban decline. Moreover, this
decline appears to be driven, at least in part, through consumption-related effects.
Perhaps, unfortunately, poverty has become to be perceived as an increasingly negative
amenity because of social problems or a higher tax burden.

4

The fact that skills increase metropolitan area growth through productivity increases is
compatible with both the Information City and the Reinvention City hypotheses. In
Section V, we try to distinguish between these two interpretations of the growth-skills
connection.

To test the Information City hypothesis, we turn to patent data. Previous

research shows that areas with more human capital have higher rates of patenting per
capita (Carlino et al, 2001). We find that controlling for patenting rates does not explain
any portion of the effect of human capital on growth. This certainly does not disprove
the Information City hypothesis, but it doesn’t support it either.

One test of the reinvention hypothesis is to look at the cross-effect between skills and
factors that have an independent effect on city growth. The Information City view
implies that skills should predict growth among all types of cities. The Reinvention City
hypothesis predicts that skills should only matter among those cities that have received
negative shocks. We test this implication by looking at the cross effect between skills
and the weather, and skills and immigration. Warm weather and immigration have been
two of the most important drivers of contemporaneous metropolitan population growth in
the United States. As Figure 4 shows, the correlation between skills and growth is
essentially zero in warm cities. As Figure 5 shows, the correlation coefficient between
skills and growth is over 50 percent.

We also find that skills don’t matter much in

immigrant cities. There is a strong negative cross-effect between skills and either warmth
or immigration, which means that human capital really only matters in potentially
declining places, which in turn supports the reinvention hypothesis.

5

We also test the reinvention hypothesis by seeing whether skilled places shifted out of
manufacturing more quickly. In the first part of the 20th century, urban success generally
meant specialization in manufacturing.

Declining transport costs and declining

importance of manufacturing has meant that at the beginning of the 21st century,
successful cities have moved from manufacturing into other industries. If the reinvention
hypothesis is right then it should predict the speed at which cities reinvent themselves.
Indeed, we find that metropolitan areas with high levels of education and significant
manufacturing as of 1940 switched from manufacturing to other industries faster than
high-manufacturing areas with less human capital. These results suggest that skills are
valuable because they help cities adapt and change their activities in response to negative
economic shocks.

II. Is the Skills-Growth Connection Spurious?

In this section, we confirm the empirical relationship between education and metropolitan
statistical area (MSA) growth. We test whether the connection between skills and city
growth is spurious, reflecting omitted variables. We use both cities and MSAs as our unit
of analysis, because there are advantages and disadvantages to both. MSAs are more
natural labor markets, but cities are smaller and a better unit of analysis for understanding
either amenities or real estate prices.

We use the 1999 county-based boundaries

(NECMA definitions in New England and PMSA definitions in the rest of the country).2
Using county level data, it is possible for us to obtain a complete and consistent panel for

Using the most recent boundaries helps us avoid the endogeneity of current definitions to growth.

1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. We select those cities with population over 30,000 in 1970.
The Data Appendix details the sources of all variables

In Figure 1, we show the correlation between the growth of the logarithm of population
between 1980 and 2000 and the share of adults in 1980 with college degrees among
metropolitan statistical areas. In Table 1 (panel a) we show the correlation between
Metropolitan Area level growth and the primary independent variables over the entire
1970-2000 period. Table 1 (panel b) shows similar correlations at the city level. In both
cases, there is a significant association between initial education levels and later growth.
The correlation between the share of college graduates and population growth is 18
percent in the case of cities and 30 percent in the case of metropolitan areas.

While we focus primarily on the share of the adult population with college degrees, an
alternative measure of human capital, the share of adults who dropped out of high school,
is a stronger (i.e. more negative) correlate of city growth, but a weaker correlate of MSA
growth. This suggests that the impact of higher education may be more important at the
MSA level (maybe due to a productivity effect), whereas the impact of low education is
more important at the city level (maybe because of localized social interactions). While
these correlations are large, other variables such as heating degree days, annual
precipitation and the share of labor force in manufacturing have stronger correlations
with population growth than the human capital variables.

7

Our baseline regressions use a panel of metropolitan areas (in Table 2) and cities (in
Table 3) over three periods (the 70s, the 80s and the 90s).3 The dependent variable is the
difference in the log of population between census years. We focus on the coefficient on
the share of the population with a college education.4

All regressions include decade-

specific fixed effects and allow each geographic unit’s standard errors to be correlated
over time. More precisely, we estimate the coefficients β and γ

j

in regressions of the

form:
(1)

where

⎛ Populationi,t ⎞⎟
Collegei,t −10
Log ⎜⎜⎜

⎟⎟ = β ⋅

⎜⎝ Populationi,t −10 ⎠

Collegei ,t −10

is the share of the population with a college degree in the initial

year, Z i , j ,t −10 is the value of independent variable j in the initial year, Yt is a decadespecific fixed effect and ε i,t is the city-year error term, which we allow to be correlated
across decades.

Regression (1) in Tables 2 and 3 shows the raw impact of percent college educated on
later growth for MSAs and cities respectively. In the case of the MSA-level regressions,
a one-percentage-point increase in the share of the adult population with college degrees
increases the decadal growth rate by, approximately, almost one-half of one percent.
The standard deviation of metropolitan area growth is approximately .1 and the standard
deviation of the college graduation variable is approximately .05:

a one standard

3

We have data for four years: 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. Since we are using population growth (the first
difference in the log of population) we end up with 3 time periods.

This corresponds to individuals with a bachelor’s degree.

deviation increase in percent college graduates increases the expected growth rate by onequarter of a standard deviation.

In the city-level regressions reported in Table 3, the basic effect of college education is
weaker. A one percent increase in college graduates increases the expected growth rate
by one fifth of one percent. At the city-level the standard deviation of the percent college
educated variable is approximately .1, and the standard deviation of decadal growth rates
is about .15. This means that a one standard deviation increase in the percent college
educated at the city level is associated with approximately a one seventh of a standard
deviation increase in the expected growth rate. As suggested by the raw correlations,
college education is a more powerful predictor of growth at the MSA level than growth at
the city level.

In regression (2) of both tables, we include initial population, the log of heating degree
days, the log of average precipitation, the share of labor force in manufacturing, trade and
professional services,5 and controls for the four Census regions. Warm and dry weather
have been shown to be amongst the important predictors of population growth in the
United States at the end of the 20th century (Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz, 2001, Glaeser and
Shapiro, 2003). Heating degree days is a measure of cold weather severity (roughly, how
many days would a household need to use heating to keep warm). Initial population is
usually unrelated to later city growth (as in Glaeser, Scheinkman and Shleifer, 1995,
Eaton and Eckstein, 1997) but it remains a natural control. The employment share

These are the three major occupations in our sample, representing 63% of total MSA employment in
1990.

9

variables capture aspects of industrial orientation and we know from Table 1 that
specializing in manufacturing is a strong correlate of later decline.

For both cities and metropolitan areas we find that warm, dry places grow much more
quickly than cold, wet places. There is a modest amount of mean reversion: bigger cities
and metropolitan areas grow somewhat more slowly. Metropolitan areas with substantial
manufacturing grow more slowly. While these correlations are interesting, we will not
discuss them further because they have been considered at length elsewhere (Glaeser,
Scheinkman and Shleifer, 1995, Glaeser and Shapiro, 2003). Our focus is the extent that
controlling for these variables changes the impact of college education on later city
growth.

Including these controls has little impact on the coefficient on the college educated.
Education does not predict growth because educated metropolitan areas have more
employment in the service sector or better weather. In the case of metropolitan areas,
including these factors actually causes the coefficient on percent college educated to rise.
The fact that controlling for these major potential omitted variables causes the impact of
college to rise shouldn’t surprise us, because skilled workers are actually less likely to
live in warm, dry places. Since more educated people have tended to live in the areas of
the country with less desirable climates, controlling for the weather variables makes the
impact of education stronger, not weaker.

10

In specification three, we include state-specific fixed effects. In principle, these fixed
effects should capture all time-invariant weather or geographic variables, as well as those
state-level policies that change only slowly over time. In Tables 2 and 3, controlling for
state-specific effects has only a modest impact. In the case of metropolitan areas, the
state fixed effects regressions have almost exactly the same coefficient as the regression
with no controls. In the case of cities, the state fixed effects cause the coefficient on
education to drop 18 percent relative to the no control specification. We generally prefer
not to work with state specific fixed effects, especially in the case of metropolitan area
regressions, since many states have only a small number of metropolitan areas.

In the fourth regression, we include a city or metropolitan area fixed effect. This control
is meant to address the possibility that skilled workers are just proxying for omitted
variables that are pushing the area ahead. In this case, all of our identification comes
from changes in the share of college educated over time within the city. In other words,
during decades where the city began with more college graduates (relative to its historical
mean) did that city have a higher subsequent growth rate? In the case of metropolitan
areas, these fixed effects have little impact on the coefficient, although the standard errors
rise significantly.6 In the case of the cities, the coefficient drops by 40 percent (relative to
the no control benchmark) and becomes statistically insignificant, but the difference
between the coefficient in regression (4) and the coefficient in regression (1) is not
statistically significant.

6

We understand that we cannot estimate the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable consistently in
the fixed effects specification. However the results on the other coefficients would not change very much if
we omitted the lag of population in the fixed effects specification.

11

Including city specific fixed effects is asking a great deal of the data, given the extremely
high degree of persistence in human capital over time. The correlation coefficient in the
share of the college educated in 1980 and 1990 is 97.3 percent across cities and 97.5
percent across metropolitan areas. As the fixed effects eliminate most of the variation in
skills across space, we are amazed that we continue to find a positive effect, and we are
not troubled that the effect gets somewhat weaker in the city specification.

In the fifth regressions of the two tables, we add two further controls to the specification
in regression (2): the share of the adult population without high school degree and the
unemployment rate. We see both of these variables as added measures of human capital,
but these measures capture the lower end of the human capital distribution. While highfrequency changes in the unemployment rate over time generally reflect time-varying
labor market conditions, differences in the unemployment rate across cities (less so across
metropolitan areas) are generally time invariant and reflect characteristics of the labor
force and the industry structure in the city.7 The correlation coefficient between citylevel unemployment rates in 1980 and 1990 is .75; the correlation coefficient between
MSA-level unemployment rates in 1980 and 1990 is .5.

In the case of metropolitan areas, the effect of the dropout rate is insignificant and the
unemployment rate is marginally significant.

Together these variables reduce the

coefficient on percent college educated by 15 percent relative to regression (1). In Table

7

Thus most of the time-series variation in unemployment rates is common to all cities, whereas the relative
differentials between cities are quite stable.

12

3, controlling for these other variables severely reduces the impact of higher education on
city growth. The natural interpretation of Table 2 and Table 3 is that an abundance of
college graduates drives the success of a regional labor market, but a local neighborhood
succeeds by minimizing the number of low educated people.

Finally, in regression (6), we drop our measure of college graduation entirely and follow
Moretti (2003) using instead the presence of colleges in the area prior to 1940. As seen
in Figure 2, there is a remarkably strong relationship between the number of colleges per
capita before World War II and the level of people with higher education in 2000. This
variable has the advantage of being predetermined and not a function of recent events
which might attract the well educated to a metropolitan area.

While we believe that this variable is less likely to reflect reverse causality or omitted
factors than our share of college educated variable, we are not confident that it is
orthogonal to the error term. As such, using the variable as an instrument (as in Moretti,
2003) may give us quite misleading results because in instrumental variables regression,
the correlation with the error term is essentially multiplied by the inverse of the first stage
R-squared.8 Instead, we present results using this variable directly instead of using it to
instrument for the share of college graduates. In fact, both as an instrument and as a
right-hand-side variable, the variable has a strong, significant impact on population
growth. The coefficient in Table 2 implies that as the number of colleges per capita

8

Technically, this statement is only true in a univariate regression. Still, the basic point that correlation
with the error term explodes in magnitude in instrumental variables regressions holds in all cases.

13

doubles, the expected growth rate over the decade rises by roughly four percent for both
MSAs and cities.9

In Appendix Table 2 we run similar regressions at the MSA level with a set of controls
for other variables that may be correlated with initial high levels of education, and find
that the impact of education on growth is not driven by these omitted variables either.10

In Table 4, we look at reverse causality.

In regression (1), we look at the relationship

between population growth and the change in the share of the population with bachelor’s
degrees at the city level. Glaeser and Gyourko (2001) argue that durable housing causes
uneducated people to move into declining cities for the cheap housing. As such, the
relationship between population change and human capital change should be much
weaker among growing cities than among declining cities. This asymmetry occurs
9

We have also experimented with college enrollment over population in 1970 as an exogenous proxy for
human capital with qualitatively similar results (see Appendix Table 2, column 1).
10
In Appendix Table 2 we control for the possibility that the share of the highly educated be simply
capturing attributes of the age distribution in a city (for example, younger cities will tend to be more
educated because of a cohort effect: younger cohorts are attaining higher education levels, or cities with
lower education maybe simply cities with elderly retired people). To address that issue we have augmented
the MSA regression to control for the initial age distribution of the metropolitan area (variables for the
shares of population in the following categories: age 0-21,22-34,35-44,45-54, and 54-65). We include in
Appendix Table 2 other variables that are generally considered city amenities or disamenities. We also
control for the murder rate. Higher education levels have been shown to reduce crime (Lochner, 1999,
Lochner and Moretti, 2001). Crime is a very salient disamenity. For instance, Berry-Cullen and Levitt,
(1999) show a causal link between crime and city depopulation. Murder rates are a good indicator of crime,
because other crimes are not always reported, and reporting rates for other crimes may vary according to
education levels. The number of museums, eating and drinking establishments per capita, health
establishments per capita, the number of amusement and recreational service establishments, and the
teacher/pupil ratio (a proxy for the quality of primary and secondary education in the metropolitan area) are
included as local public goods or amenities that are likely to be provided in high human capital areas. We
also include the number of membership organizations as a proxy for social capital. An alternative
hypothesis to explain why the presence of highly educated people fosters growth hinges on the propensity
of the highly educated to contribute to local social capital by participating in political and civic institutions
(à la Putnam, 2000). Including these amenities, public goods and controls for social capital does not seem
to explain away the role of education on city growth. In fact, the amenity variables are mostly insignificant
in this specification, although in line with previous research there is a very strong negative impact of crime
on growth.

14

because durable housing means that housing prices fall sharply in declining cities and this
attracts the unskilled. We estimate our regression with a spline at zero population
growth.

Regression (1) does indeed find a strong relationship between growth and human capital
among declining cities and little relationship among growing cities. In regression (4) we
repeat this exercise with metropolitan areas and find similar results. Regressions (2) and
(5) repeat regressions (1) and (4) with initial population and industry share controls and
finds little change in the coefficients on growth.

While these regressions point to a connection between decline and human capital change,
the fact that we are regressing change in human capital on contemporaneous population
growth is problematic.

Obviously, the causal link is hard to determine from this

regression. To address this issue, we instrument for growth using the omitted climate
variables (heating degree days and annual precipitation).

As shown above, these

variables powerfully predict growth and we use them as instruments in regressions (3)
and (6). Clearly, interpreting the coefficients from the IV specification would become
problematic if we believed that climate has a direct impact on the skill composition of an
area. In regressions (3) and (6), the results are inconclusive, because the standard errors
become quite large (especially for the coefficients on decline), but we see little evidence
for population growth accompanying skill upgrading among growing cities.

15

Our interpretation of Table 4 is that there is significant potential for reverse causality
among those cities that are actually in decline, but little potential for reverse causality
among growing cities.

We see this as being more problematic for the city level

regressions because decline is more common at the city level. To ensure that a tendency
for declining metropolitan areas to shed skilled workers is not driving our results in
Tables 2 and 3, we have run regressions where we treat all declining cities as having zero
population growth.

This change has little impact on our estimated coefficient on

schooling. We also omitted those areas which are predicted (on the basis of weather) to
have population declines. This causes our coefficients to fall, but generally remain
statistically significant.

III.

Productivity and Amenities: A Theoretical Framework

Tables 2, 3, and 4 suggest that the correlation between human capital and subsequent
urban growth is a real phenomenon, and not a spurious correlation driven by some
obvious omitted variable or reverse causality. We now try to understand this correlation.
In this section, we follow the approach in Shapiro (2003) and present a simple model that
will help us to distinguish between consumption and production led urban growth. The
structure of this framework closely follows the insights of Roback (1982). The main
novelty of the model is our use of Shapiro’s (2003) methodology to extend the
framework of Glaeser et al. (1995) to multiple skill groups.

16

The spatial equilibrium concept is the appropriate starting point for empirical work on
urban growth. This concept posits that identical people must be indifferent between
alternative locations. We assume that there are a large number of cities, and we consider
the equilibrium of a single city, denoted “j”. There are two types of workers, high skill
and low skill, who receive different wages in the city denoted W jH and W jL .

Utility is Cobb-Douglas over a traded good, a non-traded good, and over a place specific
commodity, and as such consumers choose the consumption of the non-traded good
(denoted Q) to maximize C j (W ji − PjQ Q)1−γ Q γ , where PjQ is the price of that good in
city j, and C j is a city-specific consumer amenity level. Optimization yields

PjQ Q = γW j . We assume a fixed supply of the non-traded good in city “j” which is
denoted Q j . If we let N j denote total city population and Ŵ j denote the average wage,

then total utility for each person equals (1 − γ )

We assume a Cobb-Douglas production function that uses capital (denoted K), effective
labor units (denoted L and defined later) and a city-specific production input (which is
meant to represent commercial land or access to waterways and is denoted F). Total
output is therefore A j K α Lβ F 1−α − β , where A j is a city specific productivity factor.

17

Capital is available at a national price of r, but there is only a fixed amount, F j , of the
city-specific input.

Our primary focus will be on changes in the productivity level, A j , and the consumer
amenity level, C j , and these are the only city-specific attributes that we will allow to

change over time. Specifically, we will assume that Log ⎜

which include the skill composition of the city. There are two interpretations of these
equations.

First, different variables may actually increase productive innovation or

investment in consumer amenities. In this case, we should think of estimated coefficients
as suggesting that certain characteristics have growth effects.

Alternatively, we can think of characteristics as having level effects which change over
time.

growth equations above, they are empirically indistinguishable, and we cannot tell if a

a level effect that is increasing over time.

This model will enable us to separate

characteristics that impact consumption amenities and characteristics that impact
production amenities, but not to separate growth effects from “increasing level” effects.

To allow for multiple skill categories, we assume that a unit of effective labor is produced

φ , and where Ω i i=N, W, Q refers to terms that are common across cities including the
reservation utilities, rent level and the parameters, α , β , γ and σ . Both Θ iN and Ω N
are defined in Appendix B.

Equations (2), (3) and (4) yield standard results in the regional literature: (1) increases in
urban productivity will cause increases in the population, average wages and the price of
non-traded goods (i.e. housing), (2) increases in the fixed factor of production will
likewise increase population, wages and the price of non-traded goods, (3) increases in
the consumption amenity will raise population, lower wages and raise housing prices and
(4) increases in the endowment of non-traded goods will increase the population,
decrease wages and decrease the price of the non-traded good.

To manipulate these equations, we will assume that, within a city, the production and
consumption amenities are changing over time, that all other city specific factors are
fixed, and that while reservation utilities are changing, the ratio

UH
is fixed. These

assumptions tell us that:

where I i for i=N, W, Q is an intercept term that is constant across cities, and µ ij,t again
for i=N, W, Q is an error term, which has a zero mean and is orthogonal to the X terms as
long as the underlying error terms, µ ij,t are mean zero and orthogonal to the X terms.

Equation (2’), (3’) and (4’) show us how to use the differences in the coefficients from
population, wage and price growth regressions to determine the values of δ Ak and δ Ck
for any X variable. The intuition behind this claim is that if a variable is increasing
population and prices, but not wages, this implies that the variable is increasing
consumption amenities. If a variable is correlated with increasing population and wages,
more than with prices, then this implies that the variable is increasing productivity.

We focus on a specific X variable— the share of skilled workers, which is itself a
function of the ratio of reservation utility levels and the technology parameter θ j . We
will let δ AS and δ CS refer to the impact of this variable on the growth of productivity and
consumption amenities respectively. These equations will enable us to interpret the city
growth regressions (shown above) and regressions looking at changes in urban wages and
changes in housing values.

21

Under the assumptions of the model, different values of θ j will have no direct impact on
growth if the ratio

UH
U
is fixed. As shown in the appendix, if H rises, then we should
UL
UL

expect skilled cities to grow less. The intuition behind this result is a pure price effect.
For cities that specialize in the skilled, their primary form of labor has become more
expensive and as a result they grow less.

To understand these issues fully, a general

equilibrium model would be necessary. For our purposes, though, it is enough to note
that increases in

UH
UL

(reflecting, perhaps, the rising skill premium) would cause

relatively less population growth in more skilled cities.

Using calculations in the appendix and the notation B̂ Pop , Bˆ Pr ice and B̂Wage to denote
the coefficients on schooling in population growth, housing price growth and wage
growth regressions respectively, then it follows that:

IV.

Distinguishing Between Productivity and Amenity Effects

We now use the equations in the previous section to measure the extent to which the
connection between skill and growth stems from productivity or amenity effects. Since
Rauch (1993) we have known that, holding one’s own skill level constant, wages in a city
rise with the skill level of that community. We also know that prices are higher in both
cities and metropolitan areas with more skilled workers. Moretti (2003) extends Rauch
(1993) and identifies human capital externalities by using instrumental variables related
to human capital but plausibly exogenous to wages.11 He finds that, after controlling for
the private returns to education, a 1 percentage point increase in the share of the college
educated in a metropolitan area raises average wages by 0.6%-1.2%. The same author,
(Moretti, 2002) finds more direct evidence of human capital externalities by using plant
level production functions. Of course, it is arguable if the previous literature succeeds to
address the problem that selection of more unobservable skilled workers into these cities
might be driving the correlations.

In Figure 3, we show the relationship between wages, adjusted for both individual
characteristics and local prices, and local human capital across metropolitan areas in
1990. The individual characteristics include age, schooling and gender and we have used

23

the American Chamber of Commerce Research Analysis data to correct for local price
levels. The overall correlation is strong and positive. If we believe these price levels, it
seems appropriate to think that in the cross-section the primary impact of human capital
is to increase productivity, at least at the metropolitan area level.

Our focus is, of course, on changes over time, not on the level effects. So to address
these changes we turn first to results looking at housing price growth at the city and
metropolitan area levels. We are implicitly assuming the relative home quality changes
across metropolitan areas are small. The available evidence supports that this assumption
is not particularly problematic. Table 5 (panels A and B) reproduce Tables 2 and 3 with
the change in the logarithm of median housing values as the dependent variable. These
are self-reported housing values taken from the census. In these regressions, we add the
initial housing values as an added control to correct for mean reversion.

Regressions (1)-(6) of Panel A in Table 5 show the impact that initial human capital has
on later housing price appreciation at the metropolitan area level. The magnitude of the
effect expands dramatically between regression (1) and regression (2) as the coefficient
on percent college educated rises from .18 to 1.17.

If we believe the coefficient in

regression (1) then a 10 percent increase in the percent college educated at the
metropolitan area level is associated with a 1.8 percent increase in housing prices over
the next decade. If we believe the coefficient in regression (2) then a 10 percent increase

11

He uses the demographic structure of the city and the presence of “land-grant” colleges from the Morrill
Act (1862).

24

in the percent college educated increases the expected growth rate of housing prices by
almost 12 percent over the next decade.

The difference between the two coefficients is entirely the result of controlling for the
initial housing price in each community. There is an extraordinarily large amount of
mean reversion in housing prices across metropolitan areas. In general, the high price
areas have also had higher levels of human capital, so controlling for the natural tendency
of high price places to mean revert causes the coefficient on initial share with college
degrees to increase.

Regression (3)-(6) show that at the metropolitan area level the coefficient on schooling in
housing price growth regressions is extraordinarily robust statistically when we control
for initial housing price. Even with state or metropolitan area fixed effects, the t-statistic
never drops below four. Regression (6) shows that the presence of colleges prior to 1940
also predicts housing price growth during the past 30 years. Panel A in Table 5 certainly
seems to make it clear that higher levels of education increase both the population of
metropolitan areas and the price that this population is paying for the privilege of living
in the area.

In Panel B (Table 5), we examine housing price growth at the city level, and the results
essentially reproduce the findings of Panel A. Housing price growth is weakly positively
associated with human capital when we fail to control for initial housing prices. When
we control for mean reversion, the effect becomes extremely large and extremely robust.

25

The only substantive difference between Panel A and B is that in Panel B, the presence of
colleges prior to 1940 is not a good predictor of housing price growth over the last 30
years. We are certainly struck by the extraordinary power of human capital in predicting
housing price growth.

In Panels C and D (Table 5), we look at the connection between income growth and
human capital. Panels C and D essentially reproduce tables 2 and 3 with the log of
family income as the dependent variable. These regressions are useful in that they are
directly comparable to the previous regressions, but they are flawed by the fact that these
results will be biased because of the rise in returns to skill over this time period. Because
the compensation for skilled workers has generally risen over the period, we should
expect to see incomes rising more quickly in more skilled cities. Average family income,
or other aggregate income measures, cannot control for the general change in skill
premia. Nevertheless, for completeness we present these results.

Panels C and D show a systematic positive relationship between initial human capital
levels and later growth in family income at both the metropolitan area and city levels. As
in Panels A and B, there is a big difference in the coefficients between regressions (1)
and (2) (in both Panels C and D) where the coefficient on schooling is much bigger in
regression (2). Just as in the case of housing prices, there is substantial mean reversion in
family incomes, and just as in the case of housing prices, skilled cities look much better
once we account for this natural tendency of high income places to become relatively
poorer over time.

26

In both Panels C and D, the baseline impact of having an extra 10 percent of an area’s
adult population with college degrees is an increase in expected income growth of two
percent. When we control for mean reversion, that impact increases to more than 10
percent. Given that wages for workers with college degrees expanded (relative to noncollege degree workers) by less than 50 percent over the entire 30 year period (see Katz
and Murphy, 1992), the pure compositional effect of a 10 percentage point increase in the
share of adults with a college degree should be less than two percent per decade. Using a
back of the envelope estimate, if workers of category “X” have had their wages increase
by “Y” percent over a time period, then an upper bound for the purely compositional
effect of having an extra 10 percent of a place’s labor force in category “X” is .1*Y.12
Thus, the large magnitudes of the effects seem incompatible with the view that the only
effect is that skilled workers are getting higher wages: workers in skilled cities are getting
paid more relative to skilled workers elsewhere.13

To show this, in Table 6 column 1, we use the Census Individual Public Use
Microsamples (IPUMS) from 1970 to 2000 to control for individual characteristics in a
wage regression that includes MSA education levels. We look at the wages of males over
21, and we control for schooling, age, and race, and metropolitan area fixed effects. In
these regressions, the coefficients on schooling and age were allowed to differ by time
period. We also include a control for the schooling in the area. We decided to use the
12

Although the initial share of the highly educated may also be positively correlated with changes in that
share. The micro-data regressions will dispel any concerns in that direction.

27

lagged share of the percent of the area with college degrees as our measure of education.
The decision to use lagged value is both an attempt to make these results more
comparable with the growth regressions and also an attempt to reduce the causality
problems inherent with regressing wages on the population composition of an area.
While this would certainly not eliminate causal issues, our results are essentially
unchanged if we use schooling in 1970 as our measure of MSA schooling throughout the
time period.

Since we are controlling for metropolitan area fixed effects, we can only estimate the
coefficient on area-level schooling in three decades, and we chose 1970 as the excluded
decade. As such, differences in our estimated coefficients on the interaction of schooling
and decade should be interpreted as the extent to which the coefficient on average
schooling in the area has increased over time. Our results suggest that the coefficient on
schooling increased by .58 between 1970 and 1980, and then by .21 between 1980 and
1990. Between 1990 and 2000 the coefficient increased by .047.

On average over the three decades, the coefficient on the share with college degrees
increased by .25 per decade, which is comparable to a coefficient in a growth regression
of .25. This is comparable to the coefficient in the first regressions of Table 5 (Panels C
and D), not the subsequent regressions, because Table 6 doesn’t allow high wage cities to
mean revert and become lower wage over time.

13

The results cannot be accounted for by the fact that higher educated people have a higher propensity to
be married and thus (median) higher family incomes: using income per capita at the MSA level we found

28

In the second column of Table 6, we include housing value regressions that are similar in
character to the wage regressions. In this case, we are able to control for housing
characteristics and thus to control for any changes in the hedonic value of housing
characteristics over time. Just as in the wage regression, we are able to control for
metropolitan area fixed effects and we identify a tendency of the houses in high schooling
metropolitan areas to increase over time. On average, the coefficient on schooling rises
by over .5 each decade over the thirty years, but all of this increase occurs between 1970
and 1990. Between 1990 and 2000, the coefficient on schooling actually falls.

Interpreting the Coefficients with the Model

We first focus on metropolitan areas and then turn to cities and begin with our estimates
of B̂ Pop , Bˆ Pr ice and B̂Wage . At the metropolitan area level, the coefficient of schooling
in the Table 2 population growth regressions ranges from .42 to .58.

This is a fairly

narrow band and not much is gained by focusing on the extremes, as such we will use .5
as value of B̂ Pop .

The estimates of Bˆ Pr ice in Table 5 range from .2 to 2.4, but the bulk of them are clustered
around 1. In Table 9 our estimate of Bˆ Pr ice is .55. We will use .5 and .75 as two
estimates of Bˆ Pr ice . Table 5 gives a range of estimates for B̂Wage between .2 and 1.8. In

very similar results.

29

the case of B̂Wage , we are inclined to put more weight on Table 6’s estimate of .25, since
this is the only estimate that controls properly for individual characteristics.

To produce a reasonable set of estimates, we rely on the fact that the model implies that
B̂ Pop + B̂Wage = Bˆ Pr ice , the sum of the coefficients on wages and population should equal
the coefficient on prices. It is not true that this holds perfectly empirically— for Table
6’s estimates, and for the estimates in regression (2), (4) and (5) of Table 5, the value of

Bˆ Pr ice - B̂Wage ranges from .3-.5. The two cases where the difference is outside of this
range are the case where there are no controls and the case where we have state fixed
effects.

So we will calibrate the model with a range of .1 to .5 for B̂Wage and an

associated range of .6 to 1 for Bˆ Pr ice which implies that

Bˆ Pr ice
ranges from 1.2 to 2 or
Bˆ
Pop

BˆWage
ranges from .2 to 1.

We must also have an estimate of

γ
1− γ

-- the share of spending on non-traded goods

divided by one minus the same share. We can estimate this parameter by using the 2001
Consumer Expenditure Survey to calibrate the share of shelter in overall expenditure,
which is .19. Shelter is pretty clearly a non-traded good, but as there are other elements
of consumption which are non-traded, this estimate qualifies as something of a lower
bound.

The second way of estimating

γ
1− γ

is to use a city-level price index (from the American

Chamber of Commerce) and regress the log of this price index on the log of housing
prices.

If the Cobb-Douglas assumption is correct, and if we assume that the

consumption

∂Log ( PjQ )

amenity

is

constant

then:

E ( Pj , U ) =

( )γ

U PjQ

γ γ (1 − γ )1−γ

and

= γ . Since price indices are supposed to measure the amount of money

needed to provide a fixed level of utility, they are ideally the expenditure function, so
another way of estimating γ is to estimate

∂Log ( E ( P, U ))
∂Log ( PjQ )

(i.e. the extent that local price

levels rise with increases in housing prices). Using the 2000 cross-section, we estimate:

(6) Log(Price Level)= -2.2 + .29*Log(Median Housing Price)
(18)
(.015)
The R-squared is .63, and there are 220 observations.

We can also estimate this

relationship from a panel with MSA and year dummies:

31

(6’) Log(Price Level)=MSA and Year Dummies + .21*Log(Median Housing Value)
(.028)

In this case, the R-squared is .986, and there are 505 observations. Together, these two
methods confirm that a reasonable estimate of the share of spending on non-traded goods

γ
⎛ 0.25 ⎞

lies between .21 and .29, and we will use .33 ⎜

⎝ 1 − 0.25 ⎠

The value of

β
1−α

equals the ratio of producer spending on labor divided by producer

spending on labor plus producer spending on non-traded capital goods. While we lack
any compelling figures for this ratio, we don’t believe that spending on non-traded capital
goods can be more than one-third of the wage bill. Thus, this parameter is bounded
between .75 and 1.

equivalently

< 1.1 . We don’t believe that either of those conditions hold and as
Bˆ
Pop

such, we are led to the view that the bulk of the skills-growth connection at the
metropolitan area level comes from the fact that skills predict productivity growth.

As final check on this, in Table 7, we look at the growth of real wages and the
relationship to initial human capital.

As argued before, if human capital increases

amenities at the metropolitan area level, then real wages should be falling. We again use
the American chamber of Commerce data for local prices levels. We use three different
measures of MSA-level wages. First, we use the Census’ average wage in the area.
Second, we use the average manufacturing wage in the area from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Third, we use a wage variable that we construct using data from the Individual
Public Use Micro-Sample, which corresponds to the MSA fixed effect of a regression of
wages on individual characteristics. This can be interpreted as the average wage in the
metropolitan area net of the impact of individual characteristics. We present results both
with and without other controls.

In all cases, we find either a positive or a zero

coefficient on human capital. There is no regression where human capital is associated
with declining real wages at the city level.

This evidence again pushes us to the

33

conclusion that rising wages at the city level have everything to do with rising
productivity and nothing to do with rising amenities.

Results at the City Level

We can distinguish between the impact of human capital on the growth of metropolitan
areas and the impact of human capital on the growth of cities (holding metropolitan area
growth constant). The overall growth of cities is driven by similar factors than the
metropolitan areas that surround them. The growth of cities holding metropolitan area
growth constant enables us to really focus on city-specific factors. There has been little
work on this issue, but in many respects it is a natural area for research on amenities.
Cities within a metropolitan area have radically different levels of amenities, but
supposedly are part of the same labor market. After all, metropolitan areas are defined to
capture a local labor market. Moreover, many people work outside of their city (within
their metropolitan area), but their city still determines their quality of life, their housing
prices and their public goods.

Within the context of the previous model, if we assume that wages are the same across

( )γ

cities (within a metropolitan area), then C j PjQ

−

must be constant across areas, i.e. the

price of the non-traded good (housing) must offset the value of a higher level of
consumption. This implies the following relationship:

two. To implement this empirically, we assume that (1 + φS j )

N
where I MSA
is an MSA specific intercept. Somewhat surprisingly, the Cobb-Douglas

utility function implies that the effect of consumption amenity growth on prices and
people should be the same.

Equations (2’’) and (4’’) inspire us to run regressions within metropolitan areas
controlling for MSA/decade fixed effects.

These are shown in Table 8 and the

regressions should be interpreted as capturing the impact of city-specific human capital
controlling for the average growth rate of the metropolitan area over the decade. The first
thing that the regressions show is that the impact on human capital on prices and
population is not the same, despite the implications of the model. Human capital has a
much stronger effect (at least when we control for initial price levels) on price growth
than on population growth.

The second implication of the regressions is that human capital powerfully predicts both
housing price and population growth. Interestingly, the impact of the highly educated
residents (college graduates shown in regressions (1) and (3)) is stronger in the housing
price growth regressions. High human capital workers appear to be highly correlated
with rising prices. The impact of less educated residents (high school dropouts shown in
regressions (2) and (4)) is stronger in the population growth regressions.

All four

regressions can be interpreted to mean that human capital is associated with rising
consumer amenity levels at the local level, but the regressions do not tell us a simple
story.

36

One possible way to reconcile these regressions is to drop our simple assumptions about
housing supply being essentially perfectly elastic (subject to the constraint of the fixed
amount of non-traded commodity). Indeed, the impact of housing supply is the most
important missing element in understanding city growth. If we assume that there are
limits to new construction, such as zoning or land use regulation, and we assumed that
these were more binding in high skill, rather than low skill cities, then we might expect
this pattern. In high skill cities, supply is relatively inelastic so increasing demand
operates mainly by increasing prices. In low skill cities, supply is more elastic so
increasing demand operates mainly by increasing quantities.

This is a possible

reconciliation of the four regressions in Table 8, but it properly belongs as a subject for
future research.

If we accept the assumption that a metropolitan area is a common labor market, with
common wages, then Table 8 seems to imply that there is a significant impact of skills on
consumption amenity growth at the local level. Of course, that assumption may not hold
perfectly. Some sub areas of a metropolitan region may be much more productive than
others, and productivity heterogeneity could explain the results. As such, these findings
are best thought of as suggestive evidence supporting the link between skills and amenity
growth at the local level.

V.

Understanding the Productivity Effect

The evidence suggests that the skills—growth connection at the metropolitan area is
fueled primarily by productivity effects. As suggested earlier, the basic data on wage,

37

price and population growth cannot distinguish between different stories concerning the
connection between human capital and productivity.

However, we will use other

available evidence to check the validity of two of these stories.
First, we address the hypothesis that an environment dense with highly educated people
leads to faster technological innovation and that this explains the connection between
metropolitan area growth and human capital. To test this idea, we turn to the patents
data. We are able to measure patents by MSA for the period 1990-1999, so we will focus
on growth during the 90s. We first regress patents per capita on the human capital level,
and then see how much of the skills—growth connection is explained by greater
patenting activity.

In Table 9, regression 1, we find (like Carlino, Chatterjee and Hunt, 2001) that the share
with bachelor’s degree is an important predictor of technological growth. We find that a
10 percent increase in the share of college graduates increases the number of patents by
.09 log points (approximately nine percent). This certainly supports the idea that the
better educated are more technologically innovative.

Moreover, in regression (2), we show that there is a connection between patents and
growth in regressions where we don’t control for human capital. Of course, no causality
is posited by these regressions.

Patents are as much a sign of a healthy urban

environment as a cause. However, the important fact is shown in regression (3). Once
we control for human capital there is no meaningful relationship between patents and
urban growth.

As such, human capital may matter because it makes people more

38

creative, but the important elements of this creativity must be in areas beyond the formal
patenting sector.

The Reinvention Hypothesis

We finally turn to the puzzle created by Figures 4 and 5: human capital predicts growth
much more sharply in cold places than in warm areas. Figure 4 shows the relatively mild
(0.13) correlation between skills and growth among those metropolitan areas with
January temperatures above 40 degrees on average. Figure 5 shows the 47 percent
correlation between the initial share of the population with college degrees and the
growth of the logarithm of population between 1980 and 2000 for those metropolitan
areas with average January temperatures below 40 degrees. The regression (reported in
the figure) suggests that as the share of college educated increases by one percent, the
growth rate of the period increases by 1.3 percent. Previous literature (Glaeser, Kolko,
and Saiz, 2001, Glaeser and Shapiro, 2003) has pointed to the role of warm weather as an
exogenous amenity that has fostered growth in the late 20th century U.S. Sun, coupled
with the availability of AC systems,14 may have given some areas in the South and West
a competitive advantage but skill appears to be a good substitute.

This fact may be explained by Jane Jacobs’ (1969) view that cities need to constantly
reinvent themselves. Specialization in one area may yield brief success but eventually the

14

Alternatively, the weather variable maybe capturing the impact of other variables, thought the effect of
weather on population growth holds after controlling for state fixed effects. What matters for our argument
is not so much the causal impact of weather but the strong predictive power of the part of the signal in this
variable that is orthogonal to education.

area fades, or the city’s comparative advantage in the area decays, and reinvention is
necessary. Glaeser (2003) details at least four periods in Boston’s history where the city
reinvented itself. Conversely, in areas with positive exogenous growth shocks human
capital may have less of a role, since reinvention is not necessary.

In Table 10, we look at this hypothesis more thoroughly. In regressions (1)-(3), we
repeat our benchmark specifications for population, housing price and wage growth, and
focus on the interaction between initial human capital and warmth. In all three cases,
there is a statistically significant negative interaction between warmth and initial skills.
The cross effect is strongest in the population regressions, where the regressions imply
that a doubling of the number of heating degree days causes the impact of skills to fall by
about one-half.

The effect on wages is also statistically significant, but smaller in

magnitude, at least relative to the benchmark coefficient. The effect on housing prices is
the weakest. Although, the cross-effect is still negative, it is not statistically significant.

One important omitted factor here is land use regulations which appear to be tighter
almost everywhere that there is a high degree of human capital. This would explain why
in warm places, skills still matter for housing price growth (because skills are correlated
with less elastic housing supply), but not much for population growth. Indeed, if there is
a correlation between skills and inelastic housing supply, this would tend to create a
perverse negative effect where more skilled places actually grow less, despite increasing
demand for these areas.

40

In regression (4)-(6), we look at the share of the population (in the initial time period)
that is composed of immigrants. Over this time period, immigration was a large source of
urban growth, and immigrants tend to settle where other immigrants live (Altonji and
Card, 1991, Saiz, 2003). If the reinvention hypothesis is correct, then we should expect to
see that human capital doesn’t matter in places with large supplies of immigrants, but it
should be important in areas where immigrants are not coming. Indeed, this is exactly
what we find in regression (4).

Human capital matters much more in predicting

population growth in areas without immigrants than in areas with immigrants.
One possible explanation for the strikingly different correlation between skills and
growth in growing and declining places is that skills allow reinvention. The view that
human capital is most valuable because it enables flexibility and the ability to respond to
new circumstances was emphasized by Welch (1968). If this view is correct, then we
should not be surprised if a high skill New England city manages to reinvent itself while
a low skill rustbelt town does not.

One implication of this hypothesis is that places with high human capital should be better
at switching out of declining industries. To test this hypothesis, we gathered data on
education and industrial composition in 1940 by metropolitan area (contemporaneously
defined). We then tested whether the impact of skills on contributing to the shift away of
manufacturing over the next 30 years has been more important in industrial, colder areas
of the country (Table 10, Panel B). The regressions support the view that the skilled
rustbelt towns were better at reorienting themselves: the importance of education to
explain the shift away of manufacturing (the change in the manufacturing share in the

41

left-hand-side) in the second half of the 20th Century was stronger in colder areas
(interaction between human capital and temperature) and in areas with an initial bigger
share of manufacturing (interaction between education and share manufacturing).

VI.

Conclusion

Human capital predicts population and productivity growth at the city and metropolitan
area level as surely as it predicts income growth at the country level. High skill areas
have been getting more populous, better paid and more expensive. Indeed, aside from
climate, skill composition may be the most powerful predictor of urban growth. This is
both a boon to the skilled cities that have done spectacularly over the past two decades
and a curse to the cities with less skilled workers that have suffered an almost
unstoppable urban decline.

Why do skilled cities grow more quickly? At the metropolitan area level, the available
evidence appears to show quite clearly that skills predict productivity growth and not an
increase in amenity levels. The high skilled metropolitan areas are not seeing falling real
wages. To the contrary, prices seem not to be rising quickly enough to offset the
increases in wages. Standard economic reasoning tells us that this means that high skill
levels are associated with decreasing relative levels of quality of life, perhaps because of
increasing population levels.

Within metropolitan areas, at the very local level, there is some evidence that the prices
of skilled places have risen sharply. If the standard assumption that a metropolitan area is

42

a single labor market holds, then the skills-housing price growth connection is best
understood as suggesting that skills increase amenities at the very local level, if not at the
metropolitan area level. Thus, our results suggest that skills are important because they
increase productivity at the metropolitan level and amenities at the local. On net, the
productivity effects appear to be much stronger.

Why are skills so strongly associated with productivity growth at the metropolitan level?
Certainly skilled cities are more innovative, but controlling for the rate of innovation
doesn't impact the effect of skills. One clue may be the fact that skills are much more
important in otherwise disadvantaged regions than in exogenously growing regions. This
fact might reflect the idea that cities are constantly reinventing themselves - moving from
one field of specialization to another. Skills may well be a crucial part of this reinvention
process as skilled workers react more speedily to painful economic shocks and educated
workers find it easier to switch techniques (as in Welch, 1970). While at this point the
reinvention hypothesis is only a guess, the fact that skills are so important in the northeast
and so almost irrelevant in the west suggests that there is something very significant
about the connection between skills and the process of urban decline.

The results in the paper suggest that city growth can be promoted with strategies that
increase the level of local human capital. At the regional or metropolitan level, attracting
high human capital workers may require provision of basic services, amenities and
quality public schools that will lure the most skilled. Conversely, redistributive policies
at the local level have to be carefully designed as they may have the undesired side effect

43

of repelling the skilled and deter growth. Generating new technologies locally does not
seem as important as having the capacity to adapt them.

Providing basic quality

education (maximizing success rates in high school graduation) may both produce and
attract the educated. Since local tax bases are heterogeneous, state and federal funds can
play a role in avoiding “low education traps” in ailing cities.

General Notes: MSA data is for metropolitan areas as defined by the Office of
Management Budget in 1999. We use the county MSA/NECMA definition. In most cases
we need to aggregate data by county to obtain the appropriate MSA data. City data is
from the HUD State of the Cities Data System. We select those cities with population
over 30,000 in 1970, the initial year for which the data is available.

Peterson’s provides foundation dates for all
colleges in the US. We use the foundation
date to ascertain if a college was founded
before 1940. We match the college zip code
with the pertinent county, and then assign
counties to MSA using 1999 MSA/NECMA
definitions. We have used the Department of
Education IPEDS dataset for 1969-1999 and
confirmed that attrition bias is not an issue:
colleges do not seem to disappear from the
IPEDS sample at a faster rate in stagnating
metro areas.

education dummies interacted with year, race, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, and
veteran status. Observations include males of age over 21 with complete observations.
Value regressions include year and MSA fixed effects, controls for number of rooms and
bedrooms, quality of plumbing and kitchen facilties, and age of the building. The results
use a 50% random sample of the IPUMS data for all single units with the relevant
