SWEDiSH FIRMS ACQUIRED BY FOREIGNERS:
A COMPARISON OF BEFORE AND AFTER TAKEOVER

Abs t

Swedish firms acquired by foreigners were considerably larger than the

average firms In their industries. They were relatively low in value added
per employee at the time of takeover and before, a characteristic we take
to indicate relatively low profitability, capital intensity, or efficiency,

or some combination of these. However, they had been growing at least
as fast as their industries over the longest periods we can measure.
The takeovers tended to take place in years when the acquired firms did
poorly relative to their industries and also relative to their own past
performance with respect to the growth of employment, value of production,

and value added. Thus the acquired firms seem to have been weak relative to
others in their industries and had particularly suffered during the year
in which the takeovers occurred.

There were short—term recoveries after takeover from the misfortunes
of the takeover year and a return to higher growth rates of employment and

output, particularly the former. Over the longer run the acquired firms
did not show the same relative employment gains as in the first year or
two after takeover but seem to have increased their profitability or effi-

ciency relative to their industries. The industries in which takeovers
took place grew more rapidly after the takeovers than total manufacturing
although they had grown less rapidly in the years before takeover.

SWEDISH FIRMS ACQUIRED BY FOREIGNERS:
A C0MPARSON OF BEFORE AND AFTER TAKEOVER

Robert E. Llpsey*
Linda 0 Connor **

A common way to study the effects of direct investment on host
countries is to compare foreign—owned and domestically—owned firms in the
same country and assume that differences between them, after allowing for
size, industry, or other attributes of firms, are the consequence of the

difference in ownership. We have used this technique, since it is often
the only one possible and it enables one to observe a wide range of

characteristics of firms. For a few countries it is possible to use
another approach: to examine host—country firms which are taken over by

foreign owners. Takeovers are attractive as a source of information
because It is possible to compare the firm before and after the takeover as
a way of isolating the effects of foreign ownership.

The first set of questions we wish to ask about firms taken over by

foreign companies is what they are like at the time of takeover. Are they
relatively large—firms, high— or low—wage firms, fast— or slow—growing

firms, financially weak or strong firms, etc.? These questions themselves
can be divided into two parts: one is the characteristics of the industries
in which takeovers have taken place and the other is the characteristics of

the firms relative to their industries. These questions in turn can be
further subdivided: which of the characteristics are long—term attributes
of the firm or industry and which are associated with the particular time
at which the takeover took place.

The second set of questions is about changes in the firms after

takeover. We would like to know whether they grew faster than other firms,
or faster than they did before takeover, or whether they changed with

respect to their production or value added per worker. Again the answer
can be divided between changes in their industries and changes in the firms
relative to their industries.

The questions about the characteristics of firms at time of takeover
may be thought of as attempts to shed some light on the motivations of the
acquiring firms and the acquired firms, although they may also give some

information as to the impact of takeovers on the host country. On the
whole, host countries have been reluctant to approve of takeovers of the
most profitable, fastest growing, or technologically leading domestic
enterprises but look more kindly on takeovers of unprofitable or lagging
firrnsj

The questions about changes in host—country firms after takeover are
directed at estimating the effects of foreign ownership on the acquired

firm, using its pretakeover characteristics to separate the influence of
the foreign parent from those of the characteristics of the local firm

itself. That separation can be performed with varying degrees of
sophistication, assuming that in the absence of a takeover the firm would
change as its industry does, that it would change in the same direction and
at the same rate as it did before takeover, or that it would change

relative to its industry as it did before takeover. The last seems to be
the best assumption but requires data we do not have in all cases.

—3—
In an earlier paper (Lipsey and Swedenborg, 1981) we made use of data
on Swedish enterprises taken over by foreign firms between 1961 and 1970

from a study by Samuelsson (1977). Those data gave characteristics of
firms taken over only for 1965 and 1970 and only if they had already been

taken over by those dates. We therefore had no knowledge of a firm's rate
of growth or other characteristics before takeover, to compare with later

developments. We also had to assume that firms taken over in 1961—65 still
had, in 1965, their characteristics at takeover time, and that firms taken
over in 1966—70 retained their characteristics until 1970.
Our new data set for Swedish firms has several advantages over the

older one. In particular it contains data for each firm at the date of
takeover (defined as the end of the year of acquisition) and also before

takeover, back to 1966, and after takeover, up to 1977. A drawback of the
new data is that they do not contain some of the information on salaries

and wages and types of employees we had for the earlier period. They
include for each firm in each year oniy employment, the sales value of

output, which we also call the value of production, and value added. They
are particularly good, however, for examining changes in a firm before and
after takeover.

Characteristics of Acquired Firms
In our earlier paper we concluded that the firms taken over were much
larger than average for their industries, being more heavily concentrated
in the class of over 200 employees, and including almost no firms with
under 20 employees, which were a majority of the enterprises in each

—4—

industry. However, among the firms

with

over 200 employees the average

takeovers were only half the size of the average Swedish firm. The other
characteristics we could examine were the ratios of salaried and technical
employees

to total employees and the average salary and wage per employee,

all of which we took
orientation
three

to be rough measures of the skill level or technical

of the firm. The acquired firms were

measures, particularly those

foreign

above average by all

taken over in 1966—70,

suggesting that

buyers were, within each industry, picking the firms of higher

skill or technical orientation. As far as we could tell, this selection
was not to any large extent simply a reflection of either the size or the
industry composition of the firms taken over, but was a characteristic of
those firms relative to Swedish firms of the same size and industry.

However, the data and the tests were imperfect in several respects pointed
out in the original paper.
The acquired firms in the more recent data set were, at the time of
takeover, clearly much larger than the average Swedish firms in their
industries,

by any of the three measures we used, and in all the industries

(Table 1), just as we found for the earlier period. To some degree the
size

difference reflects an apparent cutting off of the sample at some

minimum size level, but that is not the whole explanation since we know
from the earlier study that there are few takeovers of very small firms.
The sales value of output per employee in the acquired firms was, in most
industries, slightly above the average for their industries, but the

differences were small. The value added per employee in acquired firms was
lower than average, and by a substantial margin. We might interpret the

differences in value added per employee in several ways. One is that the
firms taken over were low—productivity firms, in the production function or

total factor productivity sense. Another is that these were firms with low
labor productivity because their input of capital was low relative to their

labor input. A third possibility is that the firms were relatively

unprofitable. The firms may have been inefficient, undercapitalized, or
unprofitable relative to their industries.

As we can see from the comparisons relating to the year before
takeover, these characteristics of the acquired firms did not apply only to

the takeover years. As we would expect, the size relationships did not
change greatly and the value added per employee was already low in the year
before takeover.

Other ways in which we might characterize acquired firms are the rates
of growth before takeover for the firms themselves and the rates of growth

relative to their industries. To get the longest possible view of growth
rates we measure them, for each firm and its industry, as far back as the
data permit, usually over five years or less.

Both the acquired firms and their industries were reducing employment
and increasing the value of production, value added and the value of

production and value added per employee before takeover (Table 2). The
acquired firms had been reducing their employment more slowly and growing

somewhat faster than their industries. Thus their profitability or labor
productivity, as far as we can judge it by value added per employee, had
been rising at a slightly more rapid rate than that of their industries
despite the fact that, as indicated by the data in Table 1, these were

firms of below—average value added per employee in their industries at the
time of takeover and a year earlier.2

While the acquired firms had been growing faster than their industries,
the industries in which acquisitions took place were decreasing their
employment at about the same rate as total manufacturing and growing in

value of production and value added somewhat less rapidly. However, in
comparisons with total manufacturing we cannot assume, as we do within

industries, that nominal values reflect changes in quantities. The
industries in which takeovers were occurring may have been growing more
slowly or only raising their prices more slowly than manufacturing as a
whole.

The declines we observe in both acquired firm and industry employment
before takeover may reflect the way in which we performed these

calculations. Each change in employment was measured from the earliest
date available, usually in the mid—1960's. That was a period of high
employment in Swedish manufacturing as a whole relative to most of the
other years in our data.

The effect of the characteristics of the beginning year for our
calculations raises a more general question about timing. When we measure
the characteristics of an acquired firm at year of takeover, or even the
year before, do these represent the permanent attributes of the firm or the

events of the particular year or years? The same question could be asked
about the industries in which the acquired firms operate. If, for example,
we find that acquired firms are relatively unprofitable ones, it would be
useful to know whether they had been lagging behind their industries for

—9—
many years or are firms

which had been profitable or fast—growing but had

encountered cyclical or other difficulties in a particular year or period
that impelled them to seek mergers or made them vulnerable to takeovers.

Even if the acquired firms had kept up with their industries, they might be

in industries which had suffered in profitability or liquidity. And even
if the industries were not in greater difficulties than others in their
countries, the takeovers may have tended to occur In periods of financial
stringency or low profitability for the country

as a whole.

A general picture of the timing of takeovers in Sweden Is given by

Table 3. There were apparently four waves of takeovers after the late
1940's and 195O's, when there were hardly any. One was in 1960—62, another
in 1965—66, another in 1968—69, and the last one in 1974—75. In 1960—62
the takeover wave began in years of high profitability for Swedish industry

but hit its peak in the year of reduced profits. The same pattern can be
observed for 1965—66 and 1974—75. Only 1968—69 is an exception, the
takeover peak coinciding with a profit recovery from a fairly low level.
Thus takeovers of Swedish firms seem to be concentrated near peaks in the
profit cycle but on the downward side of the cycle, and that is

particularly true of the sample used in this paper. The dating would be
somewhat different if it were based on employment in acquired firms (Col.5)
but the story would be similar.

Another way of looking at the timing of takeovers is to examine it for

the individual firms and their industries. If we compare the growth In
employment

of

the acquired firms in our sample in the year before

takeover3 with the average of earlier years we do not find any evidence

of takeovers is that they took place after relatively good years for the
industries involved, compared to their past, but involved companies that
did not do as well as their industries in the year before acquisition
although they may have been growing slightly faster before that.
If we make a similar comparison for the year of takeover itself (t/t—l),

the differences between that year and past years for the firms and between
the firms and their industries tell a very different story (Table 4).

The acquired firms had a history of somewhat faster growth than their
industries in the years before takeover, as can be seen in Table 4 as well

as in Table 2 which excludes the year of takeover (t). However, in the
takeover year itself, the relationship was reversed: the acquired firms

were having a bad year in every respect. They were reducing employment
after increasing it over previous years and their growth rates of the value

of

production and value added were far lower than earlier. During these

same takeover years the industries in which these acquired firms operated

were increasing employment. Since the value of production and value added
are affected by the rates of inflation in different years the best
comparison to make is that in the last column, between the takeover year
minus earlier year figures for the acquired firms and those for their

industries. By almost every measure, the takeovers took place in years of
difficulty for the acquired firms relative to their own longer—term

relationships with their industries and to their own histories. The
contrast may be exaggerated somewhat in the smaller sample of firms, as can
be seen by comparison with the larger sample, but the general outline is

the same. Furthermore, the particularly large difference for value added
suggests that it was profitability rather than output and employment, that
was most affected in that takeover year.

A shorter—term view of the characteristics of takeover firms and their
industries is presented in Table 5.

Unfortunately, because various types

of data are missing for some firms or some periods, the numbers of firms

vary from one comparison to another. However, the data are comparable
within each of the four sets.

Two strong impressions again emerge from the comparisons. One is that
the acquired firms were reducing employment before takeover, both in

absolute terms and even more relative to their industries. The second is
that the value of their production was declining relative to that of their

industries. Value added showed a much less clear picture, rising
relatively in some intervals but falling very sharply in the year of

takeover.

The extent of these differences among intervals suggests that

profitability was probably the source of the changes, since the wage part
of value added per worker must have moved similarly between the acquired
firms and their industries.

If we take the two intervals with the best coverage, t—lIt—3 and tlt—1,
to represent the characteristics of the acquired firms, we would conclude
that in the two years before the year of takeover they were, relative to
their industries, cutting employment and output but increasing value added,

probably in the form of higher profits. The year of takeover was a year of
declining employment, particularly relative to their industries, and of
relatively declining value of production, value added, and even value of
production and value added per employee, despite the cuts in employment.
The combination suggests that the year of takeover itself was probably an
unprofitable year for the acquired companies, not only relative to their

own past performance but relative to their industries as well. The record
of the preceding two years suggests that the acquired firms had been losing
ground to others then also, but perhaps increasing profits by contracting

output and employment. The overall impression is that the firms acquired
had not been a particularly successful group in the period close to
takeover.

A point that should be mentioned in connection with these measures
based on events of the year of takeover is that they imply that the new
owners of the firms had not yet, by the end of the year, made changes In
the acquired firms; the state of a firm at the end of the takeover year is

assumed to represent its pre—takeover situation. If new owners act very

— 16 —

quickly

to reduce employment, for example, we may be mistaking post

acquisition changes for pre—acquisitlon characteristics of the acquired
firm.

However, such quick reductions in employment at the initiative of

new management seem unlikely since firings at short notice are difficult in
Sweden.

While we lack the data to establish firmly our conclusion that
takeovers tend to occur in years of distress for the acquired firms, it is

of interest that it matches the findings of an earlier study (Rydn, 1972)
of Swedish mergers in general, in which takeovers by foreign firms were not

distinguished from domestic takeovers in most calculations. That study
found that acquired firms were, on the average, less profitable and less
liquid than firms in general and also had deteriorated in both respects

before acquisition (pp. 209—224). A study of U.S. manufacturing firms
acquired by foreigners (Little, 1981) found that they were "...

apt

to be

less profitable than the average firm in their industry and less reliably

able to service their existing debt." An analysis of takeovers in the U.K.
(Singh, 1975) not distinguishing foreign from domestic, also found that

although there was a large degree of overlap between the characteristics of
acquired firms and survivors, ".

..take—over companies have on average worse

records than surviving ones..." The variables that appeared to distinguish
the two groups of firms were average profitability over one year and three
years and the one—year change in profitability.
Our characterization of Swedish firms acquired by foreigners thus seems
to fit the attributes that have been ascribed by other studies in several
countries to acquired firms in general.

Changes after Takeover
What happened to these acquired firms after takeover is described in

Table 6. With respect to employment, which is the only measure we have in
real terms, and with respect to the value of production and the value of
production per employee, the acquired firms are hardly distinguishable from

their industries. Their value added and value added per employee rose
somewhat more rapidly than those of their industries. Thus there was
apparently some restoration of profitability after the decline during the

takeover year. The improvement in profits may have been associated with a
rise in productivity relative to their industries, to the extent that we
can interpret the value added per worker that way.

Another way of viewing the post—takeover development of acquired firms
is by comparing it with the growth of the same firms before takeover or

with the growth of these relative to their industries. Unfortunately, the
size of the sample falls sharply if we confine it to those firms with both
pre—takeover and post—takeover information for all three characteristics.
One way of comparing before and after performance is used for Table 7
which is based on the longest possible spans of data both before and after

takeover, excluding the year of takeover itself. For the firms themselves,
the before and after periods hardly differ with respect to employment

growth. The variables that are in monetary terms grew much faster after
takeover but it is difficult to interpret these comparisons by themselves.
The comparisons for the firms' industries suggest an improvement between
the before and after periods, not only for the monetary variables, which

are affected to some degree by inflation, but also for employment. In the

periods the acquired firms seemed to be growing a little

more slowly than their industries, except for value added. Thus the
acquired firms went from a long—term superiority over their industries in
growth rates to a sharp relative decline in the years of takeover, to
growth at about average rates or a little below after takeover.

The industries in which takeovers occurred also changed somewhat

relative to total manufacturing. From slower—than—average growth rates in
money terms before takeovers occurred they moved to faster than average

rates after. The differences for value added and value of production could
reflect only faster rates of inflation in these industries than in

manufacturing in general, rather than faster real growth. However, the
small positive growth in employment while aggregate manufacturing
employment declined suggests some small margin of higher real growth in
these industries.

Another way of looking at the comparisons of before and after is to

look at the swings in growth rates shown in columns 3, 6, and 9. The
industries in which takeovers occurred increased their growth rates more
than did the acquired firms themselves and both the firms and their
industries increased the value of production and value added more rapidly
than manufacturing in
takeovers

general.

We might interpret that as showing that the

failed to restore the acquired firms to their earlier superiority

in growth, after their poor performance in the takeover years, although
they

did restore some of their earlier margin in profit and perhaps in

productivity growth. Another possibility is that the takeovers themselves
spurred the industries to grow more rapidly in the years after takeovers

— 21 —

occurred.
Shorter—term versions of the before—after comparisons are presented in
Table 8, beginning with a relatively long—term one using spans of two years
omitting the year of takeover and proceeding to one using two—year spans
including the takeover year and finally a short—term comparison of the

takeover year with the following year. Again, we are plagued by small
samples and erratic changes in results as the samples change, but some
patterns do emerge.

The employment figures are the most reliable both because they are not

affected by inflation and because the samples are larger. The comparisons
between the year after takeover and the takeover year show the most

striking results. The acquired firms shifted from declining employment and
value of production relative to their industries during the takeover year
to relative gains in employment and equal changes in value of production in

the year after takeover. The combination of the two shows a relative
decline in value of production and value added per employee after takeover,

which suggest relatively falling efficiency, The longer time spans show
increases, but smaller ones, in employment for the firms and the firms
relative to their industries, but they show relative declines in value of

production and value added. However, these measures are derived from the
smallest samples and should not be given much credence. We can say at
least that we find no evidence for short—term gains in profitability over
earlier performance after takeover If we exclude the year of takeover from

the base of the comparison. We find no evidence that the takeovers
resulted in increased efficiency within the first year or two, as far as we

can tell from these crude measures and small samples.
We have interpreted changes in behavior or fortune for a company
between pre— and post—takeover periods as indications of the effects of

takeovers. Another possibility that might be mentioned is that takeovers
occur in periods of distress for a firm

but

that the ensuing recovery would

have taken place with or without takeover. Only a very close examination
of individual companies or a comparison with individual companies not taken
over could answer this question definitively, if there is any way of doing

that. However, one indication that might be taken to mean that the
fluctuations might be only random deviations from a trend and independent
of the occurrence of a takeover would be if large pre—takeover declines

were associated with large post—takeover recoveries. We have tested this
hypothesis by correlating post—takeover with pre—takeover ratios of growth,
as shown in Table 9.

Employment changes after takeover do not seem to be explainable as a

reaction to events of the takeover year. Either there was no significant
relationship or there was a positive one; the firms that were increasing or
decreasing employment more in the periods prior to the takeover year

continued to do so. However, even this relationship is noticeable in only
one of the four employment regressions. Some of the other variables did
give evidence of snapping back after the takeover year in one or two sets
of regressions, particularly those for value added and value added per
employee, which we associate with profitability and possibly with

efficiency changes. A large part of the two—year post—takeover changes in
value added and value added per employee after takeover could be explained

by pre—takeover changes, mainly increases explained by declines before
takeover, and the same was true for some of the larger one—year changes

even though the overall correlation was not high. While this relationship
does not preclude an effect of takeover on profitability it does suggest

another possibility. The acquiring firm may have been able to take
advantage of an unprofitable year to buy the Swedish firm cheaply and then
enjoy the benefit of a recovery that would have taken place, at least to
some extent, even without the acquisition.

Conclusions

Swedish firms acquired by foreigners were large relative to the average
firms in their industries but of relatively low profitability, capital

intensity, or efficiency. We cannot distinguish among these possibilities
but one of them or some combination of them seems the most likely
interpretation of the low value added per employee at the time of takeover

and before. The acquired firms had been growing at least as fast as their
industries over the longest periods we can measure, but the industries
tended to be growing no more rapidly or possibly less rapidly than
manufacturing as a whole.

The takeovers tended to take place in years when the acquired firms did
poorly relative to their industries and also relative to their own past

performance. We find that to have been true with respect to the growth of
employment, value of production, and value added. Thus the takeovers seem
to have involved Swedish firms that had been in some sense weak relative to

others in their industries and had particularly suffered during the year in

which the takeovers occurred. This impression of the acquired firms as

— 27 —

laggards in their industries, especially with respect to profits, fits with
the findings of studies of Swedish mergers and of takeovers in other
count ries.

The consequences of takeovers are more ambiguous. There is strong
indication of short—term recovery after takeover from the misfortunes of
the takeover year and a return to higher growth rates of employment and

output, particularly the former. To the extent that value added per
employee measures productivity or efficiency, however, there is no evidence

that the takeovers raised the rates of growth in these. In fact the
acquired firms ended up lower relative to their industries than before.4
Over the longer run the acquired firms did not show the same relative
employment gains as in the first year or two after takeover but seem to
have increased their profitability or efficiency relative to their

industries. The industries in which takeovers took place grew more rapidly
after the takeovers than total manufacturing although they had grown less

rapidly in the years before takeover. It remains uncertain whether the
takeovers themselves influenced these rates of industry growth.

Data
Swedish Industries

Information on Swedish industries, at the 5—digit SNI level, is from

various issues of Industri published by the Statistiska Centralbyrn.

Takeovers

Data on Swedish establishments taken over by U.S. and other foreign
companies are from Swedish census reports tagged by country of ownership

— 28 —

and supplied by the Statistiska CePtralbyrn to the Swedish Committee on
Direct Investment. The reports included some, but not all, of the standard
information collected in the industry censuses for the years 1966 through
1977 as well as the date on which each establishment was taken over and the

nationality of the purchasing firm. However, the names of the Swedish
establishments and of the parents were not included and there was,
therefore, no way to identify U.S. parents.

Quite a few data items were missing from the information provided,

including all sales value of output and value added for 1973. Since many
takeovers took place in 1974 and 1975, the omission of these data greatly
reduced the number of observations we could use in calculations involving
the year before takeover and the year before that.

A few of the remaining observations were removed for other reasons.
One was that they involved rates of growth for newly established firms,

sometimes extremely large. Another was that the firms merged with others
or sold off parts of their operations. A third was that the data suggested
changes too large to be believable.

Foot notes

'For example, Brash (1970, P. 309) quotes a speech by Australian Prime
Minister Gorton in which he stated "...he would have no objection to a
foreign company acquiring 50 'or even 60%' of the equity of an inefficient
Australian company if the latter would benefit from an infusion of capital,

know—how, or management skill. Re emphasized that he was only objecting to
a 'raid' on an efficient Australian company which already had good
management and 'good technical application' by foreign interests 'who could
afford to buy it out at high prices.'"
2There was some consolidation among Swedish establishments in general
so that the growth in sales and value added per firm was higher than that

for the industry, although still below that of the acquired firms. There
was no change in average employment per firm.

3That is, t—l/t—2 where t

is

the year in which the takeover took place.

4A comparison of foreign—owned food manufacturing firms (most acquired
by takeover) with all Swedish food manufacturing firms showed the foreign—
owned ones expanding their employment much more rapidly in 1960—65 and
1965—70 and then reducing it more rapidly in 1970—75 (Statens Industriverk,

1977). The authors found that there was no substantial change in the rate
of employment growth, relative to the industry, between pre—takeover and

post—takeover periods. For this industry they found that productivity grew
more rapidly relative to the industry after takeover than before.
