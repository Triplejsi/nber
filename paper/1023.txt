Observations on the Indexation of Old Age Pensions

ABSTRACT

This paper examines some positive and normative aspects of the

inflation indexation of public and private pensions. The analysis shows
that alternative indexing arrangements may have far less impact on actual
patterns of risk bearing than is usually thought to be the case. In so far
as inflation indexing has real effects, there is no presumption that they

are beneficial. In particular, the pre—commitment aspects of public
indexing may not be efficient. There are sound reasons to believe
that voluntarily agreed on, non—indexed private pensions may well be
efficient.

Non—indexed pensions may result in an efficient allocation

of risks given the other assets and liabilities of pension issuers and

beneficiaries. In this case, indexation would impede the efficient
allocation of risks. In this paper is also developed an ICOLI (interteinporal
cost of living index) which is superior to conventional price indices
as a way of evaluating the changes in real well being, associated with

changes in wealth. The use of this measure has significant implications
for the indexation of pensions, and for the question of what assets should
be held in pension portfolios.

A major issue in the design of both public and private pension plans
involves the inilexation of benefits to price level changes. A major purported
virtue of current public pensions in the United States is that they provide an

asset with a fixed rel return. This is regarded as important because of the
absence of an indexed bond market. It is frequently alleged that the failure to
provide indexed benefits is a major weakness of standard private pension

arrangements. These views have influenced the recomendations of groups such as
the President's Commission on Pension Policy (1980) and the Advisory Council on

Social Security (1979). Both these groups, without detailed argument, strongly
endorse the indexation of Social Security Benefits.

Serious

consideration of issues regarding indexation requires the careful

specification of an alternative to indexing. It is clearly naive to suppose
that Social Security benefit levels would never be adjusted in the absence of
indexation, or that real benefits would never be adjusted in the presence of

indexing. It also requires recognition of three fundamental principles of
modern finance. First, as exeiclified by the Modigliani—Miller theorem,

repackaging risk does not make it go away. Provisions which insure pension
recipients against some risks impose these same risks on the bearers of pension
liabilities. Second, risk associated with an asset cannot 'be measured in isolation but depends on the covariance of its return with other economic events.

Third, the consumers' objective is to reduce total risk, not to insulate themselves completely from arr

one source of

uncertainty.

While these principles

are widely recognized, they have not informed nny previous analyses of pension
policy.

This paper examines soi positive and normative aspects of the inflation
indexation of public and private pensions. A major conclusion of the analysis
is that alternative indexing arrangements may have far less impact on actual

There are sound reasons

to believe that voluntarily agreed

non—indexed private pensions may well be efficient. Non—indexed pensions

may result in

an efficient allocation of risks given the other assets and liabi-

lities of pension issuers and beneficiaries. Th this case, indexation would
impede the efficient allocation of risks.
Discussions of indexation in most contexts invariably focus only on irifla—

tion indexation. The reasons for this

objective' is

to

narrow focus are not clear. Consumers'

minimize uncertainty about their well being not just to be

free

from inflation risk. It is certainly possible to. imagine indexing public or

private benefit levels to variables other than price indices. In this paper I
develop

an ICOLI (interteioral cost of living index) which is superior to con-

ventional price indices as a way of evaluating the changes in real well being,

associated with changes in wealth. The use of this measure has significant
implications for the indexation of pensions, and for the question of what assets

should be held in pension portfolios.

The plan of the paper is as follows. The firstsection analyzes the inflation indexation of public old age pensions. Under standard assumptions of
either complete legislative discretion, or perfect capital markets, there will
be no real effects arising frora the indexation of Social Security benefits. If
enough imperfections are introduced for indexation to have real effects, there

is no presumption

that they will be

desirable. I argue that in the context of

public pensions, indexation should be thought of primarily as a kind of

aggregate magnitude is deferred to the third section.

The analysiS

here focuses on the effects of changing the size of the program in resp3flSe to

changes in the price level. The issue of indexing in the design of benefit for—
mulae is not considered.l
Since 1912, the Social Security program has in some sense been indexed to

the price level.2 The indexation scheme initially enacted was conceptually
flawed, and led benefits to rise much more rapidly than prices.

The error was

repaired in new legislation in 1917, which has been gradually phased in. At present,
benefits for current recipients are indexed on an annual basis.

In July

each year, benefits are increased by the annual rate of CPI inflation over the
preceding 12 months. Several advisory groups including most recently, the
of

President's

Commission on Pension Policy have recorunended that the frequency of

benefit adjustientS be increased.

The
not

arguments in

favor of indexing the level of public pension benefits do

appear to be very well developed. The

argument

seems to be that indexing

benefit levels provides insurance for beneficiaries agains. the effects of
inflation. Little attention is given to the possibility that this insurance can
be provided through private financial transactions.

Frequently the consequences

alternative indexing arrangements for the risk characteristics of tax liabi—
lities are not considered. Without considering these facets of the problem, it
of

is impossible to evaluate the merits of indexing public pension benefits.
For clarity it is useful to consider the necessary conditions for indexing

benefits to have any real effects at all. This is most easily done recognizing

The first proposition is obvious once stated. Regardless of indexing
arrangements, real benefits will be set at their desired level at each instant.
The form of indexing arrangement will affect whether benefit changes are or are
not necessary, and their magnitudes, but will have no impact on real benefit levels. -

A similar argument suggests that in a competitive spot labor market, indexing

in wage contracts will have no real consequences. This proposition establishes
that a necessary condition for indexation to have real effects is that benefits
can only be adjusted periodically or that some types of legislated benefit

adjustments

(i.e.,

real benefit cuts) are not permitted. These possibilities

considered below.
The second proposition is equivalent to the Modigliani-4liller theorems for

indexed bonds proved by Liviatan and Levhari (1977). It can be demonstrated as
follows. Assume that a consumer has wealth W0, which he allocates to consumption and various portfolio assets in order to maximize

where C is consumption, WT is terminal wealth, r1 is the real return on asset i,

A1 15 investment in asset i, and B represents real social security benefits
which may be uncertain. Suppose for concreteness that asset 1 is the ris)cless

indexed bond, and asset 2 is an otherwise riskiess nominal bond. Then, when

—6—

benefits are indexed, in order for them to have the same real value,

the con-

dition Bnom B•eal(1+r2)/(l+rl) must hold.3 Now supposing that this condition
does hold, consider any feasible allocation (c,A) when Social Security is not
indexed. The sarie terminal wealth distribution can be obtained, if Social
Security is indexed by taking A1 =

and

making no other portfolio chanes. A similar argument can be used to show that
switching from indexed to non—indexed benefits does not chance the feasible set.

It follows that indexing has no real effects under the stated conditions. The
argument could be extended to consider taxpayers' behavior and show that
indexing

has no general equilibrii effects.

This

proposition is clearly not literally applicable to the real world

since indexed bonds do not exist. However it is an open question whether or not

assets with near constant real returns can be forid. If so the
proposition here will continue to hold. Even in the absence of

portfolios of
irrelevance

indexed bonds, or the capacity to manufacture them from existing assets, indivi—
duals can

undo the effects of non—indexation by borrowing to purchase real

durable assets. Thus it seems likely that at least to the extent that indivi—
duals have access to the capital markets, they can negate many of the effects of
indexing

arrangements.

The preceding discussion demonstrates that capital market imperfections in
conjunction with rigidities in adjusting benefit levels are a

necessary condition for indexation to have real effects. We now consider the
case where individuals have no access to indexed bonds or arr close
substitute and where benefits are subject to infrequent adjustment.

Indexation

as Insurance

If a program can be legislatively modified only

infrequently,

indexation

of benefits will provide insurance against unexpected developments between

legislative adjustments. The'

oportance

of this insurance depends on the amount

of unexpected variation in the price level which takes place between legislative

adjustments. Table 1 reproduces a chronolor of legislative changes in Social
Security

Benefit foruulae. It is clear from the table that benefit adjustments

are very common occuring on average every four years. It is useful to get an

of how far out of line benefits can be over intervals of this length. The
likely error in forecasts of the average price level over vario1s horizons can
easily be estiizated. Forecasts based on estimates of expected inflation were

two reasons, even these figures overstate the importance of any real

uncertainties generated by the nonindexation of benefits. First, the timing of
benefit readjustments is endogencus. When the price level innovation is large,
adjustment of benefits can be accelerated. This means that one is unlikely to
observe large undesired changes in real benefit levels. Second, and more importantly, benefit adjustments can take account of losses or gains suffered during

preceding period. For simplicity assume that the target level of real
benefits is a constant B. Now assume that benefits are adjusted each period.

Assuming that individuals have a capacity to borrow and lend at the interest
rate r, in Equation (2), the reduction in lifetirre risk due to indexing is

clearly negligable. Soire data on the financial position of the elderly are pre—

sented below. They show that most possess at least a small amount of liquid
assets. That is all that would be necessary to buffer any fluctuations in real
income due to unexpected changes in the price level. Even for individuals with

no access to the capital market, there is some marn for interteoral substitution

in the timing of the purchases of durable goods. It

the length of the adjustment period constitutes any significa-t arumerit
for indexation. The data in Table 2 certainly suggest that there as been no

which it is difficult to enact legislation, because more than a majority is

In this situation, it is possible to reduce real benefit levels through infla-

tion erosion, and inaction but not through actual legislation. Thus the main
effect

of indexation may be to pre—commit to a minimum fixed real benefit level.

At first, it may seem as if such a policy should be favored by advocates of
a

larger Social Security system. Indexation does prevent reductions in

levels through inflation. Upon reflection however, the situation is

more complex. The optiim level of real benefits legislated will in general
be lower if a constraint is imposed precluding future benefit reductions. The
nature of the ambiguity can be highlighted in the context of a highly stylized
model.

Suppose that optiiim level of benefits in period t is given by X where
X is distribited uniformly on the unit interval and is serially uncorrelated.
Assume also that the regret associated with setting a benefit level B in period t is
given

by:

R(B,X) =

In the case where there is no precorrimitziient problem, the optical strate is

clearly to set B5 = X in each period and have zero regret. Note that when this
strater is followed, the mean level of benefits is X = .5.
Now consider the optirrEl strate when benefits can never be cut. It is

the value of B5 satisfying this first order condition is less than X. The

nominal

They conclude +.hat even when

pensions are included, the aged are for the most part well hedged

against unexpected inflation. It is likely that their results understate the
extent to which the aged are protected from inflation. A very sizable fraction

of the wealth of the aged is represented by the gross value of their homes.
Both economic theory and empirical evidence, (Sumrers (198la,)poterba (1981))

suggest

that owner occupied housing prices should rise much more than point for

point with unexpected inflation. This inference is supported by the recent
sharp decline in real house prices.

These factors suggest that nominal pension liabilities may in fact reduce

the real uncertainties associated with the wealth position of the aged. Of
course efficient pension arrar€emnt cannot be discussed without also considering the risks borne by corporate shareowners. This aspect of the problem
is considered below, after a discussion of the role of indexation in vesting

provisions.
Indexed Vesting Provisions
Bulow (1982) has made the

important observation that in

a competitive

labor

market a worker's marginal product in each period should equal the sum of his

wage and his accrual of vested pension benefits. More generally, his argument

suggests that

some set of market forces determine an optimal time path for com-

pensatiori. This optimal compensation path will in general be independent

of what pension arrangements are made. If pension benefits are vested in nomi—

-16—

nal terms, they represent a nominal asset to workers, and nominal liability to

firms. If the rate of inflation rises, the value of the worker's already

accrued pension asset declines. There is no reason why this should be asso—
ciated with higher subsequent compensation anymore than one would expect
workers' coiripensation to be increased just because other parts of their portfolio performed 'badly.

The common argument that pensions are effectively indexed during the
accrual phase, because benefits are tied to final year salaries, is as Bulow

points out, wrong. It ignores the fact that wages and pension accruals are
determined jointly. Market forces determine a path of total corupensation not a

path of waes. If inflation increases, and pension rules remain static, so that
the rate of growth of pension accruals increases, the rate of wage growth will
decline.

Thus under current institutional arrangents, pension wealth is a nominal
asset for all workers, not just those who have already retired. At current
high rates.of interest, the value of the asset is likely to 'be small for most

young workers. As just emphasized we should not expect the non—indexation of

vested benefits to have any effect on the path of compensation. Hence there is
no reason to expect that indexing pensions would have ar effects on

patterns of

labor turnover or allocative efficiency. Again by the same arguments made
above, in a perfect capital market indexation would have no real effects.

much more offsetting gross ho::e value and mort.age debt for younger

households. This implies that the provision of nominal pensions is unlikely to
impose serious risks on young workers.

Risk_Bear inyrms
The question which remains to be examined is the impact of alternative pension

irdexing arranerents on the risks borne by the u1tirate cwners of pension

liabilities. The proximate owners are corporation. The ultiate owners are
mainly corporate shareowners, but also other corporate creditors, and taxpayers

through the PBGC. Given capital market imperfections, it is reasonable to
expect that corporate s'nareowners will be less well hedged against inflation
than

will pension beneficiaries. Data in Blume, Crockett and Friend (19714) con-

consistent with rationality on the part of investors. A one percent increase in

The discussion in this section suests that the failure of the private
market to develop inflation indexed pensions is not surprising. In a perfect
capital market, indexation arraneitnts would have no real effects. If capital
markets

are imperfect, one would expect arrangements to evolve which lead to the

sharing of otherwise undiversifiable risks. The holders of pension assets

risk sharing calls for the issuance of nominal pension liabilities. It is
interesting to note that similar considerations can explain why indexed bonds

I II. In exin

to Other rates

Almost all p-actically oriented discussions of indexation focus on indexing
benefits to the general price level. The motivation for this choice is rarely

clearly specified.

The implicit argument for price level indexation

to

be

that this provides full insurance because real benefit levels are guaranteed.
To state this arguinnt is to realize its limitatIons. Presumably, we care about

the real standard of living of pension and Social Security beneficiaries, rather
than their benefit levels from the prograrrs. Only for individuals wholly sup-

ported by a given nonadjustable program is there a potential argument for
inflation indexation of benefit levels. The discussion in the precedin section
made the point that insuring program benefit levels may actually increase the
risk borne by beneficiaries if benefits would

otherwise

have covaried negative-

ly with the assets in beneficiaries' portfolios.
This

raises the more general point, that if the

goal is to provide

to beneficiaries, it will in general be desirable to link changes in
benefits to changes in the opportunity set faced by consumers. Benefits should
be varied so as to play the role of the hedge portfolios in Merton's (1913)

of the representative aged consumer. For simplicity, I assume that the horizon
is known with certainty, and that future prices are known with certainty, so

that there exists a safe real asset. The consumer's probln is to:

indexing schemes are directed at insuring that the first of these conditions is

met. The discussion in the preceding section considered the implications of the

fact that (iii)is unlikely to be satisfied. The analysis here however suggests
that indexing if it is to insure beneficiaries' standard of living must take
account of all changes in real wealth, and in the real interest rate.

that in evaluating the welfare of the aged some sort of inter—

temporal price index should be emplqred.

There is another way of looking at the problem which leads to a similar

conclusion. Consider an indivióial who desires a constant real consumption
stream, and holds all his wealth in the form of an indexed real annuity. Such
an individual is exposed to no real risk since his annuity payments exactly

match his consumption streams However if' real interest rates fluctuate, the

market value of such a real annuity will vary. The asset will appear risky when

risk is measurable in the standard way. This paradox is easily resolved. When

interest rates rise, the value of the annuity declines and the price of
future consumption also falls. The value of the annuity measured relative to a
real

proper interterrrporal cost of living index (as described below) remains con-

stant. Notice that the same analysis could be applied to the situation of' an
individual who owns his home which fluctuates in value as the real interest rate

It is important to be clear abot the letate uses of an intertemporal

problem unless individuals are infinite lived, since the length of their horizon

is in the form of future streams of income. This suggests that the price index

index benefits to changes in real wealth which also change the opportunity set,

or to developients which affect future incoJe? Efforts to integrate private
pensions and Social Security represent one small step in this direction. Such

schemes of córse involve the same issues of discretion and capital
market behavior. It does seem clear however that there is no strong logic which
indexing

indexation of benefits to the current price level as against other
alternatives.

A second implication of these results is that in iriaking portfolio choices
the aged should be concerned about real returns relative to an intertnporal

price index like that considered here. Assets should be more highly valued if

their returns are positively correlated vith the price of future consumption.

r-)clusio

The analysis in this paper supports three principal conclusions: First,
indexation

of both public and private pensions is likely to have only minor

effects on real economic behavior. The presence of provisions for discretionary
adjustment, and the workings of capital markets, suggest that indexation provi-

sions will be largely neutralized by other offsetting adjustments.
Second, the effects of increased indexatiori may well be perverse. The pre—
commitment aspect of public indexing means that the ultirate effect of indexing
provisions may be to reduce the size of public pensions. The non—indexation of
private pensions probably represents efficient risk sharifl. It appears that
pension beneficiaries are much better hedged against inflation risks than are
the bearers of pension liabilities.
Third, if insurance is the motivation for indexation proVisiOnS, there is no

reason why such provisions should be confined to inflation. Only under very
restrictive assumptions will inflation indexing provide full insurance. In par—
ticular an important source of exogenous uncertainty facing the aged involves

the price of future consumption. Changes in an estited interteiora1 cost of
living index diverge significantly from those in the conventional CPI.
Pobert

tion

Merton, in his contribution to this volume advocates a novel solu-

tosome of the problems discussed here. He proposes that Social Security

benefits be indexed to the level of aggregate consumption. He argues that in
addition to providing inflation protection, such a plan would offer a form of

"standard of living" insurance. In

general, the level of

consumption is likely

to be a proxy for the opportunity set facing consumers. This notion is
justified formally in Merton (l9T3) and Breeden (1979).

erton's proposed Social Security plan is self financing and requires only

very

infrequent adjustzrient. The self financing character of the plan reduces

substantially the precor-nitment problems stressed here. !erton's indexing
scheme provides for both

increases

and

decreases in benefit levels, so the "no

cut" constraint is unlikely to bind. It also implicitly Trakes benefit levels
depend on both the level of '.ealth and real rates of return.
There are however a number of types of shocks which are likely to affect

real consumption but not optimal benefit levels. Triese include changes in the taste
for leisure, changes in demographic composition of the population, changes in

life

expectancy, and changes in the distribution of income. The Lportance of

these shocks relative to others causing fluctuations in aggreate consumption is

an empirical question. If they are significant, it may be preferable to desii
indices

based on estiriated changes in the opportunity set of the representative

aged consumer. The interteiporal cost of living index presented here represents
a

start in this direction.

Footnotes

1. Indexing in the desi&n of the benefit formula may well cause greater
horizontal equity.

2. While the discussion here focuses on Social Security, it is clearly applicable to other public pensions such as those for Veterans and federal ei.lajees.

3. This condition is necessary. In order to meaninful1y talk about the
effects of indexation it must be assumed that benefit pac).'ages have equal value

in all cases.
