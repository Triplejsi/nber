Accounting for Exchange Rate Variability in Present-Value Models When the
Discount Factor is Near One
Charles Engel and Kenneth D. West
NBER Working Paper No. 10267
January 2004
JEL No. F31, G12
ABSTRACT
Nominal exchange rates in low-inflation advanced countries are nearly random walks. Engel and
West (2003a) offer an explanation for this in the context of models in which the exchange rate is
determined as the discounted sum of current and expected future fundamentals. Engel and West
show that if the fundamentals are I(1), then as the discount factor approaches one, the exchange rate
becomes indistinguishable from a random walk. An alternative explanation for the random-walk
behavior of exchange rates is that there are some unobserved variables that drive exchange rates that
follow near random walks. This paper takes the approach that both explanations are possible. We
are able to measure how much of exchange-rate variation could be accounted for by the Engel-West
explanation, despite the fact that we do not observe the information set of financial markets. We find
that the observable fundamentals (money, income, prices, interest rates) may account for about 40
percent of the variance of changes in exchange rates under the assumption of discount factors near
unity.

A well-known stylized fact about nominal exchange rates among low-inflation advanced
countries – particularly U.S. exchange rates – is that their logs are approximately random walks.
Mussa (1979) is most frequently cited for observing this regularity. In a famous paper, Meese
and Rogoff (1983a, 1983b) found that the structural models of the 1970s could not “beat” a
random walk in explaining exchange rate movements. Recently some authors (Mark (1995),
Chinn and Meese (1995), Mark and Sul (2001)) have argued that the models can outforecast the
random walk at long horizons. But a comprehensive recent study by Cheung, Chinn, and
Pascual (2003) documents that “no model consistently outperforms a random walk.”
Why? One obvious explanation is that the macroeconomic variables that determine the
exchange rate themselves follow random walks. If the log of the nominal exchange rate is a
linear function of forcing variables that are random walks, then it will inherit the random walk
property. The problem with this explanation is that the economic “fundamentals” proposed in
the most popular models of exchange rates do not, in fact, follow simple random walks.
One resolution to this problem is that there may be some other fundamentals – ones that
have been proposed in some models but are not easily measurable, or ones that have not yet been
proposed at all – that are important in determining exchange rates. If these “unobserved”
fundamentals follow random walks, and dominate the variation in exchange rate changes, then
exchange rates will nearly be random walks (even if the standard “observed” fundamentals are
not.)
Engel and West (2003a) (hereinafter, EW) propose an alternative explanation. They
consider linear models of the exchange rate that are in the “asset market approach” to exchange
rates. These models emphasize the role of expectations of future economic fundamentals in
determining the current exchange rate. The exchange rate (expressed as the home currency price

1

of foreign currency in this paper) can be written as a discounted sum of the current and expected
future fundamentals:
(1)

∞

st = xtI ≡ (1 − b)å j =0 b j E ( ft + j + zt + j | I t ) , 0 < b < 1

where ft and z t are economic fundamentals that ultimately drive the exchange rate, such as money
supplies, money demand shocks, productivity shocks, etc. We differentiate between fundamentals
observable to the econometrician, ft , and those that are not observable, z t . E is the expectations
operator, and I t is the information set of agents in the economy that determine the exchange rate.

EW show that if the fundamentals are I(1) (but not necessarily pure random walks), then
as the discount factor approaches unity, the exchange rate will follow a process arbitrarily close
to a random walk. Intuitively, we can decompose the I(1) fundamentals into the sum of a
random walk and a stationary component. When the discount factor increases toward one, more
weight is being placed on expectations of the fundamentals far into the future. Transitory
components in the fundamentals become relatively less important in determining exchange rate
behavior. When the discount factor is near unity, the variance of the change of discounted sum
of the random walk component in fundamentals approaches infinity, but the variance of the
change of the stationary component approaches a constant. So the variance of the change of the
exchange rate is dominated by the change of the random walk component, and the exchange rate
becomes indistinguishable from a random walk.
EW argue that the theorem is a possible explanation for the random-walk-like behavior of
exchange rates. In the standard models, the fundamental typically is I(1), which is a condition of
the theorem. They show that empirical estimates of the discount factor are sufficiently close to
one so that, given the time-series behavior of observed fundamentals, the exchange rate will

2

appear to be a random walk if it is indeed determined as a discounted sum of the current and
expected future fundamentals.
But is the EW result the most appealing explanation for the random walk behavior of
exchange rates? We can write
(2)

st = xtIf + U t ,

where
(3)

∞

xtIf ≡ (1 − b)å j =0 b j E ( ft + j | It ) .

xtIf is the discounted sum of current and expected future fundamentals that the econometrician
observes ( ft + j .) In this paper, we take f t to be the observable fundamental that emerges from
one of two classes of asset-market exchange rate models: monetary models of exchange rates
developed in the 1970s, and models based on Taylor-rules for monetary policy. xtIf is the part of
the exchange rate that can be explained from observed fundamentals. U t is the part of the
exchange rate not determined by xtIf . We take an eclectic view on what U t might be. It might
be the case that exchange rates are determined as in equation (1), in which case U t is the
expected discounted sum of current and future values of z t . Or, perhaps some other type of
model relates exchange rates to fundamentals, and U t measures those fundamentals. Or,
perhaps the exchange rate is driven in part by noise, in which case U t represents that noise. If

U t is important in driving the exchange rate, then given the random-walk nature of exchange
rates, U t must be a random walk.1 This in turn would imply that st and xtIf are not cointegrated.

1

U t may be a random walk if the discounted sum of unobserved fundamentals, zt , and zt is I(1) and the discount

factor is near one. In that case, the EW theorem applies to the discounted sum of expected current and future values
of zt . However, U t could be a random walk for any reason, not just this one.

3

Our task in this paper is to get a measure of the contribution of xtIf and U t in driving
exchange rates. We cannot say much about the contribution of U t , since it is not observed by us.
But even measuring the contribution of xtIf may appear to be a quixotic goal. xtIf is also
unobservable to the econometrician (even though f t is observable.) That is because xtIf
measures agents’ expectations about future fundamentals, which are not perfectly observed by
the econometrician who only sees a subset of the information that agents use in forming their
expectations. For example, if the economic fundamentals involve monetary policy, the
econometrician might observe the time-series behavior of monetary policy instruments, and
might observe many of the macroeconomic variables that influence monetary policy. But agents,
in forecasting future monetary policy, have access to a wide variety of information that is
difficult to quantify – e.g., newspaper and newswire reports, speeches by policymakers, etc.
Nonetheless, this paper demonstrates that we can measure the variance of ∆xtIf (the firstdifference of xtIf ) when the discount factor, b, approaches one. To be precise, define
(4)

∞

xtHf ≡ (1 − b)å j =0 b j E ( ft + j | H t ) .

Here, H t is the information set used by the econometrician. An estimate xˆtHf can be constructed
from VARs that include ft and other observable macroeconomic variables that might help
forecast f t . This paper demonstrates that var(∆xtHf ) approaches var(∆xtIf ) when b approaches

one. To be clear, this does not mean that xtIf ≈ xtHf as b → 1 , and for that reason we do not look
to the correlation between ∆st and ∆xtHf to gauge the EW explanation. xtIf remains
unobservable to the econometrician, but, remarkably, the variance of ∆xtIf can be estimated
consistently.
4

It follows from (2) that
(5)

var(∆st ) = var(∆xtIf ) + var(∆U t ) + 2 cov(∆xtIf , ∆U t ) .

If only observed fundamentals matter for the exchange rate, then var(∆st ) = var(∆xtIf ) . We will
take var(∆xtIf ) / var(∆st ) as a measure of the importance of observed fundamentals in driving the
exchange rate, when the discount factor is near one. This satisfies our primary objective, which
is to provide some insight into how effective the approach of EW is in accounting for the
random-walk behavior of exchange rates.
The outline of the remainder of the paper is: Section 2 is a short recapitulation of
standard asset market models of exchange rates. Some descriptive statistics for exchange rates
and fundamentals are provided in Section 3. Section 4 demonstrates that var(∆xtHf ) approaches
var(∆xtIf ) as b goes to one. Then in Section 5 we report measures of var(∆xˆtHf ) / var(∆st ) for
some standard economic fundamentals, for the other G7 countries relative to the U.S.
The ability of the fundamentals to account for the variance of changes in the exchange
rates differs somewhat across measures of fundamentals and across exchange rates. Roughly, we
find var(∆xˆtHf ) / var(∆st ) to be around 0.4 when we draw the fundamentals from monetary
models of exchange rates, and slightly lower when the fundamentals are derived from Taylorrule models.
2. Asset Market Models of Exchange Rates

EW review the familiar models that fall under the label of “the asset market approach to
exchange rates.” The simplest summary comes directly from Frenkel’s (1981, p. 674-675) paper
on “news” and exchange rates, which in many ways is a precursor of our work. (Here we have
changed only the notation to match ours.):

5

“This view of the foreign exchange market can be exposited in terms of the following
simple model. Let the logarithm of the spot exchange rate on day t be determined by:
(6)

st = ft + zt + λ éë E ( st +1 | I t ) − st ùû

where E ( st +1 | I t ) − st denotes the expected percentage change in the exchange rate between t
and t + 1 , based on the information available at t, where ft + zt represents the ordinary factors of
supply and demand that affect the exchange rate on day t. These factors may include domestic
and foreign money supplies, incomes, levels of output, etc. Equation (6) represents a sufficiently
general relationship which may be viewed as a ‘reduced form’ that can be derived from a variety
of models of exchange rate determination.”
The two types of models we consider here fall into this general form. The first is the
familiar monetary model. Following Mark (1995) and others, we take the observable
fundamental, ft , to be mt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) , where mt is the log of the domestic money supply,
yt is the log of domestic GDP, and mt* and yt* are the foreign counterparts. Following the
derivation in EW, the unobserved fundamental, zt , is a linear combination of variables such as
home and foreign money demand errors, a foreign exchange risk premium (multiplied by λ ),
and real exchange rate shocks arising from sources such as home and foreign productivity
changes. In the monetary model, the parameter λ represents the interest semi-elasticity of
money demand (assumed to be identical in the home and foreign country.)
The second model is less familiar, and is based on Taylor-rules for monetary policy.2
EW examine the implications of an interest rate rule that has as one target (in either the home or
foreign country policy rule, or both) deviations of the exchange rate from its purchasing power
parity level, st − ( pt − pt* ) , where pt is the log of the domestic price level and pt∗ is the foreign

counterpart. They show that there are two different representations of the model that fall into the
class of models given by (6). In the first, the ft = pt − pt* , and λ = 1/ β , where β is the
coefficient on deviations from (log) PPP in the Taylor rule. zt in this model is a linear
combination of other variables targeted by the Taylor rule as well as perhaps money demand
errors and a risk premium. Intuitively, this model fits neatly into the framework of equation (6)
because the log of the exchange rate is determined by its target, ft = pt − pt* , and the expected
movement toward the target, (1/ β ) éë E ( st +1 | I t ) − st ùû . Another representation of the same model
adds the interest differential to the difference in the log of prices, so that the observed
fundamental is given by ft = pt − pt* + (it − it* ) . In this case, λ = (1 − β ) / β . In this alternative
representation, zt is again a linear combination of other variables targeted by the Taylor rule,
money demand errors, and a risk premium. The exchange rate contains information not only
about the long-run target, but also about the interest differential. The deviation of the exchange
rate from its target helps markets predict the path of interest rates set by monetary policymakers.
Solving equation (6) forward for the exchange rate yields equation (1), where
b = λ /(1 + λ ) . Based on estimates of the interest semi-elasticity of money demand, EW note that

in quarterly data, for the monetary model, b ≈ 0.97 or 0.98.3 The value of the discount factor is
similar in the Taylor-rule model, based on estimates of the responsiveness of interest rates to
exchange-rate targets in monetary policymaking rules.

3

For example, the estimates of the semi-elasticity in Stock and Watson (1993) are around 0.11. Stock and Watson
express interest rates in percentages and use annual rates. To get the units correct for equation (6), we want to
express interest rates in decimal form, and we are considering a quarterly frequency. So we multiply their estimate
by 400, which implies an interest semi-elasticity of 44, and b = 44/45, or approximately 0.978.

3. The Data and Summary Statistics

We use quarterly data, with most data spanning 1973:I-2003:I. The precise data span for
the first-difference in each measure of ft is given in Table 1. The U.S. is the home country, and
we measure exchange rates and fundamentals relative to the other G7 countries: Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.K.
The exchange rates (end-of-quarter) and consumer prices (CPI) come from the
International Financial Statistics CD-ROM for all seven countries. Seasonally adjusted money
supplies come from the OECD's Main Economic Indicators available on Datastream, (M4 for the
U.K., M1 for the other countries.) For real seasonally adjusted GDP, the data come from the
OECD with the exception that for Germany the data combines IFS data (1974:I-2001:I) with data
from the OECD after 2002:I. Interest rates are 3-month Euro rates from Datastream. We take
logs of all data but interest rates, and multiply all data by 100.
In addition we use a separate measure of U.S. money supply (that we label msw) that
adds “sweep account programs” to our measure of M1 from the OECD. “Sweeps” refer to
balances that are moved by U.S. banks from checking accounts to various interest-earning
accounts by automated computer programs as a way for banks to reduce their required reserve
holdings. It has been argued that exclusion of sweeps from the M1 data will lead to an undermeasurement of true transactions balances. 4 The data on sweeps is obtained from the website of
the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. For our monetary model, we consider measures of the
fundamentals both correcting for sweeps mswt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) , and also using the uncorrected
U.S. M1 data, mt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) .

4

We thank J. Huston McCulloch for pointing out this issue to us.

8

We examine, then, the behavior of four observed fundamentals: mt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) ,
mswt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) , pt − pt* , and pt − pt* + (it − it* ) , for six countries relative to the U.S. We
performed ADF tests (with 4 lags) with a constant and trend for all fundamentals and exchange
rates, and failed to reject the null of a unit root in almost all cases.5 We proceeded to test for no
cointegration between the exchange rate and the corresponding four fundamentals. In almost
every case, we were unable to reject the null of no cointegration using Johansen’s λmax and

λtrace tests.6 This latter finding suggests that there may be a role for unobserved unit-root
variables (the U t from equation (2)) in driving exchange rates.
Table 1 presents some summary statistics for the changes in exchange rates and the
various measures of fundamentals. We note that ∆st has low serial correlation for all exchange
rates – that is, the exchange rate looks approximately like a random walk. However, for many of
the fundamentals, the serial correlation of ∆ft is quite high (in the range of 0.5). The randomwalk like behavior of exchange rates cannot be explained by random-walk like behavior in the
observed fundamentals. The alternative explanations we consider are that the unobserved
forcing variables for exchange rates, U t , are random walks; or, that the EW theorem is
applicable. Indeed, both explanations may have merit, so we ask how much of the variance of
∆st can be explained by the observed fundamentals under the conditions of the EW theorem.
5. Accounting for the Variance of Exchange Rate Changes

If only observed fundamentals determined exchange rates, then we would have st = xtIf ,
where xtIf is defined in equation (3). As we have noted, we cannot measure xtIf because we do
not have access to all of the information that markets use in forming their expectations of future

fundamentals. Here we show that we can, however, measure the variance of ∆xtIf , when the
discount factor, b, is close to one. We ask whether the variance of ∆xtIf is a substantial fraction
of the variance of ∆st , so that observed fundamentals can account for much of the variance in the
change of log exchange rates.
We can measure xtHf as defined in equation (4) – the discounted sum of current and
expected future fundamentals based on the econometrician’s information, H t . Define the
innovation in xtIf as:
etIf ≡ xtIf − E ( xtIf | I t −1 ) ,
and the innovation in xtHf as
etHf ≡ xtHf − E ( xtHf | H t −1 ) .
Under the assumption that all the variables in I t follow an ARIMA(q,r,s) process, q, r , s ≥ 0 , and
that H t is a subset of I t that includes at least current and past values of ft , equation (6) in West
(1988) shows that
var(etHf ) =

1 − b2
var( xtHf − xtIf ) + var(etIf ) .
2
b

As b → 1 , var( xtHf − xtIf ) stays bounded, but

1 − b2
→ 0 . It follows that for b near one,
b2

var(etHf ) ≈ var(etIf ) .
The EW theorem gives us that when b is near one, ∆xtIf ≈ etIf , and ∆xtHf ≈ etHf . So, we can
use an estimate of var(∆xtHf ) to measure var(∆xtIf ) .

10

A simple example may help develop intuition. Suppose ft = ft −1 + e1t + e2t −1 , where e1t
and e2t are mutually independent, i.i.d., mean-zero processes. Assuming agents observe e1t and
e2t at time t, we can use (3) to solve and find st (= xtIf ) = f t + be2t . Then,
∆st (= ∆xtIf ) = ∆ft + b∆e2t = e1t + be2t + (1 − b)e2t −1 . As b → 1 , ∆st (= ∆xtIf ) → e1t + e2t . Note that,
as in the EW theorem, when b approaches 1, st approaches a random walk.
Now, continuing with the example, suppose that H t contains only current and lagged
values of ft . Then, solving using equation (4), we find xtHf = f t , so ∆xtHf = ∆f t = e1t + e2t −1 . We
see in this example that as b nears one, var(∆xtIf ) → var(e1t + e2t ) = var(e1t + e2t −1 ) = var(∆xtHf ) .
This equality holds even though ∆xtIf ≠ ∆xtHf (even as b → 1 ). In this example, the EW result
completely explains the random walk in st as b → 1 , but that does not mean the exchange rate
change can be completely explained by observable changes in ft . The correlation between ∆st
and ∆xtHf ( = corr (e1t + e2t , e1t + e2t −1 ) ) could be far less than one if the variance of e2t is large.7
6. Results

In this section, we report estimates of var( ∆xtHf ) / var( ∆st ) for our four measures of
observed fundamentals: mt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) , mswt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) , pt − pt* , and
pt − pt* + (it − it* ) . In calculating this statistic, we take the econometrician’s information set to be
only the current and lagged value of the fundamental in each case. For the mt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ )
and mswt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) measures of fundamentals, we also consider the case in which the

7

Mark Watson has pointed out to us that if U t = 0 , then as the discount factor approaches one, the long-run

correlation between the change in xtHf and the change in the exchange rate should approach one. We do not
implement this useful observation here.

11

information set additionally includes current and lagged values of pt − pt* . We do so as a
robustness check, reminding the reader that, specification and sampling error aside, the two
information sets will generate the same value for var(∆xtHf ) as b approaches 1.
To motivate our calculation of var(∆xtHf ) , let Wt be a ( n × 1 ) vector of observable
variables, with ft = a′Wt . Assume ∆Wt follows a VAR of order d:
∆Wt = Φ1∆Wt −1 + Φ 2 ∆Wt − 2 + ... + Φ d ∆Wt − d + εWt .
−1

Define ζ (b) ≡ éë I − bΦ1 − ... − bd Φ d ùû . Then using equation (4), we can write the innovation in
xtHf as:
etHf = a′ζ (b)εWt .
From the EW theorem, for b ≈ 1 , we have ∆xtHf ≈ a′ζ (b)εWt .
Mechanically, then, we estimate a VAR (with four lags in all cases) that includes the
fundamentals and possibly other information (as noted above). We use estimates
−1
ˆ 1 − ... − b 4Φ
ˆ 4 ù and εˆWt to construct ∆xˆtHf = a′ζˆ (b)εˆWt . Tables 2, 3, and 4 report
ζˆ (b) ≡ éë I − bΦ
û

our calculations of var(∆xˆtHf ) / var(∆st ) .
Table 2 reports this ratio when the fundamentals are mt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) and
mswt − yt − (mt∗ − yt∗ ) from the monetary model. For each fundamental, only current and lagged
fundamentals are assumed to be observable by the econometrician. The notable result from
Table 2 is that var(∆xˆtHf ) / var(∆st ) is fairly large. For the first fundamental, that ratio is above
0.5 for all countries except Italy, if we take a discount factor of b = 0.95 . Not surprisingly, the
ratio rises as b increases toward 1. For the second fundamental, the reported values of the ratio

12

var(∆xˆtHf ) / var(∆st ) are slightly lower, but still quite large. For one country, Canada, the results
are troubling for both sets of fundamentals, because the ratio exceeds one in all cases. From
equation (5), that finding is sensible only when cov(∆xtIf , ∆U t ) < 0 . That is, there must be a
negative correlation between the change in the discounted sum of current and expected future
fundamentals with the unobserved ∆U t .
Table 3 reports the ratio var(∆xˆtHf ) / var(∆st ) for these same two fundamentals, but when
we augment H t with current and lagged values of pt − pt∗ . The results are quite similar to those
in Table 2. This is reassuring, since our demonstration that var( ∆xtHf ) ≈ var(∆xtIf ) when b ≈ 1 ,
does not depend on what is in the information set H t (as long as it is a subset of I t that includes
at least current and past values of ft .)
Table 4 looks at the fundamentals pt − pt* , and pt − pt* + (it − it* ) from the Taylor-rule
model. The econometrician is assumed only to observe current and lagged values of the
fundamental. We find here that var(∆xˆtHf ) / var(∆st ) is a bit lower than we found for the
fundamentals from the monetary model. When b = 0.95 or 0.99, for most countries the ratio is
around 0.20, though it is about half that size for Germany and Japan. In this case, all of the ratios
are less than one, but only in the case of Italy, when b = 1 and the fundamental is pt − pt* , does
the ratio exceed 0.5.
There are few previous studies that permit comparison to these figures. The bounds on
the variance of ∆st and of st − Et −1 ( st ) of Huang (1981, p. 37) and Diba (1987, p.106) use
inequalities that are satisfied by construction for b arbitrarily near 1. Such inequalities
unhelpfully guarantee values greater than 1 for the ratio that we consider. Using the monetary
model, West (1987, p.70) finds a ratio of about .02 to .08 for the Deutschemark-dollar exchange
13

rate. The present technique yields considerably higher figures, suggesting there is rather more in
the monetary model than this previous volatility test would suggest.
We conclude that asset-market models in which the exchange rate is expressed as a
discounted sum of the current and expected future values of these observed fundamentals can
account for a sizable fraction of the variance of ∆st when the discount factor is large. The EW
explanation for a random walk provides a rationale for a substantial fraction of the movement in
exchange rates. But there is still a role for left-out forcing variables: perhaps money demand
errors, a risk premium, mismeasurement of the fundamentals we have examined here, some other
variables implied by other theories, or noise.
