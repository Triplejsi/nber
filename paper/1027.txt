Investment versus Savings Incentives:
The Size of the Bang for the Buck and the Potential for
Self—Financing Business Tax Cuts

Abstract

This paper examines the closed economy effects of government policies that

vary with respect to whether they treat newly produced capital differently from

old capital. Policies that do make this distinction are denoted investment
policies, while those that do not are labelled savings policies. While both
types of policies alter marginal incentives to accumulate new capital, investment
incentives can generate significant inframarginal redistribution from current

holders of wealth to those with small or zero claims on the existing capital

stock. Among the principal findings, based on simulations of a general equilibrium, perfect foresight, overlapping generations life—cycle model, are:
1)

Investment incentives, even if financed by short run increases in
the stock of debt, significantly increase capital formation.

2)

Deficit—financed savings incentives, in contrast, typically reduce
the economy's long run capital stock.

3)

Deficit—financed investment incentives can actually be self—financing,

in that they may lead to a long run surplus without any increase in
other tax rates.

I. Introduction
in closed economies, saving and investment represent, respectively, the

supply of and demand for new domestic capital. Saving incentives shift the
supply curve for new domestic capital, while investment incentives shift the

demand curve. The basic public finance equivalence theorem that the real
effects of a tax (subsidy) are independent of who noxinally pays the tax

(receives the subsi) applies equally well to the market for new capital.
Hence, in closed economies, saving and investment incentives do not represent conceptually distinct policies, and the real effects of taxes or subsidies applied to the supply of new capital, saving, can be replicated by

taxes or subsidies applied to the demand for n capital, investment.
While economically meaningful distinctions between saving and investment incentives do not arise, there are meaningful distinctions between
policies that affect savings, the sum of past and current saving, and those
that directly affect only current saving, or, in equilibrium, current
investment.

This paper examines the closed econorrr effects of government policies

that vary with respect to whether they treat newly produced capital differently
are

from old

capital. Policies that distin&iish new capital from old

denoted investment policies, while those that

savings policies. While both types of policies

do

not are labelled

alter marginal incen-

tives to accumulate new capital, investment incentiv can generate
significant infraxnarnal redistribution from current holders of wealth
to those with small or zero claims on the existing stock of capital. In
the context of a neoclassical growth model, this redistribution runs, in

large part, from the elderly to young and future generations. The
direction of this intergenerational transfer is opposite to that

—2—

associated

with the "burden of governnrnt debt"; in the case of debt, the

governrrnt passes the tax bill for current expenditures on to future generations.

Intergenerational transfers can have important effects on national saving

and capital formation in the life grth cycle rrxdel that posits zero or limited
intergenerational altruism. The process by which these transfers affect capital

formation is often referred to as "crowding out" of investment. A natural
question to pose in a life cycle model is whether the ttcrcMding in" of new capi-

tal formation arising from investment incentives exceeds the crding out produced by deficits potentially associated with these incentives. This question
has particular relevance to present economic affairs since current U.S. projected deficits reflect, in large part, business tax cuts.
In addition to analyzing the net impact on capital formation of deficit—
financed business tax cuts, this paper considers the potential for self—
financing business tax cuts. A self—f inancin6 business tax cut is defined here
as a deficit—financed investment incentive that produces an increase in the
econonry's

run

tax base sufficient to permit the government to reach long

budget balance without ever raising tax rates.
A third

whether

issue of considerable relevance to current economic policy is

gradual increases in investznt incentives delay investirient until the

incentives have been fully phased in. The 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA)
provided for even greater investment incentives after 1984 than between 1981 and

1984. The 1982 Economic Report of the President indicated a potential decline
in the effective tax rate on equity financed new investment in general
industrial equipment from 21 percent in 1982 to negative 514

percent

in 1986.

In part, these figures reflect steadily declining projected inflation rates

interacting with historic cost depreciation provisions. In addition, ERTA

—3—

authorized more favorable depreciation schedules starting in 195. While the
1982 tax act reduced future increases in the acceleration of depreciation, the
1981 act may,

in

part, be responsible for the historically l investment rate

in 1982.

The principal findings of this paper with respect to these three issues
are:

(1) Investment incentives, even those financed by short run

increases

in the stock of debt, significantly increase capital formation in
life cycle economies.

(2) Deficit—financed savings incentives, in contrast, typically reduce
the economy's rate of capital formation in the long run.

(3) Deficit—financed investment incentives can be self—financing for
particular, but not unreasonable, parameterizations of neoclassical life—cycle growth models.

() Gradual

phasing in of investment incentives can actually reduce

rather than stiimlate short term investment.

(5) The underlying explanation for the relative efficacy of investment
as oppOsed to savings incentives in stirailating capital formation

in life cycle ide1s is that investnnt incentives redistribute
from the old to the young. Since the old in life cycle models
have higher marginal propensities to consume out of lifetime
resources than the young, this transfer reduces current consump-

tion, permitting the "crowding in" of current investxnt.
The analysis of investment incentives is based on the Auerbach—Kotlikoff

(1983) life cycle computer siraijation model. The del describes the perfect foresight growth path of life cycle economies in response to a wide

variety of fiscal policies. For

purposes of

this study the model has been

—11—

expanded to include full or partial expensing of new capital as a policy
option. Expensing is only one of several types of currently legislated invest—
inent incentives; its use is liniited to a small subset of total U.S. investment.

Ffowever, expensing is a convenient devise for analyzing a variety of other

investment incentives including the investment tax credit and the acceleration
of depreciation; rates of fractional expensing can be chosen that produce effec-

tive tax rates on new investment equal to those arising from these other poli-

cies. In addition, if deficit policy is chosen appropriately, expensing policies can produce a time path of cash flows to the government similar to those
that would arise from changes in the ITC or depreciation schedules.
The second substantitive addition to the model is the inclusion of cost of

quickly adjusting the econonv's capital stock. As described b many authors
(including Abel, 1979; Hayashi, 1981; and Summers, 1981), such increasing margi-

nal costs of investment generate inframarginal rents to existing capital. As a
consequence, the market valuation of the econol:v's existing capital stock can

differ from its replacement cost. The assumption of quadratic ad,ustment costs
leads to a theory of' investment in which the rate of investment is a linear
function of' Tobin's q (Tobin, 1969) ,the ratio of the stock market value of capi-

tal to its replacement cost. Tobin's q is also an important variable in determining household consumption and labor supply decisions. These decisions are
based on the current and future wages and rates of return households foresee,
but also on the householdTs initial wealth, including the market value of its
claims to existing capital.

Since the elderly are the primary owners of capital in a life cycle model,

consideration of adjustment costs, with their associated implications for

changes in the wealth of the elderly, can be quite iortant in assessing the
redistributive impact of numerous fiscal policies. One example is a switch from

—5—

income to an equal revenue consumption tax.

Such a policy suggests a significant loss in welfare to the elderly, whose wealth holdings must now be spent,
an

in part, to meet taxes on the purchase of consumption goods. With capital
adjustment

costs, however, there is a countervailing effect serving to increase

the wealth and welfare of the elderly. The stimulus to capital fornation associated with the consumption tax produces an irnnrdiate increase in stock mrket
values, reflecting increased inframarginal rents to the existing capital stock.

The higher initial stock market values obviously redound to the advantage of the
elderly.

In addition to mitigating the intergenerational redistribution from the old
to

the young in the case of a switch to a consumption tax, the inclusion of

adjustment costs in the rdel cushions the fall in stock market values associated with investment incentives that discriminate ainst old capital.
Permitting expensing of new capital at higher rates than were previously allowed
and restricting this expensing solely to new capital is an exarle of a policy
injurious to the elderly, since it places existing capital at a financial disad-

vantage relative to new capital. But the welfare loss to the elderly is mitigated to the extent that the econonv's desire for an ultimately greater level of

capital per orker raises infranarginal rents on previously installed, i.e.
existing, capital.

The next section of this paper igores the issue of adjustment costs
in order to clarify, in a simple framework, differences between investment and

savings incentives. The discussion points out equivalence relationships between

investnt incentives and other fiscal policies. In particular,

percent

permitting 100

expensing of new capital in the presence of a capital income tax (levied

either on individuals or on businesses, in the form of a profits tax) is equivalent to imposing a one tine wealth tax at a rate equal to that of the capital

—6—

income tax. If the econon- also taxes labor income at this same rate, introducing 100 percent expensing taxes wages

and

initial wealth at the same rate.

This tax structure, in turn, is equivalent to a proportional consumption tax.
With the exception of the investment tax credit, new U.S. business invest—
inent incentives are available to old as well as new capital; the old capital

must, however, be sold to qualify for the new

incentives.

The sale of old capi-

tal requires payment of recapture taxes calculated on the difference between the

asset's new sale price and its adjusted basis. If the taxes incurred in turning
over old assets exceed the present value gain in investment incentives from such
a transaction, turnover will not be stimulated; in this case the econoxciic out-

come of new investment provisions that do not explicitly exclude old capital
will be identical to that which would have occurred had the new incentives been

solely to new capital.
Section III considers the potential

Section VI considers three alternatives to the deficit—financing of

investment incentives. One involves a delay in the introduction of
expensing. A second involves actually increasing the tax on capital income
in conjunction with full expensing, while a third involves a reduction in
the

extent to which expensing is permitted.

The first simulation shows that a time path of increasingly generous
investment incentives can be associated with simultaneous declines in stock
market

values, quite low and, possibly, negative short term interest rates and

fairly large, positive long term interest rates. Such a policy actually
suppresses short—run investment. The second simulation dent'nstrates the
somewhat paradoxical result that given a structure of investment incentives,
increases in capital income tax rates (e.g. ,

corporate

or dividend tax rates)

will generally stimulate, rather than retard, capital formation, while requiring

an immediate decline in wage taxes to avoid running surpluses. Finally, our
third simulation shows that the government, through a policy of partial

expensing, can raise investment and generate a surplus without ever raising

either

tile capital income tax or the labor income tax.

The last section of the paper suxmmrizes ntjor findings and relates these
results to recent economic events.

For new capital the net acquisition cost is 1, the price of new capital,

substitutes in production their net acquisition costs must be identical in
equilibrium; hence, old capital sells for tr,t et less than new capital
because the purchaser of new capital receives tr,.t et from the government,

while the purchaser of old capital receives no tax rebate. Since the value
of old capital depends on the prothct of tr,t et, the price of old capital
falls not only when expensing is increased (and rr,t is positive), but also
when the rate of business profits taxation rises, given an expensing policy.

These equations suffice to describe the relationship of savings and

investment incentives to other tax structures. First, consider the case of

zero expensing (e1 =

=

a).

This assumption produces an econozzy with

period t capital income and wage tax rates of tr,t and

respectively. In

such an econoL7, the return to new capital, capital produced in period t—land
old capital, capital produced prior to period t—l, are taxed at the same effec-

tive

rates in period t and beyond. With zero expensing, there is no discrimina-

tion in favor of newly produced capital; the relative price of new and old capi-

tal

is always unity. Changes in the time path of I

r,t

and

Iw, that satisfy the

government's long run budget constraint (see Auerbach and Kotlikoff, 1983) are
classified,

lowering

in our taxonony, as savings incentives. Section V indicates that

capital income tax rates will typically depress rather than stimulate

long—term

capital formation if such savings incentives are deficit—financed.

The essential feature of investnrnt incentives can be illustrated most
simply by assuming
rate , zero

zero wage taxation, per.nent capital income taxation at

expensing prior to period t—l, and a pernent move to 100

percent expensing starting at time t—l.

Under these assumptions, all

tax

terms drop out of equation (6); the young of period t—l and all future
generations

face zero

young and future

effective taxation over their lifetirrs. While the

generations nominally pay

business

profits taxes in

their

old age, the reduced cost of purchasing capital when they are young exactly

offsets the present value cost of this taxation. Stated differently, new
generations

starting in year t—l are subsidized when young to purchase

—11—

capital and taxed when old on its return. The subsidy and tax cancel in
present value and the young face no net taxation on their capital investments.

While this new tax structure effectively exets the young of period
t—l and all future generations from paying any taxes over their lifetime,

elderly individuals at time t—l

suffer

a capital loss on their assets equal

to Ki t According to (7) , the consumption of the elderly falls by this

amount; the Ki tr

capital loss constitutes a one time wealth tax on the

old of period t—l. Considering the tax treatment of the young and old
together,

this new tax system is equivalent to the government's collecting

This

the special feature of investment incentives,
namely that they tax initial holdings of wealth. A second irortant feature
exanle highlights

is that they lower the effective tax on the return to savi.ng of young and

future generations. With 100 percent expensing the effective capital incot
tax rate is reduced to zero.

denstrate that the rveaent to full expensing in

presence of a proportional income tax produces a consumption tax,

or

eq.uivalently-, a wage tax plus a one time wealth tax on the elderly where the

wage and one time wealth tax rates are identical. This tax structure
corresponds exactly to that proposed by Hall and Rabushka (1982) in their

recent flat tax proposal. While the Hall—Rabushka proposal generates a
genuine consumption tax, other proposals such as unlimited use of IRAs and
abolition of the corporate income tax, which are billed as "providing consumption tax treatment" of income flows, produce wage tax rather than con—
suraption tax structures. In the case of unlimited IRAs, the initial owners

of capital can place all their holdings of capital into IRAs, receiving tax
deductions that equal in present value the taxes on withdrawals of principal

plus interest from the IRA. Thus the owners of existing capital face no
effective taxation on the conversion of their capital into consumption
expenditures; a policy of unlimited IRAs effectively

income tax component of the income tax with no

eliminates the capital

effective wealth tax on

existing assets. For those with no initial assets, wage taxation and consumption taxation are structurally equivalent. Hence, a policy of unlimited
IRAs and

a zero corporate income tax replicates a wage tax. It does not

replicate

a consumption tax.

Another complication of the foregoing analysis is that the actual U.S. tax
law permits existing assets to qualify for new tax incentives, if they are sold

by the existing owner. For example, the 1981 Accelerated Cost Recovery System
(ACRS) does not explicitly exclude old capital, though application of ACRS

—13—

to

old capital requires a change in the capital's ownership. It is important

to distinguish here between direct capital ownership and indirect ownership

through firms. One normally thinks of life cycle transfers of assets as
being accomplished by the sale of shares in finns owning capital goods.
This is not considered to be a change in the ownership of the capital goods
themselves, which would require the sale of the actual goods by one firm to

another. Thus, we may imagine that in selling off their assets the elderly
can choose whether to transfer ownership of assets or ownership of firms,
with the only resulting difference being whether sale of the capital goods

themselves is recognized for tax purposes. We refer to the former case as

of assets.

tal at

III. Recapture Taxes and the Exclusion of'

Old Capital

From the Accelerated Cost Recovery System
The extent to which recapture taxation inhibits turnover is an empirical question that depends on the size of changes in investment incentives.
The set of' new incentives considered here are those provided by the

Accelerated Cost ecovery Systea. Though the business tax provisions have
again been altered by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of l92,
the more recent legislation represents a small change from previous law, and
introduces no additional incentives to turn over old assets to obtain the

tax treatment accorded new assets. This is because the l9d2 Act maintains
current

depreciat ion allowances indefinitely.

The 1981 Act introduced a sharp increase in the present value of depre-

ciation allowances relative to
in

those previously available. Like an increase

the expensing fraction restricted to newly produced capital, accelerated

depreciation can lower the value of
provisions

existing

assets. While the new ACRS

are available to owners of old assets provided they sell

(turnover) their old assets, the sale of these assets generates recapture taxes
that

my exceed the net increase in depreciation allowances. To the extent that

such a sale is attractive, the fraction of the loss in value that the seller
recoups

represents a. "leakage" to old capital of the investment incentive

embodied

in CRS.

The recapture treatment of structures and equipment differs and they

must be considered separately. For structures, the seller must pay a tax on
the difference between sale price and depreciated basis, with the difference
between sale price and hypothetical straight—line basis taxed as a capital
gain, and the additional difference between straight—line basis and actual

—16--

basis (positive if a more accelerated depreciation method has been used),

taxed as ordinary incon. Thus, the total tax due on an asset with a one
dollar sale price is:

(8) R = c (1 —
BSL)

+

(SL

—

where c is the capital gains tax rate (equal to .28 for corporations) and I is
the inco tax rate (Jt6 for corporations). The basis B and hypothetical
straight—line basis B51 depend on the age of the asset, which deteraines the

extent to which depreciation alliances have been taken, and the asset's initial
purchase price. If a t year old asset physically depreciates at a constant

exponential rate , and the inflation rate is it,

in return for this recapture tax, the potential seller receives one dollar
times the number of units of' capital (at replacement cost) for his asset rather

than the value it would coranand with its old depreciation allowances. Since
investors imist be indifferent between old and new capital, the price of an asset

not turned over must reflect the difference in depreciation allowances afforded
new capital and those available to old capital.

the earlier equation (5) derived for the case of expensing. Here, the expensing

fraction e is replaced by the more general expression of the difference between
the values of prospective depreciation allowances on new and old assets.
Using

(9) and

(10), we may now ask whether the turnover tax Rt exceeds the

increase in sale price (i —

qt)

that the seller can obtain by opting for recap-

ture. In addition, letting Z0 be the present value of depreciation allowances
for

a new asset purchased under pre—1981 law, we my calculate what fraction of

the capital loss generated by ACRS is avoided when turnover is profitable.

Our calculations require parameter values for ô and iT, the depreciation

purposes of

we set 6 =

We assume an after tax nodnal

rate of .10 and that prior tax depreciaticn followed the 150 percent declining balance forraila with optimal straight—line switch—over, based
discount

on a tax lifeline of 35 years. These estimates of both actual and tax
depreciation

are meant to correspond roughly to a typical structures invest-

ment (see Jorgenson and Sullivan, 1982). We assume assets are purchased six

into the tax year and that tax payments are made annually, midway
through the tax year as well. Post—1981 tax depreciation follows the 175
months

percent declining balance fornula with optimal straight—line switch—over,

based on a tax lifetii of 15 years, as dictated by ACES.

—18—

Table 1 shows the results of calculations of qt and Rt for structures
purchased

years before the enactment of PLCRB. The last co1nmn

shows the

of the capital loss caused by ACRS (equal to 12.1 cents per dollar

of capital) that could be recouped by turnover. Though turnover would not
be

useful for structures alreac' conlete1y written off, it appears advan-

tageous for the bulk

of

structures. Because of growth and

depreciation, a

large fraction of the structure's capital stock is represented by assets

purchased in recent years. For those assets, recoupment is substantial.
For structures purchased within four years of the 1981 tax change, turnover

allows a recouent of over half the capital loss caused by ACR. This
figure is 85 percent for assets only one year old. Overall, if we assume a
constant real rate of annual investment growth

of

3 percent, this recoupment

froLl turnover amoui-its to about one third of the capital loss on.structures,

given our parameterization. This result also suggests that, absent transaction costs, a large fraction of the structures capital stock ought to have

been turned over upon the enactment of ACRb. However, such costs are clearly
substantial for certain assets, such as

factories

and bui1din, cox1ementary

to other productive factors in a compan''s production process. However, one
would expect to see a greater turnover activity in commercial structures, such
as apartment buildings and office buildings.

We turn next to the recapture treatment of equipment. Here, the analysis
is complicated by the fact that most equipment qualifies for the investment tax

credit, but only if the asset is new. The law greatly restricts the ability of
an investor in used property to obtain the LTC. Moreover, the credit obtained
by the original purchaser is also subject to recapture if the number of years

the asset has been held is less than the miniim number of years required to
qualify for such a credit. For example, equipment purchased before 1961 needed

a tax lifetime of at least seven years to qualify for the full 10 percent

credit. Assets with lifetimes of between five and seven years received only a
6—2/3 percent credit, and those with lifetimes between three and five years

received a 3—1/3 percent credit. If an asset with a lifetime exceeding seven
years were sold after, say, six years, the seller would have to repay one—third
of the original credit received; if the sale were after four years, two—thirds of
the original credit would be repaid, and so on.
A second difference in recapture treatment of equipment is that the entire

differential between sale price and basis is taxed as ordinary incon, unless
sale price exceeds initial purchase price, in which case the gain on purchase

price is taxed as a capital gain. These two differences in the recapture treatment of equipment make turnover less attractive than in the case of structures.
As long as the sale price of the asset is less than original purchase
price, the total recapture tax on one dollar of equipment aged t is

for an asset that depreciates at a

rate of .12 and under old law was written off over a tax lifetime of ten years

The value of P is .839, and the inflation rate and discunt rates are, as above,

set at .08 and .10. As the results show, the prospective seller would always
lose by turning assets over on resale. Thus, owners of equipment can escape
none of the capital loss induced by the liberalization of depreciation allowances

for new capital goods. This loss is described by equation (12) and equals 10.5
cents of capital (rrasured at replacement cost).
Thus no equipment, but a substantial fraction of structures, could gain by

being brought under ACRS. In the case of structures, a 1are fraction of the
capital loss induced by AORS could be avoided in this way. However, the presence of transaction costs of unknown magnitude rkes it difficult to know how

mch of this turnover would take place. We may place upper and lower bounds on
the size of the capital loss induced by the introduction of ACRS. With no turn—
over, the loss equals approxiiately 10.5 cents per dollar of existing equipnnt

This result is only a rough calculation, and ignores the actual heterogen-

eity of the capital stock. Moreover, in the presence of adjustment costs (see
below), the prices of all capital goods, including old ones, y rise with a

IV. The

Simulation Model and Its Parameters

The Auerbach—Kotljkoff sinulation model calculates the equilibrium growth
path of an econonr consisting of government, household, and production sectors.

The life cycle version of the model used in this study incorporates expensing of

new capital and costs of adjusting the level of the capital stock. In addition
to expensing, the government's policy instruments include capital income, con-

sumption, and wage taxes, the level of government consumption, and the choice of
a deficit policy.

The household sector consists of fifty—five overlapping generations, with

the total population growing at a constant rate. The fifty—five period life
span corresponds roughly to the life span of an adult. In each generation there
is a single, representative individual, and generations differ only with respect

to their opportunity sets. The production sector is characterized by fir rx—
imizing the present value of their profits by choosing both annual levels of
labor input and annual rates of investment.
Each household chooses life cycle labor supply and consumption by maxi—

mizin an interteiorally separable CES utility function (Auerbach, Kotlikoff,
and Skinner, l983) with a constant static elasticity of substitution between
consuraption and leisure at a point in tiiae and a constant interteiaporal elasti-

city of substitution between consumption at different points in time, leisure at

different points in time, and consuntion and leisure at different points in
time. The simulation presented below incorporates a one percent population
growth rate, a static elasticity of substitution of .8, and an interteniporal

elasticity of substitution of .25. These elasticities are suggested by recent

eirical studies of saving and labor supply.5
The production function used here is Cobb—Douglas, ith capital's income
share equal to twenty—five percent. The costs associated with investment are

This

budget constraint requires

receipts be sufficient to pay

the present value of expensing deductions, and the value of existinb government

debt. The assumption that government debt (surplus) per capita cannot grow

infinitely large is sufficient to generate this constraint on the tine path of
government policies.

The constraint implies that government policies are necessarily inter-

dependent. A corollary is that certain deficit policies are not feasible. For
example, the government cannot permanently change its expensing policy and per-

manently meet the consequent change in its receipts by simply altering its issue

of debt. Such a policy would lead, over the long term, to either an infinite
debt or an infinite surplus per capita. The probability that the change in the
present value of tax receipts exactly equals the present value loss in revenues

from changes in expensing is zero. hence, to meet its budget constraints, the
government rmist eventually raise or lower a tax instrument or its level of con-

sumption in response to chanes in its expensing policy. The next section indicates that for certain expensing policies the government need never raise any
tax rate and, indeed, must lower tax rates at some point in the future to bring

—26—

government finances into long term balance. Investment incentives that require
no increases in current or future tax rates or reductions in current or future
government consumption are described here as self—financing.

No single comparison of policies that do and don't discriminate against old
capital can meaningfully summarize all differences in economic growth paths
associated with investment versus savings incentives; the government's inter—

to these incentives in order to maintain a present value equality bet-

on debt). The differences in capital formation arising from the implementation

are shown by the solid lines in Figures 3 an 4,

shown by the dotted lines. The effects of the implicit wealth tax on the original owners of capital is evident in both diagrams. The utility of older tran—
sition cohorts is decreased, and capital accumulation enhanced by the reduction
in their consumption.

The five year delay in allowing tax rates to rise again leads to a lower
long—run capital stock, but to a imich smaller degree. The reason for this is
that the deficits created by the policy during its first five years are imich

snaller. The long—run level of debt to capital is just 2.13 percent, compared
to 13.8 percent in the case of the first siinjlation. In fact, the long run

1981, which

again in 1985 and 1986.6 The problem

with policies of this kind is that they

induce capital losses gradually over the phase—in period. The awareness of

potential investors of such future losses discouras investment in the short
run, defeating the entire purpose of the legislation. This can be seen in the
next

simulation, which measures

the effects of a five—year phase—in of expensing

deficits, with the expensing fraction rising linearly from .2 in the

transition year to 1 in the fifth. Deficits are avoided by the adjustrcent

A more successful way

of

avoiding deficits recognizes that investment

incentives can often be achieved by raising rather than lowering capital income

taxes. Recall that under a policy of full expensing that is effectively
restricted

to new capital the effective tax rate on capital income is zero.

While the return on savin is not taxed at the margin, the increase in the statutory capital income tax rate increases the implicit wealth tax on existing
capital. This reduces the consumption of wealth holders, permitting an expan-

sion of

national saving and investment. In addition, the extra revenue from the

capital income tax allows the government to lower other taxes. Starting from an
initial

steady state with full expensing and a 30 percent income tax, raising

the capital income tax rate to 50 percent allows an immediate drop in the wage

tax rate to 26.5

percent

(falling eventually to 21.6 percent) and an eventual

increase in capital per person of 34.6 percent.
Finally,

requiring

investment incentives may be self—financing in the long run,

no current or future increase in statutory tax rates to achieve a rre

capital intensive long run steady state with no debt. As an exale, from an
initial steady state with no expensing consider a policy of moving directly to
50 percent fractional expensing, with the income tax held constant at 30 percent
for twenty years; while there are short run deficits, the expansion of the
income tax base over time raises revenue sufficient to retire this debt.

Indeed, in the twentieth year the debt—capital ratio is —.36 percent. This surplus permits a slight decrease in the income tax thereafter (to avoid an
expanding surplus), to 29.2 percent in the twenty—first year and 29.0 percent in

the long run. The per capita capital stock increases by 25.9 percent in the
long run.

Part of the explanation of this result is that, while taxes on capital
income and, eventually, labor income decline, existing capital owners face

—39—

increased implicit wealth taxation under this same policy. Their welfare
declines,

thus distinguishing this policy from those offered by the "free lunch"

theorists. A second aspect of this policy is that the econorr has shifted to a
more efficient tax structure, substituting lump sum taxes on initial wealth
holders for distortionary income taxes on current and future generations. These
efficiency gains also provide economic resources to "cut taxes and raise
revenues."

While this policy of fractional expensing eventually leads to surpluses and

tax rate reductions, a policy of full expensing (discussed at the beginning of
-tne previous section) does not have this feature, indicating the presence of

nonlinearities in the functions determining the ecouon's behavior. One such
nonlinearity is associated with the well—known result that the excess burden of

a tax rises at a rate proportional to the square of the tax rate itself. Thus,
the initial reduction in the effective tax rate on saving induced by a policy of
50 percent expensing does proportionally more to reduce the distortion of
savings behavior than does a policy of nxving froia 50 percent to full expensing.

_140...

VII. Su.mmary

The key difference between savings and investment incentives in closed eco—
nomies is the applicability of these incentives to old as well as new capital.
Investment incentives discriminate against old capital; savings incentives do

not. This discrimination reduces the market value of old capital and, there-

fore, the economic resources of owners of the existing capital stock. The
reductions in the resources and welfare of initial wealth holders under investment policies are essential]- identical to those arising from a one time wealth
tax.

In life cycle economies, the remaining resources of the elderly are held
primarily

in form of non—human as

tax generated by

investment

opposed to human wealth.

The effective wealth

incentives falls, therefore, most heavily on the

elderly. For a given time path of goverrunent consumption and given character-

istics of

tastes

and technolor, extra taxes on

the currently

elderly imply off-

setting receipts of resources by young and future generations. In life cycle
economies, the elderly have a greater marginal propensity to consume than the
young because of their shorter life expectancies; future generations obviously

have zero current marginal propensities to consume. Hence, the intergenerational redistribution of resources away from the elderly, arising from investment

incentives, leads to a major reduction in the econo's current consumption.
The reduction in the consumption of the elderly effectively finances the
"crowding in" of investment.

For certain ranges of investment policy instruments, the long term tax
revenues arising from the increase in capital intensity are sufficient to

finance the short run loss in revenue from these incentives. Hence, there is a

range of investment incentives that are self—financing. In general, deficits

—41—

associated with investment incentives are less injurious to capital forization

than

those associated with incentives.
In contrast to investment incentives, savings incentives such as permanent

reductions in the taxation of profits at the corporate level typically redis-

tribute towards rather than away from the elderly. The impetus to current con—
suxnption arising from this redistribution ——the incone effect ——

higher after tax rate of return. The net impact of savings incentives on

capital formation

depends on the use of deficits to finance these incentives.

As demonstrated here, deficit—financed reductions in capital income tax rates
can sharply lower national capital formation.
The policy most conducive to capital accuimlation involves sirmaltaneousJy

increasing investment incentives and capital incone tax rates. Such a policy

caüd eliminate deficits, raise the after tax return to narinal saving, and
produce income and substitution effects that both operate in the direction of

stiilating

capital formation.
