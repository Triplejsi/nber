Self-Employment: More may not be better
David G. Blanchflower
NBER Working Paper No. 10286
February 2004
JEL No. J4
ABSTRACT
I present information on self-employment from seventy countries. Self-employment rates are
generally down across the OECD. The main exceptions are the UK, and New Zealand. The
probability of being self-employed across the OECD is higher for men and for older workers
compared with younger workers. In Europe the probabilities are lower the more educated an
individual is, while the opposite is true in the US. Some groups of immigrants have higher rates of
self-employment than the indigenous population, others do not. Capital constraints appear to bind
especially tightly in the US for firms owned by minorities and women: the low rates of selfemployment of blacks and Hispanics in the US appears in part to be driven by liquidity constraints.
There is evidence that liquidity constraints bite in other countries including the UK, Finland,
Australia, Canada and Sweden.
It does seem likely that people have an unrealistically rosy view of what it is like to be running their
own business rather than staying with the comparative security of being an employee. A surprisingly
high proportion of employees say they would prefer to be self-employed. Despite the fact that very
high proportions of employees say they would like to set up their own business the reality is
something else. The evidence presented her suggests that people may well be able to judge what is
in their own best interests - that is why they remain as employees. The self-employed work under
a lot of pressure, report that they find their work stressful and that they come home from work
exhausted. Further, they report being constantly under strain, that they lose sleep over worry and
place more weight on work than they do on leisure. However, they are especially likely to say they
have control over their lives as well as being highly satisfied with their lives.

I first started working on self-employment in 1988. I always thought it was an interesting topic,
not least because Andrew Oswald and I came up with what we thought was a great title – ‘What
makes an entrepreneur?’. Nobody else seemed to care much about understanding the make-up of
the elusive entrepreneur despite the fact that he or she is central to the core theories all
economists teach. That first paper was extremely difficult to publish at a major journal: it went
through numerous revisions and size changes and was rejected summarily. It was eventually
published in long form in the Journal of Labor Economics in 1998. The field was thin then – the
only American labor economists to my knowledge who were working in the area were George
Borjas and David Evans. I recall the editor Fran Blau saying to us that it was time the paper was
published as even in its working paper form it had generated a fairly substantial published
literature. There was a ten year time lag from the time we first started working on it to when it
was eventually published, which even for economics is unusually long. It is in the top three of
my most favourite Blanchflower and Oswald papers – of which there have been at least a
hundred I believe in one form or another. I am pleased to say though that ‘What Makes an
Entrepreneur’ does seem to have been quite influential - according to the Social Science
Citations Index, as of November 2003 it had been cited a creditable 70 times. The National
Bureau of Economic Research has now even started an Entrepreneurship group led by Josh
Lerner. The study of self-employment appears, at long last, to have come of age.
In this paper I extend work first published in Labour Economics in 2000. I will also introduce
new evidence on the stresses and strains and pressures that the self-employed face, particularly
when they have employees. I present macro evidence across 30 OECD countries alongside
evidence from micro-surveys on seventy countries drawn from both rich and poor countries,
from the developed and the developing world, on over five million individuals.1 The main
comparisons I draw, however, are between the United States and European countries in general
and the European Union in particular. I make use of data from the Outgoing Rotation Group
files of the Current Population Survey2 (ORG) and the General Social Survey (GSS) for the
United States along with multiple country data drawn from the World Values Survey (WVS)3,
the Eurobarometer Surveys (EBS)4 and the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP).5

The World Values Survey series is designed to enable a cross-national comparison of values and norms on a wide
variety of topics and to monitor changes in values and attitudes across the globe. This data collection consists of
responses from World Values Survey, 1981-1983 (ICPSR #9309) and World Values Survey, 1981-1984 and 19901993 (ICPSR #6160), along with data gathered during 1995-1997. Over 60 surveys representing more than 50
countries participated in the 1995-1997 study. For details of the World Values Survey see codebook ICPSR#2790

These latter three survey series have the advantage that they collect individual level data at
different points of time across many countries using identical sample designs and questionnaires.
For example, the EBS surveys collects data for the European Union in each member country at
least twice a year6 while the ISSP collects data annually: the WVS has had three sweeps.
In the first section I review the literature. In section two I examine trends in self-employment by
country using both aggregated and disaggregated data for many countries but with special
emphasis on comparisons between the USA and Europe. I present evidence on the determinants
of self-employment by country – including by time, sector, age, race, gender, immigrant status
and level of education. In section three I look at the evidence first presented in Blanchflower,
Oswald and Stutzer (2001) that there is a huge unfilled demand to be self-employed by those
working as employees. Section four examines the reasons why that might be using data from the
fifteen member countries of the EU and the United States. I replicate the well known finding
that the self-employed are more satisfied with their jobs than is true of employees. This is true
across most OECD countries – the main exceptions are Austria, Finland and Greece. I find that,
in comparison with employees, the self-employed are also more satisfied with their pay, the type
of work they do and like the fact that they have short commuting times. The paper distinguishes
a number of less desirable aspects of being self-employed which do not appear to have been
quantified previously. The results help to explain why so many of those express a desire to
become self-employed are thwarted in that desire, not least of which is the difficulty in obtaining

The International Social Survey Program (ISSP) is a continuing, annual program across countries that brings
together pre-existing, social science projects and coordinates research goals, thereby adding a cross- national
perspective to the individual, national studies. It first started in the early 1980s when the organizations running
preexisting surveys – the German ALLBUS Surveys, the US General Social Surveys, the Australian Social Survey
and the British Social Attitudes Survey agreed to 1) jointly develop topical modules dealing with important areas of
social science, 2) field the modules as a fifteen-minute supplement to the regular national surveys (or a special
survey if necessary), 3) include an extensive common core of background variables, and 4) make the data available
to the social science community as soon as possible. Since 1984, ISSP has grown to 38 nations - Australia, Austria,
Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain,
Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland,
Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Uruguay,
USA, Venezuela. In addition, East Germany was added to the German sample upon reunification. Other nations
have replicated particular modules without being ISSP members (e.g. Poland, in 1987, and Switzerland, in 1987 and
1993). See www.issp.org.

In all European Union Member Countries, for each Eurobarometer, samples are drawn among the national
population, aged 15 and over. The regular sample size is 1000 respondents per country except the United Kingdom
(1000 for Great Britain and 300 for Northern Ireland and Luxembourg (300 until the late eighties, subsequently 500
or 600). They have included Greece since Autumn 1980, Portugal and Spain since Autumn 1985, and the former
German Democratic Republic from Autumn 1990 onwards (additional East German sample of 1000 respondents).
In addition, an autonomous standard Eurobarometer on selected sets of questions was established in Norway (1000)
in Autumn 1991 and in Finland (1000) in Spring 1993. Austria (1000) and Sweden (500) first joined in Autumn
1994. In Spring 1995, the complete survey series was expanded to the new European Union member countries
Finland, Sweden and Austria. Iceland (600) first participated in Spring 2003. The EU also ran a Central and
Eastern Eurobarometer (CEEB) survey between 1990 and 1997 with a sample size of about 1000 respondents per
country - see Blanchflower (2001) for details. In October 2001, the European Commission launched a new series of
surveys in the 13 countries that are applying for European Union membership under the heading Candidate
Eurobarometer. The first such survey was carried out in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey and in the southern part of Cyprus.

capital. The self-employed work exceptionally long hours. The self-employed in general, and
the most successful ones with employees – the job makers - in particular, report that, in
comparison with those who do wage work they are less satisfied with the long hours they have to
work. The self-employed are especially likely to report that they find their work stressful; they
come home from work exhausted; that their job limits their family time; that they felt too tired
after work to enjoy the things they would like to do in the home; that their partner/family gets fed
up with the pressure of their job; that they had lost sleep over worry; felt unhappy and depressed;
were constantly under strain and worked under a great deal of pressure. However, they appear to
be satisfied in their lives, prefer work over leisure and feel they have free choice and control over
their lives. The availability of new European data means that I am able to distinguish between
the satisfaction levels of the most successful self-employed who have one or more employees –
the job makers - and the self-employed without any employed who have created a job only for
themselves. The size of any effects for the self-employed with employees are generally more
pronounced than for the self-employed with no employees. The patterns are very similar across
countries. In section five I present my conclusions. More does not appear to be better!
1. Literature Review7
There has been a growing body of empirical work on entrepreneurship in general and selfemployment in particular.8 Microeconometric work includes Fuchs (1982), Borjas and Bronars
(1989), Evans and Jovanovic (1989), Evans and Leighton (1989), Fairlie (1999), Fairlie and
Meyer (1996, 1998), Reardon (1998), Lofstrom (2002), Bruce and Schuetze (2003) and Black et
al (2001) for the United States; Rees and Shah (1986), Pickles and O’Farrell (1987),
Blanchflower and Oswald (1990, 1998a), Blanchflower and Freeman (1994), Meager (1992),
Taylor (1996), and Robson (1998a, 1998b) for the UK; DeWit and van Winden (1990) for the
Netherlands; Alba-Ramirez (1994) and Carrasco (1999) for Spain; Bernhardt (1994), Schuetze
(2000), Zhengxi et al (1999, 2000), Arai (1997), Lentz and Laband (1990), and Kuhn and
Schuetze (2001) for Canada; Laferrere and McEntee (1995) for France; Vijverberg (1995) for

several theoretical papers including Kihlstrom and Laffonte (1979), Kanbur (1982), Croate and
Tennyson (1992), and Holmes and Schmitz (1990), plus a few papers that draw comparisons
across countries such as Schuetze (1998) for Canada and the U.S., Blanchflower and Meyer
(1994) for Australia and the U.S., Alba-Ramirez (1994) for Spain and the United States, and
Blanchflower (2000) and Acs and Evans (1994) for many countries.
One possible impediment to entrepreneurship is lack of capital. In work based on U.S. micro

data at the level of the individual, Evans and Leighton (1989), and Evans and Jovanovic (1989),
have argued formally that entrepreneurs face liquidity constraints. The authors use the National
Longitudinal Survey of Young Men for 1966-1981, and the Current Population Surveys for
1968-1987. The key test shows that, all else remaining equal, people with greater family assets
are more likely to switch to self-employment from employment. This asset variable enters probit
equations significantly and with a quadratic form. Although Evans and his collaborators draw
the conclusion that capital and liquidity constraints bind, this claim is open to the objection that
other interpretations of their correlation are feasible. One possibility, for example, is that
inherently acquisitive individuals both start their own businesses and forego leisure to build up
family assets. In this case, there would be a correlation between family assets and movement
into self-employment even if capital constraints did not exist. A second possibility is that the
correlation between family assets and the movement to self-employment arises because children
tend to inherit family firms. Parker (2002) provides some much needed theory on whether banks
ration enterprises.
Blanchflower and Oswald (1998a), find that the probability of self-employment depends
positively upon whether the individual ever received an inheritance or gift. This emerges from
British data, the National Child Development Study; a birth cohort of children born in March
1958 who have been followed for the whole of their lives. Second, when directly questioned in
interview surveys, potential entrepreneurs say that raising capital is their principal problem.
Third, the self-employed report higher levels of job and life satisfaction than employees. Fourth,
psychological test scores play only a small role. Burke et al (2000, 2002) replicate the findings
using the same data source. Work by Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and Rosen (1994a, 1994b), drew
similar conclusions using different methods on U.S. data. The work of Black et al. (1996) for the
UK, discovers an apparently powerful role for house prices (through its impact on equity
withdrawal) in affecting the supply of small new firms. Cowling and Mitchell (1997), find a
similar result. Again this is suggestive of capital constraints. Lindh and Ohlsson (1994) adopt
the Blanchflower-Oswald procedure and provide complementary evidence for Sweden. Finally,
Bernhardt (1994), in a study for Canada, using data from the 1981 Social Change in Canada
Project also found evidence that capital constraints appear to bind.
Using the 1991 French Household Survey of Financial Assets, Laferrere and McEntee (1995),
examined the determinants of self-employment using data on intergenerational transfers of
wealth, education, informal human capital and a range of demographic variables. They also find
evidence of the importance played by the family in the decision to enter self-employment.
Intergenerational transfers of wealth, familial transfers of human capital and the structure of the
family were found to be determining factors in the decision to move from wage work into
entrepreneurship. Broussard et al. (2003) found that the self-employed in the USA have between
.2 and .4 more children compared to the non-self-employed. The authors argue that having more
children can increase the likelihood that an inside family member will be a good match at
running the business. One might also think that the existence of family businesses, which are
particularly prevalent in farming, is a further way to overcome the existence of capital
constraints. Transfers of firms within families will help to preserve the status quo and will work
against the interests of blacks in particular who do not have as strong a history of business
ownership as indigenous whites. Analogously, Hout and Rosen (2000) found that the offspring
of self-employed fathers are more likely than others to become self-employed and argued that the

5
historically low rates of self-employment among African-Americans and Latinos may contribute
to their low contemporary rates. Studies undertaken for the Australian and Canadian labor
markets by Kidd (1993) and Bernhardt (1994) also reported that the availability of capital is a
significant barrier to self-employment. Johansson (2000) in a study for Finland used a unique
data file drawn from the Longitudinal Employment Statistics, compiled by Statistics Finland. It
covers the years 1987-1995 and includes, in principle, every individual who has had a job in
Finland during the period – it is the population. A sample of just over 100,000 workers aged 1865 was randomly selected and they were followed from 1987-1994. Johannsson’s empirical
strategy was to model the probability of an individual entering self-employment. The main
result from the study was that a higher level of wealth significantly increased the probability that
an individual made a transition from wage-employment to self-employment.
A continuing puzzle in the literature has been why the self-employment rate of black males is
one third of that of white males and has remained roughly constant since 1910. Fairlie and
Meyer (2000), rule out a number of explanations for the difference. They found that trends in
demographic factors, including the Great Migration and the racial convergence in education
levels “did not have large effects on the trend in the racial gap in self-employment” (page 662).
They also found that an initial lack of business experience “cannot explain the current low levels
of black self-employment”. Further they found that “the lack of traditions in business enterprise
among blacks that resulted from slavery cannot explain a substantial part of the current racial gap
in self-employment” (page 664). Fairlie (1999) in a recent paper has shown that a considerable
part of the explanation of the differences between the African-American and white selfemployment rate can be attributed to discrimination. Tim Bates (1989), finds strong supporting
evidence that racial differences in levels of financial capital have significant effects upon racial
patterns in business failure rates. Robert Fairlie (1998) found that the black exit rate from selfemployment is twice as high as that of whites. Fairlie and Meyer (1998) found that immigration
had no statistically significant impact at all on black self-employment. In a subsequent paper
Fairlie and Meyer (2004), found that self-employed immigrants did displace self-employed
native non-blacks. They found that immigration has a large negative effect on the probability of
self-employment among native non-blacks, although, surprisingly, they found that immigrants
increase native self-employment earnings.
Blanchflower, Levine and Zimmerman (2004) found evidence that minority-owned firms are
discriminated against in the market for credit. There is a market failure in the credit market – the
commercial banks in the US appear to be the major source of the credit constraints faced by
minorities. The data they use are drawn from a representative sample of small firms with less
than 500 employees in the US in both 1993 and 1998. The data are especially relevant as they
were collected by the regulator – the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the
Small Business Administration. The main findings from the study were as follows.
1.1. Minority-owned firms were particularly likely to report that they did not apply for a loan
over the preceding three years because they feared the loan would be denied.
1.2. When minority-owned firms did apply for a loan their loan requests were substantially more
likely to be denied than other groups, even after accounting for differences in factors like size

6
and credit history. A comparable loan filed by a firm owned by blacks is twice as likely to be
denied than if the application was filed by a white owner.
1.3. No evidence of race differences was found with the use of credit cards. This is
corroborative evidence that the results on loan applications are not being driven by unobserved
variables. In contrast to a small business loan where the bank normally interviews the applicant,
with credit cards the approval process is highly automated and the race of the applicant is
normally unknown to the lending institution.
1.4. When minority-owned firms did receive a loan they would have to pay higher interest rates
on the loan than was true of comparable white-owned firms. Blacks receive a double whammy –
even if they get through the tough hurdle of having their loans approved they would have to pay
a one percentage point higher interest rate than if they had been white and filed the same loan
application.
1.5. A greater share of minority-owned firms complained that the availability of credit was, or
had been, the most important issue likely to confront the firm in the past, present and future.
1.6. There is no evidence that the level of discrimination in the market for credit has diminished
during the 1990s.
There has been relatively little work on how institutional factors influence self-employment.
Such work that has been conducted includes examining the role of minimum wage legislation
(Blau, 1987), immigration policy (Borjas and Bronars, 1989), and retirement policies (Quinn,
1980). Studies by Long (1982), and Blau (1987), and more recently by Schuetze (1998), have
considered the role of taxes. In an interesting study pooling individual level data for the U.S. and
Canada from the Current Population Study and the Survey of Consumer Finances, respectively,
Schuetze (1998), finds that increase in income taxes have large and positive effects on the male
self-employment rate. He found that a 30 percent increase in taxes generated a rise of 0.9 to 2
percentage points rise in the male self-employment rate in Canada compared with a rise of 0.8 to
1.4 percentage point rise in the U.S. over 1994 levels.
A number of other studies have also considered the cyclical aspects of self-employment and in
particular how movements of self-employment are correlated with movements in unemployment.
Meager (1992), provides a useful summary of much of this work. Evans and Leighton (1989)
found that white men who are unemployed are nearly twice as likely as wage workers to enter
self-employment. Bogenhold and Staber (1991), also find evidence that unemployment and selfemployment are positively correlated. In Blanchflower and Oswald (1990), we found a strong
negative relationship between regional unemployment and self-employment for the period 19831989 in the UK using a pooled cross-section time-series data set. In Blanchflower and Oswald
(1998a), we confirmed this result, finding that the log of the county unemployment rate entered
negatively in a cross-section self-employment probits for young people age 23 in 1981, and for
the same people aged 33 in 1991. Taylor (1996), confirmed this result using data from the
British Household Panel Study of 1991, showing that the probability of being self-employed
rises when expected self-employment earnings increase relative to employee earnings, i.e., when
unemployment is low. Acs and Evans (1994), found evidence from an analysis of a panel of

7
countries that the unemployment rate entered negatively in a fixed effect and random effects
formulation. However, Schuetze (1998), found that, for the U.S. and Canada that the elasticity
of the male self-employment rate with respect to the unemployment rate was considerably
smaller than he found for the effect from taxes discussed above. The elasticity of selfemployment associated with the unemployment rate is about 0.1 in both countries using 1994
figures. A decrease of 5 percentage points in the unemployment rate in the U.S. (about the same
decline occurred from 1983-1989) leads to about a 1 percentage point decrease in selfemployment. Bruce and Schuetze (2003) find that, relative to continued wage employment, brief
spells in self-employment do not increase—and probably actually reduce—average hourly
earnings upon return to wage employment. They also find that those who experience selfemployment have difficulty returning to the wage sector. However, these consequences are
small compared to similar experiences in unemployment. In Blanchflower (2000), I found that
there is generally a negative relationship between the self-employment rate and the
unemployment rate. It does seem then that there is some disagreement in the literature on
whether high unemployment acts to discourage self-employment because of the lack of available
opportunities or encourage it because of the lack of viable alternatives. In that paper I was
unable to any evidence that increases in the self-employment rate raised the real growth rate of
the economy; in fact there was even evidence of the opposite. More does not appear to be better.
In Blanchflower (2001) I found that on a variety of attitudinal measures, Eastern Europeans said
they were less contented than their western European counterparts. The strongest support for the
changes that have occurred in Eastern Europe is to be found among men, the young, the most
educated, students, and the employed and particularly the self-employed. Support for market
reforms was particularly low amongst the unemployed who were found to be particularly
unhappy on two well-being measures.
There is, however, a good deal of agreement in the literature on the micro-economic correlates of
self-employment (see Aronson, 1991), on this. It should be pointed out that most of this work is
based on U.S. data and, as we shall see below, the results do not necessarily carry through
elsewhere. Subject to that caveat it appears that self-employment rises with age, is higher
amongst men than women and higher among whites than blacks. The least educated have the
highest probability of being self-employed in Europe, however, as we will show below the
reverse is the case in the US where increases in educational attainment are generally found to
lead to increases in the probability of being self-employed. The more children in the family, the
higher likelihood of (male) self-employment. Workers in agriculture, retailing, real estate and
construction are especially likely to be self-employed.
2. Self-employment rates by country
Self-employment rates tend to vary a great deal across both countries and time. It is difficult to
obtain comparable estimates by country because of differences in the way self-employment is
measured (for a discussion see Blanchflower, 2000). The most definitive source of data is that
provided by the OECD.9 Figure 1 provides detailed yearly plots for the 24 countries for which
we have a long time run of data for the overall and non-agricultural rates – in all cases the former
plot is above the latter because of the high rates of self-employment in agriculture everywhere. I

do have some concerns about the reliability of these data: especially worrying are the
unexplained big jumps between successive years for several countries – Germany, Finland,
Portugal, Norway and Sweden are the most obvious examples. At this time we have no better
source: in subsequent sections I turn to using more consistent micro-data obtained from
comparable surveys taken across multiple countries. For ease of reference Table 1 provides
estimates of the self-employment rates for selected years from 1956-2002. If data for the exact
years are not available then those from the closest available year are reported. Table 1a provides
overall results for both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors while Table 1b provides
estimates for the non-agricultural sector. We exclude agriculture here as it is different – selfemployment rates have generally been high there and declining, a point we return to
momentarily. A number of facts stand out from the table
2.1. There is considerable variation in self-employment (SE) rates across countries. The latest
rates available, mostly in 2002, vary from a low of 5.9% in Luxembourg to a high of 37.8% in
Greece.
2.2. SE rates are generally higher in poorer countries such as Greece, Turkey, Mexico, Korea
and Portugal.
2.3. SE rates appear to have declined over time in most countries. The major exception is the
UK which has experienced growth from 7.7% in 1956 to 11.5% in 2002. The Czech Republic
has seen an increase over the short time frame since the fall of the Berlin wall.
2.4. Non-agricultural rates of SE are everywhere lower than the overall rates due to the high
levels of SE in agriculture. Non-agricultural rates have increased in Australia, Belgium, the
Czech Republic, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic,
Sweden and the UK.
Data for intervening years are also available so Table 2 examines further the issue of whether
there have been declines in the self-employment rate over time. There are approximately 1000
observations across 30 countries over the period 1956-2002. Three separate regressions are run
for each country with the dependent variable the overall SE rate, the non-agricultural rate and the
agricultural rate. Included in each regression is a linear time trend and a constant only. The
table reports whether the time trend is significant (positive (+) or negative (-)) or not: a 0 implies
that the coefficient on the time trend is insignificantly different from zero. Conclusions from this
table are as follows.
2.5. There is a preponderance of negatives in the first column of Table 2 confirming the earlier
findings from the means that overall self-employment rates are in decline in most countries
except the UK and the Czech Republic. There is now evidence in this table that New Zealand
has seen an increase.
2.6. There is evidence that non-agricultural rates have gone up significantly in thirteen countries
- Australia, Finland, Eire, Iceland, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic,
Sweden, Spain and the UK.

9
2.7. There is evidence that Non-agricultural rates have declined significantly in fourteen
countries – Austria, Germany, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and the USA.
2.8. Agricultural rates increased significantly over time only in the Czech Republic, the UK,
Greece, Hungary, Korea, Portugal and the Slovak Republic.
Table 3 reports a pooled cross-country regression using the data from Table 2. Results are
provided overall, for non-agriculture and agriculture; equations include a time trend with and
without a lagged dependent variable alongside a full set of country dummies. Overall the trend
is down in all six columns, whether or not a lagged dependent variable is included. When the lag
is in there, and it seems it should be given the very high t-statistics in all three columns, as might
be expected, the magnitude of the country effects declines. Looking at columns 2 and 4, Greece,
Italy, Korea, Mexico and Turkey have relatively large positive coefficients; Canada, Denmark,
Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden have the largest negative coefficients.
It is natural to look a little more closely at micro-data at the level of the individual to determine
what characteristics the self-employed possess. To set the scene, Table 4a presents the simplest
kind of self-employment probit equation across member countries of the European Union.
Weights are imposed so that the results are representative of the EU as a whole. The data file
used is the Mannheim Eurobarometer Trend File, 1970-1999 (ICPSR#3384) which combines
seventy different Eurobarometer Surveys into comparable format. Data on self-employment are
only available for the years 1975-1999. I report estimated derivatives from these models that can
be interpreted as the effect on the probability of being self-employed of an infinitesimal change
in each independent continuous variable and the discrete change in the probability for dummy
variables. Here the dependent variable is set to one if the person reports themselves as selfemployed and set to zero if they are a worker: agricultural workers are excluded. The sample
size is approximately 385,000 people from each of the member countries of the EU: separate
results are also reported for Northern Ireland and East and West Germany. The omitted base
category is France. The first equation includes country dummies and no personal controls along
with a time trend that has a significant negative coefficient. When personal controls are included
the significance of the time trend disappears. Self-employment is higher for men and for those
with less education. The probability of being self-employed in the EU rises with age and reaches
a maximum at age 76. The country dummies provide a snapshot view of the international pattern
of self-employment. Greece and Italy are at the top of the rankings, for instance, while the
Netherlands and Denmark are at the bottom. The probability of being self-employed is lower
among highly educated workers. The t-statistic on years of schooling is well-determined at 8.99
in the first column of Table 2. Compositional variables on full-time/part-time matter. As is
known, a variable for being male enters strongly positively in a self-employment equation. Age
also enters positively, with a small standard error.
Table 4b provides comparable evidence from the United States using data from the Outgoing
Rotation Group (ORG) files of the Current Population Survey. This Table is taken from
Blanchflower and Wainwright (2004). Sample size is large: there are a total of over 4 million
data points. Separate equations are reported for the period 1979-1991 and for 1992-2002. The
reason for this is there was a sample redesign in 1992 and a number of the equations were

10
changed – in particular the questions on schooling. Controls include a full set of state, year and
industry dummies along with controls for gender, schooling and race. A full set of industry
dummies are included but the three largest industry dummies are reported – Construction, Repair
Services and Personal Services. The coefficients that are reported are in relation to the excluded
category Agricultural Services which is the industry with the highest rate of self-employment;
hence all of the other industry dummies have larger negative coefficients. Column 3 includes
controls for country of origin if the individual was not born in the US: column 4 is restricted to
the US born. The sample for the final two columns is for 1994-2002 as these are the only years
where immigration status information is available. The main findings are.
2.9. Self-employment is higher among men than women.
2.10. The gender gap has narrowed over time from 4.7% in the first period to 2.7% in the
second.
2.11. Minorities have lower self-employment rates than whites – blacks for example have rates
4.5 percentage points lower than whites in the second period while Hispanics are 3.7 percentage
points lower.
2.12. The gap between black and white rates have remained constant whereas the gap for
Hispanics has widened from 2.9% to 3.7%.
2.13. The race effects are broadly similar when the sample excludes individuals born outside the
United States in column 4.
2.14. As in the EU the probability of being self-employed rises with age to a maximum and then
declines. In the first period it reaches a maximum at age 61 and at age 54 in the later period,
which is a lot lower than was found for the EU.
2.15. Self-employment is especially prevalent in Construction, Repair Services, Personal
Services and Agriculture.
2.16. In contrast to the EU, the probability of being self-employed is related positively to an
individual’s schooling. In column 1 years of schooling enters positively. In the second column
years of schooling is replaced with a set of fifteen levels of education dummies, which also show
the same result. The excluded category is ‘Less than first grade’.

2.17. There is a downward trend in self-employment in the USA. This can be seen from the two
sets of year dummies included in both equation 1 and 2 that are shown below. Year dummies are
included rather than a time trend simply because of the size of the data files concerned and the
fact that there are not consistent education controls available through time. The left side below
takes the year dummies from column 1 of Table 4b and the right side takes the year dummies
from column 2 of the Table. In both cases there is a steady decline in the coefficients. The
effect is more pronounced in the later period. Of course, the two sets of data should be
considered as cumulative; 1992 is simply rescaled to zero and then later years compared to it.
1992 itself is likely more than three percentage points lower than the 1979 rate.

There is a good deal of evidence that the trend in self-employment is downward in many OECD
countries. Evidence from a series of GDP growth equations presented in Blanchflower (2000)
did not suggest that the self-employment rate increased the real growth rate of the economy; in
fact there was even evidence of the opposite. I have seen no convincing evidence of any kind in
the literature that either increasing the proportion of the workforce that is self-employed, or
having a high level of self-employment produces any positive macroeconomic benefits. Such
evidence that does exist suggests quite the reverse. More is not better.
2.18. Governments on the other hand frequently see self-employment as a route out of poverty
and disadvantage and for this reason offer aid and assistance for small businesses. The

12
justification for these actions are usually that this will help promote invention and innovation and
thus create new jobs; new firms may also raise the degree of competition in the product market
bringing gains to consumers; greater self-employment may also go along with increased selfreliance and well being. Unfortunately economists have little evidence on whether these
hypothetical benefits exist in practice. Even the widely held view, best expressed in Birch
(1979), that small firms disproportionately are the creators of jobs has been challenged by Davis,
Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) who have undertaken the most careful empirical analysis of the
job creation process to date . They argue persuasively that “conventional wisdom about the job
creating powers of small businesses rests on statistical fallacies and misleading interpretations of
the data” (1996, p.57). Indeed, they go on to conclude the following.
“It is true that small businesses create jobs in disproportionate numbers. That is
gross job creation rates are substantially higher for smaller plants and firms. But
because gross job destruction rates are also substantially higher for smaller plants
and firms, they destroy jobs in disproportionate numbers. We found no strong
systematic relationship between employer size and net job growth rates….Finally,
and in contrast to the lack of a clear-cut relationship between employer size and
job growth,…(we found)..clear evidence that large employers offer greater job
durability” (1996, p.170).
Despite the lack of evidence of the benefits of having a larger small business sector and/or
having a higher proportion of the workforce self-employed many governments around the world
provide subsidies to individuals set-up and to remain in business. In Australia, Britain and
France, for example, government programs provide transfer payments to the unemployed while
they attempt to start businesses.10 Many countries, including the UK and the United States, have
government programs to provide loans to small businesses, and even exempt small businesses
from certain regulations and taxes. In the U.S. similar programs are being started for
unemployment insurance and welfare recipients.
Kosanovich et al (2001) report that programs to help the unemployed move into selfemployment are highly effective in raising the self-employment rate of participants, although it
remains unclear how cost effective the programs are. Between 1995 and 1999 seven states Delaware, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania participated in a
Self-Employment Assistance Program (SEA).
To participate in an SEA program,
Unemployment Insurance (UI) claimants must pass through a profiling process that was designed
to assess the likelihood of their reemployment within the 26 weeks of benefit eligibility or,
conversely, the likelihood of their exhaustion of benefits prior to reemployment. By statute,
SEA programs may not serve more than 5% of a state’s UI claimants. Only New York has ever
included more than 1% of its UI claimants in its SEA program. Kosanovich et al (2001) in a
study undertaken on behalf of the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Workforce Security,
surveyed 1176 participants in the SEA programs in the states of Maine, New Jersey and New
York and found that the respondents achieved high rates of self-employment. Compared to
eligible non-participants, individuals who participated in the SEA program in these states were
19 times more likely to have been self-employed at any time post-unemployment. For
10

13
participants 25-36 months from initial program enrollment, 58% in New York and 60% in New
Jersey were either self-employed or both self-employed and wage/salary employed. In Maine,
over 40% of participants were either self-employed or both self-employed and wage/salary
employed at 25-36 months since their program enrollment. higher rates of reemployment in any
position, whether self-employed or wage/salary employed, than non-participants. The study
found that program participants were four times more likely than non-participants to have
obtained employment of any kind (either wage/salary or self-employment). These programs
appear to be effective in helping the unemployed move into self-employment and stay there; but
there is no evidence that suggests they have any impact on macroeconomic performance.
2.19. Black, Holtz-Eakin and Rosenthal (2001) show that there is considerable regional
dispersion in self-employment rates. Below are self-employment rates (%) they constructed
(2001 Table 1) for males, 25 to 64 Years Olds taken from the 1990 Census of Population.

The authors show that the variation of self-employment rates across areas cannot be attributed to
differences among the metropolitan areas in the individual attributes—age, education, immigrant
status, marital status, and so on—of their populations. Neither can it be explained simply on the
basis of location— there are not simply good places and bad places for the self-employed of all
races. Instead, they find that variation in self-employment and earnings is positively linked to
minority-specific measures of economic scale—the purchasing power that minorities bring to the
metropolitan-area market. This result is robust to a variety of specifications and controls for
various alternative MSA attributes that might otherwise account for the finding, including
minority and white MSA unemployment rates and the degree of MSA minority segregation. Our
work provides support for the idea that the economic scale of the minority market affects the
ability of metropolitan areas to sustain minority entrepreneurs. Moreover, the authors argue that
this conclusion “is consistent with models of self- employment in which consumer
discrimination against minority entrepreneurs dampens minority self-employment opportunities”
(2001, p.270). Their findings also appear to be consistent with a model where discrimination
comes from other sources including the banks or even trade unions (see Ashenfelter, 1972).
The likelihood is that both spatial variation in self-employment and the return to selfemployment among minorities will be impacted by the existence of affirmative action programs
run by most large local municipalities – examples are San Francisco, New York, Chicago,
Baltimore, St. Louis and Jacksonville, Florida. There is a growing body of evidence that does

14
exist that the affirmative action programs that have been introduced in the US to counter
discrimination against minorities and women-owned firms (MWBEs) especially in US
construction do have large micro-economic effects. These programs fall into two types a)
Federal Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program which sets a goal of 10% of
spending to DBEs for entities that take federal dollars b) city, state and local governments own
programs. Blanchflower and Wainwright (2004) provide evidence from a series of natural
experiments that show that once the programs are removed – which often occurs by court
injunction following the Supreme Court’s finding in the case of Croson vs, City of Richmond in
1989 – utilization of MWBEs drops precipitously.11 These programs appear to be effective in
countering the effects of discrimination against MWBEs; there is no evidence that they have any
impact on macroeconomic performance.
2.20. There is considerable variation in the self-employment rate of immigrants. Blanchflower
and Wainwright took the significant country dummies from Table 4b, translated them into
percentage differences by taking antilogs and deducting one, because the dependent variable is in
logs. Their findings are presented below – they are all in comparison to the United States.
Countries with coefficients that are not significantly different from the US are not reported.

In a series of recent court decisions where I was the defendant’s expert the constitutionality of the federal DBE
program has been upheld both at the level of the district court and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals (Sherbrooke Turf
vs, State of Minnesota DOT; Gross Seed vs. State of Nebraska DOT). Following Croson there were many lower
court decisions in the 1990s which declared state and local programs to be unconstitutional. A recent decision by
the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Concrete Works of Colorado Inc. vs. City of Denver, where I was
also a testifying expert for the defendant, overturned the District Court’s ruling that the program was
unconstitutional. The Appeals Court decision was itself appealed to the US Supreme Court which refused to grant a
writ of certiorari, despite the fact that the case had been distributed for conference six times. Unusually, Justice

Lofstrom (2002) uses data from the 1980 and 1990 U.S. Censuses to study labor market
assimilation of self-employed immigrants. Separate earnings functions for the self-employed
and wage/salary workers are estimated. Self-employed immigrants were found to do
substantially better in the labor market than wage/salary immigrants. Earnings of self-employed
immigrants re predicted to converge with natives' wage/salary earnings at about age 30 and
natives' self-employed earnings at about age 40. Including the self-employed in the sample
reduces the immigrant-native earnings gap by, on average, 14%. Bates (1999) argues that selfemployment is often a form of underemployment among Asian immigrants. Crowding of Asian
immigrants into traditional fields such as small-scale retailing, Bates argues, has often been
interpreted as evidence of success and/or expanding. In light of the low returns earned by Asian
immigrants in traditional businesses and the observed outflow from these fields over time, Bates
argues that such crowding is rooted in “blocked-mobility considerations” (p. 181).
2.21. Individuals emigrating to the US from most member countries of both the EU and the
OECD have higher self-employment rates than the US born. The main exceptions are Australia,
Germany, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland. Mexico has a significantly lower self-employment rate.
As we noted above there is a literature in the US explaining differences between the AfricanAmerican and white self-employment see for example Fairlie (1999), Bates (1989), Fairlie and
Meyer (1998, 2004). There is also a literature suggesting that there are considerable differences
in self-employment rates of immigrants based on their country of origin. Yuengert (1995) finds
that immigrants to the USA from countries with higher self-employment rates are more likely to
enter self-employment. In a follow-up analysis though Fairlie and Meyer (1996) found that this
effect was not statistically significant. Also, he finds that immigrants are more concentrated in
high tax states where self-employment with its greater opportunities for tax avoidance is more
prevalent. In contrast to claims made in Borjas (1986), Yuengert finds no evidence that selfemployment rates are higher in cities with higher concentrations of immigrants.
Clark and Drinkwater (2000) in their study of self-employment among ethnic minorities in
England and Wales found that ethnic minorities who live in areas which have a high percentage
of their own group are less likely to be self-employed. They found that those with poor language
skills and more recent immigrants had lower self-employment probabilities. Borooah and Hart
(1999) used data from the British 1991 Census to examine why so many Indians, but so few
black Caribbeans, in Britain are self-employed? Over 20% of economically active Indian males,
but only 8% of economically active black Caribbean males, were self-employed. The reluctance
of black men to become self-employed was, as this study suggested, due to two factors. First,
they were, relative to whites and Indians, “ethnically disinclined” to enter business – this stunted
their desire to be self-employed. Second, they did not possess, relative to whites and Indians, the
attributes that were positively related to entering business – this impaired their ability to be selfemployed. The authors estimated that 58% of the observed lack (relative to Indians) of selfemployed black males was due to ethnic disinclination and 42% was due to attribute

16
disadvantage. Of course this result begs the question of why Caribbean men were disinclined to
be self-employed. Clark and Drinkwater (2000) also reported that, based on the 1991 Census of
Population, self-employment rates for blacks in England and Wales were 5.8% compared with
26.6% for Chinese and 12.3% for whites and 14.6% for non-whites.12 In contrast, in a study for
Australia Kidd (1993) found that self-employment rates of the Australian born sample was
21.3% compared with 19.9% for migrants. Migrant self-employment rates were higher for
individuals from non-English speaking (NES) countries (22.0%) than from English speaking
(ES) countries (17.2%).
In a recent paper Andersson and Wadensjö, (2003) examined how self-employed immigrants had
assimilated in Denmark and Sweden. They reported that immigrants self-employment rates in
both countries were above those of the indigenous populations. In 1999, according to the
authors, 4.1% of Swedish workers are self-employed compared to 6.4% in Denmark. These
numbers are well below the OECD numbers reported in Table 1a of 9.5% and 8.3% respectively,
for which I have no explanation. The self-employed in both Sweden and Denmark are
concentrated in construction (9.2% and 9.9% respectively); retailing (12.7% and 18.1%) and real
estate and rental services (12.9% and 16.4%). Holding constant a variety of characteristics
including schooling, age and gender Andersson and Wadensjö find that non-Western immigrants
in both Denmark and Sweden are over-represented among the self-employed. They also found
self-employed immigrants had lower incomes than immigrant employees. The differences are
large, especially in Sweden. They concluded that immigrants in the two countries were becoming
self-employed because they had difficulties obtaining wage employment.
3. “Who wants to be self-employed”
It is sometimes argued that nations differ in their underlying entrepreneurial spirit. The United
States, in particular, is often singled out as a country with an inherently large number of people
who are keen to start firms. Europe, it is sometimes asserted, lacks entrepreneurial individuals.
While some politicians argue that Eastern Europe is in particular need of people who wish to run
their own businesses, there is especially little information about the potential supply of
entrepreneurs in that region of the world. Few economists have attempted to measure
entrepreneurial spirit across countries. In Blanchflower, Oswald and Stutzer (202) we created an
international league table of what might be thought of as the simplest measure of entrepreneurial
drive. The paper measured entrepreneurial spirit by using the question:
“Suppose you were working and could choose between different kinds of jobs. Which would you
prefer: being an employee or being self-employed?”
It is possible to think of many objections to this wording (from an economist’s point of view it is
vague on the constraints under which people are assumed to make their hypothetical choice), but
it has the merit of simplicity. Moreover, because the wording is chosen deliberately to be
consistent across countries, and our concern is to produce international comparisons, some of the
question’s drawbacks are reduced. If there are biases in the question’s wording, those biases
12

Using data from the Fourth National Survey of Ethnic Minorities conducted in 1993/4 Clark and Drinkwater
found self-employment rates to be especially high, among both men and women, for Pakistanis, Indians and African
Asians.

17
may be similar across nations and thus still give useful cross-country information. The question
was asked in an International Social Survey Programme data set. Information on more than
twenty countries is available over a period spanning 1997 and 1998. For the analysis reported
here, the sample size is approximately 25,000 individuals across 23 nations. Blanchflower
(2000) and OECD (2000) look at related international self-employment statistics for OECD
countries. But information on self-employment preferences in the 1990s has until now been
sparse.
Table 5 contains the mean responses by country. To fix ideas, it is clear that an economist would
not expect to find a large proportion of people answering in favor of self-employment. The vast
majority of workers (almost nine out of ten, in most nations) in the industrial countries are
conventional employees: they draw a pay check from a firm that someone else began. There is
one small exception. In heavily agricultural sectors, and nations, the numbers of self-employed
individuals tend to be higher; but the western democracies now have only tiny percentages of
their population in agriculture. Moreover, the western nations have sophisticated banking
systems, stock markets, and networks of venture capitalists. On the face of it there are many
opportunities to borrow to back a good idea for a business start-up. At the turn of the 21st
century, therefore, an economist would not expect many of those who covet a chance to be selfemployed to be thwarted in that wish. However, the patterns in the answers are not what would
have been predicted. There are apparently many frustrated entrepreneurs.
First, Table 5 reveals that there is a strikingly large latent desire to be in charge of one’s own
business. Even in countries at the bottom of the table, a quarter of the population say they would
prefer to be self-employed. This compares to an actual proportion of self-employed people in
most countries of around 10%-15% of the labor force. It is interesting to wonder why so few
individuals manage to translate their preferences into action. Lack of start-up capital may be
one explanation, and we return to that possibility later.
Objections are certainly possible. These subjects are asked a hypothetical question, in an
unrealistic setting, and their answers may therefore be unrepresentative of the truth in a practical
or implementable sense. The harshest of critics might argue that one could imagine a question
‘if you were working and could choose between different kinds of jobs, would you prefer to be in
your current job or be a top soccer player?’, and that the answers to this might also be highly
positive and yet not tell us very much except that people would like to earn as much as David
Beckham. There is probably something to this criticism. Nevertheless, our aim is to capture the
inherent level of entrepreneurial interest, not merely the level that is currently converted into
activity. It would be extreme to view these survey answers as containing no useful food for
thought. Moreover, while winning Wimbledon is beyond the scope of almost anyone, it is not
clear that the same can be said of being self-employed. Almost anyone could be self-employed
if they wished (perhaps on a low income); that is not true of the tennis question. And as the
same question is asked everywhere, the relative responses should be meaningful.
The most compelling case, however, emerges from the structure of the answers. The numbers in
Table 5 are so large, and information in the area sufficiently sparse, that we think it unwise to
disregard answers of this type. In the late 1990s, in these countries, the data suggest that there is
considerable interest in the idea of being self-employed. Second, and intriguingly, there is

18
marked variation by nation. The proportions of people who favor self-employment vary from
80% to less than 30%. Poland, Portugal and the USA top the league table. It appears that
approximately three-quarters of these nations’ citizens would like to manage their own business
rather than work for a company as a regular employee. These proportions seem extraordinarily
large, but we simply report them. Bottom of the league table of latent entrepreneurship come
Russia, Denmark and Norway; Sweden is close to the bottom of the rankings. In these nations,
roughly 30% of citizens say they are interested in being self-employed. Three developing
countries are in the data set but, because of their reliance on agriculture, we choose not to include
the numbers. They are Bangladesh, Cyprus and the Philippines. Self-employment and expressed
desire for it are both high in the three countries, but we are not confident that it is possible to
make valid comparisons with the more heavily industrial nations in the rest of the sample.
Table 6 contains information that would have been less easily anticipated. It estimates for men
and women, from a sample of employees, the probability of an individual saying they would
prefer to be self-employed rather than work for somebody else. First, age now enters Table 3’s
probit equation strongly negatively. In other words it has the opposite sign from that for age in
the being-self-employed equation of Tables 4a for the EU and 4b for the USA. This means that,
despite the fact that older people are more likely to be self-employed, it is younger people who
say they would prefer to be self-employed. A potential explanation is a kind of dynamic one. As
they age, people simply flow into self-employment. Hence those who say when young that this
is their aim gradually achieve that aim. But this cannot account for the much larger numbers
asserting that self-employment is desirable relative to the small numbers who end up as selfemployed. Second, the structure of the country dummies is not identical to that for actual selfemployment in the previous table. As in the raw cross-tabulations of Table 5, Denmark and
Norway are low in the implied dummy-variable ranking of Table 6. Poland and Portugal are
again high: Sweden and Russia are also low. The notable feature is the contrast between age in
Table 5 and in Tables 4a and 4b. Huge numbers of young workers in these industrial countries
would prefer self-employment (or at least claim that they would). We know this from the fact
that for the young the average numbers in Table 5 are an understatement -- as they are for the full
sample and the age coefficient in the regression is negative -- of the amount of desire to be
entrepreneurial.
Our results cannot be definitive because they rely on what people say they want. Yet they seem
suggestive – leaving it natural to think that in these nations there may be a currently unexploited
supply of entrepreneurial individuals. Young people are apparently particularly constrained to
be workers rather than run their own businesses. If age entered with a zero coefficient in Table
6, we could conclude that entrepreneurship choice was unconstrained by a person’s age. A zero
would signify that older workers preferred self-employment neither more nor less than the
young. But that is not what the data show. As a person becomes older it becomes easier to break
into entrepreneurship.
4. Are People Simply Mistaken to Prefer the Idea of Self-Employment?
Some economists might reason in the following way. One possible explanation for the high
numbers in Tables 5 and 6 is that people are simply mistaken. Perhaps they have an
unrealistically rosy view of what it is like to be running one’s own business rather than have the
comparative security of being an employee. One reason economists are often wary of subjective

19
data is because people are sometimes thought to be unable to judge what will be in their own
interest.13
But Table 7 provides counter evidence. It shows, using the General Social Surveys (GSS) for the
USA from 1972-2002 along with a recent sweep of the Eurobarometer Surveys (EBS) #54.2,
January-February, 2001 (ICPSR#3211), that feelings of job satisfaction are higher among the
self-employed. Both surveys use somewhat different responses to a similar question on job
satisfaction. In the GSS respondents were asked ‘On the whole, how satisfied are you with the
work you do--would you say you are very satisfied, moderately satisfied, a little dissatisfied, or
very dissatisfied?’ and the distribution of responses for employees and the self-employed were as
follows
Very dissatisfied
A little dissatisfied
Moderately satisfied
Very satisfied

In the EBS survey respondents were asked “on the whole, how satisfied are you with your
current job or business? Please use the following scale from 1 to 10, where '1' means that you are
not at all satisfied and '10' means that you are totally satisfied”. The average scores by country

Bruno Frey in private communication suggested that people do make mistakes and are not always able to judge
how much utility will be produced by goods and activites in the future. But, he points out, such a view is
inconsistent with traditional economics. In strict neoclassics, people may make mistakes but correct them very
quickly, so that in equilibrium one can assume that people maximize their utility. One of the fundamental premises
of neoclassic, of course, is that people know well what they want and this underlies the whole neoclassical welfare
economics. See Frey and Stutzer (2003) for more on this.

In all but three countries – Austria, Greece and Finland – the self-employed report higher levels
of job satisfaction than employees. Note also that there are differences and similarities in the
pattern of the coefficients in the first two equations in Table 7 – in the US women are more
satisfied than men but in Europe there is no gender difference. As we shall see below there is
evidence from an earlier EBS sweep of a similar result to the US with women more satisfied than
men. Both in the US and Europe, workers with higher levels of schooling are more satisfied.
Job satisfaction is U-shaped in the USA in age reaching a maximum at age 61 but rises linearly
with age in Europe; the age squared term was never significant and hence was omitted. Note that
in the US blacks and other races are less happy at work than whites: the negative time trend
implies that job satisfaction in the US has been declining over time (See Blanchflower and
Oswald 1999 on this). Blacks are also found to be less happy with their lives in general (see
Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004). An obvious interpretation for such a finding is discrimination.
In Blanchflower and Oswald (1999) a range of job characteristics were introduced in a series of
job satisfaction equations using other EBS data files.14 Workers like to work independently and
in workplaces with high pay and good chances of advancement. They also like to ‘help people’
and to work in healthy rather than unhealthy conditions. The result that people enjoy
independence is well-known to psychology researchers. It is sometimes referred to as an
example of the ‘locus of control’ hypothesis. Spector et al (2001) is a recent paper looking at a
similarly large range of nations. Having a secure job increases job satisfaction: the easier it is to
find a similar job the higher is satisfaction. We also found evidence for the positive impact of
job security on job satisfaction in the US. Evidence was also found in that paper that job
satisfaction is greater in quiet workplaces, ones with no gaseous vapors, ones where workers say
‘no painful or tiring positions’, where employees control the equipment, their work pace, where
they do not have to carry move loads or work at high speed. Working at home appears to be
associated with raised satisfaction for women but not men. The ability to control the temperature
and ventilation is correlated with satisfaction. Employees who identify a health and safety risk at
their workplace are much more likely to say they are dissatisfied. Unsurprisingly, women appear
to value equal opportunities at work. We found no significant evidence that the gender of one’s
boss has an effect on job satisfaction for either men or women. Even when all these job
characteristics were controlled for, the self-employed still reported higher levels of job
satisfaction than the employed.
Table 7 also provides recent evidence from Europe on other aspects of the work environment.15
In the final five columns of the table male were less satisfied than females and satisfaction
increased with age and years of schooling. The pattern of the country coefficients is similar
across columns 2-7 with Greece having the largest negative coefficient in all columns and
14
15

See also Blanchflower and Oswald (2000)

Workers were asked to use the same scale as discussed above for job satisfaction in response to each of the
following questions. 1) And how satisfied are you with your current job or business in terms of earnings? 2) And in
terms of job security? 3) And in terms of the type of work you do? 4) And in terms of the number of hours you
work? 5) And in terms of the time it takes to travel to work?

21
Denmark the largest positive in all cases except in relation to pay. In comparison with
employees, the self-employed in Europe were not only more satisfied with their jobs but they
were also more satisfied with their pay (column 3), the type of work they do (column 5), and the
time they spend traveling to work. They were less satisfied with their hours of work – which are
well known to be longer than those of employees.16 There was no difference between employees
and the self-employed in their views on job security. This contrasts with the findings of Manski
and Straub (2000) for the US who found that self-employed workers in the US see themselves as
facing less job insecurity than do those who work for others.17 Consistent with Manski and
Straub’s findings, in Blanchflower and Oswald (1999) using data from the 1972-1996 General
Social Surveys we found that the self-employed were less likely than employees to think that
they would lose their job in the next 12 months and more likely to say it would be easy for them
to find a job with another employer with approximately the same income and fringe benefits they
currently had.18 Similar results were found when I extended the analysis to 2002 using the most
recent dataset available.19
The finding that the self-employed report higher levels of job satisfaction than employees is a
rather robust finding across the nations on which data are available. This result has been known

Average hours for the self-employed and employees are available on a consistent basis in the 1999 ISSP,

For other work on job security in the United States, that also used the General Social Surveys but does not
explicitly identify the self-employed, see Schmidt (1999).

The exact wording of the questions in the GSS was as follows Q180A – “Thinking about the next 12 months, how
likely do you think it is that you will lose your job or be laid off -- very likely, fairly likely, not too likely, or not at
all likely?” Q180B “About how easy would it be for you to find a job with another employer with approximately
the same income and fringe benefits you now have? Would you say very easy, somewhat easy, or not easy at all?”

19

For both variables ordered logit equations were estimated for the years 1972-2002 using the GSS. In the former
case relating to the probability of losing a job, the controls were time, male, age(-), black(+), Other races (+), years
of education (-) where (-)= significant and negative (+)=significant and positive. Sample size was 13,532. The selfemployment dummy had a coefficient of -.7446 and a t-statistic of 12.08. In the second equation modeling the
probability of finding a job the same list of controls were included: time(+) male(-) age(-) black(-) other race, years
of education(+). Sample size=13,444. The self-employment dummy in the job finding equation had a coefficient of
+.5055 and a t-statistic of 10.08.

22
for a long time in the psychology literature, see, for example, Eden (1975), Katz (1993) and
Weaver and Franz (1992) but is less known in economics. Recent example in economics are
Blanchflower and Oswald (1998, 1999), Blanchflower (2000), Frey and Benz (2002, 2003),
Hundley (2001). In an important paper Frey and Benz (2002) examine job satisfaction data for
the UK, Germany and Switzerland and also find evidence that the self-employed are more
satisfied at work than employees. What is impressive about this paper is that the authors have
panel data over a number of years on the same individuals for both the UK (1991-1999) and
Germany (1984-2000) and show that this result remains even in the presence of people specific
fixed effects (Table 2). Frey and Benz also provide evidence from a ‘natural experiment’ in East
Germany: people who moved into self-employment after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 saw
a large and highly significant jump in their levels of job satisfaction compared to those
experienced by East Germans who worked as employees before and after 1989. These ‘fixed
effects’ and ‘natural experiment’ results are especially convincing that there is something real
going on and the results are not simply being driven by selection. The paper is important as it
makes clear make clear that the direction of causality is clear - self-employment makes people
happy, it is not the reverse direction of causality that it is happy people who decide to become
self-employed.
Benz and Frey (2003) examined data on 23 countries from the International Social Survey
Programme (ISSP) conducted in 1997 and also used by Blanchflower, Oswald and Stutzer
(2001). Benz and Frey conclude that the self-employed are more satisfied with their jobs
because they enjoy ‘greater autonomy and independence’. In a recent paper Hundley (2001)
provides results for the USA which are similar to those of Frey and Benz. His main findings are
that the self-employed are more satisfied because their work provides more autonomy, flexibility
and skill utilization and greater job security. However, our evidence is not consistent with his
finding for the US that the self-employed are more secure in their jobs than the employed. He
concluded that “a sizable portion of the difference in job satisfaction between the self- and
organizationally employed is attributable to factors related to the independence of the selfemployed from the routines and constraints of organizational life”, (p311, 2001). As we will
show below, this greater autonomy and flexibility comes at a cost: self-employment is very
stressful on both the individual and his family: the self-employed come home tired and exhausted
from their labors.
For the first time I am aware of it is possible to distinguish between the satisfaction levels of the
most successful self-employed who have one or more employees and self-employed without any
employed20. Both groups are unique in that they have created jobs for themselves but the former
group are especially interesting as they have created jobs for others – they are the job makers in
our economies. The process by which jobs are created and by which firms are born is little
understood and an obvious area for study. Both of these groups of self-employed are more
satisfied with their jobs than are employees: the effect is greater for those with employees than
for those without. Data are available from a Eurobarometer Survey #44.3OVR, February-April

20

Surprisingly there is little if any published literature on job makers. One exception is Fölster (2000) who looks at
the link between self-employment and employment using Swedish panel data on counties. He finds support for the
notion that increased self-employment has a positive effect on employment.

On average in the EU the self-employed with employees report higher levels of job satisfaction
than do the self-employed without employees; both groups have higher levels of satisfaction than
employees. Exceptions to this general rule are found in Greece and Luxembourg where
employees are the most satisfied and in Germany and Sweden where the self-employed with no
employees have the highest satisfaction.
Table 8 presents evidence on twenty different aspects of an individual’s work environment.
Details of the questions asked are reported in Appendix 1. Each of the equations include
controls for years of schooling, union membership, years of tenure, age, gender and private
sector as well as controls for the two types of self-employment. The findings from these
equations are as follows
4.1. In comparison with employees the self-employed with employees are especially likely to
report that they are satisfied with their job, their pay, using their abilities, being able to take
initiative, the variety of work.
4.2. In comparison with employees the self-employed with employees are especially likely to
report that they are less satisfied with the hours they have to work.
4.3. In comparison with employees the self-employed with employees are especially likely to
report that they find their work stressful; they come home from work exhausted; that their job
limits their family time; that they felt too tired after work to enjoy the things they would like to

24
do in the home; that their partner/family gets fed up with the pressure of their job; that they had
lost sleep over worry; felt unhappy and depressed; were constantly under strain and worked
under a great deal of pressure.
In a related study using data for Canada from the 1994 and 2002 Canadian General Social
Surveys Williams (2003) found that self-employed individuals were significantly less likely than
employees to report poor interpersonal relationships (10% versus 16%), or fear of job loss (8%
versus 14%) as a source of workplace stress21. However, they were slightly more likely than
employees to feel stress as a result of too many hours or too many demands in their work
environment (37% versus 34%). Williams reported that both the self-employed and full-time
workers were significantly more likely to feel the time crunch of too many demands
or hours at work, compared with their employee and part-time counterparts.
4.4. The effects for the self-employed without employees were generally smaller than for the
self-employed with employees but still significantly different from employees.
4.5. The self-employed without employees were less satisfied than employees with their pay, the
amount of work they have and their job security.
4.6. In comparison with the self-employed with employees those without employees were less
likely to report finding their work stressful, coming home from work exhausted; that they felt too
tired after work to enjoy the things they would like to do in the home; unhappy and depressed or
that they worked under a great deal of pressure.
4.7. The self-employed don’t think of themselves as worthless people. They are go-getters!
4.8. Table 9 reports further evidence on the attitudes of the self-employed across countries. The
exact questions asked are reported in Appendix 2. Here I make use of data from the World
Values Surveys (WVS), 1981–1984, 1990–1993, and 1995–1997 as well as from the
Eurobarometer Survey Trend files (EBST), for 1975-1998 and estimate a series of ordered logits.
In column 1 of the Table using data from one sweep of the WVS for 1995 for 45 countries it is
apparent that the self-employed are much more likely to say that they place more weight on work
than they do on leisure – they are motivated individuals. In column 2 of the table, which uses
data on 64 countries and uses all three sweeps of the WVS, the self-employed report that they are
more likely than employees to they have control over their lives. A similar answer is obtained in
column 3 when the sample is expanded to include the retired, students, the unemployed,
housewives and others, including those on military service. The coefficient on the selfemployment dummy remains significantly positive. Groups out of the labor force report that
they are less in control of their lives than the employed. Finally, the last two columns report the
results of estimating life satisfaction equations across 17 European countries. Column 4 contains
235,000 observations and is restricted to workers while column 5 includes the whole population
and has approximately 480,000 observations. The self-employed are especially satisfied with the
lives – significantly more so than employees and the retired, roughly equivalent to the
21

In Canada according to the Labour Force Survey, between 1990 and 1997, self-employment accounted for over
75% of total job growth.

25
satisfaction levels of housewives and student, and much more satisfied with their lives than are
the unemployed22. When these equations are estimated separately by country with the same
controls (results not reported) the self-employment variable is significantly positive in ten
countries: Belgium, Denmark, East Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Northern
Ireland, Portugal, and West Germany. It should be noted, however, that the coefficient on the
self-employment variable was insignificantly different from zero in eight countries: Austria,
Finland, France, Great Britain, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and Sweden.23 Even though the
self-employed find their work environment full of stresses and strains they appear to be satisfied
in their lives, prefer work over leisure and feel they have free choice and control over their lives.
This is impressive evidence across many countries that the self-employed are different.
5. Conclusions
Self-employment rates are generally down across the OECD. The main exceptions are the UK,
and New Zealand. There are strong patterns in the data across countries. The probability of
being self-employed across the OECD is higher for men and for older workers compared with
younger workers. In Europe the probabilities are lower the more educated an individual is, while
the opposite is true in the US. Some groups of immigrants have higher rates of self-employment
than the indigenous population, others do not. Capital constraints appear to bind especially
tightly in the US for firms owned by minorities and women: the low rates of self-employment of
blacks and Hispanics in the US appears in part to be driven by liquidity constraints. There is
evidence that liquidity constraints bite in other countries including the UK, Finland, Australia,
Canada and Sweden.
It does seem likely that people have an unrealistically rosy view of what it is like to be running
their own business rather than staying with the comparative security of being an employee. A
surprisingly high proportion of employees say they would prefer to be self-employed. Despite
the fact that very high proportions of employees say they would like to set up their own business
the reality is something else. The evidence presented her suggests that people may well be able
to judge what is in their own best interests – that is why they remain as employees. The selfemployed work under a lot of pressure, report that they find their work stressful, that they come
home from work exhausted they are constantly under strain and lose sleep over worry they place
more weight on work than they do on leisure, they are especially likely to say they have control
over their lives and report that they are highly satisfied with the lives. Being self-employed is
tough work and appears to require rare talents. Self-employment isn’t for everyone. More
doesn’t seem to be better.

22

For more on life satisfaction and happiness see Blanchflower (2001), Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) and Di
Tella, MacCulloch and Oswald (2001, 2003).

In private communication Matthias Benz reported finding no significant effect for the self-employed in a life
satisfaction equation for Switzerland.
