Motor vehicle mortality has long been cited as one of the principal causes of accidental deaths in the United States accounting for
over one—half of all such deaths (see National Safety Council Reports).
Significantly influencing these statistics is the age of the driver.

While comprising less than 23 percent of the total licensed driver
population, the fifteen to twenty—four year old age group typically
accounts for more than one—third of the fatal motor vehicle accident

statistics.1 For this age group, motor vehicle accidents are also
the leading cause of death.

An important factor also affecting the motor vehicle mortality

rate is the level of alcohol consumption. Alcohol is the single most
important factor yet identified in traffic fatalities (Wailer (1979,

p. 117)]. The age of the driver together with the consumption of
alcohol can prove to be a deadly combination. One of the most
frequently cited factors contributing to the relationship between

youth, alcohol, and mortality rates is the minimum legal purchasing
age of alcohol (MPA).

With the passage of the 26th amendment giving the right to vote
to 18 year olds, came the cry for a reduction in the minimum legal

purchasing age. Prior to 1970, only five states granted individuals
under the age of 21 the right to purchase alcohol publicly. Beginning in September 1970 when Alaska reduced the NPA from 21 to 19 and
continuing to the end of 1975, a reduction in the MPA to 20, 19, or 18
became effective in a total of 25 states.2

—2—
The consequences of such legislation, primarily a higher number
of motor vehicle mortalities for drivers between the ages of 15 to 24,

soon became a concern. Legislation was introduced in many states to
reverse this trend and between 1976 and 1982, 17 states increased the
age of legal drinking.
Various studies (Haiimond (1973), Cucchiaro et al. (1974),

Douglass (1974), Douglass and Filkins (1974), Williams et al.
(1975), Zylman (1975), Barsby and Marshall (1977), Fingerman et al,
(1977), Wagenaar (1981), Cook and Tauchen (1982)) have been under-

taken to examine the effects of changes in the minimum legal purchasing

age on motor vehicle mortalities, ceteris paribus. While most of these
studies have concluded that a lower MPA increases the number of teenage
motor vehicle mortalities (or an increase in the MPA reduces the number
of mortalities) the change in the number of teenage motor vehicle mortalities cannot be attributed to one specific factor, such as the

minimum legal purchasing age, until alternative explanations are ruled

out. Fluctuations in highway safety measures, travel characteristics,
and social

rates.

and economic indicators all may influence the mortality

The unique aspect of this study is that, with the exception of
Cook and Tauchen (1982), it is the first to use data for all states.

In addition, as opposed to the Cook and Tauchen study, which employs
dummy variables to account for differing state and time effects,

study

this

includes a number of state—specific independent variables, in-

cluding the HPA, to explain differences in teenage motor vehicle mor-

tality. By focusing on the impact of a number of policy manipulable
variables a more specified model is generated.

—3—

The objective of this

paper

is to fill the gap left by previous

studies by investigating empirically factors which affect teenage

motor vehicle mortality rates. By utilizing data for the time period 1970 to 1975, multivariate equations are estimated for three
time periods in order to examine and compare the before, inmiediate,

and longer run (one—year) impact of changes In relevant variables
on mortality rates.

Many of these variables used to explain variations in mortality rates in this study result from government regulations, but some

are exogenous to governmental actions By controlling for those
exogenous variables, the research in this paper will provide unbiased estimates of the effectiveness of government regulations.

As such, it will be a valuable tool for government policy makers in
their efforts to reduce motor vehicle mortality rates.

ANALYTICAL FRANEWORK
To study the determinants of motor vehicle mortality it is

assumed that individuals make decisions over two time periods. The
individual is concerned with the present period which he is certain
to survive, and one future period which he will survive with some

probability. His expected utility is given as:

E(U) —

U(C1, A) + (1 — ir) U(C2)

(1)

where E(U) is expected lifetime utility; U(C1, A) is period 1 utility
which depends on period 1 consumption of all other goods except alco-

hol (C1) and the consumption of alcohol in period 1 (A). (1 —

must be incurred to obtain and consume it. Such examples of these costs
are the travel and shopping time required to nurchase alcohol. Therefore a youth must sacrifice scarce time as well as scarce resources to

acquire alcohol. It is plausible that time costs are smaller in states
with a larger number of retail outlets per capita. Moreover, the indirect cost of obtaining alcohol for a person under 21 should be lower

in states where the legal drinking age is 18 as opposed to 21. Throughout this study the term availability is used to account for these indirect costs.

using data for the states of the U.S..

Mortality Production Function
A simple linear production for mortality is represented by:

Da0+a1A+a2H+a3P+u

.

(5)

A is the level of alcohol consumption, H is a vector of highway variables (rural—urban highway mix, highway travel density, gasoline con—
sumption, driver's license age, and vehicle insnection requirement),
F is a vector of social and economic indicators (educational level,

health care, and unemployment) and u is a random error term with the

usual properties. The alcohol demand function depends on the

—6—

following set of variables:

A.b0+b1P+b2C+b31+V

(6)

P is actual price, C is a vector of availability factors (minimum legal
purchasing age, type of state control, number of establishments, border
state price difference and border state age difference), I is personal

income, and v is a random error term with the usual properties. Substituting equation (6) into equation (5) yields estimates of the total
impact of both policy and non—policy variables on teenage motor vehicle

mortality. The reduced form equation actually estimated is:

D=a0+a1b0+a1b1P+a1b2C+a1b31

(7)

+ a2H + a3F + a1u + u

The starting point for the empirical work in this paper is the
interest in the policy manipulable variables; the minimum legal pur—
chasing age, the minimum driving age, the price of liquor and its

availability, etcetera, on teenage motor vehicle mortality. Therefore, the empirical work will provide estimates of the effects of
these variables on teenage motor vehicle mortality, and in particular,

of (a1, b1), l' b2), (a1, b3), a2 and

a3.

EMPIRI CAL IMPLEMENTATION

Equation (7)

is estimated for white males between the ages of

to twenty—four who reside in 49 of the 50 states in the

United States plus the District of Columbia.4 The dependent variable,
the motor vehicle mortality rate, is defined as the number of deaths

per 1,000 population per year for this group in each jurisdiction

(MRWM). The justification for the use of a dependent variable that

is race and sex specific is as follows. Male death rates are much
higher than female death rates and white death rates are much higher

than those of non whites.5 Thus, pooling is inappropriate. In addition, preliminary results revealed significant race differences in
slope coefficients which supported the use of race specific data.6
By concentrating on the white male group factors that affect the exceedingly large mortality rate for this group can be identified.

Although the highest minimum

legal

purchasing age is 21, mortal-

ity data for the 21 to 24 year old age group is included for two rea-

sons. First, it accounts for fatalities that are caused by drfvers
under the age of 21 to those passengers who are in the 21—24 year old

group. Secondly, the effects of other policy manipulable variables
on this older age group can be examined.
The time period chosen is the years 1970 through 1975. During
this period an important change occurred in one of the independent

variables commonly believed to have a significant impact on the motor
vehicle mortality rate for this specific age group. As discussed
earlier, between 1970 and 1975, many States reduced the minimum legal

purchasing age to below 21 for distilled spirits. A majority of these

—8—
changes were concentrated in the years 1972 and 1973 (3 between 1970

and 1971, 21 between 1972 and 1973, and 1 between 1974 and 1975). To
control for the possibility of a difference between the short—run and
longer—run response to changes in the TIPA separate regressions are run

for three time periods: 1970—71, 1972—73, 1974—75 which are termed
Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3, respectively. Period 1 will examine
the effect of the independent variables on mortality rates prior to

NPA law changes; Period 2 will examine the short—run impact; and

Period 3 the longer (one—year or more) impact. The advantage of this
method is that it allows for the possibility of a lagged effect of a

change in the MPA on teenage motor vehicle mortality. Previous
studies have not examined both the short—run and longer—run effects.

With regard to the availability variables, the price variable for
distilled spirits is the retail selling price including tax of a four—

fifth quart of Seagram 7 Crown. This price is selected because Seagram
7 Crown is the leading brand of liquor in the United States, and its

price is commonly used as a standard in the liquor industry.7 The own

price

of liquor is deflated by a state and time—specific cost—of—living

index to obtain the own relative
Interstate

price of this variable (LIQPR). The

price index was developed for the year 1967 by Fuchs, Michael,

and Scott (1979). Cross—sectional price indexes for years other than

as a

The independent variable generally considered and cited as an important determinant of teenage motor vehicle mortality rates is the

minimum

legal

purchasing age. Each state has direct control of the age

at which alcohol can be purchased. Typically, the same minimum purchasing age is imposed on the consumption of liquor, wine, and beer.

However, a few states have two minimum purchasing ages. One is for
distilled spirits and a lower one is imposed on the consumption of

beer and wine. In addition, the maximum alcohol content of beer and

vine Is specified for the lower age group. Typically the alcohol content of beer is limited to 3.2 percent and for wine 14 percent. Since
there is a high correlation between changes in the liquor and beer pur—
chasing

ages, the minimum

age for liquor (ACE) is chosen.

Lewit and Coate (forthcoming) in a study of cigarette consumption
have

pointed out that it Is difficult to define the relevant price

15 —

variable

due to the purchase, by those individuals in a high price area,

of cigarettes in a lower priced border area. This problem presents itself in two ways regarding alcohol consumption. Not only may the price
variable be lower, but the minimum purchasing age may be lower in a

border state. This problem is dealt with via the following method.
The incentive to travel to a lower price and/or age border state

is higher the greater the difference between own once and lower border
state price as well as own age and lower border state age. Increased
travel distance will affect the probability of mortality. To control
for the border phenomenon (out—of—state i,urchases) the difference

between own price and lower border state price and the difference between own state and border state minimum

purchasing

age are obtained.

The difference variables are not available on an individual basis, but

on a state—specific basis. The difference variable will only he rele-

vant for

the percentage of the population that lives within a certain

distance

of a border state. The estimate of the relevant population

is obtained by aggregating the population of counties that border a

age and/or price state. The percentage of

lower

population

the border county

total to the state total is then multiplied by the differ-

ence variables

to obtain weighted price and age differences. The

weighted price difference and weighted age difference are entered as

separate independent variables in the regressions. An increase in the
difference variables should provide an incentive to travel to a border
state.

The variable for the difference between own price and lower
state

border

price is also divided by the state—specific cost—of—living index

— 16 —

to

obtain the relative price difference (APDR). The difference between

the own state age and border state age is denominated in years (AMD).
The availability measures are subject to government regulation.

By including these variables, the effect of government regulation on
teenage motor vehicle mortality can be measured.

The highway measures are for the most part self—explanatory. The
effect of density and the urban—rural driving mix, however is somewhat

complex. To account for urban—rural death rate differences, the ratio
of urban to rural highway mileage is entered as an independent variable

(URR). States which are characterized by a large percentage of rural
highways should have Increased distance to be traveled to places at

which alcohol is available. In addition to the urban—rural mix, rural
and urban densities (MUNHT, RIJRHT) are employed. These densities are

the amount of vehicle miles per respective highway miles. Increased
density is generally expected to increase the probability of an
accident at a given speed and thereby the risk of death [see Peltzman

(1975, p. 710)). Increased density, however, may force the average
speed to be lower and can result in fewer deaths. Rural mortality
rates are typically higher than urban rates for the population as a

whole. The speed limit is not taken into account directly, since
data on vehicle speed are not available on a state specific basis.

inclusion of the three variables (URR, MUNUT, RURUT)

The
vide

should pro—

an indirect estimate of the effects of speed.
The socioeconomic characteristics of youths in each state are

represented by four variables. The first, the state per capita
personal income, is an indication of the adolescent's command

over

— 17 —

resources.

Money income is deflated by the state Consumer Price Incex

to obtain real income (INCR). The number of hospitals with emergency
rooms ner capita (HOSP) serves as a proxy for the availability of

medical resources to an accident victim. A sex and race specific
education variable is entered to account for possible differences in
the ability to read road signs, pay attention to safety and other fac-

tors. The final variable is the state unemployment rate (UN). Though
a higher unemployment rate may reduce the command over resources to
purchase alcohol, gasoline, etcetera, it will also provide more

leisure time available for alcohol consumption and driving. Unemployment could have psychological effects that may lead to increased alcohol consumption.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS

The ordinary least—squares regressions of white male motor vehicle mortality rates for the three time periods are presented in Table 2.

These regressions are unweighted.8 The regressions contain the full
set of Independent varIables that estImate the effect of alcohol avaIlability, highway, and socioeconomic factors on motor vehicle mortality
rate outcomes.

The results pertaining to the minimum legal purchasing age are

strong, A decrease in the minimum legal purchasing age is generally
cited

as the principal cause of increased mortality rates for this

group and has been changed as a direct result of state legislation.
For white males the age variable has the expected negative sign for

all time periods, and reaches a significant level in the third period.
In this period AGE becomes significant at the 1 percent level.

An important implication of the significant sign of the AGE vari-

able for white males in the third period is that a lag exists between
the implementation of the law reducing the MPA and the consequences

thereof. Thus, studies undertaken to examine changes in both consumption and mortality limnediately succeeding an age change may not accu-

rately state the full impact of law changes.

Before estimating the full impact of a change in the minimum
legal purchasing age the significance of the border phenomenon (the

traveling to border states to purchase and/or consume alcohol because

of a difference in the legal drinking age) will be explored. The variable AND, measuring the difference between the own state minimum purchasing age and the border state minimum purchasing age was entered as

an independent variable. The coefficient of the age difference variable (AND) is positive and significant for two of the three time

pe-

riods.

As the results show, the border nroblem (crossing state lines to
obtain alcohol) is clearly relevant with regard to the age effects for

white males. The significance of the value of the border age difference
(AND), indicates that those states.which have on theirborder states
with a lower drinking age can expect to have a higher motor vehicle

mortality rate. If the incentive to search for sources of alcohol requires increased travel distance and results in driving back to the
higher age state while under the influence of alcohol the cost of this
search (in terms of lives) is clearly evident.
The significance of the above results is that it addresses the
issue put forth by both Wagenaar (1981) and Cook and Tauchen (1982)

— 20 —

as to the need to consider the border nroblem.9 The results suggest
that studies which have concentrated on variations in mortality rates

in a single state only after reductions in the MPA may understate the
true cost of such legislation.

The total impact of a change in the minimum legal purchasing

age can now be evaluated. A change in the MPA in one state will
not only increase mortality in the state instituting the law change,

but this change may also affect mortality in the border state. An
important implication of the above is that a rise in the minimum
legal nurchasing age to 21 in all states will significantly reduce

the number of teenage motor vehicle mortalities. The findings of
this paper suggest that an increase in the !PA

to

21 in all states

would result in decrease in the mortality rate of 15—24 year—old

white males by 4 per 100,000 population.10 Thus, it can be approximated that over 700 lives per year would have been saved for this
age—race group.
The results regarding the remaining independent variables are
now discussed.

The coefficients of LIOPR show that the liquor price variable
never has a significant negative impact on mortality. The price differ-

ence variable has the "wrong" sign, but is never significant. These
results may be due to the exclusion of an appropriate price variable
for beer since beer tends to be the most popular alcoholic beverage

for this age group."
The coefficient of the availability measure, NLIS is positive

and significant for two out of the three time periods. A larger

— 21 —

number

of

licenses per capita implies increased access and lowers the

cost of obtainment. While increased access may also require less
travel and a possible lover probability of mortality, the positive

sign of the coefficient of NTIS provides support to the contention
that increased availability of alcohol adds to increases in consumption and mortality.

With regard to the availability measure TYPCON, a dichotomous
variable that equals one if the state Is a license state (privately—
owned liquor stores) and zero If the state is a control state (state

monopoly of liquor stores), the coefficient is significant for white

males in all three time periods. In each time period, however, the
coefficient

has the "wrong" sign.

Additional analysis revealed that when TYPCON

the

was

dropped from

regression equation the license variable (NLIS) was no longer

significant in the second

or third periods. Thus, the impacts of

NLIS must be interpreted with caution.'2
Turning now

to

the highway variables, the effect of gasoline

consumption per capita (GCPC)

on motor vehicle mortality is clearly

evident. The sign of GCPC is positive and significant for all time

periods. A look back at the means of

the mortality rates and gaso-

line

consumption per capita shows the decline in both over time.

This

is attributed to both the higher gasoline prices

in

the

1970's

55 miles

and

the reduction in

the speed limit to a maximum

per hour at the end of 1974

Reports, 1974—1975). The

results

which occurred

(see

of

National Safety Council

indicate

that

the positive effect

of a decline in gasoline consumption has been lower mortality rates.

— 22 —

The

interpretation

of the highway variables reflecting both driving

density (MUNUT, RURUT) and the urban—rural highway mix (URR) is difficult.

The variable RURUT was dropped from the analysis due to a high correla-

tion with MUNHT. Variations in mortality rates for white males, however,
can be explained by the two above variables (MUNHT, URR).

For white

males these highway variables (MUNIIT, URR) are significant five out of

six times. These results show that while increased density may increase
the probability of an accident, and thereby death, the discouragement

of faster driving due to this density appears to dominate. This helps
to explain the persistent excess of rural over urban death rates.

The last two highway variables, DL and INSP, are not significant

in any of the time periods. For the ins'ection variable the negative
sign is consistent with the findings of Fuchs and Leveson (1967, p.

659)

in their analysis of the effectiveness of vehicle inspection in reducing
mortality for all age groups.

The socioeconomic variables (INCR, HOSP, WME, UN) are now

briefly

discussed. The effect of income is not significant for the white male

group. Differences in income do not contribute to differences in mortality rates among states. The variable used as a proxy

for

the availabil-

The

ity of health care (HOSP) varies in sign but is never significant.

unemployment variable (UN) is only significant in the second time

pe-

riod.

The education measure has a significant negative effect in all

time periods. The negative sign of WME is as was expected. Higher
educational levels may imply increased awareness of the dangers associated with drinking and driving.

CONCLUS IONS

The purpose of this study has been to examine the effects of government regulations on the 15 to 24 year old white male motor vehicle

mortality rate. Particular emphasis was placed on the role of alcohol
availability variables such as the minimum legal purchasing age in the
jurisdictions under consideration.

The effects of a change in the MPA is consistent with that found

by previous studies. The findings of this study, however, revealed
that two additional factors must be considered when changing the MPA.
Not only may changes in motor vehicle mortality be subject to a lag,

but as a result of individuals crossing state borders to obtain alcohol in lower !4PA states a higher probai1ity of mortality can be ex-

pected. The implementation of a nationally mandated minimum purchasing age of 21 could significantly reduce the number of teenage

motor vehicle mortalities. However, before such policy decisions are
made the significant role of the highway variables as well as the unexpected results of many of the availability variables must be con-

sidered. Alternative policy changes such as increased enforcement of
drunk driving, stiffer penalties for driving under the influence of
alcohol, or a change in factors that affect the availability of alcohol
(other than the NPA) may achieve the desired results.
The results of this study will serve as a useful reference tool
for policy makers in evaluating the cost and benefits of alternative
decisions in their efforts to reduce teenage motor vehicle mortality.

In all cases the F—statistic calculated on the residuals was not significant. Thus, hoinoscedasticity of the error terms was assumed and
unveighted analysis is appropriate.

This is a 6 tercent reduction in the mortality rate.

Beer and vine tax rates were used as a proxy for price, but were
later dropped from the analysis due to a high correlation with the

liquor price variable. In preliminary work the coefficients of these
variables were not significant.
The positive sign of the liquor price variable may also be due

to substitution effects. Although the variable for beer price was
not significant in any of the regressions both beer and illegal drugs

are substitutes for distilled spirits. A higher price for liquor can
result in a substituion towards beer and illegal drugs. The consumption of beer and drugs impedes the ability to drive and thus may in-

crease the probability of mortality. The unavailability of price data
for illegal drugs, however, does not enable this conclusion to be
confirmed.
