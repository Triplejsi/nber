Crime and the Labor Market

ABSTBACT

Much work on crime has

focussed

on the effect of criminal

sanctions on crime, ignoring (except as a control variable) the effect
of labor market conditions on crime. This study reviews studies of
time series, cross area, and individual evidence pertaining to the effect
of

unnployment and other labor market variables on crime and conpares

the "slrength" of the labor market-crime and the sanctions-crime relations.

It corcludes that there is a labor market-crime link but

link
is not well estimated by existing studies and is weaker than the sanctionscrime link. The rise in crime in recent years does not appear to be
greatly due to the perforrnanoe

CRIME AND ThE LABOR MARKET

'Are

there people really walking around saying there is no
relationship between crime and unemployment? Are we beating a
dead horse here? Is there a unanimous consensus on the subject or
do we have something more to prove?" (Congressman John Conyers,
cited in Unemployment and Crime, Hearings before the Subcommittee
on Crime of the Committee of the Judiciary House of
Representatives, Ninety—fifth Congress, Serial No. 47, p. 90)

The notion that the labor market, through unemployment, is an

important determinant of the crime level has a definite appeal.
Someone with a full—time high—paying job is, most of us believe, less
likely to engage in crime, particularly economic crime, than someone

out of work. After all, iSn't idle time the devil's handmaiden?
Despite the plausibilty of the claim that high unemployment

causes crime, empirical analysis shows at best a moderate link between
unemployment and crime. In some analyses the expected significant

postive relation is found, but in others, it is not. Similarly, some
studies find a significant postive relation between poverty (measured

in various ways) and crime while others do not. While no one would
gainsay a relationship between the labor market and crime, the strength
and magnitude of the link are more subtle and difficult to determine
than one might expect.

This

essay examines modern research on the relation between the

market and crime. While there have been some reviews of the
literature (Gillespie, Witte and Orsogh, Witte and Long) the effect of
labor

the

labor market, especially unemployment, on

crime has not received

the same attention as the effect of criminal sanctions on crime rates

(see National Academy of Sciences Panel on Research on Deterrent and
Incapacitative Effects, 1978, and Philip J. Cooke "Research in Criminal
Deterrance

Laying the Groundwork for the Second Decade"). This

imbalance in the current state of analysis is unfortunate, for it

directs more attention to the 'stick of deterrence than to the
'carrot' of improved employment prospects, despite

the fact that the

underlying behavior presumably depends on both.
The essay begins with a brief review of the economic rationale

for expecting the labor market to influence crime, considers the
various methods used by social scientists to study the expected
relationship, and then turns to the main issue:

the empirical findings

of the various studies. In this review I make an effort to delineate
carefully differences among types of studies in a way which will

hopefully illuminate the meaning of the work and provide suggestions
for additional analyses that may yield
a "unanimous consensus."

What Labor Market — Crime Link Should We Expect?

As a starting point, let us consider briefly the modern
analysis of the economics of crime', which underlies work on the effect
of the labor market as well as on the effect of criminal sanctions on

crime. The modern work is grounded on an individual choice model,
which treats the decision to engage in crime in the same manner as a

decision to engage in any other potential money—making activity. It
postulates that an individual chooses to commit a crime depending on

the expected benefits and costs. The benefit from crime depends on the
chance of success and the money (utility) obtained; the expected cost
depends on the chance of being caught (1 minus the probability of
success) and convicted, the criminal sanctions and the earnings lost as
a result of imprisonment and the time allotted to the criminal

activity. In this framework the labor market is expected to influence
crime through the cost side: workers with high paying jobs will
presumably commit less crime than workers with low paying jobs or the
unemployed because the higher paid face a greater opportunity cost from

crime. Their time is more valuable in legitimate activities and they
risk losing more income if they are incarcerated than lower wage or

unemployed persons. Because crime is risky, moreover, the analysis
directs attention to risk attitudes in the decision, with further

behavioral consequences. Essentially the economic model treats crime
like any other career or activity choice, in which persons respond
positively to the benefits and negatively to the costs of choosing the
activity.

majority of studies have had an

empirical orientation.

Methods of Studi
Social scientists have sought to measure the impact of labor

market conditions on crime using four distinct types of studies, each

relation
of which has advantages and disadvantages for pinning down the
under study:

(1) Time series analyses in which
to the level of unemployment

the crime rate is compared

and related labor market indicators over

time. This is the most direct way to

examine the effect of the

business cycle on crime and thus for answering the question of what

might happen to crime levels if overall job prospects improved.
series analysis does, however,

Time

suffer from a myriad of problems, the

most serious of which is the collinearity of variables (the tendency
for many variables to move together over time, providing little

variation from which to discern the

independent effect of each). It

also suffers from an interpretative problem:

a time series analysis

which shows that crime varies over the business cycle can be
interpreted as indicating that unemployment

crime is inversely related to the percentage nonwhite in an area. At
face value, this implies either that blacks are less likely to be
criminals or that black areas are subject to less crime that white

both highly questionable conclusions in light of other data.

areas ——

(3) Comparisons of individuals who Commit crimes with those
who do not. Analyzing the economic model of crime with data for
individuals has the advantage of focusing on actual decision—makers.
For charateristics of individuals that are relatively fixed (race, sex,

age, education) it provides a useful tool for inferring differences in

crime rates. For variables that change or are potentially controlled
by the individual, however, there are serious inference problems. One
could, for example, interpret the fact that criminals are more likely

to be unemployed than others in two ways: as supporting the claim that
unemployment led the person into crime, or as indicating that the

person was unemployed because he/she planned a crime. The direction of
the causal link is, in the absence of other information, impossible to
determine.

(4) Social experiments, in which the government alters the
labor market opportunities for criminals, as in the Baltimore Living
Insurance for Ex—prisoners Project or the Transitional Aid Research
Project (TARP)2. Conceptually, an appropriate experiment to test the

unemployment —

crime

link is to provide jobs at specified levels of pay

to part of the released prisoner population while letting the other

alternatives, but he/she might commit the crime even if unemployment

were always lower than at present. The analogy here is with a woman
who decides to work one quarter out of the year. When stores put on
many people near Christmas, she rationally chooses to work at that
season,

still

but in the absence of such

seasonal demand for labor, she would

work one quarter a year.

(2) Cross—sectional (ecological) analysis of crime rates and
labor market conditions across geographic areas.

Because crime rates

and other factors vary widely across states or cities, providing
considerable variation in data, many analysts seek to infer the causes
of crime from cross—sectional data. In contrast to time series

analysis, cross—section studies are more likely to reveal "permanent"
responses to crime rates to unemployment than to reflect the timing of
decisions and are generally free from collinearity problems. They,
however, suffer from their own set of inference problems: the
possibility that areas differ in both labor market and crime for

reasons having to do with the unmeasured 'nature' of the area,
producing spurious or hiding true relations; the possibility that
migration of criminals, say from high unemployment to low unemployment

areas may eliminate the link of unemployment to crime in area data,
despite the fact that high unemployment conditions create more
criminals; and the 'ecological correlation' problem

arising from the

difficulty of making inferences about individual behavior from area

Presumably the group with jobs would have a

somewhat different results, requiring a careful assessment of the

of changes in crime on changes in unemployment (Phillips) to
sophisticated time series systems models (Phillips and Ray). All of
the models examine the effect of unemployment rates on crime; some also
examine the effect of labor force participation rates; because of
collinearity with time, only a few also look at other labor market
variables, such as income; three contain deterrence variables whose
impact can be compared to that of unemployment, in terms of
significance or magnitude.
The general finding from these studies is that unemployment
and/or labor participation rates have the expected impact on crime
rates, but that the effect tends to be modest in magnitude, explaining

little if any of the upward trend of crime in the periods studied. The
labor participation rate is often found to have a closer link to crime

than unemployment, suggesting that those who leave the labor force are

the most crime prone. In the few studies which include income
variables, the level of income (interpreted as a measure of gains to
crime) was positively related to crime; while income inequality is also

found to be positively related to crime. The three studies which
included deterrent variables found them to be more closely related to
crime

than were the labor market variables.

To provide a flavor of the time series evidence, I
in

have

graphed

figure 1 the relation between the uniform crime rate and

unemployment rate for the period 1947 to 1980. The crime rate is
dominated by an upward trend but there is a definite cyclical component
related to unemployment which can be seen in the scatter diagram.

A

13

Long, I have made a crude tabulation of the results of these studies,
dividing the findings into four categories: Those with strong
(statistically significant) effects in the expected direction; those
with weak (insignificant) effects in the expected direction; and those

with strong and weak effects in the opposite direction. The results
for unemployment (or labor force participation), for income variables
viewed as measures of the incentive to commit crime and as the
incentive to choose legitimate work, and criminal sanctions, are given
in Table 2 in terms of the number of studies fitting into each

category. Because analysts usually estimate more than one equation,
with somewhat different results, the categorization is rough, based on

an overall evaluation of the findings. While undoubtedly one could
change some of the classifications, the table provides a reasonable

picture of the tone of results.
With respect to unemployment the majority of studies yield
insignificant relations between unemployment and crime but of those

that yield significant results, all are in the "correct" direction and

the majority show a positive relation. Whether this is to be taken as
strong

or weak evidence for the existence of an unemployment — crime

relation

is up to the reader to decide for him or herself. The

preponderance of evidence is more favorable to a positive linkage than
not, but if one was anticipating an overwhelmingly strong relation, one

will be severely disappointed.

12

multivariate regression of the crime rate on the unemployment and a
trend variable (with allowance for serial correlation) yields an
estimate of the effect of a one unit change in unemployment on the

uniform crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants of .05, of moderate

statistical significance4. This coefficient indicates that a doubling
of the unemployment rate from 5 percent to 10 percent would raise the
crime rate by 5 percent in the l980s, though whether this would

represent a permanent increase in crime or simply a shifting in crime
from the low to high unemployment year cannot be determined.
Overall, while not all of the analyses in Table 1 yield
significant results and while none show unemployment to be the dominant
determinant of crime, they lend overall support to the notion that crime
varies over the business cycle.

The Cross—Section Results
There have been a large number of studies comparing crime rates

across states, cities, or SMSAs. Sample sizes, variables included, and
the periods covered differ considerably. In recent years many of the
studies have been of a simultaneous equations type, with restrictions
designed to identify the effect of deterrent variables; the labor

factors are always taken as exogenous. A typical model includes
an equation relating crime to criminal penalties or resources spent on

market

police,

labor market conditions, and other factors; and a second

equation for the level of criminal penalties or police resources.
From the reviews of the literature by Gillespie and Witte and

15

The results with respect to other labor market variables are

similar. Income of the overall population in an area taken as a
measure of the possible gain from economic crime and various measures
of the income of the poor, often the fraction of the population in
poverty, viewed as an indicator of the opportunity cost of crime,

obtain estimated effects which are in the right direction, and
significant in a fair number but not a majority of cases.
For purposes of comparison Table 2 also provides a count of

estimated effects of criminal sanctions. Here, the results are
noticeably stronger, with the majority of studies finding strong
impacts in the anticipated direction.
There are two possible reasons for the differential impact of

the labor market and deterrence variables. One possibility is that
considerable effort has gone into measuring deterrence while the labor

market factors, usually entered solely as "controls," have not received

such careful attentioii As a result, it is likely that the deterrence
variables are better measured than are the labor market variables,
biasing the coefficient of the latter toward zero relative to the

coefficients of the former5. For example, most cross—section studies
use a simple aggregate unemployment rate whereas the level of crime
among young people out of the labor force suggests a youth—out—of—

labor—force measure would be better. A second related reason may be
the different specificity of the variables: deterrence variables
relate directly to the options facing potential criminals, while

general labor market variables do not: the potential criminal may be

they will have lower skills, lower wages when working, and considerably
more unemployment than the average (see Table 3 for documentation).

Isnt this clearcut evidence that unemployment and poor labor market
performance are a major cause of crime? Why does it, on the face, tell
a stronger story than the time series and cross—section evidence just
examined?

There are several possible explanations for the stronger

relation between unemployment and labor market performance in the
individual than in aggregate data.

(1) The individual data may not be reflecting the effect of
unemployment (other labor market failures) on crime but, rather, the
fact that the criminal population consists of people who are unable to
succeed in the mainstream society due to "underlying personal

characteristics." That is, the cause of both the unemployment and
criminal activity may be a third variable having to do with the

individuals attributes.

If this were the case, changes in labor

market conditions would have little or no effect on the persor(s life
in crime, although we would always find the criminal having a poor work
record.

16

quite responsive to his own unemployment (or wage) prospects but those

prospects may be only weakly related to aggregate market conditions.
Finally, how should we assess the scorecard results in Table 2?

In its evaluation of studies of the effect of deterrence on crime, the
NAS—NRC Panel on Research on Deterrent and IncapactitatiVe Effects
concluded that "we cannot yet assert that the evidence warrants an

affirmative conclusion regarding deterrance . .

. (although) . . the
.

evidence certainly favors a proposition supporting deterrence more than

it favors one asserting that deterrence is absent. .

. ." (p.

7) As

the results with deterrence variables are generally stronger than those
with labor market variables, readers who agree with the Panel
conclusion will be even more circumspect in reaching the affirmative

conclusion regarding unemployment and other labor market factors. They
will agree with Orsagh and Witte that the economic model of crime, "as
that model relates to unemployment and income is not confirmed by tests

performed on aggregate data sets" (p. 8). After all, more coefficients
on the labor market variables are insignificant than significant. My
view is more positive with respect to both the deterrence and labor

market results. It is, however, clear that the evidence is not strong
enough to yield Congressman Conyers 'unanimous consensus.

Studies of Individuals

Take a group of convicted criminals. Compare their work record
with that of other citizens of the same age and sex. Invariably one
will find that the criminals will have a much more spotty work history:

19

(2) The potential criminal may have chosen unemployment in
preparation for criminal activity. He/she could have had a job but
turned it down in favor of criminal activity. In this case
unemployment per se is not the cause of crime, though the overall

rewards from work relative to crime may have influenced the
individual's decision.

(3) Potential criminals are, indeed, responsive to
unemployment and legitimate earnings opportunities, but as argued
earlier their economic choices are weakly linked to the overall

economy, so that aggregate analyses fail to capture the micro—relation.
This would be the case if criminals tend to come from the back of the

'job queue' so that their employment chances are only vaguely affected

by the overall level of unemployment: when the market is good,
employers hire other workers before the potential criminal, with the
result that it takes huge swings in the overall level or special
programs to raise their employment chances.
These three explanations suggest that the unemployment —

crime

link found in comparison of criminal and noncritninal work records

cannot be used to infer what happens to criminal activity when labor

market conditions change. Explanations (1) and (2) differ
fundamentally from (3), however, in that they suggest that changes in
unemployment/legitimate wage possibilities for criminals are (within
normal ranges of variation) likely to have little impact on their
criminal behavior whereas (3) suggests that if properly measured the

market opportunities facing the potential criminal would indeed reveal

"supported work" ,

in

which a major effort is made to provide a social

environment encouraging work as opposed to crime. These studies give
us an indication of how ex—criminals (who, because of recividism and
the concentration of crime among a small subset of the population, can
be assumed to cause a large proportion of crime) respond to their

labor

market incentives. They also have the advantage that the

incentives are controlled by the experimenter, providing, a truly

exogenous labor market variable for study. If these studies showed a
strong link between unemployment (other labor market factors) and
crime, the case for a sizeable significant relation would be greatly
enhanced.

Unfortunately, like the other evidence in the field, these
studies, while generally supportive of a labor market —

crime link, do

not give a uniform picture either of our ability to alter labor market
opportunities to reduce criminal behavior or the relation between

unemployment

or earnings and crime. As Table 4 shows, some studies

have successfully altered behavior (the Baltimore LIFE experiment,
Project

Wildcat, Operation Pathfinder) while others have not done so

(Parole Reintegration Projects, Supported Work, Project Development
Support Services, the diverse manpower programs surveyed by Taggart).

The recent and statistically sophisticated study of the TARP
experimental program, by Rossi et al showed essentially no difference
in recividism between the experimental group (who received unemployment

compensation

so that they could better search for jobs after release

20

a significant response to these opportunities.
Studies of recividism among actual releasees provide one,
albeit imperfect, way of analyzing the response of one set of potential
criminals, ex—offenders, to their own labor market experience.

In an

analysis of 641 men who were in prison in North Carolina in 1969 or

1971 Anne Witte found that whereas the wage level received on their
first job tended to decrease arrests or conviction the variable
measuring unemployment had an unexpected negative effect as well,
giving a rather mixed picture of the effect of labor market on the

behavior of these persons. The Rossi—Berk—Lenihan analysis of TARP
participants in Texas and Georgia, by contrast, showed a significant
tradeoff

between number of arrests and weeks employed, with those

employed longer having fewer arrests. In addition, however, they found
a

weak or anomalous relation between their measure of the labor market

(unemployment in the county of the release) and the individual's

employment

experience, so that

the aggregate market variable had no

effect on the individual's behavior.
At present there are too few studies of individual behavior to
reach any overall assessment.

Results of Social Experiments
In recent years several social experiments have been developed

to evaluate the responses of ex—offenders to job market incentives.
The programs have varied from job placement, to provision of money to
give ex—offenders some financial security until they find a job to

23

from prison) and the control population. Rossi et al develop a model
explaining the failure of the program to reduce crime as resulting from
the negative impact of employment on crime and the sizeable impact of

unemployment

the

compensation on acceptance of jobs. Viewed in this light,

TARP experiment supports the link between unemployment and crime,

although the experiment itself did not succeed due to failure to allow
for greater unemployment for those receiving unemployment compensation.

However, as noted earlier, there was little relation between aggregate
labor market conditions and recividistn. By contrast the Baltimore LIFE
experiment, on which TARP was modeled, found a stronger link between

unemployment in the city and crime than between the individuaYs own
work experience and crime. While these two studies lend some support
to the unemployment —

crime link, there are enough failed experiments

to call into question our ability to predict how the labor market —

crime link will indeed operate in a particular instance.

Conclusion

So, what in fact do we know about the relation between the
labor market and crime?

As a broad generalization, the bulk of the studies examined
here show some connection between unemployment (and other labor market

variables) and crime but they fail to document a well—defined clearly

quantifiable linkage. We know:

(1) There is a cyclical pattern to crime rate, with crime rising
over the cycle with unemployment.

market on crime is not an open—and—shut case in which research results

are so definitive that there is no need for further work. The work is,
however, more supportive of a link than of the opposite conclusion.

There is evidence that criminals tend to have poorer

work records than noncriniinals, but only limited evidence that,

once a person embarks on crime, moderate changes in these market

opportunities will cause them to choose legitimate earnings channels.

(3) Cities and states have widely different crime rates
loosely linked to labor market conditions.

(4) In studies that include measures of criminal sanctions and
labor market factors, sanctions tend to have a greater impact on
criminal behavior than market factors.

How is the reader to evaluate the results?
For the person who strongly believes unemployment causes crime,

there is nothing in the empirical evidence to cause him/her to abandon

that belief. Weak or modest empirical support should not strengthen
One's belief, but also should not lead one to abandon an initial
strongly

held view. On the other hand, the stronger evidence on the

deterrent effect of sanctions, should alter one's view of the relative

impact of the "carrot" and the 'stick.'
For the person who believes crime is unaffected by the labor
market,

3. Unemployment aid after release,

for instance, reduces the need to

engage in crime to make money but also may keep a person
unemployed for a longer period of time, increasing the likelihood

of criminal activity, if unemployment

leads to crime. See Rossi et

al.
