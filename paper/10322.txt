The (Un)changing Geographical Distribution of Housing Tax Benefits: 1980 to 2000

NBER Working Paper No. 10322
February 2004
JEL No. H20, R38
ABSTRACT
Even though the top marginal income tax rate has fallen substantially and the tax code has become
less progressive since 1979, the tax benefit to homeowners was virtually unchanged between 19791989, and then rose substantially between 1989-1999. Using tract-level data from the 1980, 1990,
and 2000 censuses, we estimate how the income tax-related benefits to owner-occupiers are
distributed spatially across the United States. Geographically, gross program benefits have been and
remain very spatially targeted. At the metropolitan area level, tax benefits are spatially targeted, with
a spatial skewness that is increasing over time. In 1979, owners in the top 20 highest subsidy areas
received from 2.7 to 8.0 times the subsidy reaped by owners in the bottom 20 areas. By 1999,
owners in the top 20 areas received from 3.4 to 17.1 times more benefits than owners in any of the
20 lowest recipient areas. Despite the increasing skewness, the top subsidy recipient areas tend to
persist over time. In particular, the very high benefit per owner areas are heavily concentrated in
California and the New York City to Boston corridor, with California owners alone receiving
between 19 and 22 percent of the national aggregate gross benefits. While tax rates are somewhat
higher in these places, it is high and rising house prices which appear most responsible for the large
and increasing skewness in the spatial distribution of benefits.

Introduction
It is generally accepted that the favorable tax subsidy to homeownership in the United
States stimulates the demand for housing, raising prices and increasing the homeownership rate.1
That this subsidy comes at a significant cost is also well documented at the national level, with a
number of authors having estimated the tax expenditure associated with the mortgage interest
and property tax deductions as well as the untaxed return on housing equity.2
Over time, these marginal incentives for homeownership – and the aggregate cost of
those subsidies – have changed considerably. For example, Poterba’s (1992) analysis of the
impacts of the various tax reforms of the 1980s reports a significant increase in the marginal cost
of owner-occupied housing between 1980 and 1990 across the income distribution, but
particularly for high income owners, due in large part to a drop in marginal tax rates for high
income households and an overall reduction in the progressivity of the tax code. In our work
below, we calculate that the real cost of the tax subsidy to homeownership has risen substantially
in the last 20 years, from $198 billion (in 1999 dollars) in 1979, to $284 billion in 1989, and
$420 billion in 1999.
In addition, recent evidence shows that the value of the subsidy to owner-occupied
housing varies dramatically over space. Gyourko and Sinai (2003), using 1990 Census data, find
that the benefits of the tax subsidy are highly skewed with just a handful of metropolitan areas
reaping most of the net gains from the favored tax treatment of owner-occupiers.
These sets of stylized facts naturally lead one to wonder whether the changes over time in
marginal incentives for homeownership and in the aggregate cost of the homeownership subsidy

have also affected the geographic distribution of the benefits. Because housing markets are
inextricably tied to a physical location, and are not national in scope, knowing the extent to
which the tax benefits vary spatially is important for determining the potential impact of any
change in the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing. Moreover, the nature of the spatial
distribution of benefit flows is likely to be important for any consideration of the potential
impacts on house prices, the homeownership rate, or the political economy of fundamental tax
reform.
In addition, knowledge of how the geographical distribution of program benefits changes
also is useful for analysis of the spatial equity of the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing.
For example, every year the Tax Foundation calculates each state’s ratio of federal spending
received to taxes paid, and finds substantial variation across states. Our results, that the benefits
of the subsidy to owner-occupied housing vary spatially, suggest that this sort of calculation
should include implicit tax expenditures and subsidies alongside the observable taxes and
spending. Indeed, many of the Tax Foundation’s states with the lowest ratios of spending to
actual taxes paid are the same ones whose home owners receive the largest housing-related
subsidies.
In this paper, we examine how the spatial distribution of the tax subsidy to owneroccupied housing changes over three decades. Using the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses, we
calculate the value of the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing as the difference in ordinary
state and federal income taxes currently paid by home owners and the taxes they would pay if the
tax code treated them like landlords. In the latter scenario, there is no preference for investing in
one’s home relative to other assets.
Interestingly, while we find that the marginal tax subsidy for homeownership has

4

decreased over the last 20 years on net, the aggregate value of the tax benefits actually increased.
Our analysis indicates that this is due to rising house prices and growth in the number of
homeowners more than offsetting the decline in average tax benefit per dollar of house. In
particular, the after-tax cost of a dollar of owner-occupied housing rose between 1979 and 1989
before falling slightly by 1999, as the marginal tax rates on housing deductions were reduced and
then increased. All else constant, one would expect the value of the tax benefit to fall with tax
rates. However, this is not the case at the per-owner level, where the benefit remained flat
during the 1980s before rising by 20 percent during the 1990s. The fact that the aggregate
subsidy rose substantially during the 1980s, from $198 billion in 1979 to $284 billion in 1989, is
due at least in part to growth in the number of homeowners.
In regard to the spatial distribution of the subsidy, these tax changes, increases in house
prices, and growth in the number of homeowners were not individually neutral. However, they
happen to offset each other so that at the state level the spatial distribution of the tax benefits
changes little over time. At the metropolitan area level, however, spatial skewness of the
subsidy has been increasing. This phenomenon appears to driven by the relatively large house
price increases experienced in various coastal areas of California and in the Northeast between
New York City and Boston. Even so, the top recipients tend to persist; they just receive a larger
fraction of the total subsidy over time.
Among states, California always receives the largest gross subsidy flow, but this is not
due solely to the fact that it has the most owners. For example, in 2000 it received 18.7 percent
of the aggregate subsidy while having only 9.4 percent of the nation’s owners. That high ratio of
benefits to owners applies to only a very small number of other states such as New York (9.5
percent of total benefit flow while being home to only 5.3 percent of the nation’s owners in

5

2000), indicating that this program has highly spatially targeted beneficiaries. This pattern of
spatial skewness to where program benefits flow is even more extreme at the metropolitan area
level. Comparing subsidy flows in 1979 in the top 20 areas versus those in the bottom 20 areas
finds that owners in the high recipient areas received from 2.7 to 8.0 times the subsidy reaped
per owner in the bottom group. By 1999, the analogous calculation finds the typical owner in
the top twenty areas receiving from 3.4 to 17.1 times more benefits than owners in any of the 20
lowest recipient areas.
The precise economic implications of these results depend upon whether or not the
subsidy is capitalized into land prices. While such an analysis is well beyond the scope of this
paper, the broad range of possible outcomes can be readily understood. If the subsidy were fully
capitalized, eliminating it would not affect the user cost of owning but many owners in a few
metropolitan areas would experience significant changes in wealth. While the savings associated
with eliminating the subsidy would be redistributed back to homeowners, the net wealth effect
still could be significant in many areas regardless of how one thinks the tax benefits are
financed. If the tax subsidy is not capitalized into land prices, then the user cost of ownership
must reflect it.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In the first section, we describe the tax
subsidy to owner-occupied housing and how we measure it. Section two reports our results,
beginning with an analysis of how benefits flow across states and followed by a description of
the distribution across metropolitan areas. Finally, there is a brief conclusion and summary.

I. Measuring Housing-Related Tax Benefits
The fact that there is a subsidy to owner-occupied housing can most easily be seen by

6

comparing the current tax treatment of home owners to how they would be taxed if housing were
treated like any other asset. In particular, owner-occupied housing gets favorable tax treatment,
but housing owned by a landlord is treated like any other income-producing, depreciable asset.
Both homeowners and landlords are allowed to deduct mortgage interest and property taxes as
expenses (as long as the homeowner itemizes). But a landlord must pay tax on her rental income
while a homeowner does not. The homeowner implicitly pays herself rent to occupy her house,
but because she is both landlord and tenant, that transfer is tax-free whereas if the parties were
distinct, the rent would be taxed. On the other hand, landlords can deduct depreciation and
maintenance, while homeowners cannot.
It is apparent from this comparison that the tax subsidy to owner-occupancy arises
largely from the non-taxation of the implicit rent on the home. However, it is not so
straightforward to compute the amount of the benefit. Implicit rent is unobserved and the
components of landlords’ tax bills are often difficult to estimate. Instead, as we show below, it is
much more straightforward to calculate the difference between the equilibrium taxes paid by
homeowners and landlords. Underlying this approach is the same assumption used in the
familiar user cost of owning concept developed in Hendershott and Slemrod (1983) and Poterba
(1984): the marginal home owner invests in owner-occupied housing until the point where the
annual cost she incurs exactly equals the rent she would have to pay as a tenant in the same
property.
We begin with the equilibrium annual flow cost of owning. That user cost is described in
equation (1) and takes into account the fact that implicit rental income is untaxed while mortgage
interest and property taxes are deductible for itemizers:
(1)

RH = (1-τded)αi + (1-τded)τp + (1-τint)(1-α)r + (1-τint)β + M + δ - ΠH.

7

The left-hand side variable, RH, is the annual cost of owner occupancy per dollar of housing
value. These costs include: (a) the after-tax cost of mortgage interest, (1-τded)αi, where α is the
loan-to-value ratio on the house, i is the mortgage interest rate, and τded is the owner-occupier’s
marginal tax rate, equal to her marginal rate (denoted τint) if she itemizes and zero otherwise; (b)
the after-tax cost of property tax payments, (1-τded)τp, with τp the effective property tax rate; (c)
the after-tax opportunity cost of investing equity in the house rather than in some other riskless
investment at rate of return, r; this is given by (1-τint)(1-α)r and is a cost to all owners, whether
they itemize or not;3 (d) an after-tax risk premium, (1-τint)β, to account for the difference in risk
between bonds and housing; this applies to the entire long position in the house and thus is
unaffected by the choice of leverage;4 (e) annual maintenance costs per unit of housing which
are given by M; (f) the cost of true economic depreciation per unit of house which is assumed to
occur at rate δ; and (g) any annual appreciation in the house value, ΠH, which reduces the
carrying cost.5
If the home owner were treated as a landlord, the residence would be taxed just like any
other asset. Neutral tax treatment obviously requires taxing the implicit rental income on the
home, but if treated like landlords, owner occupiers also would be able to deduct maintenance
3

Implicitly, we assume that the opportunity cost of tying up equity in a house is foregoing taxable returns. If the
home owner were to invest in a tax-exempt asset instead, we assume the return would be (1-τ)r rather than r, yielding
the same after-tax return.

4

In this framework, the homeowner’s financial position can be thought of as being long one house and short one
bond (the mortgage). This allows us to decompose the opportunity cost of being long the house as the riskless rate
of return plus a premium that reflects the difference in risk between a bond position and an equivalent risk
alternative to investing in housing. The difference between the mortgage interest rate and the equivalent duration
riskless rate is reflected in the options to default on or prepay the mortgage. These options have value to the owner,
so the premium above the riskless rate for borrowing is rolled into the mortgage rate as a cost.
5
This specification treats capital gains on housing as untaxed and realized every year. Given that there now is a
$250,000 capital gains exclusion ($500,000 for married couples filing jointly) that can be applied every other year,
this is not unrealistic. Even in earlier periods, the assumption of no capital gains taxation on housing was valid for
the vast majority of households.

8

expenses and depreciation, not just the mortgage interest and local property taxes presently
allowed. In this case, a different annual cost would result, as described in equation (2):
RH’= (1-τ)αi + (1-τ)τp + (1-τ)(1-α)r + (1-τ)β + τ RH’ + (1-τ)M + (1-τ)δ - (1-τ)ΠH .

(2)

With perfect competition in the rental housing market, rents must equal the annual cost, so τRH’
would be the tax due on imputed rent.6 Grouping the RH’ terms and dividing both sides by (1-τ)
yields the simplified version in equation (3),
RH’ = αi + τp + (1-α)r + β + M + δ - ΠH.

(3)

One possible strategy to estimate the tax benefits of owner-occupancy would be to
compute RH′ as the sum of the terms of on the right-hand side of equation (3), add that value to
the homeowner’s reported income, and then determine the additional tax that would be paid.
There are two important drawbacks to that approach. One is that we do not have good data on
maintenance, depreciation, or expected capital gains, so the estimate is likely to be a noisy one.
The other is that simply adding the implicit rent to income does not accurately capture the impact
of itemization rates because the tax rates on deductions differ for non-itemizers.
The alternative strategy we pursue in this paper is to compute the difference between RH’
and RH directly by subtracting equation (1) from (3). Doing so yields the following:
(4)

RH’-RH = τdedαi + τded⋅(τp) + τint((1-α)r + β).7

6

This also assumes accrual taxation of capital gains which, when combined with statutory ordinary income and
capital gains rates being equal, allows us to focus on program benefits arising from differential tax treatment of
ordinary income. As our 2003 paper shows, in this setting a dollar of house price appreciation has approximately the
same value to owner-occupiers and landlords, so there is no differential impact on user costs. The analysis behind
this conclusion is fairly complex, and we refer the interested reader to that paper for the details.
7
Note that we have abstracted throughout from how many housing dollars on which a home owning family receives
a subsidy. A change in the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing might affect house values, but because we
measure the subsidy on a per dollar basis, we abstract from the possibility that there is a second order effect through
changes in house prices. This is done for two reasons. First, determining precisely how a change in the subsidy
would be capitalized into house values is beyond the scope of this paper. Second, any change in house price would
only increase the magnitudes of our estimates. For example, if the benefit to owner-occupied housing were reduced,

9

Not only does this approach get the impact of itemization correctly, but the terms for which we
would have the most problems measuring accurately (M, δ, and П) difference out in the
subtraction. Thus, the tax subsidy to owner-occupancy can be computed as the sum of three
components: (a) the tax value of home mortgage interest deductions (τded⋅α⋅i); (b) the tax value
of local property tax deductions (τded⋅τp); and (c) the tax that would have been paid on the equity
invested in the home had it been invested elsewhere (τint⋅((1-α)⋅r+β)).8 While the sum of these
three terms represents total ordinary income tax benefits to owner occupiers under the current
code, we hasten to emphasize that this does not imply that mortgage interest or local property tax
deductions themselves are responsible for creating the subsidy. As noted above, the subsidy
arises from the non-taxation of imputed rent. It simply is the case algebraically that the subsidy
can be represented by the three terms on the right-hand side of equation (4). Looking at the
deductions alone would underestimate the true subsidy.

Estimation Strategy and Data
The procedure for estimating the tax code-related subsidy to owner-occupiers is
represented graphically in the tax schedule with three marginal tax brackets shown in Figure 1.
A home-owning family with no housing-related deductions would have a taxable income (TI) of
Y1. However, if they were not owners, they may have invested their housing equity in a vehicle
that yielded a taxable return that would raise their TI to Y2. Thus, Y2 is the counterfactual TI for

house prices might also fall, further decreasing the subsidy.
8

The depreciation term nets out because we have assumed landlords can deduct economic depreciation and, after
1986, that is probably not far from the truth. Deloitte and Touche (2000) and Gravelle (2001) conclude that
economic lifetimes for rental properties in 1989 (and now) are somewhat shorter than the statutory lifetimes. The
statutory depreciable life in 1981 (of 15 years) was shorter than true economic depreciation, so we may overestimate
the subsidy to owner-occupiers in 1979.

10

a home-owning family if it were to stop being an owner. Starting with that TI, we can compute
the tax value of each of the three aforementioned deductions. With a taxable income of Y2, this
hypothetical family would have a tax liability of T1. Assume that claiming the home mortgage
interest deduction (HMI) would lower TI to Y2−HMI (presuming for simplicity that all of HMI
was above the standard deduction) and the tax liability to T2. Therefore, the tax savings for this
family from the mortgage interest deduction is T1−T2.
Although in this example the mortgage interest deduction does not move the family into a
lower tax bracket, the property tax deduction does. Beginning with TI equal to Y2−HMI, we can
compute the tax savings from the property tax deduction as the tax bill with only the mortgage
interest deduction, T2, minus the tax bill with both the mortgage interest and property tax
deductions, T3. In this case, T2 and T3 span a kink in the tax schedule, but still account for the
fact that the average tax rate is less than the marginal tax rate at Y2−HMI.
Finally, we compute the value of the non-taxation of the return on housing equity.
Because the return on housing equity is not included in TI, taxable income is measured at Y1
instead of the greater amount Y2. The tax value of not including that income is measured as the
change in tax between T3 (the tax bill corresponding to a TI of Y2−HMI−Tp) and T4 (the tax bill
corresponding to an TI of Y1−HMI−Tp).
It is apparent from Figure 1 that the order in which the deductions are taken matters when
the tax schedule is not linear. For example, T1−T2 > T3−T4, even though HMI < Y1−Y2. After
adding back the implicit return on housing equity, we compute the deductions in the following
order: (a) tax savings from the mortgage interest deduction; (b) the tax savings associated with
the property tax deduction; and (c) the savings from the return on housing equity being untaxed.
We have repeated the estimation using all six possible sequences in which the deductions can be

11

taken. While the relative magnitudes of the categories change, the differences are minor.
We calculate each of the tax liabilities T1 through T4 by combining tract level
information covering the entire United States from the STF3 files of the 1980, 1990, and 2000
decennial Censuses with the National Bureau of Economic Research’s (NBER) TAXSIM
program. TAXSIM calculates federal and state tax liabilities from our tax data and allows us to
engage in a “what-if” calculation to determine what taxes would have been paid had a household
not had various housing deductions or had invested in an asset with a taxable income stream.
For each year in our data, the TAXSIM program incorporates all relevant federal and state tax
law, including housing and property tax deductions.
To construct representative households to pass through the TAXSIM tax calculator, we
start by computing the distribution of household income among homeowners at the tract level.9
For each tract, we divide the household income distribution into deciles and assign the median
income for each decile to all the households in that category. Thus, the lowest-income one-tenth
of the households are assumed to have an income equal to that of the fifth percentile for the tract,
the next lowest-income tenth of the households are assigned an income equal to that of the 15th
percentile for the tract, and so forth.
We then map tract-level information on the distribution of house values, PH, to incomes
by assigning to households in each decile of the income distribution the value corresponding to
the same decile of the house value distribution. For example, we assume that the household in
the 5th percentile of the income distribution for the tract also owns the home in the 5th percentile

9

All tax benefit figures reported in this paper are based on tract-level data that aggregates household income across
its various sources.

12

of the housing price distribution for the same tract.10
The actual value of the tax benefits depends on certain demographic data that are likely
to affect the number of exemptions and the overall amount of deductions. Tract level data that
are available in each census year include the distribution of whether households are single,
married, or single with children; the percentage of households with children; and the percentage
of households over 65 years of age. We create a representative household for each possible
combination of these characteristics and then compute the weighted average estimated tax,
where the weights are the tract-level distributions of the demographic characteristics.
Unfortunately, the census data lack information on most non-housing categories of
potential tax deductions. We compute mortgage interest, state tax, and property tax deductions,
but we do not observe medical expenses, charitable giving, deductible interest (other than for a
home mortgage), and several other miscellaneous categories. Two countervailing problems arise
from underestimating possible deductions. First, we would be more likely to incorrectly assume
the family does not itemize. This error would cause us to underestimate the tax value of the
mortgage interest and property tax deductions since less would be deducted at the margin. On
the other hand, undercounting deductions for itemizers could increase the tax value we do
measure since the remaining deductions are applied against higher marginal tax rates.
Consequently, we impute missing tax deductions to our census data based on data from the
Department of the Treasury’s Statistics of Income (SOI) public use tax micro sample. A
10

This matching process presumes that owners and renters in a tract have identical income distributions.
Fortunately, our spatial results are robust to assuming an extreme case in which all the owners in a tract have a
higher income than any of the renters, and houses are matched to owners so that the highest income owner owns the
highest value house, the next highest income owner occupies the next highest valued house, and so forth. In reality,
any sorting into houses by income would not be perfect, as is suggested by the data in O’Sullivan et al (1995) which
matches tax returns and property tax assessments in California. Unfortunately, those data are no longer available.
However, for the 1989 data we have tried using the mean income and house value in each tract, rather than the full
distribution, and it does not make any qualitative difference to the spatial skewness we observe.

13

modified Heckman-style sample selection model is employed to correct for the selective
observing of deductions only by itemizers.11
Following the procedure shown in Figure 1, we augment the observed income by an
estimate of how much higher the household’s income would have been had they invested in an
equivalently risky taxable asset rather than housing. First, we calculate the opportunity cost of
the equity in one’s home, or PH*((1-α)*r + β), where r is the riskless yield on seven-year
Treasuries in the relevant census year: 9.47, 8.57, and 5.79 percent, respectively. Then we
compute β: the risk premium for the whole house.12 The estimates below assume that the
expected equivalent-risk opportunity cost of investing in a house was equal to the geometric
mean on the value-weighted S&P500 return (including dividends) over a certain time period.
For simplicity, we assume the relevant period always runs from the beginning of 1926 to the end
of the census year (i.e., 1926-1979, 1926-1989, and 1926-1999), yielding expected returns of
8.79, 10.13, and 11.22 percent, respectively. The risk premium is the difference between this
yield and the risk-free yield. Thus, for 1989, we define β to be the 10.13 percent S&P500 return
minus the 8.57 percent Treasury yield, for a premium of 1.56 percentage points. The opportunity
cost of riskless equity and the risk premium are then added to income.
11

The interested reader should see the Appendix to Gyourko & Sinai (2003) for a detailed description of the
procedure. The imputation results indicate that, absent the correction, we would have underestimated deductions
and therefore the number of itemizers. This turns out to be important because the underestimation of itemizers was
not random across space. In high house value and high income tax states such as California, not observing nonhousing deductions only infrequently caused us to miscategorize an owner family as a non-itemizer. Home
mortgage interest, local property taxes, and state income taxes generally were sufficient to make California residents
itemizers. This was not the case in many states with lower house values and lower state taxes. Hence, the
imputation has an important effect on the measured spatial distribution of program benefits.
12

The risk adjustment follows from Poterba (1991), with the calculation effectively assuming that the mortgage rate
would be the yield on seven-year Treasuries in the absence of the options to prepay or default. Other assumptions
regarding the relative risk of owner-occupied housing obviously could be made, as there is no clear agreement on
this issue. However, we have repeated all the analyses reported in the paper under widely varying assumptions
about the relative risk of owner-occupied housing. While the aggregate subsidy certainly does vary with the
presumed opportunity cost of equity in the home, the nature of the spatial distribution of the subsidy across states
and metropolitan areas largely is unaffected.

14

We estimate the value of the mortgage interest deduction by computing each tractdecile’s tax value as the weighted average difference in tax bills with and without it. The
mortgage interest deduction itself is defined as PH*α*i. Leverage ratios, α, vary by age and are
computed from household data in the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) closest in time to the
relevant census year. A weighted average leverage for each tract was computed based on the
tract’s age distribution.13 The mortgage interest rate, i, was calculated by taking an average
across households in the same SCFs. From the 1983 SCF, which is the closest in time to 1979,
we calculate the average mortgage rate was 10.21 percent. For 1989, the analogous rate was
9.56 percent, with a rate of 7.85 percent matched from the 1998 SCF to the 1999 census data.
The tax value of the mortgage interest deduction can differ from mortgage interest paid
times the marginal tax rate for three reasons. First, only families that itemize on their tax returns
receive any benefit on the margin from the deductibility of mortgage interest. Also, only the
excess of the mortgage interest deduction plus other itemized deductions over the standard
deduction has value for a taxpayer. Therefore, we would only multiply the portion of mortgage
interest in excess of the standard deduction (after itemizing all other non-housing related
deductions first) by the tax rate. Additionally, since the tax schedule is nonlinear, taking the
mortgage interest deduction may lower the taxpayer’s marginal and average tax rates.
The second component involves the value of the deduction of local property taxes.
Property tax payments themselves are defined as PH*τp, where τp is the average effective
property tax rate. We were not able to find reliable estimates for this variable over time.
13

There is considerable heterogeneity in leverage by age in all years. For example, in 1998, loan-to-value ratios by
age are as follows: 20-24 year olds – 66.5 percent; 25-29 year olds – 64.2 percent; 30-34 year olds – 62.6 percent;
35-39 year olds – 61.0 percent; 40-44 year olds – 52.3 percent; 45-49 year olds – 44.5 percent; 50-54 year olds –
41.3 percent; 55-59 year olds – 30.9 percent; 60-64 year olds – 21.3 percent; 65-69 year olds – 13.2 percent; 70-74
year olds – 9.6 percent; and 75+ year olds – 4.6 percent. Leverage in previous decades is, on average, lower.

Consequently, we use information for an intermediate year—1990.14 This variable is allowed to
vary by metropolitan area using data provided by Stephen Malpezzi, who has calculated average
property tax rates in 1990 for a large number of areas. Census tracts not located within
metropolitan areas covered in the Malpezzi data are assigned the average state-level local
property tax rate as reported by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
(ACIR (1987)).15 The tax value of the deduction associated with these payments then is
computed the same way as for the mortgage interest deduction.
The third term we estimate arises from the fact that the government does not tax as
income the return home owners could have earned on their equity had they not invested in their
homes. We calculate the reduction in tax liabilities that occurs when we remove the imputed
income that we had added in the first step. This approach accounts for the possibility that a
family might move into a higher marginal tax bracket if the return on its housing equity were
taxed.

II. Results
Summary Statistics for the Nation
The national aggregate gross value to owners of housing-related ordinary income tax
benefits, reported in the first panel of Table 1, is quite large and has risen over time—from $198
billion in 1979 to $284 billion in 1989 to $420 billion in 1999 (in constant 1999 dollars).16

14

Property taxes are such a small component of the total subsidy – about 10 percent – that the noise in this measure
probably has little qualitative effect on our conclusions.
15
The ACIR did not report state-by-state breakdowns for 1989, so we use the 1987 data. We have also
experimented with assuming a 1 percent and 1.5 percent national average effective rate. Our findings are not
sensitive to these changes.
16
The bulk of the tax code-related benefits to owners arises from the third of the three components from equation
(4). Depending upon the census year, from two-thirds to three-quarters of the total benefits are due to not having to
pay tax on the return to equity invested in the home plus the difference in expected return on housing versus the cost

16

These subsidies are large and are significantly higher than those typically reported by Treasury
or the Joint Committee on Taxation primarily because those government agencies calculate only
the traditional tax expenditures – the tax cost of the mortgage interest and property tax
deductions – rather than the failure to tax implicit rent. Since houses are only partially leveraged
and the expected return on a house is greater than mortgage rates, those deductions measure only
a portion of the true tax expenditure.17 In addition, our figures include state tax subsidies.
The housing subsidy is sizeable – and growing – even on a per owner or per household
basis. While the aggregate real subsidy amount increased 112 percent since 1979, the number of
owner-occupied units rose just 70 percent between 1979 and 1999 (from 40.9 million in 1979 to
69.7 million in 1999) so the subsidy per owner-occupied household has been going up. Gross
program benefits per owner-occupied household were $4,840 in 1979, remained constant over
the ensuing decade with the 1989 figure being $4,818, and then rose in the 1990s to $6,024 in
1999. The analogous figures on a per household basis range from just over three thousand
dollars in 1979 to just over four thousand dollars in 1999.
While it has long been understood that the subsidy is skewed in aggregate towards those
with high incomes and high house values, much less is known about the spatial skewness of this
aspect of the tax code. It is to that issue we now turn. We begin by documenting just how the
tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing is skewed, describe how that skewness changes over
time, and then investigate the factors driving any changes in the distribution of the subsidy

of the mortgage. Results on the decomposition of the subsidy are available upon request.
Our estimates of the tax savings from the mortgage interest deduction alone are quite close to, but lower than,
what we obtain by looking at actual tax return data. We cannot use the Statistics of Income data to compute the full
tax expenditure because tax return data do not include information about house values, only itemized deductions. In
addition, the SOI data do not report state of residence for taxpayers with AGI above a threshold, so our calculations
using the SOI are also below the true figure. On the other hand, the Joint Committee on Taxation’s projected tax
expenditure on mortgage interest deductions for 1999 (these do not include state taxes) is slightly lower than what
we calculate.

across states and metropolitan areas.
State-Level Results
While we will focus most of our analysis on the amount of tax benefits per owner, we
begin with the most basic measure of the spatial distribution of the benefits: the aggregate
benefit flow for each state by year. Not surprisingly, the most populous state, California, stands
out in Table 2, with its owners receiving gross benefits of nearly $40 billion in 1979, well over
$60 billion in 1989, and almost $80 billion in 1999. No other state approaches these levels,
although the benefit flow to New York has risen dramatically over time. A closer examination
shows that, as the national aggregate value of the subsidy increases, the additional benefits
appear to be distributed in rough proportion to where they were already going. That is, while the
aggregate benefit to California doubles between 1979 and 1999, so does the subsidy to small
beneficiaries such as Georgia, Maryland, and North Carolina. Thus, the states tend to maintain
their same relative standing, but the absolute (real) dollar difference between the highest and
lowest recipient increases substantially.
Of course, changes in aggregate subsidy flows are heavily affected by population growth.
To net out differential increases in the number of homeowners, Figure 2 reports benefits scaled
by the number of owners in each state in 1979 and 1999.18 Even on a per owner basis, people in
only a handful of states, often the most populous ones, reap substantially more from tax coderelated housing benefits than the typical owner nationally. For example, while California is no
longer the extreme outlier it was in the aggregate data in Table 2, it still is one of only seven
states that received at least $6,000 per owner in 1979 and at least $8,000 per owner in 1999.
Overall, the per owner subsidies in the top few states are well over double those received by

18

owners in the vast majority of states. Thus, while the Gini coefficients for the distribution of per
owner benefits across states are relatively low in each decade (0.20 in 1979, 0.32 in 1989, and
0.25 in 1999), it would not be accurate to consider the benefit distribution an especially
egalitarian one in spatial terms.
Although the subsidy per owned unit has risen over time, the skewness has persisted at
least since 1979. Benefit flows always are concentrated in the hands of owners in just a few
states and the top three states have remained there for the last 20 years. However, the spatial
distribution has changed some with owners in northeastern states doing better over time.
Of course, Figure 2 confounds changes in the national level of subsidy with its
distribution across space. However, the typical state receives less than the national average
benefit per owner, with a few states receiving about double the average. These disparities rise
between 1979 and 1989, but are mitigated somewhat by 1999.19 To isolate the spatial distribution
from the dollar value of the subsidy, we have computed the ratio of each state’s share of the
subsidy to its share of the nation’s owners. For example, the median state has a ratio of subsidy
share to owner share of 0.83 in 1979, 0.71 in 1989, and 0.76 in 1999. These generally are less
than half of California’s numbers which are 1.77 in 1979, 2.29 in 1989, and 2.00 in 1999.20
Figure 3 provides more detail on the heterogeneity in benefit changes by state over the
1980s and 1990s by measuring each state’s changes relative to the national average change. The
top panel highlights that owners in northeastern and mid-Atlantic states did better than average
in the 1980s. California and Hawaii are the only exceptions to that statement. There was less
19

While one cannot compute transfers across states without making assumptions regarding how the program is
financed, it seems certain that transfers are flowing from a host of states to owners in California and a select few
other states. See our 2003 paper for transfer estimates assuming lump sum and proportional financing schemes using
1990 data. In both cases, the outcome is the majority of states transferring resources to owners in the smaller
number of other states.

While Hawaii’s and the District of Columbia’s ratios are higher in each decade, California’s are more relevant
empirically because of its very large number of owners.

19

heterogeneity in the 1990s, and it was owners in the less populous western states of Colorado,
Oregon, and Utah who experienced significantly greater than average increases that decade.
Owners in California and Hawaii received smaller than average benefit flow increases that
decade.
As suggested in the introduction, many factors have changed over time that could
influence the value of the tax benefits associated with owner-occupancy. The most obvious is
tax rates themselves. Because owner-occupied housing is a true tax shelter in the sense that one
can deduct expenses without declaring any income on the asset, a reduction in tax rates naturally
lowers the value of the tax shelter. Figure 4 plots the ‘average’ marginal tax rate (state+federal)
on housing deductions for 1979 and 1999, calculated using the Census data and the NBER’s
TAXSIM program. While marginal rates do differ across states, those differences have declined
over time. Overall, marginal rates fell significantly during the 1980s and then rose modestly
during the 1990s due to a series of tax reforms at the federal level. 21
That aggregate benefits rose and benefits per owner did not decline on average between
1979 and 1989 indicates that other factors were changing to counterbalance the negative effect
that an increase in the tax price of housing would have on the value of the benefit. In addition,
the fact that most of the important tax changes were at the federal level may help explain why
the nature of the spatial distribution across states was not affected very much.
Other components of the subsidy were changing, of course, and house prices in
particular. Figure 5 graphs mean house price by state in 1979, 1989, and 1999, with Figure 6
reporting the percentage changes over time for each state. Values in many of the coastal states in
21

Like tax rates, the probability of itemizing declined significantly between 1979 and 1999, reducing the subsidy to
owner-occupied housing. Changes in the spatial distribution of itemizers, once one nets out the effect of house
prices on the likelihood of itemization, do not seem to determine the changes in the benefits. This is not surprising
since we saw in section I that itemization only affects the value of a small portion of the tax subsidy.

20

particular have skyrocketed over the past 20 years. In California, mean real prices rose from just
over $200,000 in 1979 to nearly $300,000 in 1999. The change has been even more dramatic in
places such as Massachusetts, where the average home was worth a little more than $100,000 in
1979. One decade later, mean prices had doubled (in real terms), and prices held firm in that
state during the 1990s. It seems clear that it is this type of change that has allowed the average
subsidy per owner in Massachusetts to rise so much over the past two decades. Indeed, a
comparison of Figures 3 and 6 suggests that rising real house prices can help account for the
dramatic increases in benefits per owner that have occurred in a small number of states,
especially northeastern ones in the 1980s.
Of course, there are other factors at work, including the rising return in equity markets
which raises the value of the tax shield on home equity in our calculations. While a detailed
decomposition analysis of changes in the tax benefit over time is beyond the scope of this study,
the data show that the factors that do change did so in a largely offsetting fashion with respect to
the spatial distribution across states in the 1980s. The rise in aggregate and per owner benefits in
the 1990s probably reflects a growing share of households that are owners, rising real house
prices, and increasing tax rates. On net, the spatial distribution of benefits across states is fairly
skewed in each census year, with very few states experiencing significant changes in their
relative status. Whether this holds at the metropolitan area level is the subject of the following
subsection.
Between-Metropolitan Area Results
In this subsection, we disaggregate the data further to examine subsidy flows at the
metropolitan area level and find that the distribution of housing benefits are more skewed than at
the state level, and that skewness is increasing over time. Results are computed for 380 areas

21

that were identifiable Census Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs).22
Aggregate benefit flows at the CBSA level, which are reported for selected areas in the
Appendix, document how extremely spatially targeted are the overall benefit flows. The vast
majority of metropolitan areas receive a relatively modest benefit flow, while a relatively small
number of areas receive very large aggregate benefit flows.
This form of spatial skewness also has increased over time at the metropolitan area level.
For example, if we focus just on the three CBSAs that contain the nation’s three largest cities of
New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, their owners received benefit flows equal to $27.3
billion in 1979. While being home to just 10.1 percent of all owners living in designated
metropolitan areas in the 1980s, they received 14.7 percent of all benefits flowing to
metropolitan census tracts. By 1989, the spatial skewness of aggregate tax subsidy flows had
become even more extreme. Owners in just these three CBSAs received 17.7 percent of all
metropolitan area benefits while constituting an even smaller share of the nation’s owners at 9.3
percent. The share of owners in these areas had fallen to 8.5 percent by 1999, but their benefit
share was 1.72 times higher at 14.6 percent.
Figure 7, which plots benefits scaled by the number of owners in the CBSA, highlights
that the subsidy flows disproportionately towards owners in a relatively small number of
metropolitan areas and that the skewness is increasing over time. In this figure, CBSAs are
ordered by their per-owner subsidy. Thus, the more extreme curvature in the graphs as the

22

Benefit flows to census tracts not located within CBSAs are not included in the figures reported in this section.
CBSAs are Census’s new (2003) county-based definition of metropolitan areas. We apply the same definition in
each of the three Census files, realizing of course that the economic relationship between the counties is weaker
earlier in previous decades. By construction, a CBSA must contain at least one urban area of 10,000 or more
population. The county (or counties) “in which at least 50 percent of the population resides within urban areas of
10,000 or more population, or that contain at least 5,000 people residing within a single urban area of 10,000 or
more population, is identified as a "central county"” and is included in the CBSA. Additional "outlying counties"
are included in the CBSA if they meet specified requirements of commuting to or from the central counties.

22

decades progress is an indication that spatial skewness, net of population changes, has been on
the rise.
This is made even more clear in Tables 3 and 4, which report the top and bottom 20
CBSAs in terms of benefits per owner in 1979 and 1999, respectively. (We limit consideration
to the 179 CBSAs that are above the median in terms of the number of households. 23) The table
also includes per household values of the subsidy, although the sorting is on a per owner basis.
These two tables make clear that there are very wide disparities in the size of benefit
flows across places. For example, Table 3 documents that in 1979 an owner in one of the top 20
areas received from three to eight times the benefit flow of an owner in one of the bottom 20
areas.24 The differentials are narrower on a per household basis, with households in the top
twenty areas having benefit flows that are from 2 to 4 times those in the bottom twenty areas.
While differences in ownership rates – which are lower in the top subsidy areas – do account for
some of the gap between the top and bottom recipient areas, the disparity still is large even on a
per household basis.
Table 4’s figures based on 1999 data indicate that the differentials widened considerably
over the ensuing two decades. For example, a comparison of the per owner subsidy in the 20th
highest ranked area (Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI, Metropolitan Division) with the
same figure for the 20th lowest ranked area (Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, PA, MSA) finds a ratio of
3.4 to 1—or 1.3 times the ratio for the analogously ranked areas in 1979. Comparing the 10th
highest area’s (Honolulu, HI, MSA) benefit per owner value with that for the 10th lowest area
23

The top twenty areas in terms of benefits per owner are virtually unchanged by restricting the sample to more
populous areas containing more than the median number of households. This is not the case among the bottom
twenty areas. If the full sample of 380 CBSAs is used, Texas is even more overrepresented as it contains a large
number of less populous metropolitan areas.
24
These ranges were determined by computing the ratio of benefit per owner in the top-ranked area versus the
bottom ranked area, from the second-to-highest ranked area versus the second-to-lowest ranked area, and so forth.

23

(Fort Smith, AR-OK, MSA) finds a ratio of 5.6 to 1—which is 1.5 times the ratio for similarly
ranked areas in 1979. The disparity widens even further when comparing the top-ranked area
(San Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood City, CA, Metropolitan Division) to the bottom-ranked area
(McAllen-Edinberg-Pharr, TX, MSA) in terms of benefit per owner, with a ratio of 17.1 to 1
($26,385/$1,541). Thus, the top recipient areas are receiving relatively more per area than the
bottom ranked areas in 1999 than in 1979. Moreover, the benefits flowing to owners in the very
top areas rose by 50-100 percent in real terms, while they were flat or declined slightly in the
very bottom-ranked areas.
An even clearer face can be put on the skewness depicted in Figure 7 by examining who
and where the top and bottom recipient areas are on a per owner basis. Fourteen of the top 20
areas appear in both 1979 and 1999. They include Honolulu, HI, Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk,
CT, Bethesda-Frederick-Gaithersburg, MD, Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI, and ten areas
spanning the length of California’s coastline. By 1999, a series of areas, primarily located along
the New York City-Boston corridor (Suffolk County-Nassau County, NY, New York-WayneWhite Plains, NY-NJ, Cambridge-Newton-Framingham, MA, Boston-Quincy, MA, and NewarkUnion, NJ-PA) joined the top 20 list, replacing midwestern areas such as Ann Arbor, MI,
Warren-Farmington Hills-Troy, MI, and Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, WI, along with
Anchorage, AK, and Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV. Thus, the top
recipient areas have become even more dominated by coastal areas, with the northeast being
much more heavily represented in the 1999 rankings.25 There is less stability among the bottom
twenty ranked areas, with ten being present in both 1979 and 1999. Moreover, this group always
has a very strong southern representation (especially, but not exclusively, Texas), and the

25

The only interior area to join the top twenty list in 1999 was Boulder, CO.

24

metropolitan areas tend not to situated along the Atlantic or Pacific coasts.
In sum, the spatial skewness of benefit flows per owner has grown over time, with the top
areas now receiving very large multiples of the subsidy received by the bottom areas.
Geographically, this skewness now is a bi-coastal phenomenon, with metropolitan areas
spanning the state of California and between New York and Boston dominating the top 20
benefit per owner rankings. Still, there is strong persistence over time in the areas that receive
the most benefit, and their share of the total has been rising.
Because the most important tax code changes tend to have occurred at the federal level,
plots of tax rates and tax rate changes at the metropolitan level are not particularly helpful in
increasing our understanding of these results. In contrast, examining house prices over time at
the local level is very illuminating. For example, Figure 8’s plots of the distribution of mean
house values by metropolitan area over time look strikingly similar to the distributions of
benefits per owner in Figure 7. While it is the case that incomes and tax rates are somewhat
higher in coastal metropolitan areas, those differences are not nearly as pronounced as for house
values. Thus, it is rising real house prices, especially in key coastal metropolitan areas,
augmented by generally higher tax rates in those areas, that is increasing the absolute and
relative benefits flowing to their owners. Because how the housing is financed has only a
second-order effect (through itemization) on the value of the subsidy, it is not necessary for
households to refinance their houses to increase their subsidies. Since higher prices reflect
higher implicit rental value, if housing were treated symmetrically tax revenues would increase
with house prices.

III. Conclusions

25

Estimating the tax subsidy to home owners by comparing the taxes they now pay with
those they would pay if they faced neutral tax treatment – like landlords, in our example – shows
a substantial increase in the value of the tax benefit over time. While some of the aggregate
increase clearly is due to a rise in the number of homeowners, benefits per owner are about 20
percent higher in 1999 than they were in 1979 at the national level. This is particularly
interesting given that it occurs despite marginal and average tax rates falling over the past two
decades. The evidence suggests that rising house prices, especially in key coastal areas and in
certain regions of the country, can help account for the fact that the value of the subsidy has risen
even though the tax subsidy per dollar of housing has declined.
Spatially, we demonstrate that the subsidy flows disproportionately to owners in a
relatively small number of states—California, especially. Spatial skewness is even more
extreme at the metropolitan level, and the data indicate that skewness there has increased over
time, though the top recipient areas tend to remain so. Rising house prices in certain coastal
metropolitan areas appear to play a large role in explaining this phenomenon.
While the magnitude and skewness of the subsidy are striking, one note of caution is in
order when interpreting these results. While it may appear that current homeowners in some
parts of the country reap a large tax subsidy, their house prices may be higher to reflect it. That
is, the after-tax annual cost of housing in high-subsidy areas may not differ from low-subsidy
areas by the full amount of the tax benefit. In the extreme case, if house prices have fully
capitalized the benefit, current homeowners are no better off on a flow basis.
Computing the incidence of the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing – the degree to
which the subsidy shows up in higher house prices rather than as a reduced flow cost of
homeownership – is beyond the scope of this paper. In addition, there is no consensus in the

26

economics literature on the answer: estimates range from full capitalization to very low
capitalization.26 Unfortunately, where the incidence lies has crucial implications for public
policy. For example, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that, due to the spatial inequity
of the tax subsidy to owner occupied housing, policymakers should restructure the tax benefit.
But if a reduction in benefit is capitalized into house prices, current homeowners may experience
a loss of wealth. If those homeowners had been the beneficiaries of the rise in house prices when
the tax subsidy increased, such a reduction in asset value might be equitable. However, it is
quite likely that current homeowners purchased their house with the tax benefit already
capitalized into the price, paying more on the expectation of future subsidies.
The degree of the capitalization of the subsidy into house prices also is unlikely to be
spatially neutral. In places where land is in short supply, an increase in demand for housing is
likely to show up more in house prices than it would in cities where it is easy to add more
housing stock. That housing demand can be created by local economic factors or the subsidy to
owner occupied housing. Thus, for the same underlying economic reasons, places where the tax
benefit is the greatest are places with high land prices and also places where the subsidy is more
likely to be capitalized into the house price. While we cannot say how much of any reduction in
the tax benefit would show up as lower house prices, it seems likely that a larger fraction (of a
larger benefit) would be reflected in house prices in the high benefit areas.
