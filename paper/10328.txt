The Expanding Pharmaceutical Arsenal in the War on Cancer

NBER Working Paper No. 10328
February 2004
JEL No. I12, J1, O33
ABSTRACT
Only about one third of the approximately 80 drugs currently used to treat cancer had been approved
when the war on cancer was declared in 1971. We assess the contribution of pharmaceutical
innovation to the increase in cancer survival rates in a ““differences in differences”” framework, by
estimating models of cancer mortality rates using longitudinal, annual, cancer-site-level data based
on records of 2.1 million people diagnosed with cancer during the period 1975-1995. We control for
fixed cancer site effects, fixed year effects, incidence, stage distribution of diagnosed patients, mean
age at diagnosis, and surgery and radiation treatment rates.
Cancers for which the stock of drugs increased more rapidly tended to have greater increases in
survival rates. The increase in the stock of drugs accounted for about 50-60% of the increase in ageadjusted survival rates in the first 6 years after diagnosis. New cancer drugs increased the life
expectancy of people diagnosed with cancer by about one year from 1975 to 1995. The estimated
cost to achieve the additional year of life per person diagnosed with cancer – below $3000 – is well
below recent estimates of the value of a statistical life-year. Since the lifetime risk of being
diagnosed with cancer is about 40%, the estimates imply that new cancer drugs accounted for 10.7%
of the overall increase in U.S. life expectancy at birth.

In 1971, President Nixon declared “war on cancer”, and the National Cancer Act
was enacted.1 Since that time, both government and industry have devoted enormous
resources to fighting this war. Today, it behooves us to ask, "Are we winning the war?"
At first blush, the answer appears to be, “definitely not!”. As Figure 1
reveals, the age-adjusted U.S. mortality rate from all malignant cancers was
essentially the same in 2000 as it was in 1969. (It was 8% higher in 1991 than it was
in 1969.) During the same period, the age-adjusted mortality rate from all other
causes of death declined by 38%. Today, cancer is the leading cause of years of
potential life lost before age 75.2
But the stagnancy of the cancer mortality rate is potentially misleading. This
mortality rate depends on two distinct factors: the probability of being diagnosed with
cancer, and cancer survival rates—the probability of not dying t years after being
diagnosed with cancer (t = 1, 2, …). As Figure 2 reveals, the cancer incidence rate—the
number of new cancer cases per 100,000 people—increased sharply from 1975-1979 to
1992. Although it declined after 1992, it was still 16% higher in 2000 than it was in
1975-1979. The long-run increase in cancer incidence is presumably primarily
attributable to the decline in mortality from other causes, particularly cardiovascular
disease. Medical advances for diseases other than cancer have reduced the risk of dying
from those diseases, and have thereby increased the risk of developing cancer.
According to the National Cancer Institute, in the year 2000 the lifetime risk of
developing cancer was about 40%.
Although cancer incidence has increased, so has cancer survival.3 Figure 3
shows the five-year relative survival rate from all malignant cancers from 1975-1979 to
1995. The probability that a person diagnosed with cancer in 1975-1979 would not die

mortality than heart disease. In 2001, cancer caused 35% more premature mortality than heart disease.

Epidemiologists calculate two kinds of survival rates: observed and relative survival rates. The observed
survival rate represents the proportion of cancer patients surviving for a specified time interval after
diagnosis. Some of those not surviving died of the given cancer and some died of other causes. The
relative survival rate is calculated using a procedure (Ederer et al., 1961) whereby the observed survival
rate is adjusted for expected mortality. The relative survival rate approximates the likelihood that a patient
will not die from causes associated specifically with the given cancer before some specified time after
diagnosis. It is always larger than the observed survival rate for the same group of patients.

from causes associated specifically with the given cancer within 5 years was 50.0%. For
a person diagnosed with cancer in 1995, that probability was 25% higher: 62.7%.
Figure 4 summarizes the trends in cancer mortality, incidence, and survival. The
relative stability of the cancer mortality rate is the result of two offsetting trends: an
increase in the cancer incidence rate, and an increase in the relative survival rate (or a
decrease in the relative non-survival rate).
This paper’s main objective is to assess the contribution of pharmaceutical
innovation to the increase in cancer survival rates. I estimate that only about one third of
the approximately 80 drugs currently used to treat cancer had been approved when the
war on cancer was declared. In other words, there has been a threefold increase in the
size of the cancer drug armamentarium4 in the last three decades.5
I recognize, of course, that pharmaceutical innovation is just one of a number of
factors that may have contributed to the increase in cancer survival. Other potential
factors include: a changing mix of cancers over time; technological advances in
diagnostic procedures that led to earlier detection and diagnosis; and changes in nonpharmaceutical cancer treatment (surgery and radiation). The available data will enable
me to control for these factors to a very great extent.
The survival rate data shown in Figure 3 are for all cancers combined. The mix of
cancers changes over time as the incidence of some cancers increases and the incidence
of others decreases. Annual growth rates during the period 1950-2000 of the incidence of
various cancers are shown in Figure 5. Incidence of two cancers—lung and bronchus
(among females) and melanoma—increased more than 4% per year, while incidence of
stomach and cervix uteri cancer declined more than 2% per year. Moreover, there is
considerable variation in survival rates across cancers. As shown in Figure 6, in 1950,
seven cancers had 5-year relative survival rates above 50%, while seven had rates at or
below 10%.6 In principle, the increase in the survival rate for all cancers combined could
be partly due to an increase in the relative incidence of cancers with high (initial) survival

The word armamentarium has two definitions: “(1) the equipment and methods used, especially in
medicine; and (2) matter available or utilized for an undertaking or field of activity.” http://www.mw.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=armamentarium

The growth rate of the cumulative stock of approved cancer drugs has been greater than the growth rate of
the cumulative stock of drugs approved for other diseases.

rates. In practice, this is not the case. As shown in Figure 7, there is essentially no
relationship across cancers between the survival rate in 1950-54 and the 1950-2000
growth rate of incidence.7
Survival data, by cancer site, of the type shown in Figure 6 can be calculated for
different periods. Cancer site-specific survival data (for whites only) for 1950-54 and
1992-99 are shown in Table 1 and Figure 8. In the figure, note that every point lies above
the 45o line: for every cancer site, the 1992-99 survival rate was greater than the 1950-54
survival rate. However the percentage increase in the survival rate varied considerably
across cancer sites. For example, the 1950-54 survival rate for both brain and other
nervous system cancers and childhood cancers was about 20%, but the 1992-99 survival
rate was 32.1% for the former and 78.7% for the latter. Similarly, the survival rate for
colon cancer increased from 41% to 63%, while the survival rate from prostate cancer
increased from 43% to 98%. I hypothesize that these differential rates of progress are
partly attributable to different rates of pharmaceutical innovation for different types of
cancer.
To test this hypothesis within a “differences in differences” framework, I will
estimate models of cancer mortality rates using longitudinal, annual, cancer-site-level
data based on large samples of people diagnosed with cancer during the period 19751995. The explanatory variable of primary interest is the (lagged value of the)
cumulative number of cancer drugs approved to treat that cancer type. The following
covariates will be included in the model: fixed cancer site effects, fixed year effects,
incidence, stage distribution of diagnosed patients, mean age at diagnosis, percent of
patients having surgery, and percent of patients having radiation. Including these
variables is likely to control for the effect of technological advances in diagnostic
procedures. As noted in the SEER Cancer Statistics Review, “improved earlier detection
and diagnosis of cancers may produce an increase in both incidence rates and survival
rates.” To the extent that these improvements apply to all forms of cancer, their effects
are captured by the fixed year effects. Cancer-site-specific improvements in detection
7

This confirms the observation that “while it is possible to adjust the survival rate for all cancers combined
on the basis of the relative frequency of each specific cancer in some specified reference period, rates
adjusted in this manner differ by only a small amount from unadjusted rates.” (SEER Cancer Statistics
Review, p. 13.)

and diagnosis are likely to lead to reductions in age at date of diagnosis and to increased
measured incidence.
Figure 9 depicts the general model that we will estimate. Section I of the paper
describes the data that will be used to estimate the model. Section II describes the
econometric specification and procedure. Estimates of the model are presented in
Section III. Interpretation and implications of the estimates are considered in Section IV.
Section V contains a summary.
I. Data
The National Cancer Act of 1971 mandated the collection, analysis, and
dissemination of data useful in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. This
mandate led to the establishment of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). A continuing project of the NCI,
the population-based cancer registries participating in the SEER Program routinely
collect data on all cancers occurring in residents of the participating areas. Trends in
cancer incidence and patient survival in the U.S. are derived from this database. The
SEER Program is a sequel to two earlier NCI programs — the End Results Program and
the Third National Cancer Survey.
The SEER Program is considered as the standard for quality among cancer
registries around the world. Quality control has been an integral part of SEER since its
inception. Every year, studies are conducted in the SEER areas to evaluate the quality and
completeness of the data being reported (SEER's standard for case ascertainment is 98
percent). In some studies, a sample of cases is reabstracted to evaluate the accuracy of
each of the data elements collected from the medical records. In other studies, targeted
information gathering is performed to address specific data quality needs. Computer edits
also are used by registries to ensure accurate and consistent data.
The initial SEER reporting areas were the States of Connecticut, Iowa, New
Mexico, Utah, and Hawaii; the metropolitan areas of Detroit, Michigan, and San
Francisco-Oakland, California; and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Case
ascertainment began with January 1, 1973, diagnoses. In 1974-1975, the program was

7
expanded to include the metropolitan area of New Orleans, Louisiana, the thirteen-county
Seattle-Puget Sound area in the State of Washington, and the metropolitan area of
Atlanta, Georgia. New Orleans participated in the program only through the 1977 data
collection year. In 1978, ten predominantly black rural counties in Georgia were added.
American Indian residents of Arizona were added in 1980. In 1983, four counties in New
Jersey were added with coverage retrospective to 1979. New Jersey and Puerto Rico
participated in the program until the end of the 1989 reporting year. The National Cancer
Institute also began funding a cancer registry that, with technical assistance from SEER,
collects information on cancer cases among Alaska Native populations residing in
Alaska. In 1992, the SEER Program was expanded to increase coverage of minority
populations, especially Hispanics, by adding Los Angeles County and four counties in the
San Jose-Monterey area south of San Francisco. In 2002, the SEER Program expanded
coverage to include Kentucky and Greater California (the counties of California that were
not already covered by SEER). Also in 2002, New Jersey and Louisiana became SEER
participants again. Figure 10 is a map of SEER cancer registries.
Data from the 9 SEER geographic areas used in this study represent, respectively,
approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population. By the end of the 1999 diagnosis year,
the database contained information on over 3,200,000 cases diagnosed since 1973. Over
170,000 new cases are added annually.
Data contained in the SEER Public Use File (PUF) enable us to characterize a group
of people diagnosed with a given type of cancer in a given year. They may be
characterized in terms of:
•

Their future survival prospects

•

The size of the group (incidence)

•

Their age distribution

•

Their distribution by extent/severity of illness (cancer stage distribution)

•

Whether their initial treatment included surgery and/or radiation

Future survival prospects. Each record in the SEER Public-Use File indicates
whether the person had died by the cutoff date for this file (December 31, 2000), and if
so, the date of death. This allows us to compute, for each cancer site and year of
diagnosis, the survival distribution function (SDF) and several closely related functions.

8
The SDF evaluated at t is the probability that a member of the population will have a
lifetime exceeding t, that is S(t) = Prob(T > t), where S(t) denotes the survival function
and T is the lifetime of a randomly selected experimental unit. Some functions closely
related to the SDF are the cumulative distribution function (CDF), the probability density
function (PDF), and the hazard function. The CDF F(t) is defined as 1 – S(t) and is the
probability that a lifetime is smaller than t. The PDF denoted f(t) is defined as the
derivative of F(t), and the hazard function denoted h(t) is defined as f(t)/S(t). Hence h(t)
= -S’(t)/S(t), where S’(t) is the derivative of S(t). The hazard rate is the percentage
reduction in the survival rate.) Discrete time: h(t) = (S(t) – S(t+1))/S(t) Î S(t) = ∏j=0t-1
(1 – h(j)))
To illustrate, Figure 11 shows estimates of the survival and hazard functions of
people diagnosed with all types of cancer in 1975.8 The 5-year survival rate was 45%,
and the 10-year survival rate was 34%. The hazard rate declines very sharply during the
first several years. The probability of dying, conditional on being alive at the beginning
of the year, is 31% in the first year, 15% in the second year, and 10% in the third year. It
declines much more slowly during the next five years, when it levels off at about 5%.
We compute hazard functions of this type for each cancer site and year of
diagnosis.9 That is, we compute estimates of HAZARDi,t-k,t: the hazard rate from year t
to year t+1 of people diagnosed with cancer type i in year t-k (i = 1,…,30; t =
1975,…,2000; k=1,…,24). For example, suppose i = breast cancer, t = 1990, and k = 5.
Then HAZARDi,t-k,t = the probability that a woman diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985
died in 1990, conditional on surviving until the beginning of 1990. We also compute
standard errors of these estimates.
Incidence. Incidence of cancer type i in year t can be estimated by simply
counting the number of cases in the SEER PUF. The incidence rate is the number of new
cases per year per 100,000 persons:
INCIDENCEit = CASESit / POPt
Hence ln(INCIDENCEit) = ln(CASESit) – ln(POPt)
8

These survival and hazard rates, like all others we will compute and analyze, are observed rather than
relative rates. However, the models we will estimate will include covariates (e.g. fixed diagnosis-year
effects and mean age at diagnosis) that presumably effectively adjust for changes in “expected mortality”.
9
These are computed using the LIFETEST procedure (LIFETABLE method) in SAS.

9
= ln(CASESit) + δt
where δt = – ln(POPt). Including ln(CASESit) and a set of diagnosis-year dummies (δt‘s)
therefore controls for site-specific changes in cancer incidence. As observed in the
National Cancer Institute’s SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2000, “the improved
earlier detection and diagnosis of cancers may produce an increase in both incidence
rates and survival rates.”10 Hence including ln(CASESit) and a set of diagnosis-year
dummies (δt‘s) in cancer survival or hazard models may control, to an important extent,
for the effects of changes (improvements) in cancer detection and diagnosis.
Cancer stage. In addition to cancer site, each SEER record indicates cancer stage at
the time of diagnosis. There are four main cancer stage categories:11
•
•

•

•

In situ (Stage 0)—A noninvasive neoplasm; a tumor which has not penetrated the
basement membrane nor extended beyond the epithelial tissue. Some synonyms
are intraepithelial (confined to epithelial tissue), noninvasive and noninfiltrating.
Localized (Stage 1)—An invasive neoplasm confined entirely to the organ of
origin. It may include intraluminal extension where specified. For example for
colon, intraluminal extension limited to immediately contiguous segments of the
large bowel is localized, if no lymph nodes are involved. Localized may exclude
invasion of the serosa because of the poor survival of the patient once the serosa
is invaded.
Regional (Stage 2)—A neoplasm that has extended 1) beyond the limits of the
organ of origin directly into surrounding organs or tissues; 2) into regional lymph
nodes by way of the lymphatic system; or 3) by a combination of extension and
regional lymph nodes.
Distant (Stage 4)—A neoplasm that has spread to parts of the body remote from
the primary tumor either by direct extension or by discontinuous metastasis (e.g.,
implantation or seeding) to distant organs, issues, or via the lymphatic system to
distant lymph nodes.

Survival rates of patients diagnosed in a given year are strongly inversely related to
cancer stage, e.g. patients with Stage 4 cancer have much lower survival rates than
patients with Stage 0 cancer. In principle, therefore, it might seem desirable to calculate
survival rates by site, diagnosis year, and stage, rather than merely by site and diagnosis
year. However due to a phenomenon known as stage migration, analysis of survival rates

10

http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2000/results_merged/sect_01_overview.pdf
There are two additional categories: Localized/Regional (Stage 8)—Only used for Prostate cases, and
Unstaged (Stage 9)—Information is not sufficient to assign a stage. All lymphomas and leukemias are
considered unstaged (code `9').

11

10
and other variables by site, diagnosis year, and stage is likely to lead to erroneous
inferences.
The assignment of a given stage to a particular cancer may change over time due
to advances in diagnostic technology. Stage migration occurs when diagnostic procedures
change over time, resulting in an increase in the probability that a given cancer will be
diagnosed in a more advanced stage. For example, certain distant metastases that would
have been undetectable a few years ago can now be diagnosed by a computer tomography
(CT) scan or by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, some patients who would
have been diagnosed previously as having cancer in a localized or regional stage are now
diagnosed as having cancer in a distant stage. The likely result would be to remove the
worst survivors — those with previously undetected distant metastases — from the
localized and regional categories and put them into the distant category. As a result, the
stage-at-diagnosis distribution for a cancer may become less favorable over time, but the
survival rates for each stage may improve: the early stage will lose cases that will survive
shorter than those remaining in that category, while the advanced stage will gain cases
that will survive longer than those already in that category. However, overall survival
would not change (Feinstein et al., 1985). Stage migration is an important concept to
understand when examining temporal trends in survival by stage at diagnosis as well as
temporal trends in stage distributions; it could affect the analysis of virtually all solid
tumors.12
Among people diagnosed with the same kind of cancer in the same year, those
with later stage cancer always have lower survival rates. But, as we will show below,
increases in the share of patients with later-stage cancer are not always associated with a
reduction in the survival rate of that group.
Since stage migration is very likely to result in misleading statistics for cancer
survival by stage, we will measure survival by cancer site and diagnosis year, rather than
by cancer site, diagnosis year, and stage. However, we will control for the effect of
changes in the measured stage distribution by including stage distribution variables (e.g.,
the % of cases that are Stage 0 cases) as covariates.

11
Cancer treatment. The medical community recognizes three types of
conventional cancer treatment: surgery, radiation therapy, and drugs.
Surgery. Surgery is often the first step in cancer treatment because it is used both
to diagnose and to treat cancer. Surgery alone sometimes cures cancer. Sometimes it is
used in conjunction with other treatments such as chemotherapy (cancer drugs) or
radiation therapy. More than half of the people diagnosed with cancer will have some
type of surgery or operation at some point. Surgery is used to remove tumors confined to
a small space. Surgery is also used to reduce the size of large tumors so that follow-up
treatment by radiation therapy or chemotherapy will be even more effective.
From the SEER PUF, we can determine whether the patient’s "first course of
treatment" included surgery. The "first course of treatment" is either the planned course
of treatment stated in the medical record, or the standard treatment for that site and extent
of disease when there is no treatment plan in the chart. In general terms, first course of
treatment extends through the end of the planned treatment, or until there is evidence of
treatment failure (progression of disease), and the patient is switched to another type of
treatment.
Radiation. Radiation therapy uses radiation (high-energy rays) to kill or shrink
tumor cells. It is used to treat some, but not all cancers. Radiation therapy destroys cells
either directly or by interfering with cell reproduction. Normal cells are able to recover
from radiation damage better than cancer cells. Used alone, radiation therapy can be
curative in many cases. It is also used in combination with other treatments/therapies
such as surgery. It might be used both to reduce the size of tumors before surgery and to
destroy any remaining cancer cells after surgery. Radiation therapy is also used with
many other conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and hormone therapy.
When cure is not possible, radiation therapy can also help alleviate symptoms such as
pain, and improve quality of life for patients. From the SEER PUF, we can also
determine whether the patient’s "first course of treatment" included radiation.
Chemotherapy. According to the SEER Program Code Manual, data on
chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy are collected in SEER. With
respect to chemotherapy, cancer registries are asked to “code any chemical [that] is

12
administered to treat cancer tissue and which is not considered to achieve its effect
through change of the hormone balance.”
Unfortunately, the SEER Public Use File does not contain any information about
chemotherapy. According to NCI staff, this is because chemotherapy is generally not
performed in an inpatient hospital setting—it is usually performed in an outpatient
hospital setting, in a physician’s office, or at home. Chemotherapy data collected by
SEER are rather incomplete, so SEER does not include the information on the public use
file.13 I therefore constructed a cancer-site-specific and year-specific chemotherapy
variable--the cumulative number of drugs approved to treat each type of cancer in each
year--by combining data from two sources.
The first source is the Cancer Drug Manual produced by the British Columbia
Cancer Agency, Division of Pharmacy (de Lemos (2004)). The Professional Drug Index
contains monographs on 83 cancer drugs. The monographs were written, reviewed and
edited by pharmacists practicing in oncology settings, and have been reviewed by
oncologists and an oncology nurse clinician. Each monograph contains a section on the
uses of the drug. For example, according to the monographs, there are seven uses for
asparaginase (acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute
myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease,
melanosarcoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), and four for dacarbazine (Hodgkin's
disease, malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma, and soft tissue sarcomas). Using the
information contained in all 83 monographs, I constructed a list of drugs used to treat
each kind of cancer. I determined, for example that the following 12 drugs are used
today to treat bladder cancer: bcg, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, fluorouracil,
gemcitabine, interferon alfa, methotrexate, mitomycin, porfimer, thiotepa, and
vinblastine.
I used a second data source—Mosby’s Drug Consult—to determine the year in
which the FDA approved each of these drugs.14 This enabled me to track the cumulative
number of drugs approved by the FDA for each cancer type for each year.

13
14

E-mail communication from April Fritz, Manager, Data Quality, SEER Program, 8 January 2004.
The list of cancer drugs, in order of year of FDA approval, is shown in Appendix Table 1.

13
As Figure 12 indicates, the rate of increase of the stock of drugs varies
considerably across cancer sites in a given period, and also across periods for a given
cancer site. For example, between 1969 and 2002, there was a 4.4-fold increase in the
stock of drugs for breast cancer, and an 8-fold increase in the stock of drugs for prostate
cancer. Also, the stock of drugs for colon and rectum cancer remained constant from
1974 to 1980, but then doubled from 1980 to 1982.
II. Econometric Model
For each cancer site and year of diagnosis (1975-1995), I computed a hazard
function. For people diagnosed in 1975, the hazard function had 25 points—one for each
of the years 1-25 (the cutoff date for the SEER PUF is Dec. 31, 2000). For people
diagnosed in 1976, the hazard function had 24 points, and so forth. For people diagnosed
in 1995, the hazard function had just 5 points.
I estimated a separate model of the hazard rate for each of the k years after
diagnosis (k = 1, 2,…, 25): a model of the first-year hazard rate, the second-year hazard
rate, etc. Each model was of the following form:
ln(HAZARDi,t-k,t) = αik + δtk + β1k ln(DRUG_STOCKi,t-3) + β2k ln(Ni,t-k)
+ β3k AGE_MEANi,t-k + β4k SURGERY%i,t-k + β5k RADIATION%i,t-k
+ θ0k STAGE0%i,t-k + θ1k STAGE1%i,t-k + θ2k STAGE2%i,t-k
+ θ4k STAGE4%i,t-k + θ8k STAGE8%i,t-k + εi,t-k,t

= the fraction of people diagnosed with cancer type i in year t-k
whose initial treatment included surgery
= the fraction of people diagnosed with cancer type i in year t-k

For example, suppose i = breast cancer, t = 1990, and k = 5. Then HAZARDi,t-k,t= the probability that a
woman diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985 died in 1990, conditional on surviving until the beginning of
1990.

whose cancer was classified as stage 4 (distant)
= the fraction of people diagnosed with cancer type i in year t-k
whose cancer was classified as stage 8 (localized/regional-prostate
only)

Table 2 presents some summary statistics, by year of diagnosis, from the SEER
Public Use File (PUF). There appear to be sharp breaks in several of the series between
1974 and 1975 and again between 1995 and 1996. We therefore restricted the sample to
include only the 2.1 million people diagnosed with cancer during the years 1975-1995.
In eq. (1), the hazard rate in year t for patients diagnosed with cancer type i in
year t-k is a function of: fixed cancer-site effects, fixed diagnosis-year effects, the stock
of drugs approved to treat that type of cancer by the end of year t-3, cancer incidence,
mean age at diagnosis, extent of surgery and radiation,16 and cancer stage distribution.
Since the dependent variable is the logarithm of the hazard rate, we are, in effect,
estimating a proportional hazards model. Such a model assumes that changing an
explanatory variable has the effect of multiplying the hazard rate by a constant.
Introduced by D. R. Cox (1972),17 the proportional hazards model was developed in order
to estimate the effects of different covariates influencing the times-to-failure of a system,
and has been widely used in the biomedical field.
We assume that the log of the hazard rate depends on the log of the lagged stock
of drugs. Eq. (1) may be considered a health production function, and production
functions are often assumed to be log-linear, consistent with the hypothesis of

16

Ideally, we would like to measure the number (and importance) of surgical and radiological innovations,
analogous to the number of pharmaceutical innovations. Since the FDA does not regulate surgery and
radiology in the same way that it regulates drugs, this is not feasible. However changes in the frequency of
surgery, for example, may be highly correlated with surgical innovation. If there are more surgical
innovations for one cancer site than there are for another, one would expect a greater increase (or smaller
decline) in surgical treatment of the former site.

diminishing marginal productivity of inputs. For example, in his model of endogenous
technological change, Romer (1990) hypothesized the production function
ln Y = (1-α) ln A + (1-α) ln L + α ln K,
where Y = output, A = the “stock of ideas”, L = labor used to produce output, K = capital,
and 0 < α < 1. The cumulative number of drugs approved (DRUG_STOCK) is
analogous to the stock of ideas.
In principle, the hazard rate could depend on the number of drug classes, as well
as (or instead of), the number of drugs. For example, introducing a drug that is the first
in its class might have a greater impact on the hazard rate than introducing a drug that is
the fifth in its class. We will test for this by estimating versions of the model that include
the number of drug classes as well as the number of drugs.18
Inclusion of fixed cancer-site and year effects means that we are comparing the
(percentage) changes in hazard rates of different cancer sites during the same period.
Estimates of β1k that are negative and significantly different from zero would signify that
there were above-average declines in the hazard rates of cancer sites with above-average
increases in the stock of drugs, ceteris paribus.
Instead of modeling hazard rates, one could model survival rates. Since, by
definition, Ht = (St – St+1)/ St, where Ht denotes the hazard rate during period t and St
denotes the percent surviving until the beginning of period t,
Sn = (1 – H1) * (1 – H2) * … * (1 – Hn-1)
The probability of surviving until the beginning of year n is the product of one minus the
hazard rate of years 1 through n-1.19 For example, the 10-year survival rate of patients
diagnosed in 1975 depends on their hazard rates during 1975-1984. Suppose a new drug
was approved in 1980. This would be expected to reduce hazard rates after 1980 (or even
later, due to diffusion lags, discussed below), but not before that date. For this reason, to
pinpoint the effect of new drug approvals, modeling annual hazard rates is more
appropriate than modeling multi-year survival rates.

The distribution of drugs, by drug class, is shown in Appendix Table 2.
This also implies that ln Sn = Σin-1 ln (1 – Hi) ≈ - Σin-1 Hi

16
There is ample evidence that, after a new drug is approved, it takes a few years for
that drug to be widely utilized. This may be illustrated using the following data on the
U.S. sales ranks of two major (non-cancer) drugs approved during the 1990s.20

It took at least 3 years for each of these drugs to attain its peak sales rank. It therefore
seems sensible to hypothesize a lag of about three years in the impact of the stock of
approved drugs on the hazard rate. I estimated the model with alternative assumed lags
(1 to 4 years). Assuming a 3-year lag yielded the best fit. These are the estimates I will
report in the next section.

III. Estimates
Estimates of eq. (1), by number of years after diagnosis (1,2,…,8) , are reported in
Table 3. All equations included 30 cancer-site fixed effects and year fixed effects. The
hazard models for the first six years (after diagnosis) were estimated using data on people
diagnosed during 1975-1995, and included fixed effects for each of those years. Starting
seven years after diagnosis, the sample period was reduced by one year for each year
after diagnosis. For example, the year-7 hazard model was estimated using data on
people diagnosed during 1975-1994 (due to censoring of the data after 12/31/2000).
All equations were estimated by weighted least squares, weighting by the reciprocal of
the estimated variance of the hazard rate.
The estimates shown in lines 1-10 are of the first-year hazard model, i.e. the
hazard rate in the first year after diagnosis. The estimate of the coefficient on the lagged
drug-stock is negative and highly statistically significant (line 1). This indicates that
cancers for which the stock of drugs increased more rapidly tended to have larger
declines in the first-year hazard rate (and larger increases in the one-year survival rate).
During the period 1975-1995, the incidence-weighted mean increase in
ln(DRUG_STOCKi,t-3) was 1.31. (The stock of drugs increased 3.7-fold.) This implies
that the 1975-1995 increase in the stock of drugs reduced the first-year hazard rate by
about 22% (= .167 * 1.31). As shown in Figure 11, in 1975, the first-year hazard rate
was 30.6%. Hence, we estimate that the 1975-1995 increase in the stock of drugs
reduced the first-year hazard rate from 30.6% to 23.9%.
We consider next the coefficients on the other regressors in the first-year hazard
model. The coefficient on ln(Ni,t-k) is negative and highly significant (line 2), indicating
that cancers with the highest growth of SEER incidence had the greatest declines in the
first-year hazard rate. This may reflect the fact that cancers with the highest growth of
SEER incidence had the greatest improvements in early detection and diagnosis. As the
NCI observes, “The improved earlier detection and diagnosis of cancers may produce an
increase in both incidence rates and survival rates. These increases can occur as a result
of the introduction of a new procedure to screen subgroups of the population for a
specific cancer; they need not be related to whether use of the screening test results in a

18
decrease in mortality from that cancer. As the proportion of cancers detected at screening
increases, presumably as a result of increased screening of the population, patient
survival rates will increase, because they are based on survival time after diagnosis.”
Not surprisingly, the coefficient on AGE_MEANi,t-k is positive and highly
significant (line 3): cancers with larger increases in mean age at diagnosis had smaller
reductions in first-year hazard rates.21
The coefficient on SURGERY%i,t-k is negative and highly significant (line 4).
This indicates that cancers with greater increases in the probability of surgical treatment
had greater reductions in the first-year hazard rate. However, the coefficient on
RADIATION%i,t-k is not significantly different from zero (line 5).
The last estimates to consider in the first-year hazard model are the coefficients
on the stage-distribution variables (lines 6-10). As one might expect, the stage 4
coefficient is larger than the stage 2 coefficient, which is larger than the stage 1
coefficient. This indicates that a shift to later stages increases the first-year hazard rate.
However the stage 1 coefficient is smaller than the stage 0 coefficient. This indicates that
a shift from stage 0 (in situ) cancers to stage 1 (localized) cancers is associated with a
reduction in the hazard rate. This is presumably due to differential rates of stage
migration for different types of cancers.
Estimates of the second-year hazard model are shown in lines 12-21. In most
respects, this set is qualitatively similar to the first-year set. Once again, the estimate of
the coefficient on the lagged drug-stock is negative and highly statistically significant
(line 12). The only notable difference from the first-year estimates is that the coefficient
on RADIATION%i,t-k is now positive and significant (line 16). This indicates that
cancers with greater increases in the probability of radiation treatment had smaller
reductions in the second-year hazard rate.
In the third-year hazard model estimates (lines 23-32), the coefficient on the
lagged drug-stock is negative and similar in magnitude to the coefficients in the first two
years, but is only marginally significant (p-value = 0.08). As in the estimates for the
previous two years, the hazard rate increases with respect to age at diagnosis, and
declines with respect to incidence and surgical intervention. The radiation variable is
21

What is surprising, however, is that mean age at diagnosis increased from 61.4 in 1975 to 62.7 in 1995.

19
insignificant, and the stage-distribution coefficients (for stages 0-4) have their expected,
monotonic profile.
In the fourth-year hazard model estimates (lines 34-43), the coefficient on the
lagged drug-stock is positive and its magnitude is large (0.48), which is inconsistent with
our hypothesis. However, the mean hazard rate in year 4 is substantially lower than it is
in previous years, and we will show below that this large positive effect offsets only a
small part of the negative effects of the drug stock on the hazard rates in years 1-3.
The remainder of Table 3 shows estimates of the hazard model in years 5-8. To
summarize, in the first eight years, the coefficient on the drug stock is negative three
times as often as it is positive, and it is negative and significant twice as often as it is
positive and significant. Moreover, the coefficient on the drug stock is negative in the
first three years (and significant in the first two), when the hazard rate is highest.
We estimated models that included the log of the number of drug classes in year t3, as well as the log of the number of drugs in year t-3. In general, the coefficient on the
drug-class variable was far from statistically significant, and inclusion of this variable
had virtually no effect on the estimates of β1k. This suggests that the introduction of a
first-in-class drug does not increase cancer survival more than the introduction of
subsequent drugs within the class (over and above the general effect of diminishing
marginal productivity).
IV. Interpretation and Implications of Estimates
We can use the estimates of the drug-stock coefficients for all years (years 1-23)
to assess the effect of new drug introductions on the entire cancer survival distribution
function and on life expectancy at time of diagnosis. We begin with the vector of 1975
hazard rates shown in Figure 11. These reflect the prevailing conditions at that time: the
distribution of cancers by site and stage, average age of patients diagnosed, percent of
patients receiving surgery and radiation, etc. They also reflect the drugs that were
available at that time.

20
We then use our estimates to “predict” hazard rates in 1995, given the drugs
available in 1995, if all other conditions had remained the same as they had been in 1973.
The predicted k-year hazard rate (HAZ_PREk) is computed as follows:
HAZ_PREk = HAZ_ACTk * (1 + β1k ∆ln(DRUG_STOCKt-3))
where HAZ_ACTk is the actual 1975 k-year hazard rate and ∆ln(DRUG_STOCKt-3) is
the 1975-1995 change in the incidence-weighted mean of ln(DRUG_STOCKi,t-3). As
noted above, this is equal to 1.31. Hence
HAZ_PREk = HAZ_ACTk * (1 + (1.31* β1k)).
From the vectors of actual and predicted hazard rates, we can compute vectors of
actual and predicted survival rates:
SURV_ACTn = (1 – HAZ_ACT1) * (1 – HAZ_ACT2) * … * (1 – HAZ_ACTn-1)
SURV_PREn = (1 – HAZ_PRE1) * (1 – HAZ_PRE2) * … * (1 – HAZ_PREn-1)
These calculations are shown in Table 4. Columns 1-4 show the estimates of β1k
for k =1,2,…,24. Actual 1975 hazard rates (HAZ_ACTk) are shown in column 5.
Predicted 1975 hazard rates (computed as HAZ_PREk = HAZ_ACTk * (1 + (1.31* β1k)))
are shown in column 6. Actual and predicted 1975 survival rates are shown in columns 7
and 8. Actual 1995 survival rates for years 1-7 are shown in column 9. The three vectors
of survival rates are plotted in Figure 13.
Our estimates imply that, ceteris paribus—holding constant the cancer site- and
stage-distribution, cancer incidence, mean age at diagnosis, and the probability of surgery
and radiation—the 1975-1995 increase in the stock of drugs increased the 1-year cancer
survival rate from 69.4% to 76.1%, the 5-year cancer survival rate from 45.5% to 51.3%,
and the 10-year cancer survival rate from 34.2% to 38.1%.
From these figures, it appears that the increase in the stock of drugs accounted for
a very large percentage of the actual increase in survival rates between 1975 and 1995.
For example, the difference between 1-year predicted and actual 1975 survival rates
(76.1% - 69.4%) is 91% of the actual increase in 1-year survival rates (76.7% - 69.4%).
But these are crude survival rates, not age-adjusted rates.22 The mean age of people
diagnosed with cancer increased during the sample period. As a result, the age-adjusted
22

Since we include mean age as a covariate in eq. (1), βk is an estimate of the effect of the drug stock on
the age-adjusted hazard rate.

21
survival rate increased more than the crude survival rate. Using methods similar to those
described above, we can “predict” what the 1975 survival function would have been if
mean age in 1975 had been the same as it was in 1995. These are the calculations for
years 1-6:

Consequently, the increase in the stock of drugs accounted for a smaller percentage of the
age-adjusted increase in survival rates than it did of the crude increase:

Although the surgical treatment rate (SURGERY%) had a significant negative
effect on hazard rates in a number of years, there was very little change in the overall
surgical treatment rate during the sample period—it was actually slightly lower in 1995
(62.6%) than it was in 1975 (63.4%). Hence, our estimates imply that changes in the
surgical treatment rate had a negligible impact on cancer survival rates during this period.
The radiation treatment rate also remained almost constant (at about 27%); its impact on
cancer survival rates also appears to have been negligible.
The vectors of actual and predicted survival rates allow us to compute actual and
predicted values of life expectancy at time of diagnosis:
LE_ACT = Σk = 0 (k + 0.5) * (SURV_ACTk - SURV_ACTk+1)

22
LE_PRE = Σk = 0 (k + 0.5) * (SURV_PREk - SURV_PREk+1)
Since the cutoff date for the SEER PUF is 12/31/2000, for people diagnosed in 1975, the
data are right-censored at 25 years. About 17.5% of people diagnosed in 1975 were alive
at the cutoff date. For these people, we need to make an assumption about remaining life
expectancy, and this assumption will affect the levels of LE_ACT and LE_PRE.
However, because SURV_PRE25 is virtually equal to SURV_ACT25, this assumption will
not affect the difference LE_PRE - LE_ACT. Estimated values of LE_PRE, LE_ACT,
and their difference, under three alternative assumptions about the longevity (from time
of diagnosis) of people surviving past the cutoff date (L’) are as follows:
L'

LE_ACT LE_PRE difference
27.5

30.0
9.56
10.59
1.03
35.0
10.44
11.47
1.03

If we assume that people diagnosed in 1975 who are alive at the end of 2000 die in 2005
(30 years after diagnosis), then the actual life expectancy of all people diagnosed in 1975
was 9.56 years, and their predicted life expectancy (had they had access to the 1995 stock
of drugs) was 10.59 years. In this sense, the 1975-1995 increase in the lagged stock of
drugs made the life expectancy of people diagnosed with cancer in 1995 just over a year
greater than the life expectancy of people diagnosed with cancer in 1975.
In a previous study (Lichtenberg (2003)), I estimated the effect of launches of
new drugs for all diseases on the longevity of the entire populations of 52 countries
(including the U.S.) during the period 1986-2000. The methodology used in that study
differed from the one used here: the dependent variable was a measure of the age
distribution of deaths, rather than the hazard rate of people previously diagnosed.23
Although the sample and methodology were quite different, the estimated contribution of
pharmaceutical innovation to longevity increase was very similar to the one calculated
above. Before I estimated that the average annual increase in life expectancy of the entire
population resulting from new chemical entity launches is .056 years, or 2.93 weeks.
Now I estimate that the average annual increase in life expectancy of Americans

23

27% of the deaths occurring in that sample were caused by cancer.

23
diagnosed with cancer resulting from new chemical entity launches is .051 years, or 2.67
weeks.
According to the National Cancer Institute, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed
with cancer is about 40%. This implies that the 1975-1995 increase in the lagged stock
of cancer drugs increased the life expectancy of the entire U.S. population by 0.4 years (=
40% * 1.03 years). Between 1975 and 1995, U.S. life expectancy at birth increased by
3.8 years, from 72.3 years to 76.1 years.24 Thus, new cancer drugs accounted for 10.7%
of the overall increase in life expectancy at birth.
How much did it cost to achieve this additional year of life per person diagnosed
with cancer? To determine this cost (c), I will estimate the average amount spent on
cancer drugs by a cancer patient from time of diagnosis until death, using the following
formula:

c=

total drug
expenditure
in 1995

×

cancer drug expenditure
total drug expenditure

÷

1995
×
cancer
prevalence

mean life
expectancy at
time of diagnosis

According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Americans spent $60.8
billion on prescription drugs in 1995.25 We have two different estimates of the share of
cancer drug expenditure in total drug expenditure. According to the Census Bureau,
“specific antineoplastic agents” accounted for 1.3% of the value of 1995 shipments of
pharmaceutical preparations (except biologicals). According to IMS Health, cytostatic
drugs accounted for 3.6% of total U.S. drug sales in 2002.26 Hence total cancer drug
expenditure during 1995 was presumably between $803 million (= 1.3% * $60.8 billion)
and $2194 million (= 3.6% * $60.8 billion). According to the NCI, cancer prevalence
was 8.0 million in 1995. Hence average 1995 expenditure on cancer drugs per cancer
patient was in the range $100-$274. As discussed above, estimated life expectancy of
people diagnosed with cancer in 1995 is about 10.6 years. Hence, average
(undiscounted) cancer drug expenditure per cancer patient from diagnosis till death is in
the range $1064-$2907. The cost per life-year gained is in the $1040-$2842 range.

24
This is far below recent estimates of the value of a statistical life-year. Murphy
and Topel (2003) and Nordhaus (2003) estimate that this value is in the neighborhood of
$150,000. Moreover, since drug expenditures calculated above include expenditures on
old as well as new drugs, this range represents an upper bound on the cost per life-year
gained. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey suggest that, in general, new
drugs—drugs approved within the previous 15-20 years—account for about half of total
drug expenditure. If this applied to cancer drugs, we should divide the cost per life-year
estimates by two. However, given the rapid increase in the number of cancer drugs, new
cancer drugs may account for more than half of total cancer drug expenditure.
We have examined the effect of new cancer drugs on the life expectancy, or
number of remaining life-years, of cancer patients at time of diagnosis. Ideally, we
would like to measure the effect on the number of quality-adjusted life-years. Health
economists generally postulate a quality-of-life index (QOL) that ranges between 1
(corresponding to perfect health) and 0 (corresponding to death). The number of qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs) is the number of years multiplied by the average value of the
quality-of-life index during those years. For example, 10 years lived at mean QOL=0.7
equals 7 QALYs. Unfortunately, SEER does not collect any data on the quality of life of
cancer survivors, so calculating the impact of new cancer drugs on the number of QALYs
is not feasible.
While new cancer drugs appear to have increased the longevity of cancer
survivors by about a year, QOL in that additional year is likely to have been much less
than 1. However, it is also plausible that, in addition to delaying death, new cancer drugs
increased the quality of life of people at a given number of years after diagnosis. If this is
the case, the increase in QALYS is not necessarily less than the increase in life
expectancy.
This is illustrated by Figure 14. Suppose that new cancer drugs shifted the timeQOL profile from the curve labeled ‘1975’ to the curve labeled ‘1995’. This shift reflects
the estimated increase in life expectancy, from 9.56 years to 10.59 years. The increase in
life-years is equal to the sum of areas A and B. This is significantly larger than area A
alone—the QOL-adjusted value of the additional 1.03 years. But we hypothesize that
new drugs also increased average QOL from year 0 to year 9.56. The increase in QALYs

25
during that period is measured by area C. Clearly A < (A + B), but (A + C) is not
necessarily smaller than (A + B). Whether it is depends on the relative magnitudes of B
and C: average QOL in the marginal years versus QOL improvement in the inframarginal
years.
One might suppose that increasing the longevity of cancer patients will inevitably
result in an increase in medical expenditure on them. But Lubitz et al (2003) found that
although elderly persons in better health had a longer life expectancy than those in poorer
health, they had similar cumulative health care expenditures until death.
V. Summary
The age-adjusted U.S. mortality rate from all malignant cancers was essentially
the same in 2000 as it was in 1969. During the same period, the age-adjusted mortality
rate from all other causes of death declined by 38%. This suggests that the war on cancer
has been a failure. However, the relative stability of the cancer mortality rate is the result
of two offsetting trends: an increase in the cancer incidence rate, and an increase in the
relative survival rate. The five-year relative survival rate from all malignant cancers
increased from 50.0% in 1975-1979 to 62.7% in 1995. This increase is not due to a
favorable shift in the distribution of cancers.
A variety of factors, including technological advances in diagnostic procedures
that led to earlier detection and diagnosis, have probably contributed to this increase.
This paper’s main objective has been to assess the contribution of pharmaceutical
innovation to the increase in cancer survival rates. Only about one third of the
approximately 80 drugs currently used to treat cancer had been approved when the war
on cancer was declared in 1971. In other words, there has been a threefold increase in the
size of the cancer drug armamentarium in the last three decades.
The percentage increase in the survival rate varied considerably across cancer
sites. For example, the survival rate for colon cancer increased from 41% to 63%, while
the survival rate from prostate cancer increased from 43% to 98%. We hypothesized that
these differential rates of progress were partly attributable to different rates of
pharmaceutical innovation for different types of cancer. The rate of increase of the stock

26
of drugs also varied considerably across cancer sites in a given period, and also across
periods for a given cancer site. For example, between 1969 and 2002, there was a 4.4fold increase in the stock of drugs for breast cancer, and an 8-fold increase in the stock of
drugs for prostate cancer. Also, the stock of drugs for colon and rectum cancer remained
constant from 1974 to 1980, but then doubled from 1980 to 1982.
We tested this hypothesis within a “differences in differences” framework, by
estimating models of cancer mortality rates using longitudinal, annual, cancer-site-level
data based on records of 2.1 million people diagnosed with cancer during the period
1975-1995. The explanatory variable of primary interest was the (lagged value of the)
cumulative number of cancer drugs approved to treat that cancer type. The following
covariates were also included in the model: fixed cancer site effects, fixed year effects,
incidence, stage distribution of diagnosed patients, mean age at diagnosis, percent of
patients having surgery, and percent of patients having radiation. Including these
variables is likely to control for the effect of technological advances in diagnostic
procedures.
We argued that estimation of hazard-rate models was better suited to our purposes
than estimation of survival-rate models, and we estimated separate hazard models for
each of the years following diagnosis. Overall, the estimates indicated that cancers for
which the stock of drugs increased more rapidly tended to have larger reductions in
hazard rates. In hazard-rate models for the first eight years after diagnosis, the coefficient
on the drug stock was negative three times as often as it was positive, and it was negative
and significant twice as often as it was positive and significant. Moreover, the
coefficient on the drug stock was negative in the first three years (and significant in the
first two), when the hazard rate is highest. The estimates provided no support for the
hypothesis that the introduction of a first-in-class drug increases cancer survival more
than the introduction of subsequent drugs within the class.
We used the estimates of the drug-stock coefficients to assess the effect of new
drug introductions on the cancer survival distribution function and on life expectancy at
time of diagnosis. The estimates implied that, ceteris paribus—holding constant the
cancer site- and stage-distribution, cancer incidence, mean age at diagnosis, and the
probability of surgery and radiation—the 1975-1995 increase in the stock of drugs

27
increased the 1-year crude cancer survival rate from 69.4% to 76.1%, the 5-year rate from
45.5% to 51.3%, and the 10-year rate from 34.2% to 38.1%. The increase in the stock of
drugs accounted for about 50-60% of the increase in age-adjusted survival rates in the
first 6 years after diagnosis.
Although the surgical treatment rate had a significant negative effect on hazard
rates in a number of years, there was very little change in the overall surgical treatment
rate during the sample period. Hence, our estimates imply that changes in the surgical
treatment rate (and in the radiation treatment rate) had a negligible impact on cancer
survival rates during this period.
We also estimated that the 1975-1995 increase in the lagged stock of drugs made
the life expectancy of people diagnosed with cancer in 1995 just over a year greater than
the life expectancy of people diagnosed with cancer in 1975. This figure increased from
about 9.6 to 10.6 years. This is very similar to the estimate of the contribution of
pharmaceutical innovation to longevity increase I obtained in an earlier study, although
that study was based on a very different sample (all diseases in 52 countries) and
methodology.
Since the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer is about 40%, the estimates
imply that the 1975-1995 increase in the lagged stock of cancer drugs increased the life
expectancy of the entire U.S. population by 0.4 years, and that new cancer drugs
accounted for 10.7% of the overall increase in U.S. life expectancy at birth.
The estimated cost to achieve the additional year of life per person diagnosed with
cancer is well below recent estimates of the value of a statistical life-year. The average
amount spent on (new and old) cancer drugs by a cancer patient from time of diagnosis
until death in 1995 was apparently below $3000. Previous authors estimate that the value
of a statistical U.S. life-year is in the neighborhood of $150,000.
Ideally, we would have measured the effect of new cancer drugs on the number of
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), but we were unable to do so due to lack of data.
While new cancer drugs appear to have increased the longevity of cancer survivors by
about a year, quality of life in that additional year is likely to have been much less than 1.
However, if new cancer drugs increased the quality of life of people as well as delayed

28
their death, the increase in QALYS is not necessarily less than the increase in life
expectancy.
