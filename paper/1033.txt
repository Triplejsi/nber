MONEY, CREDIT AND NONFINANCIAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY:
AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF FIVE COUNTRIES

Abstract

Data for five major industrialized economies show that the relationship
between credit and nonfinancial economic activity exhibits stability comparable

to that of the relationship between money and economic activity. Specific
orderings among a narrow monetary aggregate, a broad monetary aggregate and
a credit aggregate differ depending upon the stability criterion being applied

and the country under study. On balance, credit exhibits the most stable
contemporaneous relationship among the three aggregates, while the narrow
money stock exhibits the most stable dynamic relationship with credit in
second place and the broad money stock third.
Further tests for the same five economies also show that, within the

total of nonfinancial debt comprising the aggregate, the respective public
and private debt components exhibit movements over time that offset one
another, and hence act to maintain the stability of total credit in relation
to economic activity.

Finally, additional tests for these five economies do not support
the notion that the comparability of the respective relationships of credit
and money to nonfinancial economic activity is due to any straightforward
process whereby ttmoney causes income and income causes credit." The
interrelationships among money, credit, real income and prices in each
economy are too complex to admit of any such simple interpretation.

MONEY, CREDIT AND NONFINANCIAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY:
AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF FIVE COUNTRIES

Benjamin M. Friedman*
Harvard University

Recent research for the United States has shown that one particular
credit aggregate, the outstanding indebtedness of all nonfinancial borrowers,
bears as close and as stable a relationship to the economy's nonfinancial

activity as do any of the monetary aggregates or the monetary base) Moreover, in contrast to the monetary aggregates, among which there seems to
be little basis for choice from this perspective, total nonfinancial debt

appears to be unique in this regard among major credit aggregates. Hence
unlike the monetary (and broader asset-side) aggregates, the stability
of

the relationship for total nonfinancial debt does not just represent

the stability

of a sum of

stable parts.

The stability of the relationship between total nonfinancial debt
and economic activity bears several potentially important implications for

economic analysis as well as economic policy. From a theoretical perspective, this finding calls into question the conventional structure of macroeconomic models, which explicitly represents the supply-demand equilibrium

for the money market but not for the credit market, With respect to monetary
policy, the stability of the credit-to—income relationship immediately
suggests that, as long as a central bank operates within an intermediate
target framework, perhaps one of its principal targets should be a credit

aggregate. With respect to fiscal policy, some of the behavioral hypotheses
that are consistent with this finding have direct implications for whether
debt—financed government spending (or tax cuts) can provide an effective

—2—

economic stimulus or can merely "crowd out" private spending.

The object of this paper is to show that the finding of a stable
relationship between credit and nonfinancial economic activity is in no

way unique to the United States. Sections I-IV replicate for data from

four additional countries — Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom

— the comparative analyses of the credit-to—income versus money—to—income
relationships previously carried out for U.S. data. These tests span a
variety of methodologies including simple comparisons of coefficients of
variation (Section I), nominal income regressions (II), vector autoregression

generalizations of nominal income regressions (III), and vector autoregres-

sion analysis of private and government debt interactions (Iv). Section V
presents a further vector autoregression analysis for each country, addressing
the question of whether the explanation for the stability of the credit-toincome relationship is simply that money "causes" income while income "causes"
credit.

and

(The answer is no.) Section VI summarizes the empirical findings

offers

brief concluding comments.

Comparison of Money and

Credit

"Velocities"

Each panel of Figure 1 shows, for a particular country, the movement
over time of three different ratios relating three of that country's financial aggregates to its nonfinancial economic activity as measured by gross
national product.

2

The three financial aggregates are in each case a narrow

money

stock measure ("Ml"),

total

nonfinancial

a broad money stock measure ("M2" or "M3") and

debt ("credit"). The data plotted are quarterly values

for Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. They are annual
for Germany (where quarterly credit data are unavailable). The specific
sample periods used for the five countries differ according to data availability as of the time of writing, and each series is indexed to 100 at its
inception to facilitate ready comparisons.
Table 1 summarizes the stability of these fifteen ratios by showing

their respective coefficients of variation (standard deviation normalized
by mean), computed first from the raw data plotted in Figure 1 and then

from detrended data. What stands out most in intra—country comparisons
of coefficients of variation computed from the raw data is simply the difference, already apparent in Figure 1, between those aggregates that exhibit

time trends in their respective "reciprocal velocity" ratios — for example,
Ml in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.; M2 in Canada and M3 in Germany; and
credit

in Germany and the U.K. — and

those that exhibit little or no trend.

Even so, as judged from the raw data, the credit ratio is more stable than
either of the money ratios in three of the five countries.
On the basis of the detrended data, the credit ratio is more stable

than either of the money ratios in four of the five countries. Only in
Canada does either of the monetary aggregates (actually both, for Canada)

exhibit a more stable ratio to income than does credit. (Interestingly enough,

FINANCIAL AGGREGATES AS RATIOS TO INCOME FOR FIVE COUNTRIES

Canada is one of the three countries for which the credit ratio is the most

stable on the basis of the raw data.) A comparison of the two monetary
aggregates, across the four countries in which the credit ratio is more
stable than either one, shows that the Ml ratio is more stable than that
for M2 or M3 in all but Japan.

In sum, intra—country comparisons of the respective coefficients of
variation of the ratios to gross national product of three financial aggregates

— narrow money, broad money, and credit —

show that credit consistently

exhibits either the closest, or nearly the closest, relationship to nonfinancial economic activity.

II. Comparison of Nominal Income Regressions
Because most of the interesting aspects of financial—nonfinancial
interactions are presumably dynamic, simple ratios of contemporaneous

observations like those presented in Section I probably fail to capture
the concept of "stability" that is relevant for either analyzing economic

behavior or formulating economic policy. Relationships admitting a lead
or lag pattern provide more useful stability measures.
Table 2 presents summary statistics for equations estimated for

the same data analyzed in Section I, for each country, relating the growth
of nominal gross national product to a moving average of the growth of each
of the three financial aggregates listed in Table 1, plus a moving average

of a fiscal policy measure. Each equation is estimated in the familiar
form

where Y is gross national product; F is any of the three aggregates; E is

and the y. are estimated scalar coefficients; and the 13. and

constrained to lie along fourth-degree polynomials with the implied l =

For the four sets of equations based on

quarterly data, the lag lengths are N = 4.
based on armual data are N =

with the 13.

For Germany the lag lengths

and y. unconstrained.4

For researchers familiar with nominal income regressions based on
U.S. data, perhaps the most striking feature of the results shown in Table 2
is not the intra—country comparisons at all but the inter—country comparisons

of overall performance. In contrast to the three U.S. regressions, not one
of the twelve non—U.S. regressions has a standard error smaller than .010

—6—

(that is, 4% per annum for quarterly data). Only two of the twelve non-U.S.

regressions, those based on Ml for Canada and Germany, have coefficients of

determination above .20; and neither of these two have Durbin-Watson coeffi-

cients close to 2.00. Relationships of this kind apparently have much less
ability to "explain" the variation of nominal income in countries other
than the United States, perhaps because of the greater openness of their
respective economies.
The within—country comparisons indicate that the equation based on
Ml has the greatest explanatory power for three of the five countries.
The equation based on credit performs best for the other two countries,

and is second-best in two of the three for which Ml is superior. Only in
the case of Germany does credit not outperform at least one of the two

monetary aggregates

III. Comparison of Multivariate Vector Autoregressions
Because of widespread criticisms of the methodology underlying
nominal income regressions like those in Section II, researchers investigating the money—to—income (or, here, credit—to—income) relationship have

increasingly turned to methods that relate the variation of income not to
the entirety of the variation of money but to that part of it which cannot
already be deduced either from the past history of money itself or from

the joint past history of both money and income.6 A useful approach to
analyzing the dynamic interrelationships among economic time series in this

way is the vector autoregression.7 In brief, the vector autoregression
methodology first expresses each of a system of variables as a function of
lagged values of itself, lagged values of the other variables, and a disturbance term; then solves this representation to express each variable as a
function of the entire history of the disturbances associated with it and
the other variables; and, finally, investigates the direction and magnitude
of the response of each variable to given independent shocks, or "innovations,"

to any or all variables in the system. The vector autoregression is straightforward to estimate empirically, and simulation of the solved-out system
can then show the system—wide reactions that follow in response to innovations
in particular variables.

A representation of the money—to—income or credit—to—income relationship that is more general along these lines (but that omits the fiscal policy
variable, to keep the system small) is the vector autoregression

p1 and p2 would contain all the information that the vector autoregression
system can provide, but it is easier to think intuitively about the implications of such a simulation when it is possible to identify as its driving

force an independent innovation in either F or Y. Hence it is useful either
to subtract out of p1 that part of its variation that is correlated with
p2 so as to leave the residual to represent the independent innovation in
F or, alternatively, to subtract out of p2 that part of its variation that
is correlated with p1 so as to leave the residual to represent the independent

innovation in Y. The orthogonalization of (3) that extracts the independent

German annual data, the table shows values for the first five years.

By construction, Y remains unaffected in the initial period in which
an independent innovation occurs in F, so that in each case the F/Y ratio

rises by the full 1% of the innovation in F. In each system, however, the
bulge in F/Y shrinks as Y rises or F declines, or both. The question of the
stability of the relationship between F and Y is then a matter of the speed

and smoothness with which the bulge disappears. In the absence of a largely
arbitrary judgment of the exact time horizon that is relevant, any comparisons

among these results a±nit interpretation in a descriptive way only. Even
so, the intra—country comparisons are suggestive in several respects.

The most straightforward aspect of these comparisons is the relatively

weak performance of the broader monetary aggregate. Only for Canada do
the simulation results show the ratio of M2 to income returning rapidly to

its baseline after the one—period impulse innovation in M2. For Japan the
M2 ratio's return is slower, and for Germany it is scarcely noticeable.
For both the United Kingdom and the United States, an M3 or M2 innovation
induces still further movements of the respective ratio away from the
baseline, followed by substantial over—correction on the return.
The comparison between Ml and credit on this criterion of stability

is much closer, although on balance Ml has the edge. After an innovation
in Ml, the Ml-to-income ratio returns to its baseline quite quickly in three
countries, and moderately so in a fourth (Canada) .

Only for Japan is the

return somewhat slow and unsteady. Credit performs well in this context
in two countries (Germany and the United States) and moderately well in

a third (Japan). For Canada, however, the return of the credit ratio shows
substantial over—correction, and for the United Kingdom it shows both slow-

ness and over—correction. By a rough margin of one country out of five,

—11—

therefore, Ml appears to have the more stable relationship to income in
this context.

A further element in the tendency of recent researchers to eschew
reliance on simple nominal income regressions like those in Section II has
been an increasing reluctance to focus on the relationship between money
(or, here, credit) and nominal income without distinguishing between the

real and price components of nominal income variation.11 Table 4 presents

The Mi—to—income ratio returns rapidly and smoothly to its baseline after
an innovation in Ml in two countries, the United Kingdom and the United

States, and moderately so in two others, Canada and Japan. (It is interesting
that the one exception here is Germany, while in the bivariate results the

one country for which Ml performs poorly is Japan.) The credit—to—income
ratio also returns to its baseline rapidly and smoothly in two countries,

here Germany and the United States. In Canada and the United Kingdom,
however, the credit ratio exhibits a temporary but substantial over—correction,
and in Japan the over-correction is fairly modest but persistent nonetheless.
Canada is again the only country for which the broader money ratio shows
strong stability on this criterion, although the respective M2 results for
Germany and the United States also show stability after some delay.
On balance, the intra-country comparisons of stability in bivariate

and trivariate vector autoregression generalizations of the more familiar
nominal income regressions suggest, somewhat weakly, that the money—to—
income relationship is either more or less stable than the credit—to—income

relationship according to whether the "money" in question is a narrow or

a broad monetary aggregate, respectively. This conclusion about the relative
stability among the three aggregates in this sense is somewhat different
from that indicated by nominal income regressions themselves, and quite
different from that indicated by comparisons of coefficients of variation.

Hence the specific criterion for judging stability appears to be important

for the implied ordering. Moreover, the country-by-country differences
between the results shown in Tables 3 and 4 further reinforce the importance
of the choice of criterion, in that even the difference between bivariate
and trivariate autoregressions can alter the results for any given country.

IV.

Interactions Between Public and Private Debt

n argument for the stability of an aggregate inevitably relies on
some notion of negative covariance among that aggregate's components. Moreover, as the analysis in Sections II and III has emphasized, for many purposes
what is important is not just the precisely contemporaneous covariation

but the joint movement of two or more series over time. In the case of an
economy's total nonfinancial debt ratio, stability requires that movements
in any one sector's debt relative to economic activity typically be offset
by movements in the opposite direction in at least some other sector's debt.
The vector autoregression methodology used in Section III to examine
the dynamic covariation between aggregate credit and income in each country
is equally suitable for analyzing the dynamic covariation among the respective debt totals of different sectors comprising each country's aggregate

credit. Although in principle it would be possible to apply this analytical
apparatus to as full a disaggregation as each country's data sources permit,
doing so would yield so many partial relationships as to confound rather than

enhance understanding. Hence some more compact —that is, more fully

aggregated — way of organizing the data is needed. In light of the
theoretical literature on financial aspects of fiscal policy, one procedure
that makes sense intuitively is to distinguish between the government and
private

By construction, whichever of CG/Y or CP/Y does not experience the
1% innovation in the first year remains unchanged in that year, so that the

aggregate debt ratio (CG+CP)/Y also rises by 1%. Soon thereafter, in most
cases, a gradual decay in the component ratio experiencing the innovation
and an induced offsetting response in the other component ratio combine to

return the aggregate ratio to (or at least toward) the pre-innovation
baseline. For an innovation in the government debt ratio, the simulations
for Canada, the United Kingdom arid the United States all show prompt interactions of this kind, and those for Germany arid Japan do as well (albeit

more slowly in Germany) after a counter—stable reaction in the second year.14
For an innovation in the private debt ratio, the simulations for Japan, the
United Kingdom and the United States all show this stable pattern, and that

for Germany does also except for some over-correction. In sum, except only
for Japan in the case of an innovation in the government debt ratio and
Canada in the case of an innovation in the private debt ratio, these results

provide evidence of offsetting dynamic interactions between public and
private debt behavior that tend to restore the stability (in relation to
income) of their sum in the context of a disturbance in either one.

V. Questions of Causality
The finding that the stability of the credit-to-income relationship
is comparable to that of the money-to—income relationship is interesting

in many respects. Nevertheless, its potential importance for issues of
economic analysis and economic policy fundamentally depends on the behavior

underlying this empirical phenomenon. Alternative behavioral mechanisms,
each consistent with this basic observation, imply different answers to
familiar questions about individuals' and firms' perceptions, about their
actions in the financial markets, about the connection between spending—
saving decisions and borrowing—lending decisions, and about the effects of
monetary arid

fiscal

policies. Investigating the behavioral determinants

of the stability of the credit-to-income relationship conätitutes a major
challenge for macroeconomic research, but one that lies well beyond the
scope of this paper.15

Even at the outset, however, it is important to clarify one dimension
of the uncertainty surrounding the source (or sources) of the stability of

the relationship between aggregate credit and income. In particular, this
finding would be of limited usefulness if credit were merely the "tail"

being wagged by the "dog" consisting of the rest of the economy — that
is, if the other major aspects of economic activity were predetermined with

respect to credit, rather than jointly determined along with credit. The
same proposition also holds, of course, for the relationship between economic

activity and money (however measured). A stable money—to—income relationship is of little value for economic policy if variations in money are simply
after—the—fact responses to variations in nonfinancial economic activity.
In the context of this paper's focus on intra—country comparisons

of money versus credit, the important question is whether credit is more or

—17—

less fundamentally bound up in the joint determination of nonfinancial

economic activity than is money. Does money "cause" income while income

in turn "causes" credit? Is the reverse true? Does some dichotomy render
nonfinancial activity predetermined with respect to both money and credit?
Or are money and credit both jointly determined along with behavior in
nonfinancial markets?

Following Granger [5] and Sims [8, 10], Table 6 presents test statistics based on the estimation of (8), with first the Ml money stock and then

credit used as the financial aggregate. The estimation again includes
eight quarters of lags on each variable in each system based on quarterly

data. Because the choice of lag length affected the results in the system
based on German annual data, the table presents separate results for Germany
based on lags of two years and four years, respectively, on each variable.

For each variable in each estimated equation, the table reports the F—statistic for a test of the null hypothesis that all of the 13..

that variable in that equation are zero —

in

coefficients

on

other words, the hypothesis

that that particular independent variable does not incrementally contribute
to explaining the variation of the dependent variable in that equation,
beyond the explanation already provided by the other included variables.
Although there is little uniformity in results across the five countries
(apart from the tendency of each variable to be significantly related to its

own past history), these test statistics do not support the notion that
money affects nonfinancial economic activity in some sense that credit

does not. The coefficients on the lagged money values are significantly
different from zero at the .10 level in the real income equations in Canada,
the United Kingdom and the United States, while the analogous coefficients
on credit significantly differ from zero only for Germany and the United

States.16 By contrast, the money coefficients are significantly different
from zero in the price equations only for Japan, while the analogous credit
coefficients are significantly nonzero not only for Japan but also for
Canada and the United States.

The results are somewhat more consistent with the notion that money
is predetermined with respect to nonfinancial economic activity while credit

is not. Apart from the results for Germany, which differ here according to
the lag length, the respective sets of coefficients on real income and
prices are both insignificantly different from zero at the .10 level in the

money equations for all countries except the United States. In the credit
equations the coefficients on income are significantly nonzero only for
Canada (and for Germany with two years of lags); but the coefficients on
prices are nonzero for Canada, Japan and the United States (and again Germany
with two years of lags).
If neither money nor credit is in the situation of simply being

affected by nonfinancial activity while not affecting it, then systems that
exclude one aggregate or the other —'--like those underlying the results

shown in Table 6 — are misspecified. Table 7 presents analogous test
statistics based on the estimation of a four—variable vector autoregression
that generalizes (8) by including both Ml and credit (in addition to real
income and prices, as before).
The results for these four—variable systems do not support the idea

that money affects nonfinancial economic activity in some way that credit
does not, nor the idea that money is predetermined with respect to economic

activity in some way that credit is not. In the equations for real income
the coefficients on money are significantly nonzero only in the case of
Canada, while the coefficients on credit are significantly nonzero only in

—19—

the case of Germany.17 In the price equations, the coefficients on money
are significantly nonzero Only for Japan, while the coefficients on credit

are significantly nonzero for Canada, Japan and the United States. In the
equations for money, the coefficients on real income are significantly
nonzero only for the United States, while the coefficients on prices are

significantly nonzero for Germany and the United States. In the credit
equations the coefficients on real income are significantly nonzero only
for Germany, while the coefficients on both prices and money are significant
for Canada and Germany.

Although the results of these two sets of exogeneity tests add little
to understanding of the economic behavior connecting money, credit and

nonfinancial economic activity, they do show that there is no evidence to
warrant dismissing the observed stability of the credit-to-income relation-

ship on the supposed ground that behavior in the credit market — unlike

that in the money market —

is

determined after the fact, without effect

on behavior in nonfinancial markets.

—20—

VI. Summary of Conclusions
A series of different tests, based on a range of methodologies and
on data for five major industrialized economies, shows that the relationship
between credit and nonfinancial economic activity exhibits stability that
is comparable to that of the relationship between money and economic activity.
Specific orderings among a narrow monetary aggregate, a broad monetary aggregate
and a credit aggregate (defined in each case as total nonfinancial debt)

differ depending upon the stability criterion being applied and the country

under study. To the extent that the results as a whole admit of generalization, credit exhibits the most stable contemporaneous relationship among
the three aggregates, while the narrow money stock exhibits the most stable

dynamic relationship with credit in second place and the broad money stock
third. Further tests also show that, within the total nonfinancial debt
(credit) aggregate, the respective public and private debt components exhibit

movements over time that offset one another, and hence act to maintain the
stability of total credit in relation to economic activity.

Moreover, additional tests for the same five economies do not support
the notion that the comparability of the respective relationships of credit
and money to nonfinancial economic activity is due to any simple process

whereby "money causes income and income causes credit." The interrelationships
among money, credit, real income and prices in each economy are too complex

to admit of any such straightforward interpretation. Hence the economic
behavior underlying the stability of the credit—to—income relationship

reamins a major puzzle — though, on reflection, no more so than the stability
of the money-to-income relationship (for any "inside" definition of money).
Unraveling that puzzle is an important and challenging task for

macroeconomic research. In the meanwhile, the empirical fact that the

—21—

credit—to—income relationship is roughly as stable as the money—to—income
relationship raises important caveats about the conventional focus of macro—
economic theory on the economy's assets but not its liabilities, about
the conventional inclusion in macroeconomic models of an explicit representation of the money market but not the credit market, and about the convention focus of central bank policy on monetary aggregates but not credit
aggregates.

2. For the monetary aggregates these ratios are the reciprocals of the
familiar "income velocity" measures. In the case of the United Kingdom,
the income measure is gross domestic product.
3. In the case of Japan, the Only available series for E is not seasonally
adjusted. The three regressions for Japanese data therefore also include seasonal dummy variables. Once again, in the case of the United
Kingdom the income measure is gross domestic product.

4. The choice of N = 2 versus N = 4 slightly affects the ordering in the
regressions for the German annual data. With N = 4 (and th polynomial
constraint on the . and y.) the respective sets of (SE, R , DW)
values are (.0232, .16, l.6) for Ml, (.0336, —, 1.16) for M2 and
(.0357, —, 1.26) for credit.

5. With both - 2 values negative, it is difficult to say that credit
"outperforms" M3 despite the slight difference in standard errors.
Also, see again footnote 4.

6. The most prominent criticisms of nominal income regressions like (1)
have focused on the assumption of exogeneity with respect to nominal
income of the two right—hand—side variables, as well as on the failure
to distinguish the autoregressively deterministic from stochastic
components of the variation of all three variables. See, for example,
Goldfeld and Blinder [4], Sargent [7], and Modigliani and 7ndo [6].
See Section V below for tests of the exogeneity assumption for the
money or credit aggregates.
7. See Sims [9] for a discussion of the vector autoregression methodology
and its underlying rationale.
8. The use of levels of logarithms in (2) instead of differences of
logarithms as in (1) has essentially no effect as long as the lag
lengths of the B.. are sufficient to provide roots near the unit circle.
(If no roots nearthe unit circle are needed, then the differencing in
(1) is incorrect in the first place.) Including a time trend in (2)
would in general make a difference, but for the U.S. data results
based on the alternative specification including a time trend differed
little from those shown in Table 3 below.

9. The alternate orthogonalization that extracts E.) as the independent
innovation in y simply reverses the off-diagona' positions of 0 and
A in (5) and (6), with var(1j1) replacing var(p2) in the denominator
of (7).

10. Results based on U.S. data indicated that the response of F/Y to
independent innovations in Y show little difference according to which
aggregate

11.

is used for F; see Friedman [31.

The exogeneity tests presented in Section V below provide further
support for distinguishing movements of real income and prices.

12. Results based on U.S. data indicated that the response of F/(X.P)

to

independent innovations in either X or P show little difference
according to which aggregate is used for F; see again Friedman [31.

13. How to treat the debt of sub—national governmental jurisdictions for
this purpose is a subtle question. The procedure followed here was
to treat as "public" only the debts of national governments, as far
as the available data permitted drawing distinctions.
14. The individual components of the simulation for Germany in the second
year show a movement to 1.18 in CG/Y, offset in part by an induced
reaction of - .15 in CP/Y. The (CG+CP)/Y ratio continues to decline
after the fifth year, falling below .10 in the ninth year.

15. See Friedman [1] for a beginning along these lines.
16.

These results for the United States differ from those reported in
Friedman

[2], which were based on a different sample period and a
different definition of money.

17. This result for the United States again differs from that reported in
Friedman [2] for a different sample period and a different definition
of money. The German results shown are for N = 2; in the results
for N = 4 (not shown), nothing was significant except F(X) in the
equation for X.
