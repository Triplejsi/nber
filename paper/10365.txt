The Impact of Nearly Universal Insurance Coverage on Health Care Utilization and Health:
Evidence from Medicare

NBER Working Paper No. 10365

JEL No. I12, I18
ABSTRACT
We use the increases in health insurance coverage at age 65 generated by the rules of the
Medicare program to evaluate the effects of health insurance coverage on health related behaviors
and outcomes. The rise in overall coverage at age 65 is accompanied by a narrowing of disparities
across race and education groups. Groups with bigger increases in coverage at 65 experience bigger
reductions in the probability of delaying or not receiving medical care, and bigger increases in the
probability of routine doctor visits. Hospital discharge records also show large increases in
admission rates at age 65, especially for elective procedures like bypass surgery and joint
replacement. The rises in hospitalization are bigger for whites than blacks, and for residents of areas
with higher rates of insurance coverage prior to age 65, suggesting that the gains arise because of
the relative generosity of Medicare, rather than the availability of insurance coverage. Finally, there
are small impacts of reaching age 65 on self-reported health, with the largest gains among the groups
that experience the largest gains in insurance coverage. In contrast we find no evidence of a shift in
the rate of growth of mortality rates at age 65.

One fifth of non-elderly adults in the United States lacked health insurance in 2002.1
Insured people are healthier than the uninsured, leading many analysts to conclude that access to
health insurance is a public policy concern.2 Nevertheless, credible evidence that insurance
coverage causes better health is limited (Levy and Meltzer, 2001). Insured and uninsured people
exhibit many behavioral differences that are correlated with health, including diet, smoking,
exercise, and seatbelt use.3 Moreover, both the supply and demand for insurance depend on
health status, creating simultaneity biases that could confound any causal effect of insurance
coverage on health. Indeed, the only randomized evaluation of free health insurance – the
RAND Health Insurance Experiment of the late 1970s – found insignificant impacts of insurance
on the health status of the overall population (Newhouse et al, 1993).
An ideal study of the causal effects of health insurance would randomly assign some
people to universal coverage and others to the current system. While no such experiments are in
progress or currently planned, in this paper we argue that the Medicare eligibility rules create a
reasonably close approximation to this ideal, with “randomization” based on whether an
individual is just under or just over age 65.4 The dramatic effects of Medicare eligibility on
health insurance coverage are illustrated in Figure 1, which shows coverage rates by quarter of
age from the 1992-2001 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). The solid line in the figure

According to tabulations of the 2002 March Current Population Survey reported in Table 1 of Mills and Bhandari
(2003), 19.5 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 64 had no health insurance coverage.

Recent policy initiatives for expanding health insurance coverage among lower income adults are summarized in
Krebs-Carter and Holohan (2002).
3
For example, among 50-64 year olds in the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System sample, 20% of
people with insurance smoke, compared with 30% of uninsured people; 75% of the insured exercise at least once
per month, compared with 61% of the uninsured; 82% of the insured always wear seat belts in a car, compared to
78% of the uninsured; and 88% of the insured eat a green salad at least once a week, compared with 79% of the
uninsured.

Previous researchers have used the age 65 boundary to look at health related outcomes, including Lichtenberg
(2001), Decker and Rapaport (2002), and McWilliams et al. (2003). Our contribution is to examine a wider
variety of measures of access, utilization, and health, to quantify inter-group differences in responses to Medicare
eligibility, and to focus on alternative causal channels for reaching age 65 to impact health care use and health
outcomes.

represents the coverage rate for the overall population, which rises from 90 percent to 98 percent
at age 65.5 Even more striking is the impact on differences across socio-economic groups. Prior
to age 65 less-educated minorities (blacks, Asians, and Hispanics with less than 12 years of
education) have about 20 percent lower coverage rates than more-educated whites. After age 65
the gap narrows to 5 percentage points. If insurance coverage has a causal effect one would
expect discontinuous changes in the age profiles of health outcomes at age 65, and a narrowing
of inter-group disparities after age 65.
In this paper we combine information from several sources to measure the impacts of
Medicare eligibility on health-related outcomes. We use survey data from the NHIS and the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to examine changes in self-reported
barriers to accessing care, and changes in the number of recent doctor visits, hospital stays, and
frequency of diagnostic testing at age 65. We use hospital discharge records from California and
Florida to examine changes in the number and characteristics of hospital admissions at age 65.
We examine the age profiles of health-related behaviors (smoking, exercise) and self-reported
health using NHIS and BRFSS data. Finally, we use micro data from the multiple cause of death
files to study trends in death rates around age 65. Throughout the paper we focus on the
differential impacts of Medicare eligibility on different subgroups, and on the question of
whether these impacts arise through changes in insurance coverage or alternative channels.
As in other regression discontinuity studies, the key assumption in our research design is
that measures of health care access, utilization and health status would evolve smoothly with age
in the absence of the discrete change in insurance coverage at age 65. This implies that
Medicare eligibility is “as good as randomly assigned” among individuals who are just a little
5

As we discuss below, Medicare is not universal: an individual or their spouse must have a minimum of 40 quarters
of work to be eligible. Medicare is also available to people under 65 in the Disability Insurance program.

4

older or a little younger than 65.6 Although this assumption cannot be fully tested, it can be
evaluated by checking for discontinuities in potential confounding variables like employment,
income, and family structure. All the potential confounding variables we examine trend
smoothly through the age 65 barrier, suggesting that any discontinuities in health-related
outcomes can be attributed to Medicare eligibility.
We reach five main conclusions. First, Medicare eligibility sharply reduces disparities in
access to medical care. Groups with large increases in insurance coverage at age 65 experience
systematic reductions in the probability of delaying or not receiving medical care. These groups
also experience increases in the probability of visiting a doctor at least once per year, and in the
frequency of routine medical checkups. It is less clear whether Medicare eligibility leads to
increases in specific preventative care procedures, such as blood cholesterol testing,
mammography, or testing for prostate cancer, though this is partly an issue of statistical power.
Second, eligibility for Medicare leads to a large (10 percent) rise in hospital stays, with the
majority of the increase in non-emergency admissions and hospitalizations for elective
procedures like joint replacements and bypass surgery. Contrary to an insurance-based causal
explanation, however, the rise in hospitalizations is larger for whites than blacks or Hispanics,
and larger for residents of areas with higher insurance coverage rates prior to age 65. Third,
reaching age 65 has no systematic effect on smoking, exercise, or obesity. Fourth, Medicare
eligibility appears to have small but discernable effects on the level of self-reported health, with
larger gains for groups whose insurance coverage rates increased the most after becoming
Medicare eligible. Fifth, we find no evidence of an immediate impact of Medicare eligibility on
mortality rates at age 65, nor of a systematic change in the growth rate of mortality after 65,

Lee (2003) presents a formal framework for identification in a regression discontinuity framework.

though the latter finding must be interpreted cautiously in light of the difficulty in determining
mortality trends in the absence of Medicare.
I. Empirical Approach and Relation to Existing Literature
Our empirical analysis is based on a simple causal model of the effect of health insurance
coverage on health outcomes:
(1)

yija = Xijaαj + fj(a) + Cijaδj + uija ,

where yija is a measured outcome for individual i in group j at age a, Xija represents a set of
measured characteristics with group-specific coefficients (αj), fj(a) is a smooth function
representing the age profile of the outcome y (e.g., a low order polynomial), Cija is a dummy
variable indicating whether individual i has insurance coverage, and uija is an unobserved error
component. There are a number of difficult issues underlying the specification of equation (1).
One problem is that health insurance is heterogeneous (Levy and Meltzer, 2001). This is
important because at age 65 many people who were previously covered by other forms of
insurance switch to Medicare. Since Medicare has different reimbursement rates and coverage
provisions than other insurance packages, this switch could have a causal effect even in the
absence of any change in coverage. A second and related issue is that the shape of the age
profile fj(a) may be influenced by the presence of Medicare. For example, 64 year-olds may
delay certain medical procedures until after age 65 in anticipation of Medicare coverage.7 Such
behavior will complicate inferences based on changes from before to after 65. Third, even
within groups the causal effect of health insurance may differ across people. Heterogeneity in δj
introduces the usual problem of distinguishing between average treatment effects and the effect
for those whose insurance status changes at age 65 (Angrist and Imbens, 1995).

7

The evidence reported later in this paper shows no evidence of anticipatory behavior.

6

Setting these issues aside for the moment, the key problem in estimating equation (1) is
that health insurance coverage is endogenous. For example, if people with pre-existing
conditions cannot obtain health insurance, the error term will be correlated with coverage,
leading to a positive bias in the estimated effect of coverage on health. Conversely, if healthy
people are more likely to go without insurance there will be an upward bias in the estimated
effect of insurance on medical care utilization and a downward bias in the estimated effect on
health.8 The age limit for Medicare eligibility at 65 provides a candidate instrumental variable
for insurance coverage. As shown in Figure 1, insurance coverage rates increase sharply as
individuals pass their 65th birthday, implying that the instrument has a powerful effect.
Let Da denote an indicator for being 65 or older, and consider the following first stage
model for insurance coverage:
(2)

Cija = Xija βCj + gCj(a) + Da πCj + vCija ,

where βCj is a vector of group-specific coefficients, gCj(a) is the age profile in coverage for group
j and Da is a dummy for Medicare eligibility. Combining (1) and (2), the reduced form model for
the health outcome y is
(3)

yija = Xija βyj + gyj(a) + Da πyj + vyija ,

where βyj is a group-specific set of coefficients, gyj(a) is a smooth age profile, and πyj = πCj × δj
is the reduced form effect of reaching age 65 on outcome y. The (population) instrumental
variables estimate of the causal effect δj is just the ratio of the reduced form coefficient of Da to
the corresponding first stage coefficient:
(4)

8

δIVj = πyj / πCj

.

See Bhattacharya and Vogt (2003) for a recent survey of adverse selection issues in the health insurance market.

7

In our empirical analysis, we fit models like (2) and (3) to individual outcome data using
OLS and probit estimators. Since the age profiles and the dummy Da are the same for all
individuals in the same age cell, however, identification of πCj and πyj comes from variation
across age cells.9 Suppressing the j subscripts for different groups, let Ca and ya denote the
population means of insurance coverage and the outcome variable in age cell a. Ignoring
variation in the X’s (or assuming the age cell means have been adjusted for any variation),
equations (2) and (3) imply:
(2a)

Ca = k1 + gC(a) + Da πC ,

(3a)

ya = k2 + gy(a) + Da πy .

Standard theoretical treatments of regression discontinuity methods assume that age is measured
continuously (e.g., Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaaw, 2001). Under this assumption, as long as
the g( ) functions are continuous, πC and πy can be estimated consistently by averaging C and y
in appropriate-sized windows on either side of age 65. In our data sets, however, age is
measured in coarse intervals (either a quarter or a year), so the difference in means between
people just over 65 and those just under 65 contains a potentially non-negligible trend
component that must be estimated parametrically. An advantage of a parametric approach is that
it provides some smoothing of the estimated means of the outcome data on either side of the 65
boundary.
The necessity of fitting a parametric model to the age profiles of C and y introduces an
important consideration for inference. If equation (2a) or (3a) is fit to cell means with a specific
functional form for the g(·) function, the error component will consist of sampling error in the
9

It is well known that OLS estimators of the age-related parameters in models like (2) or (3) can be obtained in two
stages, by first regressing the dependent variable on the X’s and unrestricted age dummies, and in the second stage
using the estimated age dummies as dependent variables to fit the age functions via a generalized least squares
procedure.

8

cell mean plus any specification error.10 Conventional standard errors obtained by estimating the
discontinuity with the cell mean data incorporate both components. If the same model is
estimated using the underlying micro data, however, any specification error will be ignored in
the calculation of the conventional standard errors. A simple remedy is to calculate the standard
errors for the micro level model allowing for a shared error component for all observations of the
same age (i.e., cluster by age). This method uses the variability in mean behavior around the
parametric age profile at other ages to estimate the sampling error of the estimated change at 65.
As illustrated in Figure 1, a key feature of Medicare is that it reduces disparities in health
insurance coverage across groups. This provides the basis for a test that the impact of Medicare
eligibility on a specific outcome arises through the effect on coverage, rather than through other
channels. Specifically, consider a regression of πyj (the reduced form estimate of the effect of
Medicare eligibility on outcome y for subgroup j) on πCj (the first stage estimate of the effect of
Medicare eligibility on health insurance coverage for subgroup j):
(5)

πyj = d0 + d1 πCj +

ej .

If Medicare eligibility only affects y through its effect on insurance coverage, and if the causal
effect of insurance coverage (δj) is constant across groups, then d0 = 0 and d1 = δ.11 On the other
hand, if the responses of outcome y to Medicare eligibility arise because of the more generous
Medicare coverage, then one might expect a non-zero constant in equation (5) and a less
systematic correlation between πyj and πCj. Even if Medicare eligibility only matters through
10

For example, let ma denote the observed mean of outcome y for age a, and let G(a)= k2 + gy(a) + Daπy represent
the parametric model. Then ma=G(a) + ( ma-ya ) + (ya-G(a)). One source of specification error is unobserved
cohort effects. In our estimation the potential for such effects is reduced by pooling several cross sections.
11
Another way to test strict proportionality between πCj and πyj is to combine the data for different subgroups, use
the interaction of Da and dummies for the different subgroups as instruments for insurance coverage, and perform
an over-identification test. In an over-identified model, the conventional IV estimator can be obtained from a
generalized least squares regression of the reduced form coefficients on the first stage coefficients. The overidentification test amounts to a test that the R-squared of this regression is close enough to 1, given the sampling
errors of the coefficients.

9

coverage, the intercept in equation (5) could be non-zero if there is significant heterogeneity in δj
across groups that is correlated with the size of πCj.12
An important concern with the use of the Medicare eligibility rules to infer the causal
effect of health insurance is that other factors may also change discretely at age 65. For
example, 65 is a relatively common retirement age (although two thirds of men and three
quarters of women have left the labor force by age 64). The potential for a variable like
employment status to confound the comparison of people on either side of age 65 can be
assessed by fitting a model like (2) for that variable, and testing for jumps at age 65. A specific
parameterization of the age profile function g(·) is “flexible enough” if there are no significant
jumps in the observed confounding variables at 65 when this age function is included in the
model.
A final point worth noting is that although we estimate models like (2) and (3) using
repeated cross sections of data, the models could be estimated using true longitudinal data.13 The
key advantage of longitudinal data is power: most behaviors and outcomes are strongly
positively correlated over time, so changes at age 65 can be estimated more precisely with
longitudinal data than with repeated cross sections. In the absence of true panel data, we
compensate by pooling data from different survey years to increase our sample sizes.

12

For example, let δ represent the mean value of δj , and assume that E[ δj-δ | πCj ] = λ πCj . Then E[ πyj | πCj ] = δ
πCj + λ (πCj)2 . If λ>0, πyj is a convex function of πCj and a linear regression will have a negative intercept, while
if λ< 0 the relationship is concave and the intercept of the linear regression will be positive.
13
McWilliams et al. (2003) use longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to examine
changes in some heath related outcomes from before to after age 65. Unfortunately, the HRS is only administered
every 2 years so it is not possible to isolate changes occurring from just before to just after age 65. Kasper et al.
(2000) use data from the Kaiser Survey of Family Health Experiences to look at changes in health outcomes that
occur with changes in insurance status (for non-elderly adults). Neither study tries to deal with the endogeneity of
insurance status.

10

II. Differences Among Insured and Uninsured Near-Elderly
To begin our empirical analysis, Table 1 shows some of the average characteristics of
near-elderly people (ages 62-64) with and without health insurance. The data in this Table are
drawn from the 1992-2001 NHIS and the 1998-2002 BRFSS. We present overall means in the
first column, means for the insured and uninsured in columns 2 and 3, and simple t-tests for the
difference in means by insurance status in the fourth column.
As has been shown in many other studies (e.g., Mills and Bhandari, 2003) insurance
status is highly correlated with marital status, race, and education. Health care access and
utilization rates also vary with insurance status. Uninsured people are more likely to report that
they delayed medical care or did not get care in the past year for cost reasons (as was recently
noted in Ayanian et al., 2000), and also report lower rates of use of medical services, including
routine doctor visits and diagnostic exams. Interestingly, the comparisons in Table 1 show that
the uninsured are less likely to report having been diagnosed with hypertension or heart-related
problems than people with insurance. This could reflect the fact that insurance is more valuable
for people with known health problems, or lack of awareness of latent conditions among the
uninsured. Despite lower reported rates of hypertension and heart problems, the uninsured have
lower self-assessed health, a pattern that is potentially supportive of an awareness explanation.
Some of the observed health differences between the insured and uninsured groups in
Table 1 are arguably a result of the different compositions of the two populations. Table 2
presents comparisons of some key outcomes by insurance status for four narrowly defined
subgroups, based on education (high school diploma or not) and ethnicity (white non-Hispanic or
not). For example, columns 2 and 3 of Table 2 compare the fractions of insured and uninsured
people in different subgroups who reported that they delayed receiving health care last year for

11

cost reasons. The rates for insured and uninsured people in the four subgroups are quite similar,
suggesting that insurance status is more important than education or ethnicity in explaining
reported delays in health care. A similar pattern holds for the probability of seeing a doctor at
least once in the past year (columns 5 and 6). Doctor visit rates for the insured fall in a narrow
range around 85 percent while rates for the uninsured center around 65 percent. For the other
outcomes in Table 2, however, incidence rates vary more across subgroups even holding
constant insurance status. For example, the probability of a hospital stay in the past year ranges
from 10 to 15 percent among insured people in different race/education groups, and from 5 to 9
percent among uninsured people. Mammography and cholesterol testing rates also vary
substantially by education, holding constant insurance status.
III. Changes in Insurance Coverage at Age 65
Medicare is available to people who are at least 65 years of age and who worked at least
40 quarters in covered employment (or have a spouse who qualifies for coverage).14 For those
whose meet the eligibility criteria, Medicare hospital insurance (Part A) is available free of
charge and Medicare Part B (Medicare insurance) is available for a modest monthly premium.
Normally, individuals who are approaching their 65th birthday receive notice of impending
eligibility and are informed that they have to enroll in the program and choose whether or not to
accept Medicare Part B coverage.
Table 3 presents estimates of the effect of reaching the Medicare eligibility age on
insurance coverage, based on alternative specifications of equation (2) fit to data from the 1992-

14

Medicare is also available to people under 65 who are receiving Disability Insurance, and those with kidney
disease. Individuals who do not qualify on the basis of their own or their spouse’s work history may still enroll in
Medicare at age 65 by paying monthly premiums for both Part A and Part B coverage. This option is limited to
U.S. citizens and legal aliens with at least five years of residency in the U.S.

12

2001 NHIS.15 In all cases the age profile function (gC(a)) is assumed to be quadratic with
coefficients that are allowed to differ for those older or younger than 65. This functional form
assumes that the age profile is continuous at age 65, but allows both the first and second
derivatives to jump discretely at 65. We report estimates for the entire sample in the top row,
and for four ethnicity/education categories, three ethnicity groups, and for men and women.
The models in the first column of Table 3 are fit to mean coverage rates by quarter of
age. As suggested by the patterns in Figure 1, the jumps in coverage at age 65 are precisely
estimated, reflecting the smoothness of the coverage profiles before and after 65 and the
sharpness of the rise at 65. The gain in coverage for the overall population is estimated to be 8.4
percentage points, while the gains by ethnicity/education group range from 5.3 to 18.8
percentage points. Interestingly, the estimated gain is about one third larger for women than
men.
Column 2 reports estimates of the same specifications, fit by linear probability model to
the underlying micro data. Since we used a weighted estimation procedure for the cell-level
models the coefficient estimates are identical in columns 1 and 2.16 As expected, however, the
standard errors are slightly different. The standard errors in column 2 are calculated allowing
heteroskedasticity and an unrestricted correlation structure for observations from the same age
cell. These are larger than the conventional standard errors for the same micro models (which
ignore clustering by age), but about the same size as the standard errors from the cell level
models. Column 3 presents models in which we add a set of micro-level control variables,
including dummies for the survey year and for gender, ethnicity, education and region. Although
15

We construct age in our NHIS samples from data on year and month of birth and quarter of the interview, as well
as age (reported in years). The latter information allows us to precisely separate people on either side of their 65th
birthday. We restrict the samples to people between 55.25 and 74.75 (79 quarters).
16
Specifically, we weight the cell-level observations by the sum of the sampling weights for the people in each cell.
The micro models are weighted, using the individual sampling weights.

13

the covariates are highly significant, they vary smoothly with age, and the point estimates of the
rise in coverage at age 65 are hardly affected. Finally, in column 4 we fit the micro level models
using a probit procedure to account for the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable. The
table reports derivatives of the predicted probabilities of coverage, evaluated at the mean
predicted probability. These are uniformly smaller than estimated jumps in coverage from the
linear probability models, but provide a qualitatively similar picture.
We have experimented with a number of alternative specifications and sample choices
for estimating the effects of reaching age 65 on insurance coverage. Appendix Table 1 reports
results from models like those in Table 3 fit to the last 5 years of the NHIS data (1997-2001) and
to the 1998-2002 BRFSS sample.17 The results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the
results in Table 3. We have also examined different specifications of the age profiles. For
example, in some specifications we included a cubic or quartic of age rather than the quadratic
interacted with the post-65 dummy. The sizes of the estimated jumps in coverage at age 65 are
robust to all the alternatives we have tried.
Examining changes in the probability of any health insurance coverage at age 65 ignores
potential changes in the composition of insurance coverage. Immediately upon reaching age 65,
many people drop (or lose) private insurance coverage, while others obtain multiple coverage.
Figure 2 shows the age profiles of Medicare coverage for the same groups as in Figure 1, while
column 5 of Table 3 reports estimates of the rise in Medicare coverage at 65 (based on a linear
probability model identical to the specification in column 3). Medicare coverage rates are low
but rising before age 65, reflecting the movement of non-elderly disabled people onto the Social
17

In the BRFSS individuals are asked their current age but not their date of birth, so we use age in years rather than
quarters. To increase the number of age cells, we use data from ages 50-80. We also used March Current
Population Survey data to look at the age profile of insurance coverage. Results are qualitatively similar, although
insurance coverage rates are a little different in the CPS, reflecting in part the wording of the coverage question,
which refers to coverage at any time in the previous calendar year.

14

Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. As noted elsewhere (e.g. Autor and Duggan, 2003),
DI participation is particularly high for less-educated minorities, reaching 20 percent by age 64.
Immediately after age 65, average Medicare participation rates rise to around 85 percent, with
higher rates for highly educated whites and lower rates for less-educated blacks and Hispanics.18
The reversal of Medicare participation rankings across education/ethnicity groups at age 65
means that the groups with bigger gains in net insurance coverage at age 65 have smaller rises in
Medicare coverage.
To what extent do changes in health insurance coverage at 65 coincide with other discrete
changes? An obvious confounder is employment. Historically, many public and private
pensions became available at 65, and 65 was widely imposed as a mandatory retirement age.19
Figure 3 shows the age profile of employment for men, along with the corresponding profile of
insurance coverage.20 Unlike insurance coverage, employment rates decline smoothly from age
55 onward, with no evidence of a discontinuous shift at age 65. The first column of Appendix
Table 2 reports estimation results for a set of employment models similar to the specifications in
column 3 of Table 3, based on pooled 1992-2001 NHIS data. The estimated jumps in
employment at age 65 are generally small in magnitude and statistically insignificant, with the
exception of a positive and significant rise for less educated minorities. Similar models fit to cell
level data on current employment status from the pooled 1996-2002 March Current Population
Surveys, reported in the second column of the table, also yield estimated jumps at 65 that are
small in magnitude and mostly statistically insignificant. Interestingly, the estimated jump in
18

Incomplete coverage of people over 65 reflects a number of factors, including the minimum work history
requirements for Medicare and under-reporting.
19
See von Wachter (2002) for an analysis of retirement rates and the impact of changes in laws governing
compulsory retirement. Over the past two decades 62 has replaced 65 as the most common retirement age.
20
The corresponding figure for women shows the same smooth decline in employment though women start with
significantly lower employment rates at age 55 than men.

15

employment for less educated minorities in the CPS data is negative, suggesting that the positive
estimate in NHIS data is spurious. We conclude that employment changes are relatively smooth
at age 65, and are unlikely to drive changes in health-related outcomes around age 65.
We have also investigated the age profiles of marriage, family income, and residential
mobility using the 1996-2002 CPS data. Columns 3-6 of Appendix Table 2 show the estimated
jumps at age 65 in the fraction of people who are married and living with their spouse, the
fractions whose annual family income is under $10,000, under $15,000, and under $20,000, and
the fraction who changed houses in the past year.21 For the overall sample and for the four
education/ethnicity subgroups, none of these outcomes shows a large or statistically significant
change at age 65. These results suggest that family structure, family location, and family income
all evolve smoothly around age 65, and are unlikely to confound our analysis of the impact of
Medicare eligibility.
IV. Changes in Health Care Access and Utilization at Age 65
a. Measures of Access
We now turn to an analysis of the effects of reaching age 65 on access to and utilization
of health care services. We begin with self-reported measures of access. Starting in 1997, the
NHIS asked two questions of all adults in the survey: (1) “during the past 12 months has medical
care been delayed for this person because of worry about the cost?” (2) “during the past 12
months was there any time when this person needed medical care but did not get it because (this
person) could not afford it?” Recent waves of the BRFSS have asked a closely related question:
“Was there a time during the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not
21

We do not report results on the poverty rate (or on income relative to the poverty line) because the poverty line
changes discretely at age 65. For example, the poverty line for a single individual is reduced by 8% when the
person reaches 65. As one would expect, graphs of poverty rates by age show a small jump down at 65. The
samples include individuals aged 50-79.

16

because of the cost?” Figure 4 shows the age profiles of responses to the first question in the
NHIS, while Figures 5a and 5b show the age profiles of responses the second question in the
NHIS and the similar question in the BRFSS. Consistent with the hypothesis that having
medical insurance increases access to medical care, all three graphs show a sharp drop in the
fraction of less-educated minorities who report delaying or not getting care after age 65.
The first three columns of Table 4 show the estimated changes in the probability of
delaying or not receiving medical care at age 65, based on linear probability models similar to
those in column 3 of Table 3. As suggested by the patterns in Figures 4 and 5, all three access
measures show significant decreases at age 65 among less educated minorities. There is also
reasonably strong evidence of a discrete change in access for all blacks and all Hispanics. The
estimated jumps in column 3 (based on the BRFSS question) are larger than the estimates in
column 2 (based on the similar question in the NHIS), and suggest very systematic impacts of
insurance coverage on medical care access. The ratio of the coefficients in column 3 to those in
column 3 of Table 3 ranges from -0.2 to -0.6, with most of the implied IV estimates of the effect
of insurance on the probability of not receiving care in the range of -0.3 to -0.4.22 Corresponding
estimates based on the NHIS version of the question imply smaller effects, ranging from 0 to 0.3. Given the apparent sensitivity of responses to the question based on wording and placement
in the survey, the magnitude of the effects from the BRFSS should probably be viewed
cautiously. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the incidence of cost-related access problems falls
sharply at age 65 among the groups with the largest gains in insurance coverage.23
22

The impacts of reaching age 65 on insurance coverage using the BRFSS data tend to be a little larger than those
in Table 3 (see Appendix Table 2), implying slightly smaller IV estimates.
23
Because the questions on access refer to the previous year, our estimates of the effect of reaching 65 on access
problems are potentially attenuated. Specifically, someone who turned 65 less than a year ago could have had
problems in the months before his or her birthday. The attenuation may be mitigated by recall errors and the
saliency of the recent past.

17

Another measure of access to the health care system is whether an individual has a usual
place for routine preventative care. Since the late 1990s the NHIS has included a sequence of
questions that can be used to construct such a measure.24 As shown in column 4 of Table 4, there
is some indication that the probability of having a usual place for routine preventative care rises
at age 65, especially for black non-Hispanics. Unlike the measures of delaying or not receiving
care, however, this measure shows only a small effect for less educated minorities.
b. Doctor Visits and Hospitalization
The right hand columns of Table 4 present estimation results for two key measures of
health care utilization: did the individual have at least one doctor visit in the past year? Did the
individual have one or more overnight hospital stays in the past year? (Both measures are taken
from the 1992-2001 NHIS). Since these questions refer to flows over the past year, they will not
necessarily respond instantaneously to changes in insurance coverage. To the extent that
uninsured people are delaying or not getting care, however, one might expect discrete changes at
age 65 as Medicare becomes available.
Figure 6 shows the age profiles for the fraction of people with at least one doctor visit in
the previous year. A close look at the graph suggests that the gap in frequency of doctor visits
between less educated minorities and other groups closes between ages 65 and 66, although the
age profiles are noisy. The estimates in column 5 of Table 4 confirm that less educated whites,
less educated minorities, and non-Hispanic blacks all show significant or nearly significant rises
in the probability of visiting a doctor after age 65. These patterns are consistent with the
estimates for the access measures in columns 1-3.
24

The survey first asks if a person has a place they usually go when sick, and if yes, whether they also get routine
preventative care there, or somewhere else. For those who do not identify a place they usually go when sick, a
third question asks if they have a place they usually go for routine preventative care. These questions are only
asked of the “sample adult” in each household.

18

Figure 7 shows the age profiles of the incidence of an overnight hospital stay. There is a
discernable jump in the hospitalization rate of the overall population, but unlike the patterns in
many of the previous graphs there is no indication that the rise is bigger for less educated
minorities. Consistent with this conclusion, the estimated changes in the probability of a hospital
stay in column 6 of Table 4 are fairly stable across groups. The point estimates center around 12 percentage points – a relatively large effect, considering that the probability of a hospital stay
in the previous year for 64 year olds is around 12 percent. In the next section we use very large
samples of hospital discharge records to refine these estimates. As in the models in column 6,
the discharge data suggest that increases in hospitalization at 65 are if anything smaller for
subgroups with the larger net gains in insurance coverage.
c. Screening and Preventative Care
One concern often raised about lack of health insurance coverage is that the uninsured
will not get preventative care, leading to long term health problems that could have been avoided
by earlier diagnosis and prophylactic treatment (e.g., Powell-Griner et al., 1999). Table 5
presents estimates of the impact of reaching age 65 on several measures of preventative care,
including influenza vaccination, blood cholesterol screening, mammography, and screening for
prostate cancer. All these models are estimated using data from the 1999-2002 BRFSS.25 As
with doctor visits and hospitalization, one issue with outcomes like mammography or prostate
screening is that people may not respond instantaneously to the availability of insurance. To
partially address this concern, we include models for whether an individual has ever had a
mammogram or either a digital rectal exam or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. The final

25

A major problem with the BRFSS is that not all questions are asked in all states in all years. For example, the flu
shot question was only asked in a minority of states in 2000, cholesterol testing was only asked in most states in
1999 and 2001, and the prostate screening questions were only asked in most states in 2001 and 2002.

19

column of Table 5 also reports a model for the probability of ever having been diagnosed with
hypertension.
Column 1 reports models for having a flu shot in the past year. Only the age profile of
less educated whites shows a significant jump at 65, though the standard errors for all groups are
relatively large.26 The models for recent cholesterol testing in column 2 also show a large jump
for less-educated whites at age 65, and relatively modest changes for other groups.27 The models
for the probability of having a mammogram in the past two years yield relatively imprecise
estimates, but point toward a large gain for less educated minorities. The age profiles for this
outcome are shown in Figure 8. The profile for less educated minorities rises at age 65, but the
variability of the profile at earlier and later ages suggests the need for caution in inferring too
much from the point estimates in Table 5. Although for space reasons we have not included a
graph of the age profiles for the probability of ever having a mammogram, these are flat by age
50, suggesting that there are very few women who have their first mammogram after reaching
middle age. As shown by the estimates in column 4 of Table 5 there is no indication of an
upward jump after age 65 for any of the subgroups. In fact, the probability of ever having a
mammogram among Hispanic women is estimated to drop down. Since the true response cannot
decline, we attribute this estimate to an unlucky combination of sampling errors.
We have also fit a series of models for the probability of a clinical breast examination in
the past two years, and the probability of a pap smear test in the past two years. None of the

26

Overall, the rate of flu shots for 64 year olds is about 50 percent, with variation across ethnic and education
groups that follows the expected pattern. The fraction of people who have a shot is strongly increasing with age
for groups. The 5 point rise for less-educated whites is readily discernable in a graph. The increase in flu shots
should be interpreted with caution given that the CDC’s list of groups at risk of flu related complications includes
adults age 65 or older.
27
About 82 percent of 64 year olds report having had a cholesterol test in the past two years. The rate for better
educated whites is about 86 percent while the rate for less educated whites and less educated minorities is 72
percent.

20

estimated jumps at age 65 for the various subgroups are statistically significant for either
outcome, although this is partly a reflection of relatively large sampling errors – in the range of
1-2 percent for most subgroups, and about 3 percent for less educated minorities. Thus, we
cannot rule out effect sizes as large as 4-5 percent in most cases.
Columns 5 and 6 refer to the incidence of tests for prostate cancer. We decided to
combine the two tests (the traditional digital rectal exam and the more recent prostate specific
antigen blood test) to focus on the possibility that older men had neither test.28 Unfortunately,
the sampling errors for this outcome are relatively large, reflecting the fact that the questions
were only asked in most states in the two most recent years of our BRFSS sample. The results in
column 5 suggest an impact of reaching age 65 on screening rates among Hispanics but not for
blacks, leading to mixed results in the two minority/education categories. The results for the
ever tested measure in column 6 are all insignificant and more narrowly centered around 0.
A final preventative care outcome considered in Table 5 is the probability of ever being
diagnosed with hypertension. Untreated high blood pressure is an important health risk,
especially among minorities (Hyman and Pavlik, 2001), although lack of treatment does not
necessarily arise because people are unaware of their condition. Nevertheless, the estimates in
the final column of the table (which are based on the subset of “sample adults” in the 1997-2001
NHIS) suggest that there is a sizeable increase in the fraction of minorities of both higher and
lower educational attainment who are diagnosed with hypertension at age 65.29 A graph reveals
that although the age profiles for the two minority groups are noisy, they seem to jump after age

28

The Food and Drug Administration approved the PSA test in conjunction with a digital rectal exam to help detect
cancer (National Cancer Institute, 2001). In the data, most men report receiving both tests or neither.
29
Overall, about 45 percent of 64 year olds report having been diagnosed with hypertension at some point. The rate
is around 42 percent for more educated whites, and 60 percent for less educated minorities.

21

65. As with the other preventative care measures in Table 5, however, the underlying sample
sizes are not large enough to permit precise inferences.
Our reading of the results in Table 5 is that they lend support to the hypothesis that
Medicare eligibility at age 65 leads to modest increases in the incidence of preventative
screening, and that the increase is concentrated among groups with a larger rise in net insurance
coverage. Unfortunately, our main data source for preventative screening – the BRFSS – did not
ask screening questions in all states in all years. Moreover, breast cancer and prostate cancer are
gender-specific so the sample sizes for these outcomes are cut in half. Because of these data
limitations, and the fact that people may not seek screening immediately after getting insurance,
the power of our discontinuity-based research design is limited, and we cannot reach definitive
conclusions.
V. Changes in Hospitalization - Evidence from Discharge Data
Survey data from the NHIS and BRFSS suggest that reaching age 65 has a significant
effect on the extent and composition of insurance coverage, on self-reported access to care, and
on utilization of medical services. In particular, data from the NHIS show a surprisingly large
increase in hospitalization rates at age 65, fairly evenly distributed across subgroups. In this
section we use data from the hospital discharge records for the states of California and Florida to
examine changes in the number and characteristics of hospital admissions by age. These
administrative data sets are very large and provide detailed information on the reasons for
admission to the hospital, the procedures performed, and the cost and duration of the hospital
stay. Their main disadvantage is the absence of information on a patient’s education (a key
determinant of pre-65 insurance coverage) and the fact that we only see people who enter the
hospital. For comparison with the state data, we also make use of national samples from the

22

National Hospital Discharge Survey. While these data have the advantage of being drawn from
a nationally representative survey, they have a limited set of covariates and smaller sample sizes.
Our approach to the problem of only observing those who enter the hospital is to assume
that the underlying population at risk for hospitalization varies smoothly with age. Specifically,
consider a simple reduced form model for pja, the probability that an individual of age a in
subgroup j is admitted to the hospital in a given time interval:
(6)

log (pja) = gpj(a) + Da πpj + vpja ,

where gpj(a) is a smooth age profile, Da is a dummy for age 65 or older, and vpja is a specification
error component. Let Nja represent the population in subgroup j of age a and let Aja represent the
number who are admitted to hospital, so the ratio Aja/Nja is an estimate of pja. Finally, assume
that the log of the population in group j at different ages follows a smooth trend:
(7)

log (Nja) = hj(a) .

Equations (6) and (7) imply that the log of the number of hospital admissions in subgroup j at
age a is given by:
(8)

log (Aja) = [ gpj(a) + hj(a) ] + Da πpj + vpja + εja ,

where
εja = log (Aja/Nja)-log (pja)
represents sampling error in the observed admission ratio. Provided that the underlying
population varies smoothly by age, any discontinuity in hospital admissions at age 65 can be
attributed to a corresponding discontinuity in the log of the probability of admission.
Our state-level hospital discharge data files consist of 100% of individuals who were
admitted to hospitals in California or Florida and discharged between January 1st 1995 and
December 31st 1999 (in the case of California) or between January 1st 1995 and December 31st

23

2000 (in the case of Florida).30 We focus on individuals between the ages of 50 and 75 at the
time of their admission, yielding samples of 4,069,049 discharges in California and 3,550,784 in
Florida. In the national data, we pool discharges for individuals in the same age range during
1995-1999, and obtain a sample of 413,866 observations.
Figure 9 shows the age profiles of the overall number of admissions in California and
Florida. To make it easier to compare the two states, we have normalized each series by the log
of the average number of discharges among 60-64 year olds. In both states there is clear
evidence of a discontinuous increase in hospital admissions at age 65, equivalent to about a 5-10
percent rise. Interestingly, the rise seems to be “permanent” – the state-specific age trend in
admissions is about the same between ages 65 and 70 as between ages 60 and 64. The lack of
any relative decline from 65 to 66 suggests that the jump at 65 is primarily the result of new
admission criteria being applied once potential admittees become Medicare-eligible, rather than
to a “catch-up” for care that had been deferred prior to age 65.
Figure 10 shows the age profiles in admissions for three major ethnic groups (white nonHispanics, black non-Hispanics, and Hispanics) in the two states. In both states whites
experience the largest proportional increases in hospital admissions, with slightly smaller rises
for Hispanics and virtually no rise for blacks. These patterns are potentially surprising,
considering that the rise in net insurance coverage at age 65 is largest for Hispanics, smallest for
whites, and in the middle for blacks.31
The upper panel of Table 6 shows estimates of the jump in log hospital admissions at age
65, based on a specification of equation (8) that includes a quadratic in age, fully interacted with
30

The data sets exclude Veteran Administration hospitals. For our analysis, we focus on patients admitted from
home.
31
We used the BRFSS data set (which has state identifiers) to estimate the rises in insurance coverage at age 65 for
people in California and Florida only. Overall, the rise is a little bigger in Florida (13 points) than California (10
points). Within either state, however, the patterns by ethnic group are very close to those reported in Table 3.

24

a dummy for age 65 or older. We also show estimates of jumps in three characteristics of the
hospital stays at each age: the mean duration of the stay (in days), the average amount charged
by the hospital for the stay, and the fraction of admittees who died in the hospital. Looking first
at the models for the number of admissions (columns 1, 5, and 9), we estimate that the number of
admissions rises by 6.0 percent at age 65 in California, 11.4 percent in Florida, and by 6.4
percent nationwide. Across the three major ethnic groups, the rise is largest for white nonHispanics, a little smaller for Hispanics, and negligible for black non-Hispanics. The sampling
errors are small enough that in both states we can reject the hypothesis that the rise in admissions
is the same for blacks as the other two groups, although the rises for whites and Hispanics are
insignificantly different.
The results for length of stay and in-hospital mortality suggest that the hospital caseload
becomes less sick at age 65, consistent with the notion that the extra admittees after 65 are
relatively healthy. As we show below, this is consistent with bigger increases at age 65 in nonlife-threatening diagnoses. The patterns in the changes in duration and mortality by ethnic group
are also generally consistent with this hypothesis. Interestingly, average hospital charges do not
change much in California but show a decline in Florida.
The lower panel of Table 6 shows estimates of the number and characteristics of hospital
stays, classified by route into the hospital (emergency room or not), and by whether the
admission was for elective, urgent, or emergency care (which is only coded in the Florida data).
In California, almost all the discontinuous growth in admissions at age 65 is driven by nonemergency room admissions. In Florida, there is some increase in both emergency room and
non-ER admissions, but the percentage increase in non-ER admissions is nearly three times
bigger. When the data are classified by type of admission, the patterns reinforce the conclusion

25

that most of the rise in hospitalization at age 65 is attributable to an increase in discretionary
medical care: the rise in elective care admissions is 19.1 percent versus 5.6 percent for
emergency care admissions.
As noted, the discharge files have no information on education, which is a key predictor
of insurance coverage status prior to age 65. As an alternative, we used geographic information
in the Florida files to estimate the fraction of 50-64 year old admittees who were uninsured by
zip code of residence. (This is estimated as the fraction of all dischargees who paid their own
bill, or were classified as indigent or charity care cases). We then divided all zip codes in the
state into four equally-sized groups, ranked by the fraction of 50-64 year olds without insurance.
Figure 11 shows the age profiles in the number of admissions from the four zip code groups,
while Table 7 shows estimates of the jumps at age 65 in the number and characteristics of
admissions by group. Contrary to the view that the rise in admissions at age 65 is driven by new
inflows of people who previously lacked coverage, the jump in admissions is largest for
residents of areas with highest rates of insurance before age 65, and smallest for residents of
areas with the lowest rates of insurance prior to 65 (though the difference in the jump at 65 is not
statistically significant). The shifts in duration of stay is somewhat imprecisely estimated and
not much different across the four zip code areas, while changes in in-hospital mortality rates are
only observed for the two “low insurance” groups.
As a final step in analyzing the discharge files, we tabulated the most common ICD-9
codes assigned as reasons for admission among people ages 60-64, and the most common
primary procedures performed during the hospital stay. Figure 12 shows the age profiles for 6 of
the most common admission diagnoses in California: chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD, often
treated by bypass surgery), acute myocardial infarction (AMI or heart attack), heart failure,

26

chronic bronchitis, osteoarthrosis (degenerative joint disease, often treated by joint replacement),
and pneumonia. The figure reveals large discontinuous increases in admissions at age 65 for
IHD and osteoarthrosis, smaller increases for AMI, chronic bronchitis and pneumonia and no
increase for heart failure. The estimation results in the upper panel of Table 8 confirm these
impressions, revealing relatively large jumps at age 65 in admissions for IHD and osteoarthrosis
in both California and Florida, and much smaller jumps for AMI and pneumonia. The national
estimates are roughly consistent with the state data, but are much less precisely estimated due to
the smaller samples. The rises in admission for AMI are potentially surprising, and suggest that
a significant number of people under 65 who have heart attacks are either not treated or are
treated on an outpatient basis.32
The results by type of procedure in the lower panel of Table 8 confirm the importance of
discrete rises in admissions related to joint replacement surgery and heart bypass surgery at age
65. Rises in the number of discharges with joint replacements of the lower extremity (hip and
knee replacements) parallel to the rises in admission for osteoarthrosis diagnoses. Similarly,
rises in removal of coronary artery obstruction and bypass anastomosis are comparable to the
rise in admissions for IHD diagnoses. Finally, it is interesting to note that the increase in
admissions for people who receive no procedures is below the overall growth in admissions in
both states (4.7% versus an overall average of 6.0% in California, 9.2% versus an overall
average of 11.4% in Florida), but is above the overall growth in admissions nationwide (8.5%
versus an overall average of 6.4%).

32

Another possibility is that once people become eligible for Medicare, hospitals assign different diagnoses codes
for certain symptoms to increase their billings. Some of this may arise because of a shift in caseloads across
hospitals at age 65. In particular, people over 65 are more likely to be admitted to private hospitals and less likely
to be admitted to county hospitals.

27

Taken as a whole, the results from our analysis of hospital discharge records suggest that
although reaching age 65 has an important effect on utilization of inpatient hospital services, the
patterns by ethnicity, region, type of admission, and procedure all point to a causal mechanism
other than insurance coverage per se. The relatively larger increases in hospitalization after age
65 for white non-Hispanics and residents of areas with the highest rates of insurance coverage
among 50-64 year olds, and the very large rises for bypass surgery and joint replacement at 65,
suggest to us that the changes are driven by features of the Medicare system, such as relatively
generous coverage of hospital services, rather than to the fact that coverage rises at the Medicare
age limit. The effect may be more pronounced among relatively wealthy Medicare recipients
because they can afford the out-of-pocket costs of surgery or have secondary insurance
(Medigap or retiree health insurance) that reduces those costs.
Interestingly, a recent panel of the National Institute of Health concluded that hip and
knee replacement surgeries contribute significantly to quality of life and are under-performed in
the U.S. If true, this implies that the rise in admissions for these procedures at age 65 may be
due to excessively stringent limitations in the insurance coverage available prior to age 65, rather
than to overly generous Medicare reimbursement rates for these procedures.
VI. Changes in Health-Related Behaviors
As we noted in Table 1, insured and uninsured people differ in several important health
related behaviors, including smoking, diet, and exercise. In Table 9, we investigate whether
there are any discrete changes in the age profiles of smoking, exercise, and weight outcomes at
age 65, using data from the 1999-2002 BRFSS.33 Increased access to routine medical care after

33

The smoking measure we use is whether an individual smokes daily. Results for smoking at all are very similar.
The exercise measure is “During the past month, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as
running, calisthenics, golf, gardening or walking for exercise?”

28

age 65 may increase awareness of the health consequences of smoking, exercise, and weight,
causing some people to change their behavior and creating a pathway for Medicare eligibility to
affect health.
The age profiles for the probabilities of smoking, participating in exercise, and of being
overweight (body mass index in excess of 25) or obese (body mass index in excess of 30) all
follow relatively smooth downward trends between the ages of 50 and 80. The estimates in
Table 9 show that there are no large or statistically significant jumps in smoking or exercise
participation. There is some indication, however, of a rise in the probability of being overweight
or obese for less educated minorities and for blacks. These rises are noticeable in a graph, but
appear to be driven by a downward dip among 63 and 64 year olds, rather than a systematic rise
at age 65. We therefore attribute the point estimates to misspecification of the age profiles
and/or sampling error, rather than to Medicare eligibility.
Overall, we conclude that health behaviors evolve smoothly with age, and do not change
suddenly at 65. In view of the extensive literature on habit persistence in smoking, eating, and
other lifestyle choices this is perhaps unsurprising. The implication is that health related
behaviors are unlikely to be an important channel through which Medicare eligibility affects
health or mortality at age 65.
VII. Changes in Self-Reported Health
In this section, we turn to an analysis of trends in self-reported health before and after age
65. At the outset it should be noted that even if Medicare eligibility leads to increased use of
medical services, it is unclear how this will affect the age profiles of self-assessed health. One
possibility is that more preventative care and diagnostic testing leads to a shift in the rate of

29

change of true health status that translates to a shift in the rate of change of subjective health.34
Such a phenomenon can only be measured under stronger assumptions than the smoothness
assumptions underlying equations (2) and (3). In particular, identification of a causal effect on
the derivative of health requires an assumption that the age profile of health of uninsured people
has continuous first derivatives.35 An alternative possibility is that improved access to care after
age 65 leads to a discrete shift in self-assessed health. The shift could be positive (if certain
health problems can be resolved quickly, or if uncertainty about a chronic condition can be
resolved) or negative (if there is a “labeling effect” as people are informed about previously
unrecognized conditions, or if treatment causes serious side effects).
Both the NHIS and the BRFSS ask individuals to give an assessment of their own health
on a 5-point scale: excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.36 Figure 13 shows the age profiles
of the fraction of the population who report themselves to be in good, very good, or excellent
health, based on pooled 1992-2001 NHIS samples. Inspection of the graphs shows that health is
generally declining with age. The rate of decline before age 65 for less educated minorities is a
little faster than for the overall population, implying that the SES gradient in health is widening
with age (Case and Deaton, 2003). Some time in the mid-60s the profile for less educated
minorities gradually flattens, and between 65 and 75 there is some convergence in health
between less educated minorities and the overall population. While this is consistent with a
causal effect of insurance coverage on the rate of change of health, it is clearly impossible to
34

Baker et al. (2001) analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Survey and concluded that lack of insurance
contributed to an increased risk of health declines among 51-61 year olds.
35
More precisely, consider two assumptions: (i) equation (1) includes an interaction between age and coverage
status λj(a)×Cija ; (ii) the age functions fj(a) in the structural outcome equation and gCj(a) in the first stage
coverage equation have continuous first derivatives. In this case the reduced form outcome equation includes a
term like λj(a)Da (an interaction of an age function with the dummy for age 65 or older), and any discrete change
in the first derivative of the reduced form profile at age 65 is interpretable as a causal effect of coverage.
36
There is an extensive literature on the reliability and interpretation of self-reported health, including Bound
(1991), Waidman et al. (1995), and Crossley and Kennedy (2002).

30

pinpoint the precise turning point in the rate of change of health of less educated minorities.
Given the quarter-to-quarter variability in the age profiles, it is also hard to discern whether there
is a discrete shift in the level of self-assessed health at 65. Similar features are evident in a graph
of the age profiles of the assessment of health (assigning 1 to poor health and 5 to excellent).
Table 10 presents a series of estimates of the jump in self-assessed health at age 65. The
first column presents estimates from linear probability models for the event that people report
their health as good or better. The second and third columns presents estimates from models for
the mean assessment of health (rated 1 to 5): column 2 reports estimates from a simple linear
regression, while column 3 presents estimates from an ordered probit model.37 Although the
estimates are somewhat imprecise, the pattern across subgroups is similar across specifications
and consistent with a causal link from insurance coverage to self-assessed health. For example,
the jumps are relatively large for less educated minorities and Hispanics and relatively small for
whites and better educated subgroups. The estimated effects from the ordered probit model, for
example, suggest that the mean assessment of less educated minorities and Hispanics increases
by about one-tenth of a category at age 65 – equivalent to closing about 15% of the gap in mean
assessments between the overall population and either subgroup.
VIII. Trends in Mortality
In this section, we analyze trends in mortality before and after age 65. The previous
sections have documented that Medicare eligibility leads to significant increases in access to and
use of medical services. This could change the probability of dying in two ways. For acute, life
threatening conditions, it is possible that improved access to hospital care reduces the probability
of dying immediately after becoming eligible for Medicare at age 65. For non-acute conditions,
37

The estimates in columns 2 and 3 are multiplied by 100. A coefficient of 10 implies that the mean assessment
rises by .1 (or one tenth of a category).

31

improved access to care might increase the life expectancy of individuals who would not have
died immediately in the absence of Medicare.
We begin by testing for a discrete change in mortality rates at age 65 using a regression
discontinuity design. We then tackle the more complicated problem of testing for less immediate
changes in mortality rates resulting from Medicare coverage. We implement two approaches to
estimating the long-term effects of Medicare coverage. First, we compare projected mortality
rates among 66 and 67 year olds with the actual rates. Second, we look for comparison groups
not exposed to Medicare whose mortality rates may serve as a plausible counterfactual. In our
first comparison, we consider mortality rates in the five years before and after Medicare was
implemented in 1966.38 The second comparison we make is between Canada and the United
States during the time period 1990-1995. While informative, these two comparisons suffer from
several limitations that are detailed below.
To test for the possibility of a discrete reduction in mortality at age 65, we construct agespecific death rates by gender, race and ethnicity.39 In the numerator, we use the number of
deaths at each age listed in the Multiple Cause of Death file from the US Department of Health
Services National Center for Health Statistics. In the denominator, we use postcensal estimates
of the mid-year resident population of the United States by single year of age. Although the
denominator is a simple characterization of the population’s exposure to the risk of dying (i.e.,
period person-years lived), we have experimented with more sophisticated estimates of exposure
based on different assumptions about the timing of deaths and found these to make little

Although Medicare was enacted on July 30, 1965, it was not implemented until July 1, 1966.
We depart from our earlier approach of looking at race-education groups. Although educational attainment has
been reported on the death certificate since 1989, there is evidence of severe misreporting of education, especially
at older ages (Sorlie, 1996).

difference. In order to get more precise estimates, we pool deaths over the period 1989-1998 and
sum mid-year population estimates over the same period.
In Figure 14, we plot the age profiles of death rates by gender and race/ethnicity. There
is no evidence of a discontinuous change in mortality at age 65 for any of the six subgroups. In
the first row of Table 11 we present the corresponding regression discontinuity estimates, based
on a specification that includes a cubic polynomial in age, fully interacted with an age 65
dummy. Consistent with the patterns in Figure 14, there is no evidence of a shift in mortality at
age 65 for any of the groups. All of the point estimates are insignificant and all but one are
positive -- the opposite of what would be expected if insurance coverage causes an
instantaneous reduction in mortality.40
For most conditions, if Medicare has an impact on 65 year olds, it will increase the life
expectancy of those not at immediate risk of dying. This is much harder to detect than an
immediate, discrete change in mortality because death rates will change slowly over time as
deaths are shifted from earlier to later ages throughout the age distribution. We begin by
examining the possibility that Medicare may slow the rate of increase in mortality rates by
comparing the actual mortality rates among 66 and 67 year olds with those predicted by fitting a
cubic polynomial to the mortality rates of 50 to 64 year olds. The actual and predicted mortality
experience of 66 year olds is presented in rows 3 and 4 of Table 11. For all but one sub sample,
the actual mortality rate of 66 year olds is slightly higher than the predicted rate (consistent with
small but positive estimates of the jump in mortality rates at age 65). As can be seen in the
bottom two rows of the table, the same is true for 67 year olds, though the gap between actual
40

We ran similar regression for the 6 most common causes of death and found no evidence of a discontinuous
reduction in mortality rates for any of the 6 causes. The top 6 causes and their associated three digit ICD-9 CM
codes (in parentheses) are: ischemic heart disease (410-414), lung cancer (162), chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (490-496), cerebrovascular disease (430-438), diabetes (250), and pneumonia (480-496).

and predicted mortality is typically a little larger.41 These results provide no evidence that
Medicare coverage leads to a discrete reduction in mortality at ages 66 and 67, and point instead
toward the difficulty of predicting the age profiles of mortality from the death rates of younger
people.42
As an alternate and perhaps more straightforward way of examining the changes in
mortality rates, we examine the age profile in the year-to-year percent changes in the mortality
rate. In Figure 15, we see that there is no evidence of a deceleration in the mortality rate at age
65. This result stands in sharp contrast to findings reported by Lichtenberg (2001), who uses
life-table death probabilities constructed by the Social Security Administration and finds a shortterm reduction in the growth rate of mortality between ages 65 and 69. The SSA life tables are
primarily intended for use in projecting the long-term survival rates of the US population and are
generally not suitable for examining changes in the derivative of mortality rates. In particular,
two methodological issues make the SSA life tables unsuitable for this type of analysis. First,
SSA uses Vital Statistics and Census data to construct death probabilities before age 65, but
switches to using death data from the Medicare program after age 65.43 If the slope of the
mortality profile at 65 happens to differ somewhat between the two data series, then splicing
them together will lead to a spurious change in the first derivative at exactly age 65. Second,
SSA uses osculatory interpolation to produce smoothly trending estimates within five-year age
groups. In order to prevent discontinuities at the seams between age groups, this method forces
the first derivatives of the interpolated series to be equal at the seams between age groups (seams

41

The differences between actual and predicted mortality rates become more pronounced at older ages as we project
further out-of-sample from age 64. Basing the projections on higher order polynomials does not solve this
problem.
42
One obvious issue is the presence of cohort effects, which would confound the extrapolation exercise.

The methodology used by SSA is described, in detail, in Bell et al. (1992).

34

occur at 60, 65, 70, etc.), making it appear as if the derivative changes smoothly across the
seams, and thus obscuring any spurious changes in the derivative caused by the change of data
series.44 More generally, interpolated data pose a problem for research designs based on the
occurrence of discontinuities since interpolation is designed to smooth out such irregularities,
even when they are real.
Due to the difficulties in estimating mortality rates for older people from the age profiles
for younger people, we turn to an alternative based on plausible comparison groups. In Figure
16, we compare mortality rates for 50-to-80 year olds in the five years before and after Medicare
was implemented in 1966. We do not see a discernable pre-post difference in mortality for men.
For women we see a significant reduction in mortality rates in the later period. However, the
reductions occur for women as young as 62, suggesting that the declining mortality rates are the
result of technological improvements or cohort differences rather than Medicare. There are two
obvious limitations with the simple comparisons in Figure 16. First, since the mortality rates are
typically decreasing over time it is possible that small improvements due to Medicare may be
hidden by the greater improvements due to other causes. Second, this particular comparison is
limited in its ability to pick up the impact of Medicare because older people in the post-1965
sample have only been exposed to a few years of Medicare coverage.
To sidestep this problem we compare mortality rates in the United States and Canada.
Canada is a plausible counterfactual since although the two countries are generally similar,
Canadians have universal health insurance coverage at all ages. Canadian death rates are lower
than those in the U.S., however, so some adjustment is needed to predict the profile of U.S. rates
in the absence of Medicare. After some experimentation, we found that U.S. death rates before

65 are quite similar to those of Canadians 2 years older. Figure 17 therefore shows U.S.
mortality rates by gender, along with Canadian rates that have been shifted left by 2 years.45 Use
of the adjusted Canadian death rates as a counterfactual shows no evidence of a discrete change
in US death rates at age 65 for either men or women, although it should be noted that ageadjusted Canadian profiles do not perfectly track the US profiles between the ages of 50 and 64,
so this comparison is unlikely to reveal small changes in mortality rates associated with
Medicare eligibility.
Although our results suggest that Medicare has little impact on mortality rates, either at
age 65 or over the longer run, we believe they should be interpreted with caution. The mortality
rates we have examined are for large groups, and it is quite possible that there are effects for
subgroups that are masked by the aggregation. This is a particular problem because the increases
in access to care documented earlier in the paper affect only a small fraction of the population.
The precision of our comparisons is limited by the difficulty of obtaining precise estimates of
mortality patterns in the absence of Medicare. It is thus unlikely that our methods could detect
anything other than a very large effect.
IX. Summary of Patterns Across Groups
To summarize our findings, Table 12 presents estimates of equation (5), relating the
estimated reduced form effects of reaching age 65 across different subgroups to the estimated
rise in net health insurance coverage at age 65 for each subgroup. We estimate the models
across 7 subgroups: 3 ethnicity groups and 4 ethnicity/education groups.46 Each row of the table
corresponds to a different outcome. For example, row 1 shows the relationship between the
45

The death rates for these comparisons come from the Human Mortality Database at UC Berkeley. We also tried
raising the Canadian mortality rates at each age so that the rates among 60-64 year olds matched, but this resulted
in a very poor fit among 50-60 year olds.
46
The groups are not mutually exclusive so the standard errors are understated. The model should be estimated by
generalized least squares using the inverse covariance matrix between the 7 estimates as a weighting matrix.

36

changes in the probability of delaying medical care at any time in the past year to the changes in
insurance coverage. The coefficient estimates reported in column 1 correspond to estimates of
the coefficient d1 in equation (5). Under the assumption of a constant causal effect of coverage,
this is an estimate of δ (the causal effect of insurance coverage). Column 2 reports the R-squared
coefficients for the equations. As noted in our earlier discussion, these should be relatively high
if the discontinuity of the outcome variable at age 65 is solely attributable to the rise in insurance
coverage. Column 3 shows the mean gap in the outcome at ages 63-64 between more educated
whites and less educated minorities: this is a simple summary of the SES gradient for the
outcome among the near-elderly population. Finally column 4 shows the estimated fraction of
this gap that is closed after the availability of Medicare, estimated by multiplying the estimate of
d1 by 13.54% (the estimated relative jump in coverage from column 3 of Table 3).
Looking first at the three self-reported measures of access, the relative sizes of the jumps
in access across subgroups are systematically correlated with the jumps in coverage. Reaching
the Medicare eligibility age is estimated to close 40-80 percent of the inter-group disparity in the
three measures. The same conclusion holds with respect to the probability of a doctor visit in the
past year: 84 percent of the variation across groups is attributable to differential rises in
insurance coverage, and over 100% of the inter-group gap among 63-64 year olds is closed after
65. This contrasts sharply with the estimated changes in the probability of a hospital stay, which
are essentially unrelated to the increase in insurance coverage.
Results for the four preventative care outcomes – flu shot in the past year, cholesterol test
in the past 2 years, mammogram in the past 2 years, and prostate test in the past 2 years – are
weaker. Variation in the size of the discontinuities in these outcomes at age 65 is not very highly
correlated with the discontinuities in insurance coverage, but the point estimates of the

37

coefficients in column 1 suggest eligibility for Medicare would be expected to close 15-30
percent of the SES gradient in preventative care.
Finally, the last row of the table looks at self-reported health. The estimated jumps in
health at age 65 (from the ordered probit specification in Table 9) are reasonably highly
correlated with the corresponding jumps in insurance coverage, with an R-squared coefficient of
0.66. Although Medicare eligibility is estimated to have a narrowing effect on inter-group
disparities in health, the predicted effect is to close only about 12 percent of the gap among the
near-elderly.
X. Conclusions
In this paper, we use the discrete changes in health insurance coverage at age 65
generated by the rules of the Medicare program to identify the impact of health insurance
coverage on health related behaviors and health outcomes. Medicare eligibility is associated
with a sharp increase in average coverage rates at age 65 and a narrowing in coverage disparities
across different groups in the U.S. population. Variation in the relative impact of the program
provides a way to test that it is health insurance coverage per se that is responsible for the
changes in health care utilization and health that occur at age 65, rather than other features such
as the relative generosity of Medicare reimbursement schedules.
Our estimates show that insurance coverage has a significant causal effect on selfreported access to health care and on health care utilization. Race and education groups that
experience the largest gains in insurance coverage at age 65 experience large reductions in the
probability of delaying or not receiving medical care, and relative increases in the probability of
an annual doctor visit. Evidence for an impact of insurance coverage on medical screenings and
preventive care is less clear-cut, although this is partly a reflection of data limitations. We also

38

find large and precisely estimated increases in hospital admissions at age 65, with the biggest
increases for discretionary procedures like hip and knee replacements and bypass surgeries.
Unlike doctor visits, the rise in hospital admissions tends to be larger for groups with higher
insurance coverage prior to age 65. Thus, the roughly 10 percent rise in hospitalization rates
between 64 and 65 year olds appears to be a result of differences between Medicare and private
insurance coverage, rather than of the rise in insurance coverage at age 65.
The impact of Medicare eligibility on health outcomes is harder to assess, both because
of difficulties in measuring health, and because health is less likely to change discretely in
response to insurance coverage. Perhaps surprisingly, we find a statistically significant impact
of reaching age 65 on self-reported health, with the largest gains among the education and race
groups that experience the largest increases in insurance coverage at age 65. On the other hand,
we find no evidence of a discrete change in mortality rates at 65, nor do we see any shift in the
rate of growth of mortality after 65. These findings have to interpreted cautiously since it is
difficult to identify a plausible comparison group for post-65 mortality rates in the absence of
Medicare. Taken as a whole, we believe our findings point to a significant but relatively modest
impact of health insurance coverage on health.

Note: Table entries represent estimated coefficient of dummy for age 65 or older in models
for the probability of insurance coverage (columns 1-4) or Medicare coverage (column 5). All models include
quadratic in age (in quarters) fully interacted with dummy for age 65 or older. Models in columns (2)-(5) are
fit to micro data: standard errors are calculated assuming a cluster structure by age.
Controls in models in columns (3)-(5) include year dummies, and dummies for gender, ethnicity,
education levels, and region. Probit estimates are dummy for age 65 x density at mean. Standard errors in
parentheses.

on race, but not ethnicity. It also does not collect data about route into the hospital or type of admission. Models are fit to age cells, and include a quadratic for age (in
years) fully interacted with a dummy for age 65 and older. Standard errors in parentheses.

Note: Samples include people admitted to hospitals from home, discharged between 1995 and 2000.
Models are fit to age cells, and include a quadratic for age (in years) fully interacted with a dummy for
age 65 and older. Average insurance rates in zip code are computed from discharge records for
people age 50 to 64. Fraction uninsured is the fraction who are coded as paying their own bill or
covered by charity care or indigent care programs.

Note: Row labeled "Age>=65" presents estimated coefficient of dummy for age 65 or older in models for outcome listed in column heading. Models are fit to age cells and include a cubic in age
fully interacted with a dummy for age 65 or older. The numerator for age-specific death rates is the number of deaths at each age registered by NCHS in the Multiple Cause of Death Files for
1989-1998 (pooled). The denominator is the postcensal estimate of the July 1 resident population of the United States at each age for 1989-1998 (pooled). Death rates are expressed per 100,000
population.

Note: Table entries are estimated coefficient of dummy for age 65 or older in models
for the probability of insurance coverage. All models include quadratic in age, fully
interacted with dummy for age 65 or older. Models in columns (1) and (2) use age measured
in quarters, for people age 55-75. Models in column (3) use age measured in years for
people age 50-80. Additional controls include survey year dummies, dummies for
gender, ethnicity, education levels, and region. Standard errors (in parentheses) are
calculated assuming a cluster structure by age.
