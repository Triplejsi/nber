U.S.—OWNED AFFILIATES AND HOST—COUNTRY EXPORTS

ABSTRACT

U.S.—owned manufacturing affiliates in foreign countries tended to

become more export—oriented between 1966 and 1977. The shift toward
exporting

characterized affiliates in most industries and most countries.

The bulk of U.S.—owned production abroad continues to be for local sale in
most industries and areas. Exporting to the U.S. remains a small part of
affiliate activities in almost all cases. The most export—oriented were
subsidiaries in machinery industries in Southeast Asia which were also the
only ones outside Canada that sold a substantial part of their production
in the U.S.

In most industries and most countries U.S.—owned companies led the rise
in exports and increased their shares in the exports of their host

countries. This role of U.S. subsidiaries was particularly notable in
Southeast Asia,and in those countries was concentrated in the machinery

industry. The increasing share of U.S. affiliates in host—country exports
was quite a general phenomenon, however, and high rates of affiliate export
growth were associated with rapid growth of host country GDP and exports.

Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of exportLng in the
activities
role

of U.S.—owned manufacturing companies

in foreign countries, the

of these U.S.—owned manufacturing affiliates in exports of manufac-

tured products by their host countries, and the changes
place

that have taken

in the decade between the most recent and previous censuses of U.S.

direct

investment abroad. The completion of the 1977 census (U.S.

Department

of Commerce, .1981) and the fairly close comparability with the

earlier one (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1975) which covered the year 1966
make possible a new examination of this issue.

The effects of direct investment on trade, particularly those of direct
investment in manufacturing, are usually analyzed in terms that suggest

that it is a substitute for exports from the home country. That may be
because capital movements in general, whether direct or portfolio, are
thought of as substitutes for trade, along the lines of the Mundell (1957)

analysis. Or it may be because, as in the more recent analyses specifically of direct investment, such investment is thought of as involving a
decision by the parent company as to whether to serve an essentially fixed

Another side of the concern with trade effects of direct investment has
been the fear among host countries that foreign—controlled subsidiaries are
prevented by their parent companies from competing with them outside the
host—country market, and that foreign ownership therefore impedes the devel-

opment of export Industries. That issue has been discussed and studied
extensively in Canada in particular3 although the advantage of such a

policy to a parent maximizing its worldwide income is not obvious. On the
other hand, countries welcoming direct investment from abroad often look on
it as an aid to establishing or increasing exports because the foreign
owners bring previously unavailable technology, established marketing faci-

lities, or entree to the parents' home markets. In the United States, at
present, one of the chief concerns of trade policymakers is that host
countries are squeezing U.S. exports out of third—country markets by
forcing U.S.—owned affiliates to export as the price for host—country per-

mission to invest or to take over existing firms. Again, Canada is a particular focus of this concern although export requirements are increasingly
applied in developing countries.

Production for Export and for Local Sale
U.S.—owned manufacturing affiliates have always had as their main

markets the host countries within which they operate. In 1966, over 80 per
cent of sales were within the host countries, and the proportion of local
sales was over 90 per cent for affiliates in developing countries.

3An early example is the study by Safarian (1966).

Table 1

Although U.S.—owned foreign production has been heavily concentrated in
developed countries (about 85 per cent of sales in both 1966 and 1977) the
number of manufacturing affiliates in developing countries was almost 30

per cent of the total in 1966. Since

affiliates in developing countries

were almost all producing for local markets, the proportion of all affiliates engaged almost entirely in host—country sales must have been very
large.

Although host—country sales remained the predominant business of manufacturing affiliates in 1977, there had clearly been a major shift in their

activity. The share of exports in total sales rose from 16 per cent in
1957 to 19 per cent in 1966 and to 31 per cent in 1977, and this shift took
place

in both developed and developing countries (Table i)

for which we could make the calculation (Table A—i). It was small in a
few cases (only Sweden among the European countries, and Japan,
Australia, and South Africa), but it was large in almost all the
European countries, roughly 50 per cent in the EEC and in other Europe,

taken as groups. There was not such complete unanimity among the developing countries even though the overall rise in the export ratio was

very large: from 8 to 18 per cent (Table 1). There was a very large
increase in the export ratio for the group of countries called "Other
Asia and Pacific, except India, Indonesia and the Philippines," prin—

cipally Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and South Korea, as well
as a rise in the importance of that group among the developing

countries. Affiliates in these countries had been comparatively export—
oriented

even in 1957 and 1966 (42 per cent of sales) and by 1977, three

quarters of their sales were for export.
For U.S. affiliates in developed countries,

the share of exports to

the United States in total exports diminished sharply between 1957 and

1966, and slightly between 1966 and 1977. In the last year their
exports to the U.S. were almost 10 per cent of their total sales. Only
for affiliates in Canada was the U.S. a major market and of growing

importance (a quarter of sales in 1977), This high

ratio

was partly

attributable to the trade in automobiles and parts resulting from the

U.S.—Canadian auto agreement. U.S. affiliates
did shift their exports to the United States

in

developing countries

in the last ten years (38 to

50 per cent of exports) but the U.S. market still accounted for less
than 10 per cent of sales in 1977. Even that was a large rise from 1957,

The chief exceptions once again were the small Asian countries, for whom
exports to the U.S. reached well over half of exports in 1977 and almost
half of their total sales, at least four times the 1957 share.
In general, then, exporting to the United States has been a relatively
minor, though expanding, activity of U.S. manufacturing affiliates in
foreign

countries for the last twenty years. The major exceptions to

this generalization are the affiliates in the small Asian countries, for
which

the United States has been a major market, accounting for roughly

half of their sales, and those in Canada. The chief trends in affiliate
activity over the twenty years have been the rise in export orientation
of affiliates in most parts of the world, but particularly in the small

—6—

Southeast Asian countries, the shift away from exporting to the United
States by European affiliates, and the shift towards the United States
as a market by those in Canada and in Asian developing countries.

A quick glance at the country data of Table A—i suggests that country
size is a factor accounting for the degree of export orientation of affi-

liates. Among European countries, the highest export ratios were among
the

smaller countries: Belgium—Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden,

and Switzerland, although Sweden was no

longer

among that group in 1977.

The largest countries, France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K., had below—
average export ratios for Europe in both years. Among the developing
countries,

export ratios were low for India and the larger Latin American

countries,

and high for the small Asian countries, but there were major

differences in trade policy as well as in size which may have influenced
these
A

ratios.

more formal analysis of the country characteristics determining the

export propensities of U.S.—owned affiliates is

by the equations sum-

Although the relationships are not as strong as those that have been
calculated for countrtes' total export propensities, the direction of the

effects is the same on the export behavior of foreign affiliates. The
smaller the country, in terms of population, and the higher the popula-

tion density, the higher the propensity of an affiliate to export. The
coefficient for country size is consistent in sign, not statistically

significant in most arithmetic equations, but more generally significant in

the log equations. That difference suggests that the population effect is
stronger among the small countries. The coefficients for density are
almost all significant. One interpretation of this relationship is that it
reflects economies of scale; otherwise we might expect affiliate sizes to
be proportional to market size and each market supplied from an affiliate

in that market. Thus, while production for export by multinational firms
tends to be located in large markets (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982), those affiliates that do locate in small markets tend to export a large part of what

they produce. The data are apparently not dominated by large numbers of
plants, too small to be economical, lured or coerced to undesirable locations in small markets by tariffs or other restrictions or subsidies,
although such plants undouhtediy exist.

If they were typical, we would

expect a positive relationship between market size and export propensity.

However, it may be that location in small markets is partly induced by
government actions, that firms making
warranted

that

choice build larger plants than

by the market size in order to gain some economies of scale, and

that such plants then tend to he export oriented because of the mismatch

between their size and the s[ze of their markets. In any case, the relationship is strong enough that it would have to be allowed for in any
attempt to judge the effects of host—country policy on affiliate export
behavior.

—9—

If

we compare increases in exports from 1966 to 1977 with increases in

total sales (Table A—i), we see another aspect of the importance of exports
to the growth of U.S.

manufacturing

affiliates. The increase in exports was

over a third of the total rise in sales for affiliates in all countries and a
somewhat higher fraction for those in developed countries. This source of

growth in sales was particularly important for the smaller European
countries: well over half the total in Belgium—Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Ireland, and Switzerland. Exports were a much less important source of
sales growth for Japanese and other non—European developed country affiliates and for those in developing countries, again with the exception of

the small Asian countries. For them, the share of export growth in the
increase in sales

there no

was over three—quarters. In

only one country——India——was

contribution from exports to the increase in sales. In fact,

India was the one case of an absolute decline in the value of exports by
U.S. affiliates.

To some

extent,

the differences between affiliates in developed

countries and those in developing areas may have reflected the industry

composition of activities in the two types of host countries. Affiliates in
developed countries were more heavily involved with sales of machinery and
transportation equipment and those in developing countries with sales of

food products and chemicals (Table 3). However, there was considerable convergence in the industry composition of sales in the two groups of countries:
in particular from the large fall in importance of food products and rise
in machinery sales among affiliates in the developing countries.
Affiliates producing food products in developed countries have
generally been among the less export—oriented groups within manufacturing.
In

developing countries, however, they were far above average as

exporters

in 1966 but a little below average in 1977 (Tables 1 and 4). Over that

period

affiliates in developing countries shifted away from exporting and

came to resemble in this respect, those in developed countries, which
shifted

toward a higher ratio of exports to sales.

For no country were exports to the U.S.
food
(a

a

large part of total sales of

product affiliates, and they were an important part of

total exports

third or more) only for developing countries, parttcularly the

Philippines (Table A—2). Reliance on the U.S. as a market for exports
declined for both groups of countries.

U.S.—owned affiliates in the Chemicals and Allied Products industry in
developed

loping

countries were much more dependent on exports than those in deve-

countries in 1966 (Table 5). After 1966 the chemical affiliates

doubled their export propensities. The shift towards exporting took place
in Europe and "Other Asia," while export propensities decreased in Canada

and Latin America. For affiliates in Belgium and the Netherlands exports
were about three—quarters of total sales and more than that for the

increase in sales between 1966 and 1977. For the six countries of the original EEC almost half of the increase in sales went into exports (Table
A—3).

tn none of the major areas listed in Table 5 was exporting to the U.S.

an important part of the chemical industry affiliates' activities. Even
Canadian affiliates sold only 6 or 7 per cent of their output in the U.S.,

although these sales accounted for a substantial part of Canadian

affiliates' exports. There was, furthermore, a shift away from the U.S. as
an export market by affiliates in general, the main element of which was
the rise in importance of the European affiliates, which sent only a very
small share of their exports to the U.S.

As can be seen in Table 2, both country size and density were related
to export propensities of chemical affiliates. The country size coefficients were much larger negative values than those for the other
industries or for all manufacturing, suggesting that economies of scale may
be particularly important in this industry.

Although the data for primary and fabricated metals are thin, it appears

that the same phenomenon of increasing export orientation was present. For all
affiliates, worldwide, the share of exports in sales rose from about 10 per

cent in 1966 to more than one quarter in 1977 (Table 6). There were large
increases in the importance of exports in every country for which data were
published, with the sole exception of the Netherlands, for which the share
declined in the face of a more than tenfold increase in sales (Table A—4)
although it remained above average for Europe. The export orientation of

affiliates in developing countries, mainly Latin America, was similar to
that of developed area affiliates in 1977 except that they were more depen-

dent on the United States as a market while European affiliates exported
very little to the United States. On the other hand, U.S. companies In

Canada sent almost all their exports to the United States in 1977, con
siderably above the half or so in 1966.

Machinery production is the most export—oriented of the industry groups

we distinguish among U.S.—owned producers in foreign countries. Almost a
quarter of sales were exported in 1966 and over a third in 1977 (Table 7).
In Europe,

was

over

and for developed countries in

general, the proportion exported

40 per cent. Machinery affiliates in developing countries shifted

their orientation very sharply. In 1966 they sold their output almost
entirely in the local markets but by 1977 they were exporting over 40 per
cent of their production: the same fraction as that of affiliates in the

developed countries. Affiliates in developed countries (except for Canada)
never sold much of their total output in the United States, and the propor-

tion declined sharply. However, those in the developing countries had more
than half their export sales in the United States in 1966 and almost two—

thirds in 1977. By the latter year, the U.S. was taking over a quarter of
their output.

As in other industries, affiliates in Belgium—Luxembourg and the

Netherlands were the most active exporters in the EEC, sending more than
half of their sales outside their host countries, as did those in

Switzerland (Table A—5). Among affiliates in developing countries those

Brazil

in

and Mexico increased the proportions of export sales sharply and

also shifted export sales towards the United States. The major development by far in the machinery industry was the rise of production by

U.S.—owned affiliates in the small Southeast—Asian countries, fifteen—fold
or more, and the multiplication of exports by more than 50 times, from a
negligible amount in 1966 to one and three—quarters billion dollars in

1977. By 1977 between half and three—quarters of this production was

exported. Over three—quarters of the exports were sent to the United
States, which accounted for well over half of machinery sales by these
count ries.

For 1977, machinery sales and exports by U.S.—owned affiliates can be

divided between non—electrical and electrical machinery. Affiliates in the
developed countries dominate the former group while developing countries
play a large role in the latter (Table A—6). The affiliates producing non—
elect rical machinery in Europe are strongly export—oriented (Table 8), with

those in the smaller countries exporting from 50 to 60 per cent of their
sales (Sweden and the Netherlands) to over 80 per cent (Belgium—Luxembourg),

and even those in the larger countries, 35 to 45 per cent. Among affiliates in developing countries most exported less than 20 per cent of their
output, but those in "Other Asia," the small Southeast Asia countries,

exported almost all their output: over 90 per cent. The United States took
over half the exports and the sales of these countries but was not a major
market for affiliates in the other developing countries or in the developed
countries.

In electrical machinery and equipment European affiliates' export
ratios were again fairly high, averaging a third of sales, with the United
States a minor market. Sales by developing country affiliates were more
important

than in any other of our industry groups and again the main

actors were affiliates in "Other Asia." They exported almost 90 per cent
of

their sales, mostly to the United States, arid had a share of total

export sales almost half as large as that of developed—country affiliates,
a higher proportion than in any other industry.
The relation of country size and density to affiliate export propensities in the two machinery industries is described in equations 5 and 6 of

Table 2. The significance of the density coefficients may particularly
reflect the high export ratios of the affiliates in the small Southeast
Asian countries.

Transportation equipment affiliates were almost entirely involved in

the production of motor vehicles and parts. What little investment there
was in other types of transportation equipment, such as aircraft and parts,

was almost all in Canada. Affiliates in Canada and Europe were export—
oriented in 1966, and shifted further in that direction by 1977 (Table 9).
Canadian affiliates doubled the share of exports in sales to more than half

and those in European countries also increased the export share substan-

tially. Affiliates in developing countries concentrated entirely on their
home markets in 1966 and, while they increased the export share, still
exported less than 10 per cent of sales in 1977. Only Canadian and Mexican
affiliates depended on the United States as a market for exports (Table
A—7); the European affiliates shipped less than 6 per cent of their sales
to the United States.
Summarizing the industry data, we find several common characteristics

and developments. Affiliates in all five industries worldwide became more
export—oriented.

However, even in the

most export—oriented industries, the

affiliates in the aggregate sold mainly in their own countries ——

the

bulk

of U.S.—owned foreign production was still for local sale in 1977. The
exceptions were machinery in Southeast Asia and in some of the smaller
European countries, as well as motor vehicles in Canada.
Exports to the U.S. were a small part of total sales in almost all
industries: the main exceptions were machinery producing affiliates in the
developing countries

probably

of Asia. In

other words, exporting

to the U.S. was

not a major reason for the establishment or development of U.S.

production abroad in most cases.

Another way of looking at the same set of data is given by Table 10

which brings together the industry data by geographical area. There are
some geographical distinctions that run
in

across

industries. The affiliates

"Other Asia" were generally the most export—oriented and, in the

industries for which we have data, tended to shift their sales tx.iard
exporting.

They were also the most dependent on the U.S. as a market, over

50 per cent of sales for machinery affiliates, the only case in the table
of dependence on the U.S. market for a majority of sales.

Affiliates in Europe were also quite oriented toward exports and in all

the five industries increased their export propensities. In none of these
major industry groups was the U.S. the market for more than three per cent
of the sales or more than seven per cent of the exports of these affi-

liates. Thus they are the outstanding example of the irrelevance of the
U.S. market to U.S.—owned foreign affiliates.
At the other end of the scale, Latin American affiliates were the most
dependent on their domestic markets, and do not seem to have moved as much
toward more export orientation over the decade or so shown in the table as

did affiliates in other areas. The U.S. was not a major market for Latin
American affiliates, but did take a large part of their small exports in
some cases.

Canadian affiliates other than those in the transportation equipment
industry —

mainly autos — despite

the high degree of openness of the

Canadian economy, concentrated their sales in their home market, although

their was some trend toward increasing export shares. While the United
States was not the dominant market for sales, it was the chief market for
export by these affiliates, taking more than half of exports in every
industry group but one.

— 24 —

The Role of U.S. Affiliates in Host—Country Exports
The rapid growth in exports of manufactured goods by foreign affiliates
of U.S. companies reflects, to some extent, the growth of the economies in
which they are located and the worldwide rise in trade relative to output.
To some degree the growth of the host—country economies and of their

exports may have reflected the growth of the foreign affiliates. Although
it was not possible to assemble industrial statistics for many countries
comparable to U.S. data on the operations of foreign affiliates, we did
attempt to try to learn what role the U.S. affiliates played in the trade
and the growth in trade of their host countries.
The adjustments made to the trade statistics to reach some conr-

parability with the affiliate data are described in an appendix, but there

are a few points to be mentioned in connection with the text tables. The
1977 trade data could be fairly well adjusted to match the industry classification used for the U.S. affiliate export data, although there were considerable differences among countries in the completeness of this adjust-

ment. These more fully corrected trade data are used for the columns

labeled "Corrected data, 1977." Since much less detail was available in
trade statistics for 1966 the adjustments made in the trade data to match
the U.S. Department of Commerce industry classification used for the

investment data were less complete. Therefore, for comparisons betceen
1966 and 1977 we made an alternative adjustment of the 1977 data which
maximized comparability with the trade data for 1966 rather than with the

affiliate data for 1977. These 1977 trade data are used for the calculations of "Exports: 1977/1966, All firms"

and

for the comparisons of affi—

hate with total trade labeled "Comparable Data."

— 25 —

U.S. manufacturing affiliates accounted for about 10 per cent of 1977
exports of manufactures by "market economies" other than the U.S., which we

shall henceforth refer to as world exports (Table 11). The move towards
greater export orientation, referred to earlier, is reflected here in the
fact that exports by U.S. affiliates grew faster than host—country exports
in every one of the regions in Table 11 or, in other words, that the share

of affiliates in exports increased in each one. A somewhat surprising
aspect of the table is that U.S. affiliates were considerably more important in the exports of developed countries, even aside from Canada, where
they accounted for a majority of exports, than in the developing countries.
U.S. affiliates had the largest share of exports in Singapore ——

over a

fifth —— and possibly in a couple of other Southeast Asian countries,
although in those cases we may have failed to adjust the SITC export data

sufficiently (Table B—i). The U.S. shares were also large —— 15 per cent
or so, in the U.K., Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Mexico, and even
larger in Ireland.

In no area, aside from Canada, were U.S. affiliates responsible for a
large part of the growth in exports, the shares in growth being 10 per cent

or less. In individual countries, however, the ratio reached the range of
15—20 per cent and even higher in Indonesia and the Philippines. In many,
but not all cases, the major export success stories were also associated
with relatively high shares of U.S. firms in both exports and export

growth. This was the case, for example, for Belgium—Luxembourg, the

Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, and Mexico (Table B—i). Several of
these, it

may be

recalled, were also the countries in .ihich U.S.

by real GDP. Even after that relationship is taken into account, the
growth

of manufactured exports was also related to the growth of exports by

The lines of causation must be very mixed. The growth of total output,
other things equal, presumably produced growth in exports, but the ability

to export may also have affected the rate of growth of output. The growth
of exporting by U.S.—owned affiliates presumably affected the rate at which
a country's exports grew, but whatever national factors, such as productivity increases or price stability, encouraged export growth in general,

must also have aided the growth of exports of the U.S. affiliates. We can
say, however, that the equation is compatible with the Idea that the growth
of affiliate exports was an influence in increasing host—country exports.
The food products industry differed from manufacturing in general in

several respects. For the world as a whole and in three of the four main
areas the share of U.S. affiliates in exports declined (Table 12). That
share was no more than 6 per

cent or so in both 1966 and 1977 in all

areas except Canada, and U.S. firms' shares in export growth were small.
Even the U.S. firms' export shares in individual countries, aside from a

few, were generally below 5 per cent. By and large, this was not an

industry

in which U.S. firms played a major role in exporting.

In the chemicals and allied products industry, a more substantial
object of U.S. direct investment, opposite trends appeared in developed
and developing countries, the latter a minor factor in U.S. investment.

For the world as a whole, particularly in Europe, and probably in "Other
Asia," exports by U.S. affiliates grew much more rapidly than chemical

industry exports in general (Table 13). U.S. firms accounted for about 1/8
of total exports by 1977, or, on a less completely adjusted basis, 14 per

cent, as compared with 10 per cent in 1966. The usual set of countries
showed
the

large U.S. affiliate shares in exports and export growth: Belgium,

Netherlands, and probably Ireland among the European countries (almost

a third or more of export growth), and Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines
among developing countries, along with Argentina. U.S.—owned firms

remained an important source of Canadian exports but their share decreased

very sharply, and the same was true for affiliates in Latin America and in
developing

countries as a group. Despite the decline in their role in

exports of some areas, U.S.-owned chemical industry affiliates accounted

for about 15 per cent of the growth of the industry's exports from the
world, the developed countries as a group, and from Canada and Europe

separately. To some extent this decline in U.S. affiliates' shares in
developing

countries' chemical exports reflects the rise in importance of

Asian countries in which U.S. affiliates' shares were low. But
also

there was

a large decline in U.S. companies' share in exports by developing

American countries despite the increasing role in exports by Brazil and

Mexico and the slight decrease in Argentina. There was clearly a substantial fall in the U.S. affiliates' shares in other developing American

countries not reported separately in the investment data.4

Primary and fabricated metals was an industry in which U.S.—owned
affiliates accounted for only small

shares

of exports except in Canada

(Table 14). In all other countries for which separate affiliate data are
published the shares were below 10 per cent and mostly below 5 per cent

(Table B—4). However, the story of increasing shares in host—country
exports was repeated in this industry in every area and every single

country for which we have data. Since the 1977 shares remained low the
U.S. affiliates did not account for a large part of the growth in exports

for

any of the countries aside from Canada, in which their share in export

growth was about 35

per

cent.

Machinery, the most important industry group for U.S. direct
abroad,

investment

has traditionally been the preserve of exporters from developed

countries. Between 1966 and 1977, however, there was an enormous increase

in

exports by developing countries ——

to

perhaps about thirty times the

earlier level (Table 15), The exports of U.S. affiliates reflected these
trends, those from developed countries rising to a little under six times
the earlier level while those from developing countries reached almost 60

times the 1966 level. Another way of describing the change is that the
share of exports by U.S. firms (other than from the U.S.) supplied from
developing countries rose from less than 2 per cent to about 17 per cent
(Table B—5).

Another contrast between the developed and developing countries in
machinery exports was that while U.S. affiliates' exports from developing
countries increased about twice as fast as exports in general, those in

4rhere may also be a statistical problem in the treatment as chemical
industry exports of aluminium oxide from Jamaica.

developed countries rose a little less quickly than exports of the industry

as a whole (Table 15). However, in the European countries, affiliate
exports rose faster than those of the average firm; what bought down the
share of affiliates for developed countries in the aggregate was mainly the
large growth of Japanese machinery exports, in which U.S. firms played a
very small role. TJ.S. affiliates accounted for a little over 10 per cent
of the increase in developed country exports but for almost a third of the
rise in developing countries, and around half or more for such countries as
Mexico, Malaysia, and Singapore.
The separation between non—electrical and electrical machinery,
possible only for 1977 in the case of affiliate exports, identifies these

developments more clearly. While the role of developing countries
increased in both types of machinery from the very low levels of 1966, it

was in electrical machinery that the change was greatest. Exports by devel-

countries reached over 10

oping
only

about

per cent of world exports as compared with

2 1/2 per cent for non—electrical machinery (Table B—6).

The position of U.S.—owned affiliates was also different in the two

industries. In Europe, and in the developed countries as a group, U.S.
affiliates had a larger share of exports in non—electrical machinery
than in electrical machinery (Table 16) and some of these shares in

European countries were as high as a quarter or more (Table B—6). In the
developing countries, on the other hand, U.S. affiliates not only accounted
for a larger share of exports than in developed countries but had a particularly large

role in electrical machinery and equipment. Their share

was a third in developing
America,

countries as a group, almost 60

per cent in Latin

and over a third in Other Asia, the area of most rapid export

growth (Table 16). There were wide disparities in the U.S. companies'

positions even among Asian countries. U.S. affiliates accounted for only

about 10 per cent or less of electrical machinery exports from Korea but
for more than half of those from Malaysia and Singapore.

In both types of machinery, high U.S. companies' shares in exports were
generally associated with high growth rates of exports, although there were

some exceptions. India, Korea, and Japan enjoyed high rates of growth in
both types of machinery but U.S. firms did not play any major part in them.
Because the U.S. transportation equipment industry, or at least its
overseas operations, is highly concentrated among companies, a large part
of the data are suppressed, and we can get only hints of export develop-

ments. We show ratios of U.S. firms to all firms in two ways In Table 17
and Table B—7, one with all transport equipment in the denominator and the

other with only motor vehicles and equipment in the denominator. The former
matches the description of the industry given by the Department of Commerce
but, since a very large proportion of overseas activities are those of
motor vehicle companies, we also calculate the second set of ratios,
assuming in effect that motor vehicles are the only overseas operation, or
at least the only exporting operation in the transportation equipment

industry. We know that the assumption is not strictly correct ——
aircraft

manufacturing affiliates in Canada, for example ——

probably

responsible for the one ratio of U.S.

exports

and

affiliate exports to total

that is greater than 100 per cent (Table 17). However, even in

Canada motor vehicles and equipment accounted for 83 per cent of the assets
of U.S. transportation equipment affiliates and the proportion was over 98
per cent in the rest of the world.
As was the case for machinery, the rate of growth of exports by U.S.—owned
transportation equipment affiliates was far greater in developing countries

than in developed countries (Table 17). In Europe and Canada, the share of
U.S. affiliates In exports was fairly constant, but overall among developed

countries it fell sharply. Again, as in the machinery industry, the main
reason for the decline was the rise as an exporter of Japan, a country with
no U.S.—inajority—owned affiliates in this industry (although there were

minority—owned firms).

The developing countries can be thought of as having had virtually no

transportation equipment exports in 1966. The share was still very small in

1977. In Latin America U.S. firms

were important as exporters in both

Brazil and Mexico, but probably not as important in Argentina, the only

other exporter of consequence. In Asia other than Japan U.S.—majority—
owned firms were not a large factor in the growth of exports, which was

quite substantial in several of the countries. In this industry, therefore, we cannot observe any clear relation between the U.S. role in
exporting and the rate of export growth.
The same data analyzed above are summarized to highlight the charac-

teristics of each of the four major world areas in Table 18. In Europe and
"Other Asia," U.S.—owned companies led the rise in exports in most
industries and increased their share of the exports of their host

countries. This major role was particularly notable in "Other Asia,"
although even there it was concentrated in machinery.

The same area was

the one with the greatest overall increase in manufactured exports.

The Latin American case is not so clear because of missing data. U.S.
firms

increased

their share of total manufacturing exports even though in

the two industries for which we have the full set of data the U.S. firms'

share fell. However, the share of U.S. firms was very high in machinery
and transport equipment, and their exports grew very rapidly in these

industries. It seems

likely, therefore,

that they played a large role in

the growth of Latin American export in these Industries. That was cer—

tainly the case for the major

machinery exporters,

Brazil and Mexico, and

to a smaller extent, Argentina.

In Canada, the country with the smallest increase in exports, the U.S.

role stayed constant or decreased in all industries except metals. In that
one case the exports by U.S. affiliates increased so much that the U.S.

share in manufactures exports as a whole also increased. In general,
however, Canada was the country in which the U.S. role changed the least,

although one reason may have been the fact that it was so great to begin

with. The share of U.S. companies in exports in 1966 was over 80 per cent
in transportation equipment, almost half in chemicals, and over a third in

machinery. Even after the declines they remained close to a quarter or
more in all five industry groups.
In general it appears that U.S.—ownned affiliates were leaders in the
growth of exports in many areas and countries in the sense that their
exports grew faster than those of their host countries and faster than
those of other producers in the same industries in their host countries.

Thus they increased their share in host—country exports and in their

industries' exports. There was no indication that their presence inhibited
the growth of host—country exports and some evidence that they promoted the

growth of exports. On the whole, the developing countries and industries
in which they played a major role were among the more successful in
increasing exports during these years.

Appendix
The data on the exports and sales of U.S.owned manufacturing affiliates were taken, essentially as published, from U.S. Department of

Commerce (1960), (1975), and (1981). There was a change in coverage that
might have affected our results. The 1957 data cover all direct investments, defined as companies "...the voting securities of which were owned
to the extent of 25 percent or more by persons, or groups of affiliated
persons, ordinarily resident in the United States...' plus "Foreign
corporations, the voting stock of which was publicly held within the United
States to an aggregate extent of .50 percent or more, but distributed among

stockholders so that no one investor, or group of affiliated investors,
owned as much as 25 percent," plus sole proprietorships, partnerships, and

branches of U.S. corporations. The 1966 and 1977 data cover only majority—
owned branches and subsidiaries of U.S. companies. We therefore may
understate slightly the growth in U.S. affiliate sales and exports between
1957 and the two later years.

The major statistical adjustments were those to make the host—country
export data as comparable as possible to the U.S. affiliate data and to
make the host—country export data as comparable as possible between 1966

and 1977. Since these two objectives were often in conflict we calculated
two sets of values for 1977. One was our best estimate of host—country exports comparable to the export data for JJ.S.—owned affiliates.

lit was derived

mainly from the data on "Exports by Industrial Origin" given in the 1978
and 1979 UN Yearbook of International Trade Statistics, with some modifications to fit the U.S. Department of Commerce industry classification, as

described below. The second set of values was taken from export data by
SITC given in the volumes of the same source for 1966 and 1969 and in the

— 43

—

UN Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, Tables on World Trade by Commodity

Classes and Regions, April and July 1972 and later issues. We adjusted
these to industry classifications as well as we could, using as a guide
the UN Classification of Commodities by Industrial Origin, Statistical

Papers, Series M, No. 43, Rev. 1, 1971. There were quite a few problems in
making this adjustment, however. One was that no country's data contained
the full detail needed to adjust the trade figures completely. A second
was that there was a great deal of variation from country to country in the
degree of detail provided, and the comparisons among countries for any one

year therefore are not completely consistent. The third is that much less
detail was available for 1966 than for 1977 and the match with industry
data therefore poorer for country export estimates comparable between the
two years than for the 1977 estimates based on industry data.

Because of the many country differences in the commodity detail provided, the following description of the adjustments is not applicable to

every country. Some judgment had to be used in applying the desired
adjustments, listed below, to the actual data.
