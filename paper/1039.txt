The Gold Standard and the Bank of England in the Crisis of 1847

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the operation of the gold standard and the performance of the

Bank of England during the crisis of 1847. The key feature of that crisis has been its
origin: it originated from a massive real shock rather than from monetary disorder. A
harvest failure gave rise to commercial distress and financial panic.
Following a brief outline of the main events during the 1847 crisis, we present a
simple model of the financial sector that captures the central characteristics of the

crisis. The model, which highlights the role of confidence in both external and internal
convertibility, is then used for interpreting the detailed characteristics of the financial
crisis.

Faced with a confidence crisis leading to international and external monetary drains,
the Bank of England suspended Peel's act and thereby was allowed to issue fiat money without

being constrained to have full gold backing. Our analysis shows that suspension of
Peel's act was the proper policy required for the restoration of confidence. It also
sheds light on the role of a lender of last resort in cases of banking panic.

As for the evaluation of the gold standard, the 1847 crisis demonstrates that International capital flows have played a key role in the adjustnent mechanism. Further, It
demonstrates that in contrast with the traditional representation, the gold standard has

not been characterized by automatic, non—discretionary adjustment. On the contrary,
banking policies and changes in the reserve—deposits and currency—deposits ratios have
affected the money stock independently of gold flows.

I. Introduction
The acceleration of world inflation during the 1970's along with the rise
in the rate of unemployment, and the general instability of money and prices

have renewed interest in theoperation of the gold standard. Recent proposals
for a return to some variant of the gold standard stem from the belief that a

return to such a standard will restore macroeconomic stability. This belief is
based on a casual look at history with the consequent inference that the gold

standard contributed to the stability of the system. This view of prices stability
was supported by Keynes who argued in Essays in Persuasion.

The course of events during the nineteenth century favoured
such ideas... The remarkable feature of this long period
was the relative stability of the price level. (Approximately the same level of price ruled in or about the years
1826, 1841, 1855, 1862, 1867, 1871, and 1915. Prices were
also level in the years 1844, 1881, and 1914... No wonder
that we came to believe in the stability of money contracts
over a long period. The metal gold might not possess all
the theoretical advantages of an artificially regulated
standard, but it could not be tampered with and had proved
reliable in practice. (Keynes, 1932, p. 88—9.)
But another view of the history of the gold standard during the 19th century re-

veals a succession of crises of varying length and depth. As documented by
Hyndman (1932) the 19th century in the U.K. witnessed at least eight serious
crises in 1825, 1836—39, 1847, 1857, 1866, 1873, 1882, and 1890. With this perspective of the gold standard era the relevant question should not only be how the
gold standard worked but also why did it fail.

The origins of the various crises during the gold standard era vary.
Some were "real" and some were"financial", some automomous (like a massive har-

vest failure) and some were induced by mistaken policies. Of course, no proponent of the gold standard has suggested that it would eliminate harvest failures.
The question, therefore, is whether and to what extent the policies that are induced by the rules of the game mitigate or exacerbate the severity of crises.

Our paper examines the 1847 crisis in Great Britain. That year, well documented
by Parliamentary Inquiries, is of special interest since the origin of the crisis

was "real". A harvest failure gave rise to commercial distress and financial
panic the extremity of which were remarkable. Our analysis examines the operation
of the gold standard, the policies of the Bank of England as well as the speed
and extent of international adjustment in the form of gold and capital flows.
The paper proceeds as follows: the second section provides a brief account

of the main events in Great Britain during 1847. Section III studies the institutional setting of the gold standard and spells out a formal model of the finan-

cial markets. The two crises of April and October 1847 are studied in section
IV. In section V we discuss whether suspension of Peel's Act was necessary.
The paper concludes with some observations on the gold standard as a monetary
system.

II. Outline of Events
The events of 1847 were initiated by a major harvest failure in Ireland and

England in 1846. The shortage of domestic food supplies led to large price increases and trade deficits which in turn brought about an external drain of bul-

lion from the Bank of England. These developments occurred against the background of the "railway mania" which commenced in 1845.

3

The railway mania along with the food panic resulted in a massive financial

crisis, the analysis of which is the subject of this paper. The characteristics of the 1847 crisis have been stated by John Stuart Mill:

It is not, howver, universaL1' true that the contraction
of credit, characteristic of a commercial crisis, must
have been preceded by an extra—ordinary and irrational
extension of it. There are other causes; and one of more
recent crises, that of 1847, is an instance, having been
preceded by no particular extention of credit, and by no
The
speculations; except those in railway shares
crisis of 1847 belonged to another class of mercantile
phenomena. There occasionally happens a concurrence of
circumstances tending to withdraw from the loan market
a considerable portion of the capital which usually supplies it. These circumstances, in the present case,
were great foreign payments, (occasioned by a high price
of cotton and an unprecedented importation of food)
together with the continual demands on the circulating

capital of the country by railway calls and the loan
transactions of railways companies,... This combination
of

a fresh demand for loans, with a curtailment of the
capital disposable for them, raised the rate of interest,
and made it impossible to borrow except on the very best
security. Some firms.., stopped payment: their failure
involved more or less deeply many other firms which had
trusted them; and, as usual in such cases, the general
distrust, commonly called a panic, began to set in, and
might have produced a destruction of credit equal to that
of 1825, had not circumstances which may almost be called
accidental, given to a very simple measure of the government (the suspension of the Bank Charter Act of 1844) a
fortunate power of allaying panic, to which, when considered
in itself, it had no sort of claim. [Mill, 1871, Book III,
Chap. XII, §. 4).

Table

1 reports selected data for the period 1845—48. 1847 was charac-

terized by a deterioration in the balance of trade and the terms of trade as
well as by a significant rise in the price of wheat and the other price indices.

The

in

trade balance deficit caused gold outflows and an accompanying reduction

the supply of Bank of England liabilities and credit. While the external

bullion drain was one direct consequence of the harvest failure, a second one was
the

extensive commercial failures arising from speculative forward purchases of

—4—

food stuffs for delivery in mid—1847. By the time these contracts came to
maturity a good harvest for 1847 was expected and that change in expectations
led to a drastic decline in spot prices and default of many trading establish-

ments. In addition, the precarious financial position of many enterprises
that had taken part in the railway speculations, reduced confidence in the
financial integrity of the system and resulted in an internal drain of bank
reserves.

Figures 1—3 show the weekly data for the stock of bullion in the Bank of
England, the Bank's note reserve, the stock of notes held outside the Bank,
and the price of consol.2

Two major crises occurred during the year. The April crisis arose from the
reversal of Bank of England credit policy. Having followed to that date a policy
of sterilization of the credit effect of the deficit by lowering its reserve—deposit

ratio, the Bank reversed its policy in April by raising the discount rate and

only sparingly accommodating the discount market. The suddenness and severity
of the action led to a panic as the best houses in the trade found it impossible to obtain domestic credit.

The panic in October by contrast was due to an internal drain which resulted from a loss of confidence in the convertibility of bank deposits into
Bank of England notes and was essentially due to the operation of Peel's Act
which is described in the next section.

That crisis was overcome by the

joint effect of a suspension of the prohibition of fiduciary issue and a discount rate at an unprecedented level of 8 percent. The policy package led

domestically to a full return of confidence and a reduction in defensive liquidity
positions while at the same time attracting gold and capital from the rest of

the world. By the end of the year the Bank of England had restored its note
reserve as well as its stock of bullion to the levels prevailing prior to the

year of crisis. Both in April and in October the timing of the public sector
deposit withdrawals aggravated significantly Bank of England liquidity problems
and contributed to precipitating the crises.

The policies pursued to alleviate the October panic were an early application

of by now well accepted centtal banking principles. In the subsequent section we
develop an analytical framework to study the interaction of external payments
and the financial system.

III. InstItution5 and A Model of Financial Markets
In what follows we discuss the events in 1847 in the context of a simple

model. The model establishes how the rate of interest is determined by the
existing stock of bullion, currency preferences of the public and reserve be-

havior of the Bank of England, The analysis starts with the institutional
setting, namely the provisions of Peel's act of 1844.

The Provisions of Peel's Act and the Money Supply

Peel's Act was passed by Parliament in 1844 and essentially enacted the

doctrine of the "currency school."3 The main provisions were the following:

1. The Bank was separated into a banking and an 'tissue" department.
2. The fiduciary note issue was limited to 14 million pound sterling,
and supplementary note issue required a 100% marginal bullion reserve.
3. Notes were issued for bullion at 13.l7s9d pound sterling per ounce
of gold.

The consolidated balance sheet of the Issue and Banking Departments is

shown in Table 2. Several points are worth noting. First the distinction between public deposits, including in particular the exchequer and the account for
debt service (entitled for payment of dividends), and the private deposits among

which we include bankers' accounts. Second we note on the liability side the
item "circulation" which refers to Bank of England notes including seven—day and

other bills. The latter remain less than 1 million pounds throughout. On the
asset side we note the item "bullion" which refers to silver and gold bullion as
well as coin in the Bank.

To study the operation of the Bank of England in accord with Peel's Act
we show in Table 3 the corresponding disaggregated balance sheets of the Banking
and Issue departments respectively.

In analysing the balanc2 sbt 'e"oral comments are noteworthy: First,
the issue department has security holdings in the amount of l4 million that

back the fiduciary component (F) of note issue, (N), but at the margin there is
100 percent backing of note issue. Furthermore, note issue is confined to the
issue department. Second, the banking department holds part of the Bank of
England note Lssue as

reserve,

(R), against their deposIt taD

().

The money supply——that means the supply of Bank of England liabilities——
equals the sum of currency and Private deposits, and the monetary base equals

the sum of currency and reserves. With these definitions we express the proximate determinants of the money supply as shown in equation (1):

(1)

M

c

[B + fl

= m(c,r)

[B+F]

—7—

where m(c,r)

(1+c)/(c+rc) is the money multiplier. The ratio of total to private

deposits is denoted by

(D+G)/D, c denotes the currency—private deposit ratio of

the non—bank public and r is the actual reserve—total deposit ratio in the banking
department.4

From (1) we have the familiar properties that an increase in bul-

lion B, given the reserve and currency—deposit ratios, will increase the money
stock as will a reduction of the ratio of total to private deposits and of the

reserve and currency—deposit ratios. Throughout this paper the discussion is confined to the supply of Bank of England note and deposit liabilities.

The Financial Model
The currency—deposit ratio is determined by institutional factors as well

as by the reserve—deposit ratio. Specifically, a rise in the actual reserve—
deposit ratio, r, is assumed to enhance confidence in the convertibility of
deposits into notes (internal convertibility) and therefore it reduces the
desired currency—deposit ratio, c.

This relation between c and r is expressed

by equation (2):

(2)

c =

c(r),

c' 0

With this assumption the money supply function (1) becomes:

(3)

M =

i(r)

[B+F]; rn' 0

where i(r) E m(c(r),r).

Our specification implies that a rise in the reserve—deposit ratio exerts two
effects on the money multiplier. First, it reduces it directly through the increased use of highpowered money by the Banking Department; and second, the rise
in the reserve—deposit ratio raises confidence and, thereby, reduces the currency—deposit ratio which in turn increases the money multiplier. In what fol-

lows we assume that the net tffect cf a hiher reserve—deposit ratio is to

our discussion we abstract from the existence of private banks, their note issue,
their deposit liabilities or tir demand for Bank of England nctes.

—8—

lower the money multiplier, that is, iii' < 0.

This may appear plausible at first

sight but is in fact a strong assumption since it eliminates the possibility of
a dominating impact of the internal convertibility problem.
The demand for real balances is assumed to depend on real income, y, as

well as on the rate of interest, i, in the conventional way. Monetary equilibrium requires that the real money stock, M/P, equa1s the demand for real balances,
L( ) as in equation (4):

Focusing on the short—run of weeks or months rather than a year or more, we take

both prices and output as exogeneous to the financial sector.5 With this assumption and with a given fixed stock of fiduciary issue, Equation (4) can be solved
for the equilibrium interest rate as a function of the reserve—deposit ratio and
the stock of bullion:

The adjustment of the Banks lending policy, motivated by prudence and
profit, is described in equation (5). The Banking Department adjusts gradually, raising the reserve—deposit ratio, through credit contraction, in proportion to the discrepancy between the desired reserve—deposit ratio

and the actual ratio, r. Thus,

rates may in fact be disregarded without too much obvious strain.

—9—

of interest increases. This reflects the behavior of the Banking Department:
In response to more profitable loan opportunities the desired liquidity of the
balance sheet is reduced.

A specification of the rate of inflow of bullion completes the model. The
rate of inflow of bullion or the balance of payments, denoted by B, depends on

the exogeneous trade balance as well as on the rate of capital inflow. Capital
flows respond positively to the international interest differential, i_i*, and
the foreign interest rate, i*, is taken as given:

(6)

B =

B(i_i*;

...);

> 0.

Again, we concentrate on the short—term and, therefore, leave relative prices
and output as exogeneous to the model.

Formal Dynamics

Equations (4V), (5) and (6) represent a dynamic model of the interaction
between the Banking Department's credit policy and the balance of payments.
Substituting (4') in (5) and (6) yields the following pair of equations:

(7)

=

G(r,B) ; GO, GB >

(8)

=

H(r,B)

;

0

Hr >O HB < 0

where the signs of the partial derivatives follow from the previous assumptions.
It is readily verified that the system, shown in Figure 4, must be stable.
In
and

to

Figure 4 the i = 0

schedule shows the locus of reserve—deposit ratios

levels of bullion at which the Banking Department is in

equilibrium

with respect

its liquidity position. Therefore, along that schedule the reserie—deposit

—10--

ratio is neither rising nor falling. At points above the schedule the high
reserve—deposit ratio implies a low real money supply and thus high interest

rates. The preferred reserve—deposit ratio is low and therefore, above the
r=O schedule, the reserve—deposit ratio is being lowered. Conversely, below
the r=O schedule the Banking Department seeks to become more liquid because
interest rates are low, and therefore the reserve—deposit ratio is raised.

Along the B = 0 schedule the balance of payments is in equilibrium. Points
below and to the right of the schedule correspond to high money supplies, low

interest rates, capital outflows and therefore deficits and falling bullion. By
contrasts, points to the left of the schedule involve high interest rates and

growing levels of bullion. Along the B = 0 schedule the interest rate is compatible
with external balance. The interest rate is higher above and to the left of the
schedule and lower below and to the right of the schedule. The relative slopes of
the two schedules is implied by the previously assumed restrictions.
As the arrows indicate the dynamic model

of the financial sector must

be stable and the approach to equilibrium cannot be oscillatory. From
any initial reserve—deposit ratio and stock of bullion the adjustment process
leads to the steady state at point A where the Bank's liquidity position is in
equilibrium and external payments are balanced.

The response of the Bank's reserve—deposit ratio to the rate of interest is

reflected in the slope of the O schedule. The less responsive the Bank the
flatter the schedule and, in the extreme, when the Bank is entirely unresponsive,

the desired reserve—deposit ratio is constant and the 0 schedule is horizontal.
As the reserve—deposit ratio becomes more responsive the schedule steepens and,

in the limit, its slope coincides with that of the =0 schedule. The responsiveness
of the reserve—deposit ratio, of course, determines the extent to which interest

rates move in the adjustment process. If the reserve—deposit ratio declines in

response to high interest rates than a shortage of bullion will in part be offset by increased lending on the part of the Bank and interest rates therefore
will tend to be lower, the balance of payments will be smaller and the rate of

adjustment will be slower. Conversely, if the reserve—deposit ratio is unresponsive, a shortage of bullion implies a sharper reduction in the money stock,
high equilibrium interest rates, larger capital flows and faster adjustment.

The Adjustment Process

The traditional model of the price specie flow mechanism originating with
the David Hume, emphasizes the impact of relative prices on the trade balance
and hence on the balance of payments and the international flow of bullion.

A

deterioration of the external balance due to increased aggregate spending
or an adverse development of net exports would lead to bullion export, monet-

ary deflation, declining spending and price deflation. Both the decline in
spending and deflation work to restore external balance.
The model we have sketched here, on the contrary, places emphasis on
capital flows and banking policy as the main factors in the adjustment pro-

cess. The two views of the adjustment mechanism are, of course, complementary
although they may well correspond to different adjustment periods. In the
short run banking policy and capital flows are likely to be the main factors
determining bullion flows, since, in the short run, prices and trade flows do
not adjust to the full possible extent.

The role of capital flows in the adjustment process was recognized by con-

temporaries. John Stuart Mill, in particular noted:
"it is a fact now beginning to be recognized, that the passage
of the precious metals from country to country is determined
much more than was formally supposed by the state of the loan
market in different countries and much less by the state of
prices." (Mill, l87l,Book III, Chapter VIII, 4).

—12—

In addition to the difference between the balance of trade and the
capital account in facilitating adjustment, there is another aspect of the

adjustment process that deserves emphasis. The traditional representation
of the gold standard is taken to be an automatic, non—discretionary adjust-

ment. Bullion flows are matched one—for—one by changes in the amount of
currency outstanding. This is,of course, not the case once the reaction
of the Banking Department are taken into account. Changes in the reserve—
deposit ratio of the Banking Department affect the money stock independently
of the existing stock of bullion. The question then arises whether during the
1847 episode the Banking Department's credit policy may in fact have amounted

to partial or even complete sterilization of bullion flows. This possibility
of credit expansion by the Bank and loss of reserve notes financing the export
of bullion is suggested by the data which reveal a high correlation between
weekly changes in bullion and in note reserves.
Consider an autonomous, transitory improvement in the trade balance
which leads to an inflow of bullion and therefore to a monetary expansion.

The monetary expansion lowers the interest rate and, with a constant reserve—
deposit ratio (or a flat ir=O schedule in Figure 4) the lower interest rate

leads to capital outflows and thereby to restoration of the initial equilibrium.

Now if,

on the contrary, the reserve—deposit

ratio rises due to the

Banking Department response to the reduced profitability of loans, then the
rise in the reserve—deposit ratio dampens the decline in interest rates and
therefore slows down the adjustment process. The Banking Department's reaction to the interest rate will only slow the speed of adjustment but will not

eliminate the adjustment process. Thus our model is also capable of incorporating a partial sterilization policy with an effect of dampening interest rate
movements and reducing the speed of adjustment.

—13—

Changes in the reserve—deposit ratio enter consideration in another respect.

If the Bank, perhaps in response to a loss of confidence on the part of the public,
decides to raise the reserve—deposit ratio, then this, of course, leads to a reduc-

tion in the supply of money and credit. Interest rates rise and that state persists
until bullion inflows accommodate the desired increase in reserves. This model suggests therefore that changes in the Bank's reserve preferences may be an important
source of macroeconomic disturbance.

The possibility of internal inconvertibility turns out to be an important issue

in the 1847 crisis. Internal inconvertibility would arise if the Banking Department
should become sufficiently illiquid not to be able to redeem its deposit liabilities

into notes. Thus there is a clear distinction between external or gold—convertibility
and internal or note—convertibility. Note—convertibility involves the Banking Department's reserve—deposit ratio. If the reserve—deposit ratio falls too low the public
loses confidence and reacts by raising the currency—deposit ratio. While our model
embodies this reaction of the public, this reaction is for the moment not allowed to
exercise a dominating influence.6

Some Evidence
Before the detailed discussion of the various crises which occurred during
1847, we look at some evidence that is consistent with the general analytical
framework outlined in this section.

The dynamic model was summerized by equations (7)—(8). Changes in the
reserve—deposit ratio depend negatively on the level of that ratio and positively
on the stock of bullion while changes in the stock of bullion depend positively

on the reserve—deposit ratio and negatively on the stock of bullion. In Table 4

61f a rise in the reserve—deposit ratio lowers the currency—deposit
ratio so much as to raise the money multiplier (in contrast with our assumption in Equation (3)), then a higher reserve—deposit ratio would lower interest
rates and thus change the specification in (4'). The B=O schedule might then
be negatively sloped at low levels of r, and so may even the rO curve. We
xauiine this cnse in section V below.

we report regressions of the changes in the reserve—deposit ratio and bullion

and we turn next to a more detailed analysis of the crises of 1847.

Financial

Markets and the Balance of Payments in 1847

The April Crisis
The harvest failure of 1846/1847 depleted the bullion in the Bank in the

fall of 1846 and, more so, in early 1847. Table 5 shows the development of
bullion, the note reserve, the reserve—deposit ratio, the discount rate and
the stock of notes in the hands of the public during the first half of 1847.

The table brings out forcefully the magnitude of the depletion. Indeed, over
the period January 2 to April 17, 1847 bullion fell by about 40 percent and
the note reserve in the Banking Department declined by about 70 percent.
The extraordinary decline in the reserve—deposit ratio from 46 percent to

19.6 percent, implies that the Bank sterilized substantially the effect of
gold outflows. The decline in the reserve—deposit ratio occurred along with
an increasing discount rate. The table reports the weighted average discount

rate applied by the Bank. From a level of 3 percent in the beginning of the
year, the rate was gradually raised toward 5 percent in early April 1847.
These developments suggest that part of the effects of

the external drain

on the money supply were sterilized. Whether sterilization was a conscious
policy, or whether it was a banking response to increasing interest rates

and credit tightness is open to question. But it is certainly interesting

to note that F.T. Baring, the ex—Chancellor of the Exchequer argued that

the possibility of sterilization was a major defect of the Bank Act of 1844:

believe, if

"I

we look back, we shall find that the

of the deposits and the question of the reserve
was not sufficiently considered, either by those who were
operation

favorable or those who were opposed to the bill. I cannot find in the evidence before the committee of 1840 more
than a few sentences leading me to suppose that danger
arising from such a cause was contemplated or referred to;
yet this was a most important consideration; for it was
by the reserve, the bank was enabled to do what was contrary to the spirit of the bill when gold was running out,
not to reduce their circulation by a single pound. I do
not think that the system works satisfactorily in this
respect; and in fact, the point did not receive anything
like a sufficient consideration. Perhaps it was impossible before the bill was in practical operation to see
how the reserve of notes would operate; but it certainly
never entered into the contemplation of anyone then considering the subject that £7,000,000 in gold should run
off, yet that the notes in the hands of the public would
rather increase than diminish." (F.T. Baring, 1847, as
quoted in MacLeod, 1896, pp. 141—2).
The relative constancy of notes in the hands of the public to which

Baring refers, is shown in Table 5. Through late April 1847 notes were practically unchanging while bullion declined by nearly one—third. In this period
the Bank of England expansion "financed" the export of bullion. Bullion losses
did not exert their full contractionary effect on money and credit because the
reserve—deposit

In

ratio was declining.

March and April things became troublesome. The ongoing decline of

bullion tightened credit market conditions and the failure of the Bank to
change its accommodating stance in the face of a deteriorating balance sheet
evoked concern about a sudden reversal of policies that would leave the

public without notes and without loans. In April, therefore, the ongoing

7me defects

of the Bank act were discussed forcefully by Thomas Tooke
(1844) whose views are analysed by Laidler (1975). For a further analysis
see Morgan (1943).

—16—

drain of bullion was reinforced dramatically by the seasonal payment of the

dividend which meant a significant run—down of public deposit. During the
week of April 17th reserves fell to a level of only £2.56 million, the reserve—

deposit ratio fell to less than 20 percent. Consol prices fell in March—April
by 4.5 percent and short—term interest rates skyrocketed as the Bank moved
vigorously to restore its liquidity position by reduced discounts, consol sales
and high discount rates.

Figure 5 shows the series for private and public deposits. The Figure makes
it clear that whatever influence the bullion drain had on the liquidity position
of the bank, the sharp public deposit withdrawal could not but accentuate the

problem. Table 6 shows that the public sector deposit withdrawal led only partially

to a loss in reserves and that the money stock did not change substantially.
The Table confirms that the Bank of England managed to face the runoff by selling
securities.

Figure 6 shows the weekly series of the reserve—deposit ratio during

the year. The effects of the extra ordinary loss of reserves (by April 17th) and
the reaction of the financial markets and the Bank of England have been described
by MacLeod (1896, p. 142):

"When, therefore, the public saw that the whole banking
resources of the bank were reduced to £2,558,000, a
complete panic seized both the public and the directors.
The latter adopted severe measures to check the demand
for notes. The rate was not only raised to five percent, but this was only applicable to bills having
only a few days to run, and a limit was placed upon
the amount of bills discounted, however good they
might be. Merchants who had received loans were
called upon to repay them without being permitted
to renew them. miring some days it was impossible
to get bills discounted at all. These measures
were effectual in stopping the efflux of bullion;
and a sum of £100,000 in sovereigns, which had
been actually shipped for America, was relanded.
During this period the rate of discount for the
best bills rose to nine, ten and twelve percent."

The tightening of credit Led to internal dishoarding and to some re-

flow of bullion. Accordingly, the Bank's reserve—deposit ratio quickly
rose to about 30 percent. The crisis was overcome and the adjustment process of tight money was underway. The external part of that adjustment
process involved importation of bullion and foreign investment in London as

well as English borrowing abroad. In response to high yields on consols,

the Emperor or Russia decided o substicue foreign securities for gold as
a backing of the Russian currency and effected substantial purchases of
consols. These developments, and their effect on the restoration of confidence were described in the contemporary writings as follows:

"Between the 25th and 28th of April confidence in a
slight degree revived. The Bank was then discounting
more freely; and the important news was announced
that the Emperor of Russia had issued a Ukase 'ordering an investment of about four and a half million
sterling in home and foreign securities'. Under the
impression that a large amount of the money would
find employment in Consols, as ultimately was the
case, this circumstance, coupled with greater
disposition of the Bank to grant facilities for
accommodation , tended to abate the pressure."
(Evans, 1849, p. 62.)

It seems fairly clear from the events that the Bank's policy in the first

half of the year was certainly poor. It had all the characteristics of a policy
of "too late, and (therefore) too vigorously". The continued expansion of
credit in the face of the falling reserves, and of the prospect of further de-

cline in bullion, meant that a crunch was quite inevitable. To wait with
tightening for too long, and to ultimately administer it with severity, led to
an unnecessary panic in the money market.

—18—

The October Crisis

The severe credit tightening following the April crisis restored the Bank's
ability to maintain convertibility. Table 7 shows that by June the reserve—
deposit ratio was again substantial. The currency outstanding was significantly
lower

than during the April crisis. But during the late summer, and especially

in early fall, conditions deteriorated, setting the basis for the October crisis.

The credit tightening starting with the April crisis raised the
cost of credit substantially above what it had been in past years, and indeed

above anything the public could remember. This is reflected in "The Petition
of Merchants, Bankers, and Traders of London Against the Bank Charter Act"
issued in July 1847, in which the opening statement reads:
"

That there has lately been apparent throughout.
the commercial and manufacturing community of
this country an extent of monetary pressure,
such as is without precedent in the memory of
the oldest living merchant." (Gregory, 1929,
vol. II, p. 3.)

Figure 7 confirms that 1847 interest rates were at a peak relative to the

preceding 25 years. In May, first—class bills had been discounted at an all—time
high of 7 percent, but by July the rate had, in fact returned to 5.5 percent which,
as the Figure shows, is still very high.8

By October the increasing tightness of credit, the extra—ordinary height of
the rate of interest, commercial failures and the threat of financial institutions

defaulting had increased even further. Sir Charles Wood, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer is quoted as stating:

"When he came to town i Oct,ber he found the City
in a state of panic. He saw persons of all classes
and descriptions from the time he was up until he
went to bed, and he never passed so painful a week.
The interest of money rose to an exorbitant rate,
and 60 percent per annum was charged for what were
called "continuations" for one day. It was thought
impossible that the loans could be repaid
(Gregory, 1929, :l. II, p. 11.)

Developments between June and September resulted in some decline in both bullion

and note reserve. The large payments for grain shipments received in June and
July from Russia became due, and caused a further drain of bullion and reserves.
By now, of course, the cumulative external drain had reduced both bullion and

note reserves. Bullion still remained at a comfortable £8.3 million, but the
note reserve was down to only £1.55 million, well within the reach of depletion

by a scramble for currency. The same point is clear from the reserve—deposit
ratio that had declined from 32 percent in June to only 11.6 percent by late
October.

The October crisis, once again, shows the role of public sector deposit
movements, but this time in combination with a scramble for currency by the

public. Table 8 shows a large decline in public sector deposits of nearly
4 million between the 9th and 16th. Three quarters of that deposit reduction

are matched by a reduction in exchequer bills on the asset side. In the week
of the 23rd dividened payments further reduced public sector deposits and showed

up in increased currency in circulation. The increase in currency during the

first three weeks was only 2 million and as such did not appear large, but
that gain must be compared to the reserves in the issue department which by

the 23rd had fallen to only 1.5 million. The crisis thus involved the potential
of minor increases in currency holdings putting the Bank into insolvency.
While the external drain set the pre—conditions for the crisis, it was the
internal run and scramble for currency shown in Figure 8 that caused the panic

of October. The poor liquidity position of the Bank was deteriorated further by a
lot of commercial failures which in turn caused the public to question the
soundness of private banks and thus required, on their part, increased liquidity
and an ability to demonstrate convertibility of their liabilities into Bank of

England notes or specie. Again this factor enhanced the shortage of Bank of
England notes and the inadequacy of the note reserve.9

It is not certain who broke the Old Lady's back. There is some
indication in the I nquiry that nrivate bankers threatened the withdrawal of

deposits from the Bank in excess of the amount of notes on hand (Gregory, 1929,
10

vol. II, p. 113). The Bank, however, put up an admirable stone face and, would
claim in the Enquiry that there was no issue of convertibility having been in

question. Thus, in 1848, the Governor of the Bank, James Morris, told the
House of Lords:

"The Question was put to me over and over again
whether we were able to take care of the Bank.
I always stated that, so far as the Bank itself
was concerned, we had no Difficulty; but that,
whether Her Majesty's Government might have any
political Reasons, such as Fear of Mills being
stopped, or Riots in the Country, was a Question
for them to decide, and one which we could not
answer." (Gregory, 1929, vol. II, p. 11.)

9it is interesting to note that the developments during the October Crisis
were part of the evidence which stimulated Jevons' theory of the "Frequent
Autumnal Pressure" (see Jevons, 1884, ch. V).
100n October 23 London Bankers held £1.6 million with the Bank of England
whereas the note reserve was only £1.5 million. While balances of all Bankers
had risen from 1.5 to 2.1 million in the week of the 16th, they declined to only
1.8 million by October 23.

Indeed, the way the Bank proposed to restore its financial position suggests that
they may well have been able to maintain convertibility by an extraordinary con-

traction

of

of credit. Here it is worth quoting what the Governor told the House

Lords:

"We should have had no Difficulty whatever in
meeting all our Liabilities. We should not
have been able to give the same Extent of
Accommodation that Parties were requiring
from us. Parties came and thought they had
only to ask for Money and they would have
it at once. We might have put into the
Account a consLderable Amount by selling
Consols. We had going off weekly Bills to
the Extent of £1,500,000, so that by discounting even at the Rate of £100,000 a Day
to give the Public some Accommodation our
Reserve would still have increased at the
Rate of £900,000 a Week. It is certain
that in a very short Period we should have
had as large a Reserve as would be necessary
for our Purposes, and therefore I maintain
that the Bank was never at any Period in
Jeopardy." (Evans, 1849, P. 89.)
Whether the Bank might have been successful or not, the contraction of money
and credit was so severe, commercial failure was so widespread and reaching increasingly the banking system, that the government felt it was wise to suspend

Peel's Act, authorizing the Bank to issue notes without gold backing. The letter
of instruction, dated October 25, 1847, is reproduced here [the letter is reproduced in Turner (1897, pp 159—60) and in Evans (1849, p. 87)J.

The authorization for fiduciary issue, coupled with the high discount
rate

that the Bank was charging, rapidly restored financial stability. The

—23—

removal of the restriction on fiat money issue dispensed with the concern

for the internal convertibility of deposits into notes. The high interest
rates, at the same time, brought about very substantial inflows of capital.

The capital inflows, in turn, expanded the bullion in the Bank and thus led
to internal monetary expansion that over time alleviated the extreme tightness

in credit markets. By December 24, 1847 the reserve—deposit ratio had risen
substantially while interest rates had declined from their panic peaks of late
October.

It is important to recognize the role of international capital flows in

the adjustment process. A key aspect, in the eyes of the government, was that
suspension of Peel's Act be implemented in a way that was in no way prejudical
to external convertibility, i.e., fiat money issue that would finance export

of bullion. To prevent such a course of events the high interest rate was
an essential part of the suspension of Peel's Act since the very size of the
international interest differential would ensure that there was an advantage
for gold import and thus an external support of domestic monetary expansion.
The 1847 episode was probably responsible for the popular maximum (ascribed
to Bagehot) that "seven percent will draw gold home from the moon".11 That
high interest rates do attract gold flows is immediately obvious from the

bullion gain. Between October and December the Bank's holdings of bullion rose
by more than fifty percent. This interest responsiveness of bullion flows is
substantiated by a regression of the flow of bullion on lagged interest rates.
To examine the interest responsiveness of bullion flows we regressed the change
in the stock of bullion on current and lagged values of the consol yield (up

to a lag of eight weeks). We have experimented with various lag structures and,

11While we could not trace the exact origin of this maxim, it is being
refered to by Lionel Robbins in his testimony before the (Radcliffe) Committee
on the working of the Monetary System (1959, p. 218). We are indebted to David
Laidler for this reference.

—24—

consistently, the only significant coefficients were on the fourth and the

seventh lag. Equation (9) reports the regression of gold flows on the four
and seven weeks lagged interest rate; standard errors are reported below the
coefficients:

(9)

Bt = -0.892(10')

(0.043)10

R2=0.75, D.W.=2.16,

+ o.795(l08)it_7
(0.396)10

=0.43

The results are consistent with the expectations that the rate of capital in-

flow is related positively to the domestic rate of interest. Since in the pre—
telegraph period information on interest differentials could not be transmitted
instantaneously, it is reasonable to expect that gold flows respond to lagged value

of interest rates. The length of the lag, in turn, should correspond to the length
of time needed for a round trip between the home country and its trading partners.

The round trip was necessary since the information on the rates of interest had to

be transmitted and then the gold had to be shipped. The four and seven weeks lags
that are reported in equation (9) correspond, respectively, to the length of the
round trip between England and New York and England and

St.

12
Petersburg.

If this

interpretation of the lag structure is correct, one might expect that in subsequent

periods, following the introduction of telegraph, the lag structure would be shortened by a factor of 50 percent.

the regressions bear out is also quite clear from contemporary accounts:
Capital did move in response to interest rates:
What

ttThe

season was advanced and the navigation on

the Baltic near its close; but even at the disadvantage of a double rate of insurance, orders
had been sent to St. Petersburg, under the impulse of an 8 percent rate of interest, which
sufficed to bring back all, and more than all
the gold which had been exported in the beginning of the year. (Hubbard, 1848, p. 23.)

That same principle was understood by the Bank of England.

. it

•
was desirable that capital and bullion
should be attracted to this country, and it was
only by the attraction of a high rate of interest
that this desideratum could be accomplished. He
[the chancellor of the Exchequer] as convinced,
therefore, that the mode in which the Government had acted was the one best calculated to
attain the end they had in view——namely, the
influx of capital and the importation of bullion, and thereby the removal of the panic.
(Evans, 1848, p. 98.)
•

It is relevant to note, in the context of the discussion of capital flows,

that in the case of a transitory real disturbance as in the case of a Harvest
failure, the correct response is indeed financing through the capital account

of the balance of payments as opposed to the price—specie—flow mechanism of ad-

justment which operates through the trade account. The 1847 episode illustrates
this principle.

V. Was the Suspension of Peel's Act Necessary?
The authorisation for uncovered note issue, as we already noted,

immediately removed the panic, so much so that therewas almost no need•
to actually issue uncovered notes. In fact during the period of suspension
the Bank issued only £400,000 in notes in excess of the limits set by the

Act of 1844. The rapid restoration of confidence and the normalization of
affairs allowed the government to revoke the suspension on November 23:
(reprinted from Evans, 1849, p. 102):
Downing-street,

Nov. 23, 1847.

Majesty's Government have watched with the decpet interest
the gradual revival o( confidence in the commercial classes of the country.
° They have the satisfaction of believing that the course adopted by the Dank o(
England on their recommendation has contributed to produce this result, whul,t it
has led to no in(ringement of the law.
It appears from the account.. which you have transmitted to us, that the reserve
Oenflemen,—Hcr

of the Bank of England ha.. been (or some time steadily increasing, and now amounts

to £5,000.000. This increase has in great measure arisen from the return of notes
and coin from the country.
° The bullion exceeds £10,000,000, and the state of tho exchanges promise a fur.
ther iii tlux of thu precious metals.
Thu knowledge of thc.o futa by the publlo Is calculated to inspire still furthcr
confidence.

In tlmcse circumstance, it appears to her Majosty'. Government that the pur.

poses which they had in VIeW in the letter which we addressed to you on the 2,5th of
October ha.. been fully answered, and that it is unnecessary to continue that letter
any longer in force.
' We have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
° Your obedient humble servants,
J. RUSSELL.

The rapid normalization led in some quarters (in the Bank and elsewhere)

to the belief that there had been no real reason for the panic and no need to
allow suspension of Peel's Act in the first place. Thus Hubbard (1848, p.25)
commented:

"How utterly baseless were the apprehensions of the
panic—mongers is now proved by the fact that the
Bank not only never availed itself of the power of
additional issue, but met from its own resources
all the demands made upon it, including the extraordinary applications which would naturally be
encouraged by the prospect of their being favorable received."

Of course, the statement reflects, in an exemplary way, the lack of under-

standing of an internal convertibility crisis. A convertibility crisis or run
occurs only if in fact not everybody can be paid off. Suspension of the act
removed any conceivable basis for panic and therefore immediately restored a
measure of financial stability.
The special characteristics of an internal drain and the remedies that are
called for were fully perceived by Bagehot (1873):

"A domestic drain is very different. Such a drain
arises from a disturbance of credit within the
country, and the difficulty of dealing with it is
the greater, because it is often caused, or at least
often enhanced, by a foreign drain... What then ought
to be done? In opposition to what be at first sight
supposed, the best way for the bank. . . to deal with a
drain arising from internal discredit, is to lend freely"
(Bagehot, 1873, p. 23).
Since the key issue underlying an internal drain is lack of confidence, it is
clear that:

"What is wanted and what is necessary to stop a panic
is to diffuse the impression, that though money may
be dear, still money is to be had. If people could
be really convinced that they could have money.. . they
would cease to run in such a mad way for money. Either
shut the Bank at once, . . .or lend freely, boldly, and so
that the public may feel you mean to go on lending"
(Bagehot, 1873, p.31).

—27—

The Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Charles Wood told the Committee of
Inquiry that the basis of the panic was indeed a lack of confidence in internal

convertibility. He quotes commercial traders and bankers as stating:

"we

do not want notes——what we desire is that you

should give us confidence, it is only for you to

say that you will stand by us, and nothing in the
world else will give us confidence. We do not
want notes, but only to know where we can get
them... Charge 10 or 12 percent interest if you
like——we do not mean to take notes, but let us
know that at some rate of interest we can get
them and that will amply suffice." (quoted in
Evans, 1848, p. 96.)
Sir Robert Peel for his part expressed the view that the Bank Charter Act

had failed in one of important respects, namely it failed to secure a gradual
and early, as opposed to severe and sudden,adjustment:

"If the Bank had possessed the resolution to meet
the coming danger by a contraction of its issue,
by raising the rate of discount,..if they had
been firm and determined in the adoption of those
precautions, the necessity for extrinsic interference might have been prevented, it might not
have been necessary for the Government to authorise
the violation of the Act of 1844." [Quoted in
Andreades (1966, p. 339)]

Many felt that the Act, as opposed to the Bank of England policy, had

no effect in aggravating the crisis. S.J. Lloyd, for example, stated to the
Committee that:

"The

Act had no effect whatever in aggravating the

Pressure. It protected the Public from the additional evil, which would otherwise have occurred,
of a Failure in maintaining Convertibility of the
Notes, and the consequent complete Destruction of
our Monetary System." (Gregory, 1929, vol. II,
p.

But

44.)

this was not the view the House of Lords came to. While also agreeing on

—28—

the fundamental importance of external convertibility, the committee concluded
that:

"The recent panic was materially aggravated by the
operation of that statute, and by the proceedings
of the Bank itself. This effect may be traced,
directly, to the Act of 1844, in the legislative
restriction imposed on the means of accommodation,
whilst a large amount of bullion was held in the
coffers of the Bank, and during a time of favour—
able exchanges; and it may be traced to the same
cause, indirectly, as a consequence of great
fluctuations in the rate of discount, and of
capital previously advanced at an unusually low
rate of interest. This course the Bank would
hardly have felt itself justified in taking,
had not an impression existed that, by the separation of the issue and the banking departments,
one inflexible rule for regulating the Bank
issues had been substituted by law in place of the
discretion formerly vested in the Bank." (quoted
in Turner, 1897, pp. 162—3.)
Likewise,

"The Committee are fully aware that Alternations
of Periods of Commercial Excitement and of Discredit, of Speculation and of Collapse, are likely
to arise under all Systems of Currency; it would
be visionary to imagine that they could be averted
altogether, even if the Circulation were exclusively
Metallic. But it is on this Account that greater
Care should be taken to avoid increasing an Evil,
perhaps inevitable, by any arbitrary and artificial
Enactments.
The Committee are of opinion, that the Principle
on which the Act of 1844 should be amended is the
Introduction of a discretionary relaxing Power;
such Power, in whomsoever vested, to be exercised
only during the Existence of a favourable Foreign
Exchange." (Gregory, 1929, vol. II, p. 40.)

The very interesting aspect of the Lords' recommendation is the link between

fiat issue and the state of the foreign exchanges. It represents a departure
from strict gold standard rules where only actual gold flows can be monetized.

Under the proposal of the Committee it is enough to have the conditions for

—29—

gold flows to take place, as opposed to actual arrival of gold, for suspension

to be allowed. There is money issue, so to speak, on credit. The compromise
of lending freely at high rates——the high rates ensuring in time the arrival
of gold and the validation of the fiat issue——is important in that it is a
remedy specifically for internal convertibility crises for which Peel's Act
had made no allowance.

The model of the gold standard developed in section III above did not

raise issues of stability and crisis in that model. Portfolio adjustment
by the bank and gold flows in response to interest differentials brought about

smooth adjustment. How can the panic of October be accommodated in such a
framework? Here it becomes essential to recognize the dominating effect of
the currency—deposit ratio. When the reserve—deposit ratio of the Bank is
sufficiently low, so as to reduce confidence in the viability of internal
convertibility, then further reduction in the reserve—deposit ratio may bring
about changes in the currency—deposit ratio so large as to actually reduce
the money multiplier and the money stock.

In terms of equation (3) the money multiplier, in that low reserve—deposit
ratio region, responds positively to an increase in the reserve—deposit ratio

and, therefore the equilibrium interest rate responds negatively. The sign
reversal implies the possibility of multiple equilibria as shown in Figure 9.
Point A' is the stable equilibrium studied earlier, Point A is another
equilibrium in the region where convertibility concerns dominate the money

supply process. Point A is an unstable equilibrium that can be attained only
for initial conditions on the GG schedule. Initial conditions below and to
the left of GG lead to unstable paths of reserve ratio that decline to zero.
From a point such as C, with low bullion and low reserves, the Bank lowers the

VI. Concluding Remarks

In

this paper we have examined the operation of the gold standard and

the performance of the Bank of England during the crisis of 1847. The
key feature of that crisis has been its origin: it originated from the
instability of the real sector tather than from monetary disorder. That
crisis highlights the role of confidence in both external and internal

convertibility. We have presented a simple model that seems to capture
the central characteristics of the crisis and that emphasize the role of
international capital flows during the adjustment process

.

Our analysis

suggests that the repeal of Peel's Act, i.e. the collapse of the rigid
rules of the gold standard, was the correct and the essential policy which
was required for the restoration of confidence.
We return now tn the more general question of the gold standard as a

framework for macroeconomic stability. The monetary system, to work
satisfactorily would have to satisfy three criteria: First, to assure
stability and predictability of the general level of prices and output.
Second, to separate to a large extent banking and financial problems from
the :nacroeconomy. Third, to provide a stable financial framework that
facilitates financial intermediation and lending, both domestically and
in the world economy.

There is considerable doubt now whether the objective of the price

level stability was well served by the gold standard. There is evidence

—31—

of short term price variability substantially in excess of the post World

War II experience. It may also be argued that long term stability was,
to a large extent accidental being due to fortuitous gold discoveries

rather than the systematic operation of the system. But even with these
qualifications there can be little question that the gold standard was
a system that utterly excluded the extreme monetary instability Europe

witnessed, for example, in the 1920s. It also excluded the accelerating path
of inflation that we have experienced from the interaction of macroeconomic
shocks, inertia and accommodation in the 1970s.
But on a different account the gold standard was disappointing.
Until the principle "during crisis discount freely" was firmly established,
the gold standard provided an exceedingly poor framework for financial markets.

The presence of a lender of last resort——whether it be the Treasury of the
Central Bank——is essential as long as there is less than 100 percent reserve

banking. The lack of a lender of last resort was sharply obvious in the 1847
crisis when the Bank of England, in the midst of a banking panic, sold consols
and reduced discounts thus assuring confidence in deposit convertibility (not
gold convertibility) at the expense of devastating financial distress.
