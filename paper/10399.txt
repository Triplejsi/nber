Top Wealth Shares in the United States, 1916-2000: Evidence from Estate Tax Returns

NBER Working Paper No. 10399

JEL No. H2, N3
ABSTRACT

This paper presents new homogeneous series on top wealth shares from 1916 to 2000 in the United
States using estate tax return data. Top wealth shares were very high at the beginning of the period
but have been hit sharply by the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II shocks. Those
shocks have had permanent effects. Following a decline in the 1970s, top wealth shares recovered
in the early 1980s, but they are still much lower in 2000 than in the early decades of the century.
Most of the changes we document are concentrated among the very top wealth holders with much
smaller movements for groups below the top 0.1%. Consistent with the Survey of Consumer
Finances results, top wealth shares estimated from Estate Tax Returns display no significant increase
since 1995. Evidence from the Forbes 400 richest Americans suggests that only the super-rich have
experienced significant gains relative to the average over the last decade. Our results are consistent
with the decreased importance of capital income at the top of the income distribution documented
by Piketty and Saez (2003) and suggest that the rentier class of the early century is not yet
reconstituted. The most plausible explanations for the facts are perhaps the development of
progressive income and estate taxation which has dramatically impaired the ability of large wealth
holders to maintain their fortunes, and the democratization of stock ownership which now spreads
stock market gains and losses much more widely than in the past.

Introduction

The pattern of wealth and income inequality during the process of development of modern
economies has attracted enormous attention since Kuznets (1955) formulated his famous inverted U-curve hypothesis. Wealth tends to be much more concentrated than income because
of life cycle savings and because it can be transmitted from generation to generation. Liberals
have blamed wealth concentration because of concerns for equity and in particular for tilting
the political process in the favor of the wealthy. They have proposed progressive taxation as
an appropriate counter-force against wealth concentration.1 For conservatives, concentration of
wealth is considered as a natural and necessary outcome of an environment that provides incentives for entrepreneurship and wealth accumulation, key elements of macro-economic success.
Redistribution through progressive taxation might weaken those incentives and generate large
efficiency costs. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the forces driving wealth
concentration over time and whether government interventions through taxation or other regulations are effective and/or harmful to curb wealth inequality. This task is greatly facilitated by
the availability of long and homogeneous series of income or wealth concentration. Such series
are in general difficult to construct because of lack of good data. In this paper, we use the extraordinary micro dataset of estate tax returns that has been recently compiled by the Statistics
of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in order to construct homogeneous
series of wealth shares accruing to the upper groups of the wealth distribution since 1916, the
beginning of the modern federal estate tax in the United States.
The IRS dataset includes detailed micro-information for all federal estate tax returns filed
during the 1916-1945 period.2 We supplement these data with both published tabulations and
other IRS micro-data of estate tax returns from selected years of the second half of the century.
We use the estate multiplier technique, which amounts to weighting each estate tax return by the
inverse probability of death, to estimate the wealth distribution of the living adult population
from estate data. First, we have constructed almost annual series of shares of total wealth
1

In the early 1930s, President Roosevelt justified the implementation of drastic increases in the burden and

progressivity of federal income and estate taxation in large part on those grounds.

Scheuren, former director of the Statistics of Income division at the IRS.

accruing to various sub-groups within the 2% of the wealth distribution.3 Although small in
size, these top groups hold a substantial fraction of total net worth in the economy. Second,
for each of these groups, we decompose wealth into various sources such as real estate, fixed
claims assets (bonds, cash, mortgages, etc.), corporate stock, and debts. We also display the
composition by gender, age, and marital characteristics. This exercise follows in the tradition
of Lampman (1962), who produced top wealth share estimates for a few years between 1922
and 1956. Lampman, however, did not analyze groups smaller than the top .5% and this is
an important difference because our analysis shows that, even within the top percentile, there
is dramatic heterogeneity in the shares of wealth patterns. Most importantly, nobody has
attempted to estimate, as we do here, homogeneous series covering the entire century.4
Our series show that there has been a sharp reduction in wealth concentration over the 20th
century: the top 1% wealth share was close to 40% in the early decades of the century but has
fluctuated between 20 and 25% over the last three decades. This dramatic decline took place at
a very specific time period, from the onset of Great Depression to the end of World War II, and
was concentrated in the very top groups within the top percentile, namely groups within the
top 0.1%. Changes in the top percentile below the top 0.1% have been much more modest. It is
fairly easy to understand why the shocks of the Great Depression, the New Deal policies which
increased dramatically the burden of estate and income taxation for the wealthy, and World
War II, could have had such a dramatic impact on wealth concentration. However, top wealth
shares did not recover in the following decades, a period of rapid growth and great economic
prosperity. In the early 1980s, top wealth shares have increased, and this increase has also been
very concentrated. However, this increase is small relative to the losses from the first part of
the twentieth century and the top wealth shares increased only to the levels prevailing prior to
the recessions of the 1970s. Furthermore, this increase took place in the early 1980s and top
shares were stable during the 1990s. This evidence is consistent with the dramatic decline in top

For the period 1916-1945, because of very high estate tax exemption levels, the largest group we can consider

is the top 1%.

Smith (1984) provides estimates for some years between 1958 and 1976 but his series are not fully consistent
with Lampman (1962). Wolff (1994) has patched series from those authors and non-estate data sources to produce
long-term series. We explain in detail in Section 5.3 why such a patching methodology can produce misleading
results.

capital incomes documented in Piketty and Saez (2003) using income tax return data. As they
do, we tentatively suggest (but do not prove) that steep progressive income and estate taxation,
by reducing the rate of wealth accumulation of the rich, may have been the most important
factor preventing large fortunes to be reconstituted after the shocks of the 1929-1945 period.
Perhaps surprisingly, our top wealth shares series do not increase during the 1990s, a time of
the Internet revolution and the creation of dot-com fortunes, extra-ordinary stock price growth,
and of great increase in income concentration (Piketty and Saez, 2003). Our results are nevertheless consistent with findings from the Survey of Consumer Finances (Kennickell, 2003; Scholz,
2003) which also indicate hardly any growth in wealth concentration since 1995. This absence of
growth in top wealth shares in the 1990s is not necessarily inconsistent with the income shares
results from Piketty and Saez (2003) because the dramatic growth in top income shares since
the 1980s has been primarily due to a surge in top labor incomes, with little growth of top
capital incomes. This may suggest that the new high income earners have not had time yet to
accumulate substantial fortunes, either because the pay surge at the top is too recent a phenomenon, or because their savings rates are very low. We show that, as a possible consequence
of democratization of stock ownership in America, the top 1% individuals do not hold today a
significantly larger fraction of their wealth in the form of stocks than the average person in the
U.S. economy, explaining in part why the bull stock market of the late 1990s has not benefited
disproportionately the rich.5
Although there is substantial circumstantial evidence that we find persuasive, we cannot
prove that progressive taxation and stock market democratization had the decisive role we
attribute to them. In our view, the primary contribution of this paper is to provide new and
homogeneous series on wealth concentration using the very rich estate tax statistics. We are
aware that the assumptions needed to obtain unbiased estimates using the estate multiplier
method may not be met and, drawing on previous studies, we try to discuss as carefully as
possible how potential sources of bias, such as estate tax evasion and tax avoidance, can affect
our estimates. Much work is still needed to compare systematically the estate tax estimates
5

We also examine carefully the evidence from the Forbes 400 richest Americans survey. This evidence shows

sizeable gains but those gains are concentrated among the top individuals in the list and the few years of the
stock market “bubble” of the late 1990s, followed by a sharp decline from 2000 to 2002.

with other sources such as capital income from income tax returns, the Survey of Consumer
Finances, and the Forbes 400 list.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data sources and outlines our
estimation methods. Section 3 presents our estimation results. We present and analyze the
trends in top wealth shares and the evolution of the composition of these top wealth holdings.
Section 4 proposes explanations to account for the facts and relates the evolution of top wealth
shares to the evolution of top income shares. Section 5 discusses potential sources of bias, and
compares our wealth share results with previous estimates and estimates from other sources such
as the Survey of Consumer Finances, and the Forbes richest 400 list. Finally, Section 6 offers
a brief conclusion and compares the U.S. results with similar estimates recently constructed
for the United Kingdom and for France. All series and complete technical details about our
methodology are gathered in appendices of the paper.

Data, Methodology, and Macro-Series

In this section, we describe briefly the data we use and the broad steps of our estimation
methodology. Readers interested in the complete details of our methods are referred to the
extensive appendices at the end of the paper. Our estimates are from estate tax return data
compiled by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the beginning of the modern estate tax in
the United States in 1916. In the 1980s, the Statistics of Income division of the IRS constructed
electronic micro-files of all federal estate tax returns filed for individuals who died in the period
1916 to 1945. Stratified and large electronic micro-files are also available for 1965, 1969, 1972,
1976, and every year since 1982.6 For a number of years between 1945 and 1965 (when no microfiles are available), the IRS published detailed tabulations of estate tax returns (U.S. Treasury
Department, Internal Revenue Service, various years).7 This paper uses both the micro-files and
the published tabulated data to construct top wealth shares and composition series for as many
years as possible.
In the United States, because of large exemption levels, only a small fraction of decedents
has been required to file estate tax returns. Therefore, by necessity, we must restrict our analysis

7

Those data are stratified and hence always contain 100% of the very large estates.
Those tabulations are also based on stratified samples with 100% coverage at the top.

to the top 2% of the wealth distribution. Before 1946, we can analyze only the top 1%. As
the analysis will show, the top 1%, although a small fraction of the total population, holds
a substantial fraction of total wealth. Further, there is substantial heterogeneity between the
bottom of the top 1% and the very top groups within the top 1%. Therefore, we also analyze in
detail smaller groups within the top 1%: the top .5%, top .25%, the top .1%, the top .05%, and
the top .01%. We also analyze the intermediate groups: top 1-.5% denotes the bottom half of
the top 1%, top .5-.25% denoted the bottom half of the top .5%, etc. Estates represent wealth
at the individual level and not the family or household level. Therefore, it is very important to
note that our top wealth shares are based on individuals and not families. We come back to this
issue later. Each of our top groups is defined relative to the total number of adult individuals
(aged 20 and above) in the U.S. population, estimated from census data. Column (1) of Table A
reports the number of adult individuals in the United States from 1916 to 2002. The adult
population has more than tripled from about 60 million in 1916 to over 200 million in 2000. In
2000, there were 201.9 million adults and thus the top 1% is defined as the top 2.019 million
wealth holders, etc.
We adopt the well-known estate multiplier method to estimate the top wealth shares for the
living population from estate data. The method consists in inflating each estate observation by
a multiplier equal to the inverse probability of death.8 The probability of death is estimated
from mortality tables by age and gender for each year for the U.S. population multiplied by
a social differential mortality factor to reflect the fact that the wealthy (those who file estate
tax returns) have lower mortality rates than average. The social differential mortality rates
are based on the Brown et al. (2002) differentials between college educated whites relative to
the average population and are assumed constant over the whole period (see Appendix B for
a detailed discussion and analysis of the validity of this assumption). The estate multiplier
methodology will provide unbiased estimates of the wealth distribution if our multipliers are
correct on average and if probability of death is independent of wealth within each age and
gender group for estate tax return filers. This assumption might not be correct for three main
reasons. First, extraordinary expenses such as medical expenses and loss of labor income may

Harrison (1978) describe the method in detail.

5

occur and reduce wealth in the years preceding death. Second, even within the set of estate tax
filers, it might be the case that the most able and successful individuals have lower mortality
rates, or inversely that the stress associated with building a fortune, increases the mortality rate.
Last and most importantly, for estate tax avoidance and other reasons, individuals may start
to give away their wealth to relatives as they feel that their health deteriorates. We will later
address each of these very important issues, and try to analyze whether those potential sources
of bias might have changed overtime.
The wealth definition we use is equal to all assets (gross estate) less all liabilities (mortgages,
and other debts) as they appear on estate tax returns. Assets are defined as the sum of tangible
assets (real estate and consumer durables), fixed claim assets (cash, deposits, bonds, mortgages,
etc.), corporate equities, equity in unincorporated businesses (farms, small businesses), and various miscellaneous assets. It is important to note that wealth reported on estate tax returns only
includes the cash surrender value of pensions. Therefore, future pension wealth in the form of
defined benefits plans, and annuitized wealth with no cash surrender value is excluded. Vested
defined contributions accounts (and in particular 401(k) plans) are included in the wealth definition. Social Security wealth as well as all future labor income and human wealth is obviously
not included in gross estate. Estate tax returns include the full payout of life insurance but we
include only the cash value of life insurance (i.e., the value of life insurance when the person is
living) in our estimates.
Therefore, we focus on a relatively narrow definition wealth, which includes only the marketable or accumulated wealth that remains upon the owner’s death. This point is particularly
important for owners of closely held businesses: in many instances, a large part of the value of
their business reflects their personal human capital and future labor, which vanishes at their
death. Both the narrow definition of wealth (on which we focus by necessity because of our
estate data source), and broader wealth definitions including future human wealth are interesting and important to study. The narrow definition is more suited to examine problems of
wealth accumulation and transmission, while the broader definition is more suited to study the
distribution of welfare.9
9

The analysis of income distribution captures both labor and capital income and is thus closer to an analysis

of distribution of the broader wealth concept.

6

For the years for which no micro data is available, we use the tabulations by gross estate,
age and gender and apply the estate multiplier method within each cell in order to obtain a
distribution of gross wealth for the living. We then use a simple Pareto interpolation technique
and the composition tables to estimate the thresholds and average wealth levels for each of our
top groups.10 For illustration purposes, Table 1 displays the thresholds, the average wealth level
in each group, along with the number of individuals in each group all for 2000, the latest year
available.
We then estimate shares of wealth by dividing the wealth amounts accruing to each group by
total net-worth of the household sector in the United States. The total net-worth denominator
has been estimated from the Flow of Funds Accounts for the post-war period and from Goldsmith
et al. (1956) and Wolff (1989) for the earlier period.11 The total net-worth denominator includes
all assets less liabilities corresponding to the items reported on estate tax returns so that the
definitions of wealth in the numerator and the denominator are as close as possible. Thus, our
denominator only includes defined contribution pension reserves, and excludes defined benefits
pension reserves. Life insurance reserves, which reflect the cash surrender value of all policies
held are included in our denominator. The total wealth and average wealth (per adult) series
are reported in real 2000 dollars in Columns (3) and (4) of Table A. The CPI deflator used to
convert current incomes to real incomes is reported in Column (10). The average real wealth
series per adult along with the CPI deflator is plotted in Figure 1. Average real wealth per adult
has increased by a factor of three from 1916 to 2000 but the growth was very uneven during the
period. There was virtually no growth in average real wealth from 1916 to the onset of World
War II. Average wealth then grew steadily from World War II to the late 1960s. Since then,
wealth gross has been slower, except in the 1994-2000 period.12
After we have analyzed the top share data, we will also analyze the composition of wealth
10

We also use Pareto interpolations to impute values at the bottom of 1% or 2% of the wealth distribution for

years where the coverage of our micro data is not broad enough.
11
Unfortunately, no annual series exist before 1945. Therefore, we have built upon previous incomplete series
to construct complete annual series for the 1916-1944 period.
12
It is important to note that comparing real wealth over time is difficult because it requires to use a price
index and there is substantial controversy about how to construct such an index and account properly for the
introduction of new goods. That is why most of the paper focuses on top wealth shares which are independent of
the price index.

7

and the age, gender, and marital status of top wealth holders, for all years where these data
are available. We divide wealth into six categories: 1) real estate, 2) bonds (federal and local,
corporate and foreign) 3) corporate stock, 4) deposits and saving accounts, cash, and notes, 5)
other assets (including mainly equity in non-corporate businesses), 6) all debts and liabilities.
In order to compare the composition of wealth in the top groups with the composition of total
net-worth in the U.S. economy, we display in columns (5) to (9) of Table A, the fractions of real
estate, fixed claim assets, corporate equity, unincorporated equity, and debts in total net worth
of the household sector in the United States. We also present on Figure 1, the average real value
of corporate equity and the average net worth excluding corporate equity. Those figures show
that the sharp downturns and upturns in average net worth are primarily due to the dramatic
changes in the stock market prices, and that the pattern of net worth excluding corporate equity
has been much smoother.

3.1

The Evolution of Top Wealth Shares
Trends

The basic series of top wealth shares are presented in Table B1. Figure 2 displays the wealth
share of the top 1% from 1916 to 2000. The top 1% held close to 40% of total wealth, up to the
onset of the Great Depression. Between 1930 and 1932, the top 1% share fell by more than 10
percentage points, and continued to decline during the New Deal, World War II, and the late
1940s. By 1949, the top 1% share was around 22.5%. The top 1% share increased slightly to
around 25% in the mid-1960s, and then fell to less than 20% in 1976 and 1982. The top 1% share
increases significantly in the early 1980s (from 19% to 22%) and then stays remarkably stable
around 21-22% in the 1990s. This evidence shows that the concentration of wealth ownership in
the United States decreased dramatically over the century. This phenomenon is illustrated on
Figure 3 which displays the average real wealth of those in the top 1% (left-hand-side scale) and
those in the bottom 99% (right-hand-side scale). In 1916, the top 1% wealth holders were more
than 60 times richer on average than the bottom 99%. The figure shows the sharp closing of the
gap between the Great Depression and the post World War II years, as well as the subsequent
parallel growth for the two groups (except for the 1970s). In 2000, the top 1% individuals are

8

about 25 times richer than the rest of the population.
Therefore, the evidence suggests that the twentieth century’s decline in wealth concentration
took place in a very specific and brief time interval, 1930-1949 which spans the Great Depression,
the New Deal, and World War II. This suggests that the main factors influencing the concentration of wealth might be short-term events with long-lasting effects, rather than slow changes
such as technological progress and economic development or demographic transitions.
In order to understand the overall pattern of top income shares, it is useful to decompose
the top percentile into smaller groups. Figure 4 displays the wealth shares of the top 1-.5%
(the bottom half of the top 1%), and the top .5-.1% (the next .4 percentile of the distribution).
Figure 4 also displays the share of the second percentile (Top 2-1%) for the 1946-2000 period.
The figure shows that those groups of high but not super-high wealth holders experienced much
smaller movements than the top 1% as a whole. The top 1-.5% has fluctuated between 5 and 6%
except for a short-lived dip during the Great Depression. The top .5-.1% has experienced a more
substantial and long-lasting drop from 12 to 8% but this 4 percentage point drop constitutes a
relatively small part of the 20 point loss of the top 1%. All three groups have been remarkably
stable over the last 25 years.
Examination of the very top groups in Figure 5 (the top .1% in Panel A and the top .01% in
Panel B) provides a striking contrast to Figure 4. The top .1% declined dramatically from more
than 20% to less than 10% after World War II. For the top .01%, the fall was even more dramatic
from 10% to 4%: those wealthiest individuals, a group of 20,000 persons in 2000, had on average
1000 times the average wealth in 1916, and have about 400 times the average wealth in 2000.
It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the groups below the very top on Figure 4, the fall
for the very top groups continued during World War II. Since the end of World War II, those
top groups have remained fairly stable up to the late 1960s. They experienced an additional
drop in the 1970s, and a very significant increase in the early 1980s: from 1982 to 1985, the top
.01% increased from 2.5% to 4%, a 60% increase. However, as all other groups, those top groups
remained stable in the 1990s. Therefore, the evidence shows that the dramatic movements of
the top 1% share are primarily due to changes taking place within the upper fractiles of the top
1%. The higher the group, the larger the decline. It is thus important to analyze separately
each of the groups within the top 1% in order to understand the difference in the patterns.

9

Popular accounts (see Section 5.3 below) suggest that the computer technology in the recent
decades has created many new rich individuals. Those newly rich individuals are likely to be
much younger than the older rich. However, even if the new rich are younger and hence less likely
to die than the old rich, our estimates based on estate tax data should not be biased downward.
This is because the estate multiplier method corrects for changes in the age distribution of top
wealth holders. Our estimates should, however, become noisier (as the sampling probability by
death is reduced). This phenomenon should generate noisier series in the recent period but with
no systematic bias as long as our multipliers correctly reflect the inverse probability of death
of the wealthy in each age-gender cell.13 However, the series displayed on Figures 2, 4, and 5
are very smooth in the 1990s, suggesting that the groups we consider are large enough so that
sampling variability is small.14

3.2

Composition

Figure 6 displays the composition of wealth within the top 1% for 1929, a year when top wealth
shares and stock prices were very high. Wealth is divided into four components: real estate,
corporate stock (including both publicly traded and closely held stock), fixed claims assets
(all bonds, cash and deposits, notes, etc.), and other assets (including primarily non-corporate
business assets).15 Figure 6 shows that the share of corporate stock is increasing with wealth
while the share of real estate is decreasing with wealth, the share of fixed claims assets being
slightly decreasing (the share of bonds is slightly increasing and the share of cash and deposits
slightly decreasing). In the bottom of the top 0.5%, each of those three component represents
about one third of total wealth. At the very top, stocks represent almost two thirds of total
wealth while real estate constitutes less than 10%. This broad pattern is evident for all the years
of the 1916-2000 period for which we have data:16 the share of stocks increases with wealth and
the share of real estate decreases. The levels, however, may vary over time due mainly to the
sharp movements in the stock market.
13

If fewer than expected of these young wealthy individuals die, the estimate is downward biased but if more

than expected die, the estimate is upward biased.
14
The estimates are independent across years as every person dies only once.
15
Debts have been excluded from the figure but they are reported in Table B3.
16
All these statistics are reported in Table B3.

10

Figure 7 displays the fraction of corporate stock in net worth over the period 1916-2000 for
the top .5%, and for total net worth in the U.S. economy (from Tables B3 and A respectively).
Consistent with Figure 6, the fraction of stock is much higher for the top .5% (around 50%
on average) than for total net worth (around 20% on average). Both series are closely parallel
from the 1920s to the mid 1980s: they peak just before the Great Depression, plunge during the
depression, stay low during the New Deal, World War II, up to the early 1950s, and peak again
in the mid-1960s before plummeting in the early 1980s.
This parallel pattern can explain why the share of wealth held by the top groups dropped so
much during the Great Depression. Real corporate equity held by households fell by 70% from
1929 to 1933 (Figure 1) and the top groups hold a much greater fraction of their wealth in the
form of corporate stock (Figure 7). Those two facts mechanically lead to a dramatic decrease in
the share of wealth accruing to the top groups. The same phenomenon took place in the 1970s
when stock prices plummeted and the shares of top groups declined substantially (the real price
of corporate stock fell by 60% and the top 1% fell by about 20% from 1965 to 1982).
Corporate profits increased dramatically during World War II, but in order to finance the
war, corporate tax rates increased sharply from about 10% before the war to over 50% during
the war and they stayed at high levels after the war. This fiscal shock in the corporate sector
reduced substantially the share of profits accruing to stock-holders and explains why average
real corporate equity per adult increased by less than 4% from 1941 to 1949 while the average
net worth increased by about 23% (see Figure 1). Thus, top wealth holders, owning mostly
stock, lost relative to the average during the 1940s, and the top shares declined significantly.
The central puzzle to understand is why this explanation does not work in reverse after 1949,
that is, why top wealth shares did not increase significantly from 1949 to 1965 and from 1986
to 2000 when the stock market prices soared, and the fraction of corporate equity in total net
worth of the household sector increased from just around 12% (in 1949 and 1986) to almost 30%
in 1965 and almost 40% in 2000?
The series on wealth composition of top groups might explain the absence of growth in top
wealth shares during the 1986-2000 episode. The fraction of corporate stock in the top groups
did not increase significantly during the period (as can be seen on Figure 7, it actually drops
significantly up to 1990 and then recovers during the 1990s). Therefore, although the fraction of

11

corporate equity in total net worth triples (from 12% to 38%), the fraction of corporate equity
held by the top groups is virtually the same in 1986 and 2000 (as displayed on Figure 7). Thus,
the data imply that the share of all corporate stock from the household sector held by the top
wealth holders fell sharply from 1986 to 2000. Several factors may explain those striking results.
First, the development of defined contribution pensions plans, and in particular 401(k) plans,
and mutual funds certainly increased the number of stock-holders in the American population,17
and thus contributed to the democratization of stock ownership among American families. The
Survey of Consumer Finances shows that the fraction of families holding publicly traded stock
(directly or indirectly through mutual funds and pension plans) has increased significantly in
the last two decades, and was just above 50% in 2001.18
Second, the wealthy may have re-balanced their portfolios as gains from the stock-market
were accruing in the late 1980s and the 1990s, and thus reduced their holdings of equity relative
to more modest families.
In any case, the data strikingly suggest that top wealth holders did not benefit disproportionately from the bull stock market relative to the average wealth holder.19 This might explain
in part why top wealth shares did not increase in that period when top income shares were
dramatically increasing (see Section 5 below). By the year 2000, the fraction of wealth held
in stock by the top 1% is just slightly above the fraction of wealth held in stock by the U.S.
household sector (40% versus 38%). Therefore, in the current period, sharp movements of the
stock market are no longer expected to produce sharp movements in top wealth shares as was
the case in the past.20
17

The Flow of Funds Accounts show that the fraction of corporate stock held indirectly through Defined

Contribution plans and mutual funds doubled from 17% to 33% between 1986 and 2000.
18
In 1989, only 31.7% of American households owned stock, either directly or indirectly though pension and
mutual funds, while 48.9% and 51.9% did in 1998 and 2001 respectively. See Kennickell et al. (1997) and Aizcorbe
et al. (2003).
19
It is important to keep in mind that, because the wealth distribution is very skewed, the average wealth is
much larger than median wealth. Obviously, the stock market surge of the 1990s did not benefit the bottom half
of American families who do not hold any stock.
20
It should be emphasized, though, that the wealthy may not hold the same stocks as the general population.
In particular, the wealthy hold a disproportionate share of closely held stock, while the general population holds
in general only publicly traded stocks through mutual and pension funds (see e.g. Kennickell, 2003). Estate tax
returns statistics separate closely held from publicly traded stock only since 1986.

3.3

Age, Gender, and Marital Status

Figure 8 displays the average age and the percent female within the top .5% group since 1916.21
The average age displays a remarkable stability over time fluctuating between 55 and 60. Since
the early 1980s, the average age has declined very slightly from 60 to around 57. Thus, the
evidence suggests that there have been no dramatic changes in the age composition of top
wealth holders over time.22 In contrast, the fraction of females among top wealth holders has
almost doubled from around 25% in the early part of the century to around 45% in the 1990s.
The increase started during the Great Depression and continued throughout the 1950s and
1960s, and has been fairly stable since the 1970s. Therefore, there has been substantial gender
equalization in the holding of wealth over the century in the United States, and today, almost
50% of top wealth holders are female. It is striking, comparing Figure 2 and Figure 8, to note
the negative correlation between the top wealth shares and the fraction of women in the top
wealth groups. This suggests that the gender equalization at the top might have contributed to
the decline in top wealth shares measured at the individual level. It is conceivable that wealth
concentration measured at the family level has not declined as much as wealth concentration
measured at the individual level.23
Estate tax law regarding bequests to spouses has changed over time and this might have
affected the gender composition at the top through behavioral responses to estate taxation.
Before 1948, bequests to spouses were not deductible from taxable estates with an exception
of couples located in the so-called community property states where each spouse owned half of
all assets acquired during marriage. Starting in 1948, spousal bequests became deductible up
to 50% of the net estate. In 1981, spousal bequests became fully deductible.24 Those changes
might have increased the amount of spousal bequests made by wealthy individuals and hence
21
22

Series for all groups are reported in Table B4.
Although, due to significant decreases in mortality over the course of the 20th century, top wealth holders

nowadays have more years of potential lifespan ahead of them and are therefore younger relative to the average
population than in the early part of the century.
23
We come back to this point in Section 5.3 when we compare our estimates with wealth concentration measures
at the family level obtained with the Survey of Consumer Finances for the recent period.
24
Similarly, 50% and 100% of spousal gifts became deductible in 1948 and 1981 respectively. In 1976, the
marital deduction was modified to allow for the greater of 50% of estate or $250,000 to be deductible.

13

potentially increased the fraction of women in the top wealth groups.25 Two points should be
noted.
First, Figure 8 shows that most of increase in female fraction in the top wealth groups
happened before the changes in estate tax law regarding spousal bequests (in 1948 and 1981)
implying that those tax law changes can explain at best a fraction of the trend. As we discuss
below, estate tax rates at the top became very high in the 1930s.26 As a result, in order to
avoid “double estate taxation”, wealthy husbands had an incentive to pass their wealth directly
to the next generations instead of passing it to their widowed spouses. Such a phenomenon
should have decreased the number of wealthy widows, which should have reduced the number of
wealthy widows at the top. Splitting wealth between spouses using gifts before death was not a
better tax strategy as it would have triggered substantial gift taxes (following the introduction
of the gift tax in 1932) before the marital deduction (for estates and gifts) was introduced in
1948. The main reason why the number of women in the top groups increases so much during
the Great Depression seems to be due to differences in wealth composition between genders. In
the late 1920s, wealthy women held a smaller fraction of their wealth in the form of stock than
wealthy men. As a result, wealthy men lost a larger fraction of their wealth following the stock
market crash of 1929 than wealthy women, thereby contributing to the increase in the fraction
of women at the top.
Second, even tax law induced changes in spousal bequests have a real impact on the distribution of wealth across gender lines, and thus should not necessarily be regarded as unimportant.
The marital status of top wealth holders has experienced relatively modest secular changes.
For males, the fraction of married men has always been high (around 75%), the fraction widowed
has declined slightly (from 10 to 5%) and the fraction single has increased (from 10 to 15%).
For females, the fraction widowed is much higher, although it has declined over the period from
about 40% to 30%. The fraction married has increased from about 40% to 50% for females and
thus the fraction single has been stable around 10%. This reinforces our previous interpretation
that the increase in the fraction female at the top of the wealth distribution has not been due
solely to an increase in the number of wealthy widows following increased spousal bequests,
25
26

See Kopczuk and Slemrod (2003) for a detailed discussion of this point.
The top estate rate increased from 20 to 45 percent in 1932, and then to 60% in 1935, to 70% in 1936, and

to 77% in 1941.

but might reflect increases in female empowerment in the family (fairer distribution of assets
between spouses) and in the labor market (reduction of the income gender gap overtime).

Understanding the Patterns

4.1

Are the Results Consistent with Income Inequality Series?

One of the most striking and debated findings of the literature on inequality has been the sharp
increase in income and wage inequality over the last 25 years in the United States (see Katz and
Autor, 1999, for a recent survey). As evidenced from income tax returns, changes have been
especially dramatic at the top end, with large gains accruing to the top income groups (Feenberg
and Poterba, 1993, 2000; Piketty and Saez, 2003). For example, Piketty and Saez (2003) show
that the top 1% income share doubled from 8% in the 1970s to over 16% in 2000.27 How can
we reconcile the dramatic surge in top income shares with the relative stability of top wealth
shares estimated from estate tax data since the 1980s?
Figure 9 casts light on this issue. It displays the top .01% income share from Piketty and
Saez (2003), along with the composition of these top incomes28 into capital income (dividends,
rents, interest income, but excluding capital gains), realized capital gains, business income, and
wages and salaries. Up to the 1980s (and except during World War II), capital income and
capital gains formed the vast majority of the top .01% incomes. Consistently with our top .01%
wealth share series presented on Figure 5B, the top .01% income share was very high in the late
1920s, and dropped precipitously during the Great Depression and World War II, and remained
low until the late 1970s. Thus both the income and the estate tax data suggests the top wealth
holders were hit by the shocks of the Great Depression and World War II and that those shocks
persisted a long time after the war.
Over the last two decades, as can be seen on Figure 9, the top .01% income share has indeed
increased dramatically from 0.9% in 1980 to 3.6% in 2000. However, the important point to
note is that this recent surge is primarily a wage income phenomenon and to a lesser extent
27
28

See the series of Piketty and Saez (2003) updated to year 2000.
This group represents the top 13,400 taxpayers in 2000, ranked by income excluding realized capital gains

although capital gains are added back to compute income shares.

15

a business income phenomenon.29 Figure 9 shows that capital income earned by the top .01%
relative to total personal income is not higher in 2000 than it was in the 1970s (around 0.4%).
Adding realized capital gains does not alter this broad picture: capital income including capital
gains earned by the top .01% represents about 1% of total personal income in 2000 versus about
0.75% in the late 1960s, a modest increase relative to the quadrupling of the top .01% income
share during the same period.
Therefore, the income tax data suggest that the dramatic increase in top incomes is a labor income phenomenon that has not translated yet into an increased concentration of capital
income. Therefore, in the recent period as well, the income tax data paints a story that is consistent with our estate tax data findings of stability of the top wealth shares since the mid-1980s.
The pattern of capital income including realized capital gains displayed on Figure 9 is strikingly
parallel to the pattern of the top .01% wealth share of Figure 5B: a mild peak in the late 1960s,
a decline during the bear stock market of the 1970s, a recovery in the early 1980s, and no growth
from 1990 to 2000.
Three elements might explain why the surge in top wages since the 1970s did not lead to
a significant increase in top wealth holdings. First, it takes time to accumulate a large fortune
out of earnings.30 The top .01% average income in the late 1990s is around 10 million dollars
while the top .01% wealth holding is around 60 million dollars. Thus, even with substantial
saving rates, it would take at least a decade to the average top .01% income earner starting
with no fortune to become an average top .01% wealth holder. Second, it is possible that the
savings rates of the recent “working rich” who now form the majority of top income earners,
are substantially lower than the savings rates of the “coupon-clippers” of the early part of the
century. Finally, certain groups of individuals report high incomes on their tax return only
temporarily (e.g., executives who exercise stock-options irregularly, careers of sport or showbusiness stars usually last for just a few years). To the extent that such cases became more
29

Gains from exercised stock options are reported as wage income on income tax returns. There is no doubt

that the recent explosion in the use of stock options to compensate executives has contributed to the surge in top
wage incomes in the United States.
30
Even in recent years after the explosion of executive compensation, few of the richest Americans listed on
the annual Forbes 400 survey are salaried executives. Most of them are still either family heirs or successful
entrepreneurs (see Section 5.3.3 below).

16

prevalent in recent years (as seems possible based on popular accounts), the sharp increase in
the concentration of annual incomes documented by Piketty and Saez (2003) may translate into
a smaller increase in the concentration of lifetime incomes and accumulated wealth.
The very rough comparison between income and estate data that we have presented suggests
that it would be interesting to try and estimate wealth concentration from income tax return data
using the capitalization of income method. In spite of the existence of extremely detailed and
consistent income tax return annual data in the United States since 1913, this method has very
rarely been used, and the only existing studies have applied the method for isolated years.31 The
explanation for the lack of systematic studies is that the methodology faces serious challenges:
income data provides information only on assets yielding reported income (for example, owneroccupied real estate or defined contribution pension plans could not be observed), and there is
substantial and unobservable heterogeneity in the returns of many assets, especially corporate
stock (for example, some corporations rarely pay dividends and capital gains are only observed
when realized on income tax returns).32 More recently, Kennickell (2001a,b) has analyzed in
detail the link between income and wealth in order to calibrate sample weights for the Survey
of Consumer Finances. His analysis shows that the relation between capital income reported on
tax returns and wealth from the survey is extremely noisy at the individual level. Nevertheless,
it would certainly be interesting to use income tax return data to provide a tighter comparison
with our wealth concentration results from estates. We leave this important and ambitious
project for future research.

4.2

Possible Explanations for the Decline in Top Wealth Shares

We have described in the previous section the dramatic fall in the top wealth shares (concentrated
within the very top groups) that has taken place from the onset of the Great Depression to the
late 1940s. Our previous analysis has shown that stock market effects might explain the sharp
drop in top wealth shares during the 1930s but cannot explain the absence of recovery in top
31

King (1927) and Stewart (1939) used this method for years 1921 and 1922-1936 respectively. More recently,

Greenwood (1983) has constructed wealth distributions for 1973 using simultaneously income tax return data and
other sources.

multiplier methods for the United Kingdom.

wealth shares in the 1950s and 1960s once stock prices recovered by the end of the 1960s. At
that time, the wealth composition in top groups was again very similar to what it had been in
the late 1920s, and yet top wealth shares hardly recovered in the 1950s and 1960s and were still
much lower in the 1960s than before the Great Depression. There are several possible elements
that might explain the absence of recovery of top wealth shares.
The first and perhaps most obvious factor is the creation and the development of the progressive income and estate tax. The very large fortunes (such as the top .01%) observed at
the beginning of the 20th century were accumulated during the 19th century, at a time where
progressive taxes hardly existed and capitalists could dispose of almost 100% of their income
to consume, accumulate, and transmit wealth across generations. The conditions faced by 20th
century fortunes after the shock of the Great Depression were substantially different. Starting in
1933 with the new Roosevelt administration, and continuously until the Reagan administrations
of 1980s, top tax rates on both income and estates have been set at very high levels.
These very high marginal rates applied only to a very small fraction of taxpayers and estates,
but the point is that they were to a large extent designed to hit incomes and estates of the top
0.1% and 0.01% of the distribution. In the presence of progressive capital income taxation,
individuals with large wealth levels need to increase their savings rates out of after tax income
much more than lower wealth holders to maintain their relative wealth position. Moreover,
reduced after-tax rate of return might have affected savings rates of high wealth holders through
standard incentive effects. In the presence of high income and estate taxes, wealthy individuals
also have incentives to give more to charities during their lifetime further reducing top wealth
shares.33
Second, starting with Sherman and Clayton Acts enacted in 1890 and 1914 respectively,
the U.S. federal government has taken important steps to limit monopoly power using antitrust
regulation. However, the degree of enforcement remained weak until the New Deal (see e.g.,
Thorelli, 1955). By curbing the power of monopolies, it is conceivable that such legislation
contributed to reduced wealth concentration at the very top. Perhaps more importantly, the
Roosevelt administration also introduced legislation to sever the link between finance and man33

Lampman (1962) also favored progressive taxation as one important factor explaining the reduction in top

wealth shares in his seminal study (see below).

18

agement of corporations. The Depression’s financial market reforms act broke the links between
board membership, investment banking, and commercial banking. As a result, the model of
great financiers-industrialists which had created the very large fortunes of the Robber Barons
of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was no longer a possibility after the 1930s.
DeLong (2002) discusses those aspects in more detail and suggests that such regulations severely
prevented the creation of new billionaires during the very prosperous post-World War II decades.
Finally, the post World War II decades were characterized by a large democratization of
higher education. Following the G.I. bill, the number of college educated men increased very
quickly after World War II.34 This undoubtedly contributed to the emergence of a large middle
and upper middle income class in America which was able to accumulate wealth and hence
perhaps reduce the share of total wealth accruing to the groups in the top percentile.35
Although we cannot observe the counterfactual world without progressive taxation or antitrust regulations, we note that economic growth, in net worth and incomes, has been much
stronger starting with World War II, than in the earlier period. Thus, the macro-economic
evidence does not suggest that progressive taxation prevented the American capital stock from
recovering from the shock of the Great Depression. This is consistent with Piketty (2003), who
shows that, in the purest neo-classical model without any uncertainty, a capital income tax
affecting only the rich does not affect negatively the capital stock in the long-run. If credit
constraints due to asymmetric information are present in the business sector of the economy,
it is even conceivable that redistribution of wealth from large and passive wealth holders to
entrepreneurs with little capital can actually improve economic performance (see e.g., Aghion
and Bolton, 2003, for such a theoretical analysis). Gordon (1998) argues that high personal
income tax rates can result in a tax advantage to entrepreneurial activity, thereby leading to
economic growth. A more thorough investigation of the effects of income and estate taxation
on the concentration of wealth is left for future work.
34

The number of Bachelor’s degrees awarded relative to the size of the 23 year old cohort tripled from about

5% in the 1920s to over 15% after World War II (see U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975), series H 755).
35
For example, home ownership increased from 41% in 1920 to 62% in 1960 (see U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1975, series N 243).

Are Estimates from Estates Reliable?

In this section, we explore the issue of the reliability of our estimates. Our top wealth share
estimates depend crucially on the validity of the estate multiplier method that we use. Thus we
first discuss the potential sources of bias and how they can affect the results we have described.
Second, we compare our results with previous findings using estate data as well as other data
sources such as the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), and the Forbes 400 Wealthiest Americans. We focus on whether biases introduced by the estate multiplier methodology can affect
our two central results: the dramatic drop in top shares since 1929 and the absence of increase
in top shares since the mid-1980s.

5.1

Potential Sources of Bias

The most obvious source of bias would be estate tax evasion. Three studies of evasion, Harris
(1949), McCubbin (1994), and Eller et al. (2001), have used results from Internal Revenue
Service audits of estate tax returns for years 1940-41, 1982, and 1992 (respectively). Harris
(1949) reports under-reporting of net worth of about 10% on average with no definite variation
by size of estate, while McCubbin (1994) and Eller et al. (2001) report smaller evasion of about
2-4% for audited returns.36 Those numbers are small relative to the size of the changes we have
presented. Thus, it sounds unlikely that direct tax evasion can have any substantial effects on
the trends we have documented and can certainly not explain the dramatic drop in top wealth
shares. It seems also quite unlikely that evasion could have hidden a substantial growth in
top wealth shares in the recent period. From 1982 to 2000 in particular, the estate tax law
has changed very little and hence the extent of under-reporting should have remained stable
over time as well. A closely related problem is undervaluation of assets reported on estate tax
returns. We describe the issue of undervaluation in detail in appendix C, and we conclude that
those adjustments appear to be too small to produce a significant effect on estimated top wealth
shares.
As we have discussed briefly in Section 2, the estate multiplier method requires precise
assumptions in order to generate unbiased estimates of the wealth distribution for the living.
36

Those studies underestimate estate tax evasion to the extent that audits fail to uncover all the evaded wealth.

20

We use the same multiplier within age, gender, and year cells for all estate tax filers, independent
of wealth. We apply the same social differential mortality rates for all years based on the Brown
et al. (2002) differential between college educated whites relative to the average population. This
is not fully satisfactory for two reasons. First, wealthy individuals (those who file estate tax
returns upon death) may not have exactly the same mortality rate as college educated whites
from Brown et al. (2002). The bias introduced, however, may be small, because the social
mortality gradient is steeper at the lower end of the wealth distribution than at the high end.
Second, we use the same social differential rates for the full 1916-2000 period although those
rates might have changed over time. In appendix B we analyze in detail life insurance and
annuities data compiled by the Society of Actuaries. Perhaps surprisingly, the data does not
point to a significant narrowing over time between mortality rates of the general population and
life insurance policy holders. Therefore, our assumption of constant social mortality differential
rates might be acceptable.
Assuming that our multipliers are right on average, the key additional assumption required
to obtain unbiased wealth shares is that, within age and gender cells and for estate tax filers,
mortality is not correlated with wealth. A negative correlation would generate a downward bias
in top wealth shares as our multiplier would be too low for the richest decedents. For example, if
those with very large estates are less likely to die than those with moderately large estates, then
the estate multiplier will underestimate the very wealthy relative to the moderately wealthy.
There are two direct reasons why such a negative correlation might arise. First, extraordinary
expenses such as medical expenses and loss of labor income or of the ability to manage assets
efficiently may occur and reduce wealth in the years preceding death, producing a negative
correlation between death probability and wealth. Smith (1999) argues that out-of-pocket health
expenses are moderate and therefore are not a major factor driving the correlation of wealth
and mortality. However, his evidence is based on expenditures for the general population and it
is the end-of-life health expenditures that are most significant. It seems unlikely, though, that
health-related expenses create a significant dent in the fortunes of the super-rich but we were
unable to assess the importance of lost earnings due to health deterioration at the end of life.37
37

For some years, our data set contains information about the length of terminal illness. A simple regression of

net worth on the dummy variable indicating a prolonged illness and demographic controls produced a significant

21

Second, even within the small group of estate tax filers, the top 1 or 2% wealth holders, it
might be the case that the most able and successful individuals, of a given age and gender, have
lower mortality rates. Although we cannot measure with any precision the quantitative bias
introduced by those effects, there is no reason to believe that such biases could have changed
dramatically over the period we study. In particular, they cannot have evolved so quickly in the
recent period so as to mask a significant increase in top wealth shares and, for the same reason,
they are unlikely to explain the sharp decrease in top wealth shares following the onset of the
Great Depression.
More importantly, however, for estate tax avoidance and other reasons, individuals may
start to give away their wealth to relatives and heirs as they feel that their health deteriorates.
Indeed, all estate tax planners recommend giving away wealth before death as the best strategy
to reduce transfer tax liability. Gifts, however, create a downward bias only to the extent that
they are made by individuals with higher mortality probability within their age and gender
cell. If gifts are unrelated to mortality within age and gender cells, then they certainly affect
the wealth distribution of the living but the estate multiplier will take into account this effect
without bias. Three important reasons suggest that gifts may not bias our results. First and
since the beginning of the estate tax, gifts made in contemplation of death (within 2-3 years of
death, see appendix C for details) must be included in gross estate and thus are not considered
as having been given in our wealth estimates. We expect that a large fraction of gifts correlated
with mortality falls into this category. Second, a well known advice of estate tax planners is
to start giving as early as possible. Thus, those most interested in tax avoidance will start
giving much before contemplation of death; in that case gifts and mortality have no reason to be
correlated.38 Last, since 1976, the estate and gift tax have been unified and the published IRS
tabulations show that taxable gifts (all gifts above the annual exemption of $10,000 per donee)
represents only about 2-3% of gross estate, even at the top. Thus, lifetime gifts do not seem to
be large enough to produce a significant bias in our estimates for the recent period.
A more subtle possibility of bias comes from a related tax avoidance practice which consists
in giving assets to heirs without relinquishing control of those assets. This is mostly realized
negative coefficient, suggesting that this effect may play a role.
38
Gifts will have a real impact on the individual distribution of wealth although it might not change the dynastic
distribution of resources.

22

through trusts whose remainder is given to the heir but whose income stream is in full control
of the creator while he is alive. Like an annuity, the value of such a trust for the creator
disappears at death and thus does not appear on estate tax returns. This type of device falls in
between the category of tax avoidance through gifts and under-valuation of the assets effectively
transferred. The popular literature (see e.g., Cooper, 1979 or Zabel, 1995) has suggested that
many such devices can be used to effectively avoid the estate tax but careful interviews of
practitioners (Schmalbeck, 2001) suggest that this is a clear exaggeration and that reducing
significantly the estate tax payments requires actually giving away (either to charities or heirs)
a substantial fraction of wealth. Again, such a source of reduction in wealth holdings reflects a
real de-concentration of individual wealth (though not necessarily welfare).
The key question we need to address is whether the wealthy derive substantial annuity income
from trusts which the estate multiplier method fails to capture because it disappears at death.
There are two indirect sources of data to cast light on the importance of trusts. First, trusts
are required to file income tax returns and pay annual income taxes on the income generated
by the assets in the trust which is not distributed to beneficiaries.39 Second, income from
trusts distributed to individuals has to be reported on those individuals’ income tax returns.
Therefore, statistics on individual and trust income tax returns published regularly by the
IRS (U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, various years) can be used to assess
the total value of income generated and distributed by trusts. The total income distributed by
trusts to individuals can then be capitalized to get an approximation of total individual wealth
in the form of trusts. This total wealth should be an upper bound of the annuitized trust wealth
that the estate multiplier method fails to capture. Using a 7.5% nominal rate of return on trust
assets (trust income includes both ordinary income and realized capital gains), total wealth in
trusts is only around 1.4% of our total wealth denominator in 1997, the last year for which
statistics on trust income are available.40 Thus, trust wealth is modest relative to the 21% share
of total wealth going to the top 1% or even relative to the 9% share going to the top 0.1% in
39

Beneficiaries could be individuals or charitable organizations. Trusts face the top individual income tax rate

(above a very low exemption level) on undistributed income in order to prevent (untaxed) accumulation of wealth
within trusts.
40
In 1997, trusts distributed $26.3 billion to beneficiaries (see Mikow (2000-01)), representing a total annuitized
wealth of $350 billion, or 1.4% of the $2.5 trillion total personal wealth in 1997.

23

1997.41
Therefore, the popular view that the wealthy hold most of their wealth through trusts which
escape estate taxation appears inconsistent with tax statistics. More importantly, estimated
trust wealth has declined overtime from around 3.5% of total wealth in the 1936, to around 2%
in 1965, to about 1.5% in 1997. Hence, including annuitized trust wealth to our estimates would
not modify much our results and would likely reinforce our main finding of a secular decline of
top wealth shares over the century.

5.2

Changes in Bias Over Time

It is important to emphasize that real responses to estate taxation, such as potential reductions
in entrepreneurship incentives, savings, or increases in gifts to charities or relatives, do not bias
our estimates in general because they do have real effects on the distribution of wealth. Only
outright evasion or avoidance of the type we described in the previous section can bias our
results; and those effects need to evolve over time in order to counteract the trends we have
described. We would expect that changes in the levels of estate taxation would be the main
element affecting avoidance or evasion incentives over time.
It is therefore important to consider the main changes in the level of estate taxation over the
period (see Appendix C and Luckey, 1995, for further details). Since the beginning of the U.S.
federal estate tax, the rate schedule was progressive and subject to an initial exemption. The
1916 marginal estate tax rates ranged from 0 to 10%. The top rate increased to 40% by 1924,
a change that was repealed by the 1926 Act that reduced top rates to 20%. Starting in 1932, a
sequence of tax schedule changes increased the top rates to 77% by 1942, subject to a $60,000
nominal exemption. The marginal tax rate schedule remained unchanged until 1976, resulting in
a fairly continuous increase of the estate tax burden due to “bracket creep”. Following the 1976
tax reform, the exemption was increased every year. The top marginal tax rates were reduced
to 70% in 1977 and 55% by 1984. There were no major changes until 2001 (the nominal filing
41

Income tax statistics show that about 75% of total trust income goes to top 1% income earners and about

40% goes to the top 0.1% income earners. Thus, it seems reasonable to think that about 40% of trust wealth, or
about 0.6% of total individual wealth, is held by the top 0.1%, a small amount relative to the 9% share of wealth
held by that group in 1997.

threshold stayed constant at $600,000 between 1988 and 1997). Figure 10 reports the average
marginal tax rate in the top 0.1% group42 and the statutory marginal tax rate applying to the
largest estates43 (left y-axis), along with the top 0.1% wealth share (right y-axis). It is evident
from this picture that the burden of estate taxation increased significantly over time. Somewhat
surprisingly, the most significant increases in the marginal estate tax burden were brought about
by holding brackets constant in nominal terms rather than by tax schedule changes.
There are very few attempts to measure the response of wealth to estate taxation.44 Kopczuk
and Slemrod (2001) used the same micro-data that we do to estimate the impact of the marginal
estate tax rates on reported estates. They relied on both time-series variation and cross-sectional
age variation that corresponds to having lived through different estate tax regimes. They found
some evidence of an effect, with estate tax rates at age of 45 or 10 years before death more
strongly correlated with estates than the actual realized marginal tax rates. Because the source
of their data are tax returns, they were unable to distinguish between tax avoidance and the real
response. Holtz-Eakin and Marples (2001) relied on the cross-sectional variation in state estate
and inheritance taxes to estimate the effect on wealth of the living. They found that estate
taxation has a significant effect on wealth accumulation. It should be pointed out though that
their data contained very few wealthy individuals. Taken at face value, both of these studies
find very similar magnitudes of response (see the discussion in Holtz-Eakin and Marples, 2001)
suggesting little role for outright tax evasion: the Holtz-Eakin and Marples (2001) data is not
skewed by tax evasion and avoidance while the effect estimated by Kopczuk and Slemrod (2001)
reflects such potential responses. This would imply that trends in concentration due to tax
evasion and avoidance are not a major issue.
Regardless of these findings, given that between 1982 and 2000 the estate tax system has
changed very little, we would expect that the extent of tax avoidance and evasion has also
42

These tax rates are computed by first evaluating the marginal tax rates at the mean net worth in Top .01%,

.05-.01% and .1-.05% and then weighting the results by net worth in each category. These are “first-dollar”
marginal tax rates that do not take into account deductions but just the initial exemption.
43
After 1987, there is an interval of a 5% surtax intended to phase out the initial exemption in which the
marginal tax rate (60%) exceeds the marginal tax rate at the top (55%).
44
There is a larger literature that concentrates on gifts. See for example, McGarry (1999); Bernheim et al.
(2001); Poterba (2001); Joulfaian (2003).

25

remained fairly stable. Therefore, the absence of increase in top shares since in the 1990s is
probably not due to a sudden increase in estate tax evasion or avoidance.45

5.3

Comparison with Previous Studies and Other Sources

Another important way to check the validity of our estimates from estates is to compare them
to findings from other sources. We have presented a brief comparison above with findings from
income tax returns. After reviewing previous estate tax studies, we turn to comparisons with
wealth concentration estimations using other data sources.
5.3.1

Previous Estate Studies

Lampman (1962) was the first to use in a comprehensive way the U.S. estate tax statistics published by the IRS to construct top wealth shares. He reported the top 1% wealth shares for the
adult population for a number of years between 1922 and 1956.46 His estimates are reproduced
on Figure 11, along with our series for the top 1%.47 Although the method, adjustments, and
total net worth denominators are different (see appendix E ), his estimates are generally similar
to ours and in particular display the same downward trend after 1929.
Smith (1984) used estate tax data to produce additional estimates for the top 0.5% and top
1% wealth shares for some years in the 1958-1976 period. In contrast to Lampman (1962) and
our series, the top 1% is defined relative to the full population (not only adults) and individuals
are ranked by gross worth (instead of net worth).48 We reproduce his top 1% wealth share,
which looks broadly similar to our estimates and displays a downward trend which accelerates
in the 1970s. No study has used post 1976 estate data to compute top wealth shares series for
the recent period. A number of studies by the Statistics of Income Division of the IRS have
estimated wealth distributions from estate tax data for various years but those studies only
45

Of course, technological advances in estate tax avoidance remains a possibility, especially given that many

changes relating to valuation issues are driven by judicial rather than legislative activity. It is striking to note,
however, that the many books on estate tax avoidance published over time seem to always propose the same type
of methods (see again Cooper, 1979 and Zabel, 1995).
46
Lampman (1962) does not analyze smaller groups within the top 1% adults.
47
Those statistics are also reported in Table C1.
48
See Smith and Franklin (1974) for an attempt to patch the Lampman series with estimates for 1958, 1962,
1965, and 1969.

produce distributions, and composition by brackets and do not try in general to estimate top
shares.49 An exception is Johnson and Schreiber (2002-03) who present graphically the top 1%
and .5% wealth share for 1989, 1992, 1995, and 1998. Their estimates are very close to ours,
and display very little variation over the period.
5.3.2

Survey of Consumer Finances

The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is the only other data that can be used to estimate
adequately top wealth shares in the United States, because it oversamples the wealthy and asks
detailed questions about wealth ownership. However, the survey covers only years 1962, 1983,
1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001 and cannot be used to reliably compute top shares for groups
smaller than the top 0.5% because of small sample size.50 It should also be noted that all the
information in the SCF is at the family level and not the individual level. Top shares estimated
at the individual level might be different from top shares estimated at the family level, and the
difference depends on how wealth is distributed among spouses within families. Atkinson (2003)
discusses this issue formally. He shows that for realistic parameters (on the Pareto distribution
and the number of married individuals relative to singles), for a given top share estimated at
the family level, the corresponding top share at the individual level will be about 20% higher if
all the rich are unmarried or have spouses with no wealth and will be about 20% lower if all the
rich are couples with wealth equally split between spouses. Thus, changes of wealth distribution
within families, which leave unchanged family based wealth shares, can have relatively large
effects on individually based wealth shares. However, the magnitude is not large enough to
explain the dramatic decline of the very top shares over the century solely by equalization of
wealth between spouses within families.51
49

See Schwartz (1994) for year 1982, Schwartz and Johnson (1994) for year 1986 and Johnson and Schwartz

(1994) for year 1989, Johnson (1997-98) for years 1992 and 1995, and Johnson and Schreiber (2002-03) for year
1998.
50
The 1962 survey is called the Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers and is the predecessor of the
modern Surveys of Consumer Finances.
51
The negative correlation, however, between the pattern of the top 1% wealth share on Figure 2 and the
fraction female in the top .5% on Figure 8 suggests that equalization of wealth between spouses might have
played a role in reducing individually based wealth concentration.

27

Kennickell (2003) provides detailed shares and composition results for the 1989-2001 period,
and Scholz (2003) provides top share estimates for all the years available from the SCF. Kennickell and Scholz results are very close. We reproduce the top 1% wealth share from Scholz
(2003) on Figure 11. The SCF produces estimates of top wealth shares larger than estimates
from estates: the top 1% share from estates is between 20 and 25% while to the top 1% share
from the SCF is slightly above 30%. We discuss below the reasons that have been put forward
to explain this difference by various studies. However, the important point to note is that,
as our estate estimates, the SCF does not display a significant increase in top wealth shares
between 1962 and 2001. There is an increase from 1992 to 1995, but this increase has in large
part disappeared by 2001. As a result, the top 1% shares from the SCF in 1983 and 2001 are
almost identical.52 In particular, it is striking to note that the top 1% share did not increase
at all during the bull stock market in the second half of the 1990s. Therefore, two independent
sources, the estate tax returns and the SCF, arguably the best data sources available to study
wealth concentration in the United States, suggest that wealth concentration has not increased
significantly since the mid-1980s, in spite of the surge in stock market prices.
A few studies have compared the estate tax data with the SCF data in order to check the
validity of each dataset and potentially estimate the extent of tax avoidance. Scheuren and
McCubbin (1994) and Johnson and Woodburn (1994) present such a comparison for years 1983
and 1989 respectively. They find a substantial gap in top shares estimates based on the two
datasets, of similar magnitude than the one between our estimates and Scholz (2003) estimates.53
As discussed above, an important source of discrepancy comes from the fact that the SCF is
based on families while estate estimates are individually based. Johnson and Woodburn (1994)
tries to correct for this and finds a reduced gap, although, in absence of good information on
the distribution of wealth within rich families, the correction method might be very sensitive to
assumptions (see below).
Scheuren and McCubbin (1994) describes other potential sources creating biases. In addition
to the tax avoidance and under-valuation issues that we describe above, they show that SCF
52

Kennickell (2003) reports standard errors of around 1.5 percentage points around the top 1% share estimates.

Thus, the small movements in the SCF top 1% share might be due in large part to sampling variation.
53
The statistics they report do not allow a precise comparison of the gap in the top 1% wealth share.

28

wealth might be higher than estate wealth because the value of closely held businesses might
drop substantially when the owner-manager dies. Thus, the SCF wealth measure of businesses
incorporates human wealth that is by definition excluded from estates. Therefore, the SCF and
estates may not measure the same wealth concept even though both measures are interesting.
The estate represents wealth that can be transferred while the SCF includes in part human
wealth that is destroyed at death.
The composition data reported in Kennickell (2003) do not report total stock ownership
separately. However, we can add together the categories of publicly traded stock directly held,
mutual and other investment funds, and cashable pension funds. In 2001, both the top 1%
wealthiest families and the average family held about 35% of their wealth in that form. This
suggests, consistently with our composition results, that the development of retirement pension
funds and mutual funds has contributed to the equalization of publicly held stock ownership
in the United States. We note, however, that the SCF data for 2001 show that the top 1%
hold a much larger fraction than the average (34% versus 19%) in the form of business assets
(which include sole proprietorships, partnerships, as well as closely held corporations). Further
systematic comparisons, asset by asset narrowly defined, of the SCF and estate tax returns
would be very useful to understand better the quantitative importance of each of the sources of
discrepancy we have mentioned.
More recently, Wolff (1996) uses the SCF 1992 data to estimate how much estate tax would
be collected by applying average mortality rates to the SCF population. He finds that expected
collections estimated from the SCF should be about 4 times larger than actual estate tax collections for those who died in 1992, suggesting massive tax evasion and avoidance. Poterba (2000),
however, repeats Wolff study for 1995 and finds that estate taxes estimated from the SCF are
just 10% higher than what was actually collected. Eller et al. (2001) tries to reconcile this
discrepancy and shows that the results are quite sensitive to assumptions made about mortality
rates, as well as marital and charitable bequests, but find a range of estimates much closer to
Poterba than to Wolff. Our top wealth share estimates are about 25% lower than the SCF top
wealth shares, suggesting that there might be some under-reporting of estates, but that the
difference is actually much closer to the small gap found by Poterba (2000) than the very large
gap found by Wolff (1996).

29

Finally, Wolff (1994) has produced series of top 1% wealth shares by pasting together the
earlier estate series by Lampman (1962) and Smith (1984) and the modern SCF estimates.54
These series represent the top 1% households (not individuals) and are reproduced on Figure
11. A close examination reveals that patching together data from difference sources is a perilous exercise. The Wolff series suggest that there has been a tremendous decline in wealth
concentration in the 1960s and 1970s from 34% to 20%, followed by an equally large surge in
concentration to above 35% in 1989. Our series based on an homogeneous estate tax data show
that the evolution of concentration has actually been much less dramatic during that period. As
can be seen from Figure 11, Wolff-Marley’s estimate for 1976 is based on estate tax data while
the 1962 and 1983 estimates are based on the SCF. Thus, the failure to account for the large
gap between the SCF and estate estimates that exists in any given year generates a dramatic
distortion in the time pattern of the Wolff-Marley series.
5.3.3

Forbes 400 Richest Americans

The popular view is that the personal computer revolution of the 1980s, and the development of
Internet in the 1990s, created many new business opportunities and the extremely quick creation
of new fortunes (the so called dot-comers). From this perspective, our finding of no increase in
wealth concentration during the 1990s seems surprising indeed. To pursue this question further,
we use the Forbes magazine annual survey of the top 400 richest Americans, available since
1982.55 This systematic source has certainly been highly influential in creating the feeling that
the last two decades had been extraordinary favorable to the creation of new fortunes.
The Forbes 400 represent an extremely small fraction of the U.S. adult population, about
the top .0002% in 2000, that is, a group 50 times smaller than our top .01% group. We have
used the Forbes 400 survey to estimate the top .0002% (corresponding almost exactly to the
top 400 individuals in 2000) wealth share. This share is displayed on Figure 12.56 It shows
that the fraction of wealth controlled by the top fortunes tripled from just above 1% in the
54

These series are a revised and extended version of the earlier Wolff-Marley series constructed in the same way

and presented in Wolff and Marley (1989).
55
Kennickell (2003) also examines the Forbes 400 data for the years corresponding to the SCF surveys between
1989 and 2001.
56
Those statistics are also reported in Table C2.

30

early 1980s to above 3.5% at the peak in 2000. From 2000 to 2002, the share came down to
just below 3% in 2002. Thus the Forbes data is indeed consistent with the popular view that
the richest individuals in the United States control a sizeable share of total wealth and, more
importantly, that this share has increased significantly over the last two decades. The top .01%
share we estimated was around 4% since the mid-1980s. This is compatible with a top .0002%
share slightly above 1% as in the early 1980s but not with a top .0002% share equal to 3.5% as
in the peak of 2000.57 Therefore, it appears that our top wealth share series from estates have
failed to capture the increase due to the surge in the Forbes 400 top fortunes.58
For the early 1980s, McCubbin (1994) analyzed estate tax returns of Forbes 400 decedents
and found that wealth reported on estate tax returns was on average 35% lower than on the
Forbes list. The discrepancy was attributed mostly to the fact that the estate tax returns
include only the assets and property owned by the individual decedent while the Forbes survey
also includes wealth distributed to the spouse, and the full value of trusts set-up to distribute
wealth to family relatives but whose creator retains control. It would be extremely useful to
repeat this study for the full period 1982-2002 in order to understand the reasons for the growing
discrepancy that has taken place since the mid-1980s between top estates and the Forbes 400.59
It is interesting to divide further the group of the Forbes 400 into the top 100 and the
next 300 richest (for year 2000). Those top groups correspond to the top .00005% and top
.0002-.00005% using our usual notation. The share of wealth accruing to those two groups is
reported on Figure 12. It displays a striking contrast: the share of wealth of the top 100 have
been multiplied by a factor 4.3 from 1983 to 2000 while the share of wealth of the next 300
richest individuals has only been multiplied by a factor 2.1 during the same period.60 It is also
57

More precisely, if wealth is Pareto distributed with parameter a, then the ratio of the top .01% wealth share

to the top .0002% wealth share is (.01/.0002)1−1/a = 3.7 for a = 1.5, which is about the Pareto parameter that
can be obtained for the wealth distribution in 2000 from Table 1.
58
If just a few billionaires are responsible for the surge, it is possible that they were simply not sampled (by
death). Given that these types of fortunes accrued to relatively young individuals and that death probability
(adjusted by the socioeconomic status) does not even reach 1% by the age of 60, it seems possible that a few-year
long surge of wealth of a few individuals can remain unnoticed.
59
It should also be noted that the Forbes 400 estimates are often educated guesses with potentially large errors.
The Forbes 400 survey might also miss some wealthy individuals. The SCF survey does include a few individuals
missed by Forbes with wealth above the Forbes 400 lower bound.
60
The threshold corresponding to the bottom of the top 400 has actually increased “only” by 75% from 1983

31

important to note that the share of the two groups is closely parallel during the 1980s, a decade
of relatively modest growth for the Forbes shares, and that the bulk of the divergence between
the two Forbes groups, is concentrated in just 3 years, 1996 to 1999, which are the years of the
fastest growth of the stock market (see Figure 1). It would be interesting to use the Forbes
data to analyze to what extent the new technology stock market “bubble” can account for this
phenomenon. In sum, three quarters of all the gains to the Forbes 400 from 1983 to 2000 have
actually accrued to the top quarter of the list, and most of those gains happened in the second
half of the 1990s. Therefore, taken at face value, the Forbes data, combined with the absence
of a significant increase in top wealth shares in the estate tax data and the SCF, suggest that
among the top fractiles of the wealth distribution, only the very top (perhaps a group limited
to just the hundred richest individuals in the country) has experienced sizeable gains since the
mid-1980s, while the other groups of high wealth holders actually did not experience much gains
relative to the average wealth holder in the U.S. population.
The number of fortunes created by the development and expansion of new technology sector
is certainly more than a few hundred. This fact can be consistent with our findings only if,
at the same time those new fortunes were created, fortunes of similar magnitude were being
destroyed. Analyzing in more detail the rise and fall of the new technology companies over the
last two decades could be an interesting way to cast light on this issue, and understand why the
results from estate tax returns or the SCF seem so much at odds with the popular perception
of the 1990s decade and the Forbes 400 data.
Our top wealth shares series from estates show a sharp drop in very top wealth shares from
1916 to 2000; although the Forbes data suggest that our estimates have missed the surge in
wealth of the very wealthiest richest Americans. How do the very richest Americans of today
compare with the richest individuals from the beginning of the twentieth century? Forbes
proposed a list in 1918 of the top 30 richest Americans. The richest person at the time was
John Rockefeller, who held an estimated fortune of $1.2 billion (current dollars), and thus held
0.54% of total net worth. How does this compare with the wealth of the richest Americans
in 2000, the very peak of the stock-market? As population has grown by a factor 3.33 from
1918 to 2000, to provide a meaningful comparison, we need to add the fortunes of Bill Gates,
to 2000.

32

Lawrence Ellison, Paul Allen, and one third of Warren Buffet, the four richest Americans in
2000. They total $166.33 billion, which is 0.52% of total net worth, almost exactly the same as
John Rockefeller in 1918. Thus, even the peak of the stock market bubble did not produce top
fortunes larger relative to the average than the one accumulated by John Rockefeller by 1918,
and our top shares results suggest that there were many more wealthy individuals below him
than today below Bill Gates.

Conclusion

This paper has presented new homogeneous series on top wealth shares from 1916 to 2000 using
estate tax return data. Although many studies have analyzed wealth inequality in the United
States, none had presented consistent concentration estimates over such a long period on an
almost annual basis. We have found that the shocks of the Great Depression, the New Deal,
and World War II, have produced a dramatic decrease in the top wealth shares. This decrease
has been concentrated within the upper part of the top percentile, the top .1% of the wealth
distribution, with much more modest changes for lower wealth groups within the top 1%. This
evidence is consistent with the dramatic decline in top capital incomes documented in Piketty
and Saez (2003). The large shocks that large wealth holders experienced in the first part of the
century seem to have had a permanent effect: top wealth shares increased very modestly during
the stock market booms of the 1960s and 1990s, and are much lower today than in the preGreat Depression era. We have tentatively suggested that steep progressive income and estate
taxation, by reducing the rate of wealth accumulation, may have been the most important factor
preventing large fortunes from being reconstituted. Many other factors such as business and
finance regulations, the emergence of a large middle class in the post World War II period, and
the equalization of wealth across genders might have also contributed to reducing individual
wealth concentration.
Surprisingly, our top wealth shares series do not increase during the 1990s, a time of extraordinary stock price growth and perceived as having been extremely favorable to the creation
of new fortunes. Our results are consistent with findings from the Survey of Consumer Finances (Kennickell, 2003; Scholz, 2003) which also display hardly any significant growth in

33

wealth concentration since 1995. This absence of growth in top wealth shares are also consistent
with the top income shares results from Piketty and Saez (2003) because the recent dramatic
growth in top income shares has been primarily due to a surge in top labor incomes, with little
growth of top capital incomes. Examination of the widely known Forbes 400 richest Americans survey shows a dramatic gain for those wealthy individuals but most of the gains are
concentrated within the top 100 and in the few years of the stock market “bubble” of the late
1990s. Our composition series suggest that by 2000, the top 1% wealth holders do not hold a
significantly larger fraction of their wealth in the form of stocks than the average person in the
U.S. economy, explaining in part why the bull stock market of the late 1990s has not benefited
disproportionately the rich.
To what extent is the U.S. experience representative of other developed countries’ long run
wealth concentration dynamics? Existing wealth concentration series are unfortunately very
scarce and incomplete for most countries, and it is therefore very difficult to provide a fully
satisfactory answer to this question. However, it is interesting to compare the U.S. top wealth
series with comparable series constructed using the estate multiplier technique as well for the
United Kingdom by Atkinson and Harrison (1978) and the Inland Revenue, and for France
by Piketty et al. (2003). There are important similarities between the American, French, and
British pattern of the top 1% wealth share displayed on Figure 13. In all three countries, top
income shares fell considerably during the 1913 to 1950 period, and they were never able to
come back to the very high levels observed in the early decades of the century. By the end of the
century, the top 1% wealth shares are remarkably close around 22% is all three countries. It is
plausible to think that in all three countries, top capital incomes have been hit by the depression
and wars shocks of the first part of the century and could not recover because of the dynamic
effects of progressive taxation on capital.
Some important differences among these countries should be mentioned. First, in the early
decades of the twentieth century, top wealth shares were much higher in France, and especially
the United Kingdom, than in the United States. Just before the Great Depression, the top 1%
share is about 40% in the United States, 50% in France, and 60% in the United Kingdom. Thus,
the dramatic fall of top wealth shares that we described for the United States pales in comparison
to the French and British decline. Unsurprisingly, the decline in France is much steeper during

34

World War II, which destroyed a large fraction of the capital stock in the country. Second, in
contrast to France and the United States where the top 1% wealth share has been relatively
stable since the late 1940s, the top 1% wealth share continues to fall in the United Kingdom
from over 45% in the 1950s to about 20% in the late 1970s.61 Finally, the increase in the top 1%
wealth share in the last decades in the United States and the United Kingdom has been of similar
and modest magnitude (from less than 20% to 22-23%) but the timing has been different.62 All
of the gains occurred in the early 1980s in the United States, while all the gains happened in
the late 1990s in the United Kingdom. A detailed analysis of the U.K. very top shares (such as
the top .1%) and composition would be useful to understand whether this difference is driven
from differences in concentration of stock ownership or in the tax systems in the two countries.
It is striking that, in both the United States and the United Kingdom, top wealth shares
have increased so little in spite of a surge in top income shares. Atkinson (2002) shows that
the top 1% income share increased from less than 5% in the late 1970s to over 10% in 1999 in
the United Kingdom. The increase for the United States has been from less than 8% to about
16% during the same period (Piketty and Saez, 2003). Such a pattern might not last for very
long because our proposed interpretation also suggests that the decline of progressive taxation
observed since the early 1980s in the United States63 and in the United Kingdom could very
well spur a revival of high wealth concentration during the next few decades.
61

Analyzing the evolution of top income and wealth taxation in the three countries more carefully could be

useful to test whether taxation is the main factor driving top wealth shares.
62
The French top wealth share does not seem to have increased at all since the early 1980s.
63
Top income tax rates have gone down dramatically from 70% to 35% since 1981 and the U.S. estate tax is
scheduled to be phased-out by 2011.

Appendix A

The Estate Multiplier Method

The estate multiplier method relies on the assumption that decedents represent a random draw
from the living population. Consequently, denoting the probability of dying by mi , a single
estate observation stands for m1i observations, so that the observed estate of Ei stands for the
wealth of m1i Ei . Our measure of Ei is described in Appendix C and our mortality measures are
presented in Appendix B.
An implementation of the multiplier technique requires that wealth and mortality rates are
appropriately measured. There are problems with both that we will discuss in what follows.
It also requires the assumption of a random draw from the population. There are at least two
reasons why this assumption is non-trivial.
First, individuals may de-cumulate wealth in anticipation of death, thereby making decedents
a non-representative sample from the population. For example, some individuals who died had
experienced a prolonged terminal illness. This is important because of accompanying expenses
and the potential tax planning activities in anticipation of death. The effect may simply be
due to higher out of pocket health expenses of the individuals who died compared to survivors.
Smith (1999) argues that such expenses are moderate and therefore do not have major impact
on wealth. However, his evidence is based on expenditures of the living, while there is some
evidence that it is the end-of-life health expenditures that are most significant. Alternatively,
when dealing with the tax data as we do here, there is also a possibility that observed estates are
skewed by tax avoidance and therefore do not accurately reflect wealth of a typical individual.64
Second, to the extent that a priori mortality risk varies in the population and people have
private information about their own frailty,65 their wealth accumulation patterns might well
be different. Alternatively, under one of the theories explaining the relationship of health and
income or wealth, healthier people may simply be more productive and therefore wealthier. A
correlation of the error between actual and assumed mortality rates with wealth will tend to
bias the results even in the absence of any other measurement issues.
64
This type of tax avoidance may be more prevalent among individuals who died compared to those who
survived, because increased likelihood of death may motivate taxpayers to undertake planning. The importance
of such an effect is mitigated by the fact that some avoidance strategies (such as gift giving) that are performed
in anticipation of death are explicitly disallowed by the tax code. Note also that there is a qualitative difference
between tax avoidance and real behavioral response to taxation in this context. To the extent that taxpayers
truly adjust their behavior in response to taxation, it represents an economically meaningful impact on the wealth
distribution. Tax avoidance that allows to reduce the size of taxable estate without effectively relinquishing
control (see Wojciech Kopczuk and Joel Slemrod (2003) and especially the comment by Ray Madoff (2003) for
a related discussion) will bias our results toward finding lower share of wealth at the top without a real effect.
Such response is likely to vary with changes in the tax rates and therefore the bias might have changed over
time. There is some evidence that the size of estates responds to tax incentives (Kopczuk and Slemrod, 2001;
Holtz-Eakin and Marples, 2001). It is unclear whether the effect, if any, would be due to a real reduction in
wealth or else due to tax avoidance. Some authors suggest that tax avoidance is rampant (Cooper, 1979), others
disagree (Schmalbeck, 2001). Poterba (2001) and McGarry (1999) find that easy avoidance strategies that rely
on gifts are not taken advantage of. On the other hand, Joulfaian (2003) finds using aggregate data that gift
tax revenue is highly sensitive to expected marginal tax rates, while Poterba and Weisbenner (2003) find some
evidence of the quantitative importance of an abusive use of minority discount provisions.
65
Hurd et al. (1999) find that subjective survival probabilities predict mortality even when socio-economic
characteristics and health conditions are controlled for.

Appendix B

Population and Mortality

Mortality differential — its presence and its size One of the key issues in implementing
the estate multiplier technique to estimate wealth shares of the wealthy is the choice of appropriate mortality rates. The ideal mortality tables would apply specifically to the wealthy and
would be broken down by age and demographic characteristics. Our baseline mortality tables
were obtained from the Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org) and rely on the life
tables constructed by the Office of the Actuary of the Social Security Administration (see Bell
et al., 1992, for a full description of the methodology). The mortality tables by age and gender
are available at annual frequency between 1900 and 1995. Between 1996 and 2000, we are using
mortality projections available from the same source. These mortality tables are representative
of the whole population.
It is well-known that health and mortality rates are negatively correlated with higher socioeconomic status measured by education, income (Deaton and Paxson, 1999, show that the
effect is still present when education is controlled for), wealth (Attanasio and Hoynes, 2000) and
wealth ranking (Attanasio and Emmerson, 2001). Deaton (2002, 2003) and Smith (1999) are
recent surveys of the literature on this topic. In their pioneering study, Kitagawa and Hauser
(1973) documented the importance of the socioeconomic differences in mortality rates in the
United States using 1960 Census data, but there is also some evidence of differences by social
classes that goes back much further (see Deaton, 2002, for references). The presence of such
differences is also found in more recent data. The U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Study
was specifically designed to study socioeconomic differentials. The sample consists of 1.3 million
(approximately half of that in the public release data) individuals primarily drawn from the 12
CPS studies between March 1973 and March 1985 and matched with the National Death Index
between 1979 and 1985 to identify deaths (see Rogot et al., 1992, for the details of the design).
Extensive tabulations in Rogot et al. (1992) document substantial mortality differentials by race,
education and income categories. The study has its limitations: income is poorly measured and
the sample does not include institutionalized individuals. Figure A1 is based on the tabulations
in Rogot et al. (1992). It shows the ratio of mortality rates of white individuals with the highest
family incomes to the population average. Income categories are defined in terms of 1980 dollars.
The whites in $25,000 and over group constitute approximately 25% of the population while the
whites in $50,000 and over groups constitute approximately 5%. There is considerable noise in
the estimates for the top income category due to limited number of observations: for example,
the category of 25 to 35 years old women with income above $50,000 includes a bit more than
3000 individuals but just 11 deaths. Nevertheless, the figure illustrates that mortality rates for
the higher income categories are usually significantly below the population ones and that the
gap gets smaller for the elderly.66 Brown et al. (2002) use the NLMS data to estimate the size
of socioeconomic differentials by education and gender. As discussed in what follows, we rely
on their estimates in making adjustments to the mortality rates.
There is a considerable literature devoted to analyzing causal paths from income to health.67
The direction of causality is not directly relevant for our study, although, to the extent that
health affects wealth, it suggests that the bias discussed earlier may be relevant.
66
67

Using AHEAD data, Hurd et al. (1999) also find that the mortality gap falls with age.
See Deaton (2002) for a survey and discussion and Adams et al. (2003) for a recent study.

37

Mortality differential — changes over time The major data problem from our point of
view is that no consistent mortality tables for the wealthy for the whole century are available. It
is certainly possible that the magnitude of the mortality differential between wealthy and the rest
changed over time. Duleep (1989) compared the mortality differentials in the 1970s by income
and education classes based on the Social Security records to the results of Kitagawa and Hauser
(1973) that were based on 1960 Census and found no significant changes. By its design, however,
that study does not directly address the mortality experience of the wealthy (who are above the
Social Security limit). Pappas et al. (1993) replicated the analysis of Kitagawa and Hauser (1973)
using the 1986 National Mortality Follow-back Survey and the 1986 National Health Interview
Survey and concluded that differentials increased between 1960 and 1986. Hattersley (1999)
relies on the UK Longitudinal Study (a panel study) and reports changes in life expectancy
and survival probabilities by social classes (based on the initial occupation) between 1972 and
1996. For both men and women, the results show proportionally bigger increases in the survival
rates for professionals than for unskilled workers (who had lower survival rates to begin with).
Converting her results to mortality rates, they indicate a significant widening of the mortality
differential.68
We can shed some additional light on the mortality differential over time using insurance
data. It is well-known that both annuitants and purchasers of life insurance are wealthier than
the average. The Society of Actuaries made available on its web page (www.soa.org) a collection
of more than 300 mortality tables for different countries and different periods, including some
tables based on the experience of insurance companies. Unfortunately, variation in the definitions
and approaches used in their construction makes them non-comparable and thus makes it difficult
to credibly trace the evolution of the mortality differential over time. Furthermore, to the extent
that penetration of the insurance markets varied over time, this induces an additional source
of compositional changes. We present the numbers from the George B. Buck Consultants Inc.
U.S. mortality tables that are based on the experience of employees of large industrial clients
pension plans and are dated at 1963, 1974 and 1979. Additionally, the Buck table based on
the experience of employees in State Teacher Retirement Systems is available for 1982. In each
case, these mortality tables cover a few preceding years. Figure A2 compares these mortality
rates to population averages in 1960, 1971, 1975 and 1978 — years that fall in the middle of
the experience periods corresponding to the different tables.69 All of these figures include as a
reference the arithmetic average of the differential over the four series. One thing to note here
is that the 1960 mortality differentials are smallest (the ratios are closest to one) and the 1978
values appear to indicate a bigger differential than the earlier years. As mentioned, however,
the 1978 data is based on a different sample and therefore is likely not comparable to other
series. The education gradient is known to be significant and, arguably, more important than
the income one. The pattern of the earlier data is certainly consistent with mortality differential
increasing over time but it is hardly conclusive.
Given difficulties involved in studying the size of the gradient in the second part of the 20th
68
For example, according to these results, the estimated probability of survival to at least age 65 for a 25-29
year old male professional changed from 72% to 84%, while the respective probabilities for a male unskilled worker
changed from 61% to 64%. Taking these numbers at face value would suggest an large decrease in the ratio of
mortality rates of the skilled to the unskilled from 72% to 45%.
69
There is no information about the period covered by the 1963 study so that the value of 1960 was selected
arbitrarily. The mortality rates are weighted by the sizes of policies.

38

century, it is hardly surprising that the task is even more daunting if one is concerned with
the whole century. Scattered mortality tables based on annuity providers experience and relied
upon in valuation of annuities are available for many different years and they underlie Figure
A3. It has to be stressed that these tables have different sources and are not necessarily directly
comparable.70 No obvious trends in the evolution of mortality differentials are detectable.
Approach. We assume that the differential between mortality rates of the wealthy and those
of the general population stayed constant over time. The evidence regarding changes in the size
of this differential over time is very sketchy. It is somewhat reassuring that mortality tables
based on the experience of pension plans do not contradict our assumption. Even under this
simplifying assumption, we still need to measure the size of these constant differentials. We rely
on estimates from Brown et al. (2002) kindly provided by the authors. Relying on the NLMS
data, they estimated mortality differentials by educational status, sex and gender. We use in our
work the mortality differential for white college graduates (by gender). It would be preferable
from our point of view to use differentials by wealth or at least income classes. Such data is
unfortunately not available. The NLMS has only a poor measure of income and, despite its
large size (more than 1 million observations) the top income category is very thin. We modify
the Brown et al. (2002) factors slightly: their mortality ratios exceed 1 for ages close to 100,
in such cases we set them to equal 1 (and we set them to 1 for all higher ages).71 Figure A4
displays the socioeconomic mortality differentials that we use for both men and women.
Mortality-related sources of a potential bias. The mortality adjustments that we rely on
are crude. There are at least two issues that are of importance. First, the mortality rates may be
systematically biased. It is certainly possible that our assumption of the mortality differential
not changing over time is not correct, so that in any given year the mortality rates are in fact
biased. One would expect that the bias from this source, if any, evolves slowly over time, so
that short-term changes in wealth shares cannot be explained by it. Long-term biases remain,
however, a possibility.
Second, our assumption that the mortality rates are constant within year×gender×age cluster may be in fact incorrect. The direction of the bias will depend on the sign of the covariance
between the mortality error and its effect on wealth accumulation. In a given cluster, we esti1
mate the average wealth as m
· W where “bar” stands for the mean. If the mortality rates are in
1
1
· W + cov( m
, W ). Standard arguments
fact varying, the correct estimate should be T1 · W = m
would suggest that higher mortality rates lead to lower wealth due to higher health expenditures,
increased tax avoidance and planning in contemplation of death, or lower productivity. If so,
then the multiplier and wealth are positively correlated, so that the covariance effect tends to
bias our wealth shares estimates downward.
70

We selected tables that were subsequently relied upon in valuation of annuities. These are tables numbered
803, 806, 888, 809, 810 and 814 (in chronological order). In some cases, they involve some interpolations (especially
for younger ages). The full methodology is not always fully explained.
71
As Brown et al. (2002) point out, there must be a cross-over of mortality rates if groups have the same
maximum age. Effectively then, our assumption implies that the maximum age for the two groups is different.
There are naturally extremely few individuals of such advanced age, even among estate filers. Since mortality
rates by the age of 100 are of the order of .4 even in the most recent data and because our age variables are
truncated at 97, 98 or 99 (depending on the year), it is unlikely that this has any significant effect.

Appendix C

An Overview of Estate Taxation and the Net Worth
Measure

An excellent overview of the history of changes in the estate tax can be found in the CRS
report by Luckey (1995). Gale and Slemrod (2001) discuss the economic literature on estate
taxation. The modern estate tax was introduced in 1916. The original tax applied to net estates
above $50,000 dollars with a top marginal rate of 10%. Between 1916 and 1945, there were
11 tax reforms changing marginal tax rates and/or exemptions. By the end of this period, the
top marginal tax rate was 77% and the exemption was $60,000. Both the rate schedule and
the nominal exemption remained unchanged until 1976. Major revisions of the gift and estate
taxation were introduced by the Tax Reform Act of 1976 and the Economic Recovery Tax Act
of 1981. A number of smaller changes throughout the 1980s and 1990s were followed by major
increases in the exemption levels and the scheduled repeal (in 2010) of the tax enacted in 2001.
In what follows, we briefly review the history of provisions that are of major importance to this
paper.
Filing Threshold. The coverage of our data naturally depends on the filing threshold. The
tax applies to net estate (gross estate minus deductions). Beginning with the Revenue Act of
1918 (effective February 24, 1919), a tax return had to be filed for all gross estates exceeding
the exemption, regardless of whether net estate was above or below the threshold. Prior to that
change, the return had to be filed if estate was subject to the tax or where gross estate at death
exceeded $60,000 (while the exemption was $50,000). Subsequent changes in the nominal filing
threshold were as follows: February 26, 1926 — $100,000, June 6, 1932 — $50,000, August 31,
1935 — $40,000, October 21, 1942 — $60,000. Between 1977 and 1988, the exemption changed
every year (on January 1st) beginning with $120,667 and increasing to $600,000. It was further
increased to $625,000 in 1998, $650,000 in 1999 and $675,000 in 2000. The location of this
threshold determines what fraction of population our data represents.
Gross Estate. The 1916 definition of gross estate included all property, gifts made within two
years of death and all assets held jointly excluding those that may be shown to have originally
belonged to the other persons and never belonged to decedent. The Revenue Act of 1918
expanded the definition of estate to include dower, power of appointment, and life insurance.
Many aspects of this definition evolved over time since. Major changes involved the treatment
of jointly owned property, gifts, life insurance and relatively recent legislative and court activity
regarding valuation of certain kinds of assets.
• Community property/jointly owned property/marital deduction.72 There are nine community property states73 where half of all assets acquired while married is the property of
each spouse — such assets are called community property. Jointly held property is different from the legal point of view — this is anything jointly owned (not necessarily with the
spouse) except for the community property. The original definition of a gross estate called
for inclusion of all jointly owned property in the gross estate. As a consequence, residents
72

We are grateful to Jon Bakija and Barry Johnson for their help in clarifying these issues.
Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington. Wisconsin effectively
became a community property state in 1986.
73

40

of the community property states were treated differently than others. A half of any community property was to be reported, while residents of other states had to report and were
subject to the tax on the full value of jointly held assets. This situation was perceived as
an important source of the (horizontal) inequity, and the 1942 Act attempted to address
this issue by requiring that community property be included in the gross estate unless the
surviving spouse could be shown to have contributed to the acquisition cost. This solution
was replaced in 1948 by the marital deduction: up to 50% of estate of the first-to-die could
be deducted from gross estate. In 1976, this rule was modified to allow for a deduction of
the greater of 50% or $250,000, and in 1981 the unlimited marital deduction was allowed
for. Until 1976, all of the joint property was included in gross estate.74 After 1976, under
some conditions, only 50% must be included.75 After 1981, only 50% of joint property
(without any restrictions) must be included.
From the point of view of maintaining a consistent definition of gross estate, the 19431948 period is different than the rest, because the definition of gross estate in community
property states is broader than in other years. Our data do not provide a fully consistent
definition over time and across states.76 In Appendix D.5 we do though perform limited
sensitivity checks by comparing individuals in the community property states to the others
to see whether their relative shares between 1943-1948 appear unusual. We also discuss
there the quantitative relevance of changes in the treatment of joint property.
• Life insurance (receivable either by the executor of the estate or by others under policies
taken out by the decedent) was to be included in gross estate beginning with the Tax
Reform Act of 1918. Before 1942, up to $40,000 of life insurance could be excluded from
the estates. In 1954, rules governing taxation of life insurance were further extended to
include policies that were given away by the decedent within three years of death or in
contemplation of death. We can account for changes in the exemption, but not for the
1954 change in the definition.
While we observe life insurance payouts, we have no further information regarding contracts that were their source. For example, we do not know whether the taxpayer held
a term- or a whole-life policy. This data problem makes it impossible to ascertain the
exact cash value of life insurance. Motivated by the composition of life insurance in the
SCF data as reported in Brown (1999), we assume that the life insurance payout is split
equally between term- and whole-life policies. We further assume that the whole-life part
has the cash value of 2/3 of the face value, while the term-life part has the cash value equal
to the expected payout (the mortality rate times the actual payout). We include the so
defined cash value in our net worth measure but we order individuals based on net worth
excluding life insurance. Figure A5 shows estimates of the top 1% wealth share when (1)
74

Unless it could be shown that it have originally belonged to the other persons and never belonged to decedent.
However, with unlimited marital deduction available, there is a counteracting incentive to report all unrealized
capital gains as jointly owned property, in which case they are subject to a step-up in basis. The 1976 Act
introduced a “carryover basis” for unrealized capital gains, however this provision never became effective and was
repealed by the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act of 1980.
76
We have no information about community property before 1976 and we have no information about jointly
owned property in 1965 and 1969. We investigated adjusting the definition of gross estate to always include half
of jointly owned property (imputing 1965 and 1969 values), but it had negligible quantitative consequences and
still does not address the community property problem.
75

41

life insurance is excluded, (2) only cash surrender value is included (the baseline case) and
(3) when the full payout is included. It is evident from these pictures that life insurance
is small and that both quantitative and qualitative results are very robust to variations in
its treatment. The importance of life insurance falls with wealth: for example, the cash
surrender value of life insurance in the top .01% constituted at its peak (1943) just 1.56%
of net worth and it was usually much lower than 1%.
• Gifts. The gift tax was introduced in 1924. There was a lifetime exclusion of $50,000
and an annual exclusion of $500 per donee. The gift tax, as well as the 1924 estate tax
schedule were retroactively repealed in 1926. In 1932, the gift tax was reintroduced and
the marginal gift tax rates were set at three-quarters of the estate tax rates and the annual
exclusion was set at $5000. The next major modification of gift taxation was introduced
in 1976 when the estate and gift taxation were “unified”. The 1976 Act introduced the
single unified exemption for combined gifts and estate transferred by the deceased. The
marginal estate and gift tax rates are set nominally at the same level, However the estate
tax liability is computed using a tax-inclusive basis while the gift tax liability is obtained
on a tax-exclusive basis, resulting in a significant tax advantage of gifts.77
We exclude regular lifetime gifts from our definition of net worth, consistently with our
objective of computing the total wealth that is effectively controlled by the wealthy. The
exception here are gifts in “contemplation of death” that were included in the estate since
the introduction of the tax in 1916. Some of specific rules changed over time to address
certain avoidance loopholes (e.g., the 1954 change in the treatment of life insurance that
was discussed earlier). The gross estate is now supposed to include regular gifts made
within 3 years of death78 (the original limit was two years, increased to three in 1950),
any transfers with retained life estate (i.e., if the decedent retained an interest), transfers
taking effect at death, revocable transfers and transfers by the decedent with respect to a
life insurance policy made within 3 years before death. To the extent that such gifts are
indeed made in contemplation of death (as the tax law assumes), their inclusion potentially
reduces the “moral hazard” bias discussed earlier by eliminating one source of the difference
between decedents and survivors.
• Valuation. Many types of assets are inherently difficult to value. As discussed by e.g., Schmalbeck (2001) and Johnson et al. (2001), certain types of assets are routinely allowed by the
courts to be valued at a discount. This applies in particular to the situations where
the estate contains a significant fraction of a certain kind of property (e.g., corporate
stock) so that its sale would likely result in a significant reduction in price (so called nonmarketability discounts). Discounts are also granted to minority interests, even in the case
when the family owns a majority stake in the company. Some difficult to sell assets (such
as works of art) are also occasionally granted such a treatment. Our data does not allow
for identifying the extent of such activity. Johnson et al. (2001) found that approximately
6% of returns claimed minority or lack-of-marketability discounts and that their average
size was about 10% of gross estate (for those who claimed the discounts), suggesting that
this does not have a large quantitative impact on the estimates. Poterba and Weisbenner
77
78

On the other hand, gifts including any unrealized capital gains do not benefit from the step-up of their basis.
Even those for which a gift tax return was filed

42

(2003) pursue this direction further. It is quite possible that the bias resulting from these
kinds of discounts did not stay constant over time, because many of these approaches are
relatively new.
Changes in the approach to valuation are often driven by court cases rather than legislative activity. Two provisions were, however, directly enacted by the legislature. Since
1976, the so-called “special-use” rules allowed estates consisting primarily of a closely held
business or family farm to be significantly undervalued.79 Because tax returns (and our
data) contain both the information about the fair market value and the adjusted value
of such assets, we are able to account for the full (i.e., fair market) value of these assets
and, therefore, maintain the consistent definition of estate over time. The special-use adjustment is of minor quantitative importance.80 Since 1935, the executor of an estate has
had an option of using the so-called “alternate valuation”, whereby assets can be valued
one year after death instead of being valued at the time of death. The alternate valuation
delay was later reduced to half a year. Our data contain both alternate and date-of-death
valuations starting in 1962, but we only have the actual for-tax-purposes value between
1935-1945. As a result, we are unable to have a fully consistent date-of-death definition
for our whole sample, but we can measure the size of the difference starting in 1962 and
it is quantitatively small.
Deductions Many deductions for tax purposes from the gross estate are possible (charitable
deductions since 1918, marital deduction since 1948, deductions for funeral and administrative
expenses and so on). Although all of them have tax consequences, they are not relevant for
the purpose of estimating wealth shares. We subtract from the estate only personal debts and
mortgages of the decedents. In particular, funeral expenses, executor’s commissions, attorneys’
fees and other administrative expenses of the estate are not subtracted. Some of these debts
(e.g., medical debts) may not be representative of debts of surviving individuals, our data does
not allow however for any systematic and consistent over time accounting for different kinds of
debts.
Definition of net worth. Net worth is defined as the total gross estate adjusted for the
special use valuation provisions and reduced by debts.81 Gross estates are measured at the
value for tax purposes which is either date of death or the date of alternative valuation. This is
due to lack of information on the date of death valuations between 1935 and 1945. After 1962,
we can observe both date-of-death and alternate valuations. We discuss the magnitude of the
difference between the two types of valuation below.
79

Specifically, under certain circumstances, these kinds of assets can be valued at their present rather than best

use.
80
With the exception of 1983 tabulations in brackets below the top .25% that are based on a very small number
of observations (see tables A2-A and B, and the further discussion of the estate composition data), in no other
bracket the special use adjustment exceeds the order of 1% of our final figure assigned to net worth. In some of
the thin brackets in 1983, this adjustment is approximately 4%. The special-use adjustment was originally capped
at $500,000. The 2000 (the last year of our data) limit was $780,000. By definition then, this rule can only play
a minor role at the very top.
81
Individuals are ordered according to net worth minus the estimated value of life insurance. To the extent
that inclusion of life insurance leads to rank reversal, the share of wealth held by the top percentiles is slightly
underestimated (see sensitivity analysis described above).

Appendix D
Appendix D.1

Top Wealth Shares
Aggregate Net Worth Series

In order to obtain a denominator for our top wealth shares computations, we need to obtain
estimates of total net worth of the household sector in the United States. Net worth will be
defined as the sum of all tangible assets (owner occupied residential land and housing82 and
consumer durables), financial assets (deposits, bonds, equity in corporate and non-corporate
businesses, etc.), net of all liabilities (consumer debt, mortgages, etc.). Our wealth measure
includes only the cash surrender value of pension fund reserves (that is, the value of pensions
that remains upon death). Our wealth measure includes life insurance reserves (as we include
the expected pay-out of life insurance in our estimates). It also excludes social security wealth,
and all forms of human wealth (expected value of future labor earnings). Our wealth definition
corresponds roughly to the definition of wealth W2 in Wolff and Marley (1989).
Unfortunately, the United States has not developed a consistent set of estimates of household
wealth since 1916. As a result, aggregate net worth series have been computed using various
sources.
Period 1945-2002
For the period since 1945, detailed official Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA) have been produced for each sector of the U.S. economy (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(2000)). The FFA presents the detailed balance sheets of Households and Nonprofit Organizations. They report the amounts outstanding (on December 31st of each year) broken down for
a large number of assets and liability items. Net worth is divided into three broad categories:
Tangible Assets, Financial Assets, and Liabilities. The main difficulty with the FFA is that they
separate the household from the non-profit sector only imperfectly before 1988.
As only the Cash Surrender Value (CSV) of pensions enters estates, we include only the CSV
of pension fund reserves in our total net worth series. According to Smith (1984) and Wolff
(1989), the CSV of pensions has been traditionally very small in the United States (estimated
around 5%). However, over the last three decades, the development of Defined Contribution
(DC) pension plans, and in particular 401(k) plans since the 1980s, has substantially increased
the CSV of pensions. In general, DC plans vest after a short period of employment (401(k)
employee contributions vest immediately in general) with the same employer and are portable
when an employee shifts to another employer; amounts accumulated in DC plans can be fully
bequeathed at death and thus are fully included on estate tax returns). Therefore, we assume
that all DC pension reserves have 100% CSV. The DC pension plans assets are obtained from
the FFA, Table L119c (Row 1, total financial assets) since 1985. Before 1985, the FFA does not
report the DC plans assets but report the equity shares held by households through DC plans
(Table B100e, Row 13). We assume that the fraction of equity shares in DC plans before 1985
is equal to 40% (which is the fraction in 1985). Before 1955, DC plan assets is less than 5% of
pension reserves. Therefore for the period before 1955, we adopt the Smith-Wolff assumption

Tenant occupied residential land and buildings with more than four units are included in the business assets
category in the Flow of Funds Accounts and we have followed their methodology although rented land and
residential buildings would appear in large part as real estate on tax returns of decedent owners. This discrepancy,
however, has no effect on our top share and composition estimates.

and we estimate the CSV of pensions as 5% of total pension fund reserves. This approximation
is of little consequence as pension fund reserves are less than 5% of total net worth (and hence
the CSV of pensions is a negligible component of total net worth).
Pension funds assets are invested in corporate equities and fixed claims assets. We compute
the total amount invested in corporate equities from Table B100e, Row 13 (see above); the
amount of fixed claims assets is then obtained by substraction.
For the period since 1988, we defined our wealth measure as net worth of households and
nonprofit organizations less the net worth of nonprofit organizations. For the period before
1988, the category tangible assets allows the separation between the household and the nonprofit
sector. The category financial assets does not provide the breakdown and therefore, we have
assumed that the fraction of financial assets in the nonprofit sector has stayed constant and
equal to the fraction for 1988 (the earliest year this estimate is provided). This assumption
seems reasonable because the share of nonprofit for the tangible asset category does not display
a trend and stays around 10% between 1945 and 1988. It is important to note that, in the
FFA, tenant occupied real estate for buildings with more than four units is not included in the
real estate category but included in equity in non-corporate business. We follow the same rule
although it should be noted that tenant occupied real estate (even for buildings with more than
four units) will most likely appear in the real estate category in the estate of the owner.
The category liabilities is partially broken down between the household and the non-profit
sector for the period 1945 to 1987. Three separate sub-categories (municipal securities, commercial mortgages, and trade payables) are liabilities of the nonprofit sector exclusively. In
the period 1988 to 2002, those three categories represent about 70% of all nonprofit liabilities.
Therefore, for the period 1945 to 1987, we have assumed that the total liabilities of the nonprofit
sector is equal to 1/0.7 times the sum of those three sub-categories.
In any case, the fraction nonprofit in the FFA of households and nonprofits is between 5%
and 10%, and closer to 5% for the liability and financial assets categories for which we need to
do imputations. Therefore, we expect that errors in our imputations will lead to a very modest
bias in our net worth estimates (no more than 1-2%) for the period 1945-1987.
Period 1916-1944
Estimating total household net worth in the prewar period is complicated, because there
is no single official source and most sources provide estimates only for some years during the
period. An earlier attempt to compute household wealth from various sources is Wolff (1989).
However, he provides estimates only for years 1900, 1912, 1921, 1922, 1929, 1933, and 1939 for
the pre-1945 period. Our estimates are very close to his W2 series for those years. We build
upon his methodology and the same sources he did to extend our estimates to every year from
1916 to 1944.
Tangible assets are estimated as follows. For 1925 to 1945, consumer durables are taken
from the FFA series reported in Herman (2000), Table 1, Consumer durable goods column. For
1916 to 1924, we have used Goldsmith et al. (1956), Table W1, p. 14, column 12, Consumer
durables. The earlier Goldsmith series has been pasted (using a constant multiplicative factor)
so that they coincide with the most recent and official FFA series in 1925 (in 1925, Goldsmith
series about 10% higher than the FFA series).
Residential land series is from Goldsmith et al. (1956), Table W1, p. 15, column (21), non45

farm residential land. Owner occupied residential structures is from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis at http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/faweb/, Table 5.1, col. 14, for the period 1925 to
1945. For 1916 to 1924, we have used Goldsmith et al. (1956), Table W1, p. 14, column 4,
nonfarm residential structures. The Goldsmith series for 1916-1925 have been pasted (using a
constant multiplicative factor) to coincide with the most recent and official BEA series in 1925
(in 1925, Goldsmith series about 20% higher than the BEA series because they include tenant
occupied housing as well).
Tangible assets are defined as the sum of those three series: consumer durables, non-farm
residential land, and owner occupied residential structures. This series is about 8% higher in
1945 than the tangible assets series from the FFA (see above). Thus, we have reduced uniformly
our tangible assets series by about 8% before 1945 so that they match exactly in 1945.
Unlike Tangible Assets, there is no annual source available for each of the categories forming
the financial assets and liabilities of the household sector. Goldsmith et al. (1956) provide
detailed estimates of the financial assets, and liabilities of the household sector only for years
1900, 1912, 1922, 1929, 1933, 1939, 1945, and 1949. Wolff (1989) uses the Goldsmith estimates
and reconciles them with the FFA estimates in order to cover the period 1900-1984. We therefore
use the Wolff (1989) estimates available for the years 1912, 1922, 1929, 1933, 1939, and 1945,83
Financial assets are divided into fixed claimed assets (deposits and currency, federal bonds,
state and local bonds, corporate and foreign bonds) and equity (corporate stock, equity in
farm businesses, equity in non-farm unincorporated businesses, trust equity). The Wolff (1989)
estimates for each of these categories are reported in Table 5, “Final National Balance Sheet Estimates for the Household Sector for W2, by Detailed Component, 1900-1983”, in the electronic
data appendix to the paper that Professor Edward Wolff kindly made available to us.
We start from the Wolff (1989) estimates and we interpolate in between the years as follows.
For deposits and currency, state and local bonds, corporate and foreign bonds, and liabilities, we have done a straight linear interpolation between each consecutive pair of years for
which Wolff (1989) provides estimates. Each of these items is relatively small and was trending
upward relatively smoothly over the period.
For federal bonds, we interpolate between the years using the total outstanding Federal Debt
series from Historical Statistics of the United States (Series Y493).84 The interpolation proceeds
as follows: we compute the ratio of federal bonds in household wealth to outstanding federal
debt for the years available in Wolff (1989). In between those years, we assume that this ratio
evolves linearly, and this allows us to estimate the amount of federal bonds in household wealth
for each year.
We proceed in the same fashion for corporate equity using the S&P500 index end of year
series compiled on line by Robert Shiller at http://aida.econ.yale.edu/ shiller/data.htm. We also
interpolate trust equity and unincorporated non-farm business equity using the same S&P500
index. Finally, we interpolate unincorporated farm business equity using an estimate of the
value of farms from Goldsmith et al. (1956), Table W1, the sum of columns (7) farm structures,
83

Wolff (1989) also provides estimates for year 1921 based on King (1927). King (1927) computes estimates
only for year 1921 and is difficult to reconcile with the laterGoldsmith et al. (1956). Therefore, we do not use
the King (1927) and Wolff (1989) estimate for 1921.
84
Those series give the amount of debt on June 30th of each year. We estimate end of year amounts of debt in
year t as the average of year t and t+1 from the original series.

46

(14) livestock inventories, (15) crops inventories, and (20) agricultural land. Contrary to the
FFA series, Goldsmith and Wolff series do not include tenant occupied real estate for buildings
with more than four units in the unincorporated business category. Therefore, in order to be
consistent with FFA, we add tenant occupied residential structures from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis at http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/faweb/, Table 5.1, col. 15 to the category equity
in unincorporated businesses.85
Those interpolated series extend Wolff (1989) series for financial assets and liabilities for each
year from 1912 to 1945. In order to paste those series to the series for the 1945-2002 period, we
adjust by a proportional factor each the early series (1912-1945) for fixed claim assets (deposits
and all bonds), corporate equity, non-corporate equity and trusts, and liabilities. For fixed claim
assets, the adjustment is up by about 5%. For corporate equity, the adjustment is up by 10%,
and for unincorporated equity (including tenant occupied housing), the adjustment is down by
about 10%. For liabilities, the adjustment is about 2% up.
Overall, our series are within 5% of the Wolff (1989) W2 series, and often within 2-3%, with
no trend over the period.86
From end-of-year to average-of-year estimates
All wealth series from FFA, Goldsmith et al. (1956), and Wolff (1989) are end-of-year estimates (for December 31st of each year). Estates represent wealth of decedents at time of death
and hence are distributed fairly uniformly over the year. Therefore, for our denominator series,
the best would be to obtain estimates of average aggregate wealth over the year. The simple
approximation we use consists in estimating the average for year t as the half-sum of our endof-year t − 1 and end-of-year t series. Smith (1984) adopted this method to obtain top wealth
shares for the 1958-1976 period. This approximation will be accurate when wealth is smoothly
increasing or decreasing in between the two end-of-year snapshots.
The only adjustments we made to this simple method were for corporate stocks for years
1929, 1932, and 1933. This is because the annual average value of stock prices (estimated as the
monthly average of the S&P 500 series) was substantially different than the end-of-year averages
for the corresponding two consecutive years. Thus for those three years, we replaced the simple
end-of-year average by the monthly average over the year.87

Estimates Based on Micro-Data: 1916-1945, 1962, 1965, 1969,
1972, 1976, 1982-2000

We take advantage of an extraordinary dataset available through the Statistics of Income (SOI)
Division of the IRS.88 The data include information from all of the estate tax returns filed for
85

The BEA series are only available since 1925, we extrapolate the series from 1916 to 1925 using Goldsmith
et al. (1956) non-farm residential structures as we did for owner occupied residential structures (see above).
86
The only exception is 1972 for which our series derived from FFA are 7% higher than Wolff estimate.
87
For all other years, the end-of-year average and the monthly average are very close and we did not do any
adjustment.
88
The dataset is confidential and is not released in its raw form. We are extremely grateful to Barry Johnson
of the SOI for his help and patience in explaining the data and facilitating our access to it by running our SAS
programs at the SOI.

deaths occurring between 1916 and 1945,89 all returns filed in 1963, samples of returns filed in
1966, 1970, 1973, 1977 and samples of returns corresponding to years of death between 19822000. For all years however, there is 100% coverage of very large estates (those corresponding
roughly to our top .01% group). A more detailed description of the 1916-1945 data can be found
in McCubbin (1990), while the post-1945 studies are described in Johnson (1994).
We rely on the relevant year-of-death datasets to characterize wealth distributions for 19161945 and 1982-2000. We use returns filed in 1963, 1966, 1970, 1973, 1977 to construct wealth
percentiles for 1962, 1965, 1969, 1972, and 1976 respectively, regardless of the actual year of
death. For 1962-1976, this choice is motivated by the sample design: in the absence of regular
sampling, no other approach is feasible. Conveniently, this period does not involve any significant
legislative activity and most returns filed in year t+1 correspond the deaths in year t.90 We
always ignore observations for which net worth falls below the filing threshold because not 100%
of estates with net worth below the filing threshold file estate tax returns.91
We impute estate multipliers when age is missing. Age of the decedent was present on the
tax return beginning with the August 1919 revision of the tax form. As a result, we do not
have age information for most of the decedents dying between 1916 and 1918. We also do not
know age for any of the 1965 observations. We do have age data for 77% of the 1919 decedents,
88% of the 1920 decedents and we have age information for over 90% of our sample in each
of the remaining years (between 1982 and 1995, we have age information for everyone). In
years when age information is available for most observations, imputations are performed by
setting the multiplier equal to the average of the multipliers of the 50 individuals in the wealth
distribution surrounding the one with missing age information. In order to impute multipliers
between 1916 and 1918, we proceed in an identical fashion, but we place each observation in
the 1919 distribution (adjusted for inflation) and base our imputations on the surrounding 1919
observations. Imputations in 1965 are performed similarly by using the joint distribution of 1962
and 1969 returns as the reference distribution.
Age is coded in the data using two digits. Except for 1982-1983, the age variable is top-coded
at 98, in 1982 the value of 96 stands for “96 or above”, while in 1983 the value of 97 stands for
“97 or above”. Using the top-coded value would lead to overestimation of the corresponding
multiplier, since some of the individuals are in fact older and therefore faced higher mortality
risk than the top-coded value would indicate. To correct this problem, we use as a multiplier
for top-coded observations the average (using population weights) multiplier for those aged at
the top code or above.
As discussed earlier, the filing threshold and therefore the coverage of our data changed many
times over the years.92 Post-1945, all tax changes went into effect as of midnight December 31st ,
but the earlier reforms generally did not take place on such end-of-year dates. There were four
changes in the filing threshold that became effective in the middle of a year: on 2/26/1926,
6/6/1932, 8/30/1935 and 10/21/1942. The 1926 and 1942 changes increased the threshold,
89

Returns filed after 1945 are also included.
The latest year available is for estate tax returns filed during calendar year 2002. This year contains about
8% of returns for individuals deceased in 2000 and less than 1% for individuals deceased in 1999 or before. We
are therefore confident that extremely few estates for 2000 decedents will be filed in years 2003 or later.
91
A number of estates with net worth below the filing threshold do file estate tax returns because the filing
threshold is defined based on gross worth.
92
We ignore the issue of inflation effects within a year which makes individuals with the same real net worth
more likely to be subject to the tax if they die later in the year
90

48

the other two decreased it. Furthermore, the estate tax was adopted starting September 9th
1916, so that we do not have the full coverage for 1916. In those cases, we naturally re-weight
observations available for part of the year only by the inverse of the part of the year with lower
threshold.93 This amounts to assuming that decedents dying during the part of the year when
the low threshold was effective constitute a representative sample of decedents of similar wealth
dying during the other part of the year.
Where relevant, we rely on the sample weights provided by the SOI. Post-1945 samples are
stratified samples of returns actually filed. Generally, all returns above a certain high level of
wealth are included in the data ($5 million in most years), while returns below that level are
sampled using a complex design (Woodburn and Johnson, 1994). Certain rare types of returns
(e.g., individuals aged 45 or younger) are included with certainty. In the 1980s, returns were
sampled every year but samples for certain years (1982, 1986, 1989) are significantly larger, with
samples for intermediate years treated as supplementary. This design reflects the fact that at
the time of the studies, one of the main SOI objective was to be able to produce wealth estimates
every three years. Beginning with 1991, the sampling strategy is essentially consistent over time.
We assign observations to the various top groups as follows. We define the corresponding
population count of an observation as the product of the sampling weight and the multiplier.
We use these weights we compute the rank of an individual in the distribution of net worth. We
then compute the thresholds of the fractiles of interest using the U.S. population over 20 in a
given year estimated from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975) (series A29-32) and U.S. Bureau of
the Census (2002) (Table 2-12). Individuals who are located on the boundaries of two top groups
contribute to both of them in proportion to their overlap with each. All reported tabulations
are performed using top groups defined in this way.
For 1916-1945, the data are not equally detailed for all observations. As mentioned, all
returns that were filed are included in the data and they are all subject to the so called “basic
edit,” while only selected observations are subject to the “complete edit.” The former includes
basic information from the tax return such as age, sex, marital status, date of death, state
of residence, gross estate, debts, life insurance and a few other variables. The latter includes
in addition information on the composition of estates. Sub-samples of returns for decedents
who died in 1916-1920, 1928-1930, 1938-1940 and 1944 were subject to the complete edit. In
addition, gross estates above some high threshold were always subject to the complete edit. As
the result, for 1916-45 we are able to construct the complete estate composition series for the top
0.01% based on the complete coverage of decedents, while the composition for lower percentiles
is available only for selected years and is usually based on a sample of returns.
Column 2 of Table A displays the shares of population that we estimate are covered by our
data in each year. Table D contains basic information about the size and information contained
in our sample, by percentile category. Its first panel lists the number of observations in each
percentile category. When no figure is shown, it indicates that filling out this category would
require including individuals with net worth below the threshold level. The second panel presents
average sample weights in various percentile groups, by year.94 In practical terms, our estimates
93

For example, on June 6, 1935 the filing threshold was decreased from $100,000 to $50,000. As a result, we
use only deaths occurring after June 6 to estimate wealth between $50,000 and $100,000 and re-weight those
observations by a factor 365/208 (208 is the number of days between June 6th and the end of the year). We
re-weight all observations in 1916 by a factor 366/114 (1916 was a leap-year).
94
The weight can be lower than 1 for observations which span two different categories. By construction, it

49

of the top 0.01% wealth are based on returns sampled with certainty, while estimates in lower
percentiles are for many years based on samples. It is clear from this table that the data for
1983-1985 and for 1987-1988 is based on the much sparser sampling than those in other years.
The last part of Table D shows the fraction of observations in each category that contain detailed
composition information about asset holdings.

Appendix D.3

Estimates Based on Published Tabulations: 1946-1950, 19531954, 1956, 1958, and 1960

For years 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1958, and 1960, the IRS has not
constructed micro-data files but has published a set of detailed tabulations in U.S. Treasury
Department, Internal Revenue Service (various yearsa). We have used those Statistics of Income
(SOI) tabulations to estimate top wealth shares and composition for those years as well.
SOI tabulations are always presented by year of filing: as most estates are filed within 9
months of death, we assume that year of filing t corresponds to year of death t − 1.95 The SOI
publication contains cross-tabulations by size of gross estate and age groups (for each of the two
genders) for years 1948, 1949, 1950, 1953, and 1958. For all years but 1958, the age groups are
quite detailed and defined as 0-20, 21-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 64-69, 70-74, 75-79,
80-84, and 85+.96
For each age group and gender cell, we compute the estate multiplier as the product of the
average mortality for the cell97 and the social differential mortality factor from Brown et al.
(2002) (see above). We multiply the number of decedents and the amount of gross estate they
report by the estate multiplier in order to obtain a distribution by gross estate brackets for
the living population. Because the number of observations in the very top brackets is small,
the corresponding multipliers tend to be noisy and vary from bracket to bracket and year to
year. Therefore, for each gender group, we average multipliers for all estates above one million
nominal dollars for years before 1950 and above two million nominal dollars for 1953 and after.
Such estates are very large and always represent less than the top 0.01% which is the smallest
group we analyze in this study.
We then estimate the thresholds and amounts corresponding to each fractile using the well
known empirical regularity that the top tail of the wealth distribution is very closely approximated by a Pareto distribution.
The first step consists then in estimating the income thresholds corresponding to each of the
percentiles Top 2%, Top 1%, ,..., Top 0.01% thresholds, that define our top wealth groups. For
each percentile p, we look first for the wealth bracket [s, t] containing the percentile p. We then
assume that the distribution of wealth is Pareto distributed within the bracket [s, t]. A Pareto
distribution has a cumulative distribution function of the form F (y) = 1 − (k/y)a where k and
a are constants, a is the Pareto parameter of the distribution. We estimate then the parameters
applies to at most two observations in a group.
95
Micro-files from the IRS show that this assumption is reasonable although not completely accurate because
many returns are filed late. The overwhelming majority of returns filed in year t are composed by returns for
date of death t − 1 (about two thirds) and date of death t − 2 (about one third).
96
For year 1958, the age groups are less detailed: 0-30, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+.
97
This average mortality is computed using the mortality tables for the U.S. population by 5 year age and
gender groups available at http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/wilmoth/mortality/states.html

a and k of the Pareto distribution for the wealth bracket [s, t] by solving the two equations:
k = s · p1/a and k = t · q 1/a where p is the fraction of individals above s and q the fraction
of individuals above t. Note that the Pareto parameters k and a may vary from bracket to
bracket.98 Once the density distribution on [s, t] is estimated, it is straightforward to estimate
the income threshold, say yp , corresponding to percentile p.
The second step consists of estimating the amounts of wealth reported above wealth threshold
yp . We estimate the amount reported between wealth yp and t (the upper bound of the wealth
bracket [s, t] containing yp ) using the estimated Pareto density with parameters a and k. We
then add to that amount the amounts in all the brackets above t. Using the micro-data, we
have checked that this method provide very close estimates of the thresholds and amounts.
Gross estate is defined as the sum of all assets (including life insurance) before deducting
debts and liabilities, and all other deductions. Therefore, to obtain net worth estimates, we
need to deduct life insurance and liabilities from our gross worth estimates and add back the
cash surrender value of life insurance. We estimate the cash surrender value of life insurance
from the pay-out value using the same method as the one described above for micro-data. For
each fractile, we compute the fraction of life insurance and the fraction of debts relative to gross
worth using the method to estimate composition of wealth described below. We then subtract
from the amounts and thresholds corresponding to each bracket the fraction of debt and life
insurance and we add back the cash surrender value of life insurance.99 This method provides
accurate results when the ranking according to gross estate and the ranking according to net
worth (gross estate less life insurance and debts plus CSV of insurance) are close. Using the
micro-data, we can check that those rankings are close and that our method provides results
very close to the exact computations (both can be computed with the micro-data).100
Once the corrected amounts and thresholds are obtained, we obtain directly the mean income
above percentile p by dividing the amount by the number of individuals above percentile p.
Finally, the share of income accruing to individuals above percentile p is obtained by dividing
the total amount above yp by our aggregate wealth series (Table A, col. (4)). Average wealth and
wealth shares for intermediate groups (Top 2-1%, Top 1-0.5%, etc.) are obtained by subtraction.
The shares are reported in Table B1, and the thresholds and average wealth levels are reported
in Table B2.
For years 1946, 1947, 1954, 1956 and 1960, the IRS has not published tabulations by brackets
of gross estate, by age and gender. Therefore, for those years, we apply the multipliers by
brackets obtained above using the closest year. For 1946 and 1947, we use the multipliers from
1948. For year 1954, we use year 1953. For years 1956, we use the average of 1953 and 1958.
For 1960, we use year 1958. This method is acceptable because multipliers by wealth brackets
vary little from year to year.
For years 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1953, 1954, 1958, and 1960, composition tables published
98
If the threshold falls in the top bracket, we estimate the Pareto parameter a for the top bracket using the
fact that the average wealth in the top bracket is equal to a/(a − 1) times the top bracket threshold.
99
For each threshold, we subtract the average fraction of debt and life insurance and add back the CSV of life
insurance from the bracket above and the bracket below.
100
For years 1950 and 1956, no composition tables have been published. Therefore, we assume the same average
liabilities and life insurance as the average of 1954 and 1958 by bracket for 1956 and years 1949 and 1951 for year
1950.

51

by brackets of gross estates have been used to estimate the fraction of net worth for each fractile
falling into each of the categories: real estate, bonds, stocks, cash, deposits and notes, other
assets, and debts. The composition of wealth within each group was estimated from these tables
using a simple linear interpolation method. As those composition tables are not published by age
or gender, we assumed that the composition by brackets was the same for the living population
and for decedents. This assumption does not seem to bias our results significantly as we see no
evidence of discontinuity with the years where we can use the micro-data and hence relax this
assumption. The composition estimates are also reported on Table B3.
As we discussed above and as can be seen in Table D, for a number of years during the period
1916-1945, the micro estate tax data do not provide composition information for returns with
gross estate below a very high threshold for years 1921-1927, 1931-1937, 1941-1943, and 1945.
For all these years, except 1926 and 1945, we have used the published composition tabulations
by size of estate from U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (various yearsa) to
estimate the composition of net worth for our top groups using the same methodology as above.

Appendix D.4

Pareto Extrapolations when Coverage is too Low

As can be seen on Table A, column (3), for a number of years and especially in the 1916-1945
period, the estate tax data does not cover the top 1% of the population (or even the top .5%
for some years). In order to produce top 1% shares for all years, we have used a simple Pareto
extrapolation technique to estimate those shares. We assume that the Pareto coefficient for the
groups for which we do not have enough data is the same as the one for the lowest group fully
covered by our data. For example, in 1918, as the data covers the top 0.571%, the lowest group
covered is the top .5-.25%, and we assume that the Pareto parameter for group 1-.5% is the
same of the Pareto parameter we estimated for the group .5-.25%. This method is acceptable
because the variations in the Pareto parameters are relatively small from one group to the next.
This method can be checked with years with good coverage.

Sensitivity to certain data inconsistencies

As discussed earlier, between 1942 and 1948 the gross estate was supposed to include the full
value of community property. This change took place in October 1942. By definition, this
rule affected directly only married individuals, although an effect (with a lag) on widows is
also possible. Its mechanical consequence is a temporary increase in the reported assets of the
married individuals in community property states. As the result, if this change had a significant
effect, it should affect the values of estates of married residents of the community property states
relative to the rest. Figure A6 shows fractions of the top .05% and Top .25-.05% accounted for
by residents of the community property states, by marital status. The mechanical effect should
lead to an increase in the share of community property residents among married individuals in
the top group but not necessarily in the other groups. The evidence of such a change is weak.
The share of married community property residents in the top group indeed increased in 1943
but then fell back to the usual level. The trend is much stronger for single individuals (who
are not affected by the change). In the lower bracket, it appears that the share of community
property residents among the married was indeed increasing relative to other groups, but the

52

effect is the strongest some two years after the change went into effect. Overall, we conclude
that there is no evidence that this source of data inconsistency plays an important role.
The tax treatment of jointly owned property changed in 1976 and 1981 by allowing to include
only 50% of jointly held assets in the estate of the decedents. Our dataset includes the value
of the includible portion of jointly owned assets as reported on Schedule E for 1962, 1972, 1976
and from 1982 on. Starting with 1992, we can observe both total and the includible part of
assets jointly held with the spouse. Indeed, approximately 50% of the total is included. Assets
held jointly with the spouse constitute more than 80% of all jointly held assets in all wealth
categories. Generally, the importance of jointly owned assets falls with wealth. There is little
evidence of a significant decrease of the value of jointly held assets included in the estate after
1976. In the top .1%, the includible part of jointly held assets was approximately 2.3% of the
total net worth in 1972, 1.1% in 1976 and it fluctuated between .7 and 4% (with the mean of
2.2%) since, with no discernible trend. At lower percentiles, there is similarly no evidence of a
major decrease in the included jointly owned assets (although the importance of jointly owned
assets is much larger: they steadily increase as net worth falls and, e.g., they are more than
10% of net worth around the .5% percentile). Speculating somewhat, because the change in tax
law should have had a mechanical effect of halving the jointly owned property, it suggests that
additional outside assets might have been reported as jointly owned, presumably to benefit from
a step-up while escaping taxation via marital deduction. If so, doubling jointly owned property
after 1976 would lead to a significant overestimation of net worth relative to the pre-1977 period.
In any case, at least at the very top, how jointly owned assets are accounted for would have
no major impact on our shares. Either doubling of the post-1976 jointly owned property or
including a fraction of the pre-1977 would change the shares only in a minor way (in the top
.1%, net worth would change by approximately 2%). Such a change would lead to showing a
slightly stronger recovery in the early 1980s without an effect on trends pre- or post-1976.

Appendix E

Earlier Estimates and Estimates from other Sources

Table C1 reports top 1% wealth share estimates in the United States from previous studies.

Appendix E.1

Lampman Estimates

Lampman (1962) was the first to use in a comprehensive way the U.S. estate tax data to construct
top wealth shares. He focused his analysis on years 1922, 1929, 1933, 1939, 1945, 1949, 1953,
1954, and 1956, for which the IRS published detailed tables by age and gender groups. However,
for all these years, Lampman’s analysis is always focused on all estate tax returns filers as a
whole representing the living population of wealth holders with gross wealth above the filing
threshold. Because of inflation, economic growth and downturns, and changes in the nominal
filing threshold, the adult population represented by estate tax filers has changed dramatically
from less than 0.5% in 1929 to almost 2% in 1956. Lampman’s provides consistent top wealth
1% shares for the adult population (aged 20 and above) from those estimates using a simple
graphical Pareto interpolation method (Table 94 and Chart 32 on pp. 204-205).101 He assumed
101

Lampman also provides estimates of the top 0.5% share of the total population (adults and minors) using the
same method. As a result, the top 1% and top 0.5% Lampman series are not comparable.

53

that the Pareto parameter for all years was equal to the one estimated for 1953 (for which he
provided much detail in the first part of the book).
Therefore, although Lampman’s study was very detailed and careful in the analysis of the
group represented by all estate tax filers, his derivation of consistent top shares, the most
influential piece in his study, was very rough. Our own estimation method shows that the
Pareto parameters do vary substantially from year to year. The Pareto parameter for year 1953
in the range Top 1-0.5% (which Lampman used for the other years) is equal to about 1.6 but
is lower for pre-war years (around 1.3). Therefore, Lampman’s graphical method might have
introduced non-negligible errors, especially for the years for which the fraction of the population
represented by tax returns is far from 1%. It is also important to note that there are many
other reasons why our estimates might differ from Lampman’s, as his definition of net worth is
not identical to ours, and the social differential mortality rates are also different.
Nevertheless, overall, Lampman’s estimates (reproduced in Table C1 and graphically displayed on Figure 11) are comparable to ours. The downward trend is of similar magnitude. The
main difference is for 1939. Our series suggest than there was a continuous decline in the top
1% from 1933 to 1945, while Lampman’s series displays a rebound in 1939. This discrepancy is
in part explained by differences in our denominator series. Lampman denominator is relatively
low in 1939 (displaying less than a 10% increase from 1933) whereas our denominator increases
by about 20% (in nominal terms). Both Wolff (1989) and Goldsmith et al. (1956) display a
similar 20% increase in nominal terms from 1933 to 1939.

Appendix E.2

Smith Estimates

Smith (1984) constructs top 0.5% and 1% net worth shares for years 1958, 1962, 1965, 1969,
1972, and 1976 using micro estate tax data. He also estimates the composition of wealth for
those two groups. Smith defines the top groups relative to the total population instead of adults
(as we do). Moreover, because of data issues, the top groups are defined by ranking individuals
by gross worth instead of net worth (although shares are computed based on the net worth
concept). Those two features make Smith’s data not directly comparable with our results and
with the previous estimates by Lampman.102

Appendix E.3

SCF and Combined Estimates

Kennickell (2003) and Scholz (2003) have used the Survey of Consumer Finances to construct
top net worth shares. Kennickell (2003) estimates shares and composition of wealth for 5 groups:
the bottom 50% (percentiles 0-50), the next 40% (percentiles 50-90), the bottom half of the top
decile (percentiles 90-95), the next 4% (percentiles 95-99), and the top 1%. Those estimates are
provided for years 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, and 2001.103
Scholz (2003) provides wealth shares for the top 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, and 0.5% for all survey
years available: 1962, 1983, 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, and 2001. Kennickell (2003) uses the nonpublic large SCF data which have a more observations at the very top and which are not included
102

The top .5% Smith series, however, can be compared more easily with the top .5% Lampman series for the
total population. See footnote above.
103
According to Kennickell, earlier surveys, 1962 and 1983 are not directly comparable due to substantial changes
in the surveying and weighting methodology.

54

in the publicly available SCF data used in Scholz (2003). This, however, seems to have only a
minor effect on the estimates as Kennickell’s and Scholz’ top wealth share estimates are very
close.
Wolff and Marley (1989) and Wolff (1994) provides top 1% household wealth shares based on
the previous estimates by Lampman and Smith from estate tax data and more recent estimates
from the SCF.

Appendix E.4

Computations Based on Forbes 400 Richest

Every late September since 1982, Forbes magazine has constructed a list of the richest 400
Americans, along with estimates of their net worth, age, and the main source of their wealth. It
is important to keep in mind that those wealth estimates are not exact measures of net worth as
some of those richest individuals may not be willing to cooperate with Forbes and reveal precisely
their net worth. It is also possible that some of the wealthiest (but not highly visible) Americans
have not been discovered and listed by Forbes.104 This problem was more acute in the early
years of the survey (especially the first year 1982).105 With the years and the incredible success
and publicity of the Forbes 400, most wealthy individuals provide voluntarily information to
Forbes and it is quite unlikely that a significant fraction of the wealthiest Americans has been
able or willing to escape the attention of Forbes magazine.
We report in columns (1) and (2) of Table C2, the total net worth of the Forbes 400 and the
average wealth of the Forbes 400 in 2000 dollars.
Because the total adult population has increased by almost 30% over the period, measuring
the share of total net worth of the Forbes 400, might be misleading. In order to provide estimates
robust to population growth, we have constructed series for the top .0002% and top .00005%
wealth shares from 1982 to 2002. We also provide the share of top .0002-.00005% which is
simply the difference of the two former shares. The top .0002% corresponds almost exactly
to the top 400 richest individuals, and the top .00005% to the top 100 richest individuals in
2000 (as there are 201.9 million adults in the population in 2000, see Table A). The top .0002.00005% corresponds to individuals ranked 101 to 400 in 2000. The shares are computed simply
by summing the net worth levels of the corresponding individuals on the Forbes list.106 For the
final years (2000, 2001, and 2002), the top .00005% corresponds to a few more individuals than
the top 400. In that case, we use the complementary list of near misses (those individuals who
almost made it to the Forbes 400) to compute our estimates.
The shares of those three groups are reported in columns (3), (4), (5), and the ratio of the
average wealth to the average wealth in the adult population is reported on columns (6), (7),
and (8) for each of these three groups. Finally, and for comparison purposes, the share of the top
.01% (top 20,000 individuals in 2000) estimated from estate tax returns is reported in column
(9).
104

For example, the SCF has found believable interviews of individuals with wealth above the Forbes 400
minimum but not included in the Forbes list (see Kennickell, 2003). Estate tax returns with net worth above the
Forbes 400 minimum have also been found by the IRS (see McCubbin, 1994).
105
This is why we do not reproduce very top wealth shares from the Forbes 400 for year 1982, the first year of
the survey, on Figure 12.
106
For example, if the top .00005% corresponds to the top 100.5 individuals, we sum the top 100 wealth levels
plus one-half of the wealth of the 101st individual.

Notes: Population estimates based on census data from Historical Statistics of the United States and the U.S. Statistical Abstract.
Population covered by tax returns is defined by the population represented, using the multiplier technique, by estate tax returns with net worth above the filing threshold.
Total wealth is defined as net worth of the personal sector excluding all future social security benefits and human wealth but including life insurance reserves.
Only the cash surrender value of pension reserves is included (such as vested defined contribution and 401(k) accounts).
The series is estimated from the Flow of Funds Accounts since 1945 and from several other sources before 1945. The series estimate average wealth during the
corresponding year (and not end of year estimates). Wealth composition column reports the percent shares of tangible assets (owner occupied real estate and tenant occupied
buildings with four units or less, consumer durables), fixed claim assets (cash and saving deposits, all bonds, mortgages), corporate equity, non-corporate equity (which includes
tenant occupied net real estate for buildings with more than 4 units), and life insurance reserves. Liabilities include all debts (mortgages and consumer credit).
Columns (5) to (10) add up to 100%. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) series is used to express all nominal values into real 2000 dollars.

Notes: Computations by authors based on estate tax return statistics. See Appendix Section D for details.
Series display the top of total net-worth accruing to each upper wealth group.
Series for Top 2-1% are estimated only for the 1946-2000 period because the tax return population does not cover that group in the pre-war period.

Figure A1
Ratio of the average mortality to the mortality of the wealthy
based on Rogot et. al. (1992)
Note: The graph is based on tables 1 and 7 in Rogot et al. (1992) and shows the ratios of death rates for white
individuals with family incomes above 25,000 and 50,000 of 1980 dollars to the corresponding death rates for the
whole population (Table 1). The annualized death rates for income-age categories are computed by multiplying the
annualized mortality rate for the age category by the ratio of actual and expected numbers of deaths in the income
categories (all of these numbers are reported in Table 7). Deaths in Rogot et al. (1992) are tabulated for age
categories of: 0-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+ and the corresponding values of age used
on the graph are 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90. The number of individuals and deaths in the $50,000+
categories is relatively small and the resulting age-pattern is considerably noisier.

Figure A5
The Top 1% Wealth Share: The Impact of Life Insurance
Note: The Series No Life Insurance excludes completely life insurance payments from the numerator. The series
Cash Surrender Value only includes only the cash surrender value of life insurance (as in all our series reported in
Table B1). The series Full Payout includes the full value of life insurance reported on estate tax returns. For all three
series, the denominator is the same and defined as in Table A, and includes life insurance reserves.
