December 1982
Life Insurance Savings and the After-Tax
Life Insurance Rate of Return

Abstract
This paper presents a calculation of the time series of the

after-tax rate of return to whole life insurancy. When compared to the
after—tax return on an alternative portfolio of similar risk, more than 60%
of the decline in life insurance savings (suitably defined) in the past two
decades can be attributed to a widening after-tax rate of return differential.

Both the existence and importance of this result depend on the

characteristics of life insurance savings. Life insurance saving is intimately connected to life insurance coverage and therefore is long—term and

quasi—contractual in nature. Furthermore (and, in part, because of the
above characteristics), the interest earned on the fixed income portfolio
of life insurance intermediaries has been taxed under a special set of

rules. From 1958 to 1981

,

these rules have taken the rather complicated

form of the Menge formula. This formula is very sensitive to changes in
nominal interest rate levels and in particular, during inflationary periods
it acts so as to dramatically increase the tax burden of life insurance
savings.

Life irsurance savings is therefore an example of the non-

neutrality of monetary policy. This is important for studies of flow of
funds and capital accumulation using the historical record.

LIFE INSURANCE SAVINGS AND THE AFTER-TAX
LIFE INSURANCE RATE OF RETURN

The relative place of life insurance in United States household
savings has declined since the mid 1950s and indeed this decline has acce—

lerated in recent years.1 Combined dth the phenemona of the increased use
of policy loans, the net savings flow through the life insurance intermediary
as a percentage of personal disposable income has been reduced.

Any explanation of the reasons for, and financial/non-financial
effects of this decline must, at least in part, depend on the peculiar

characteristics of life insurance savings. As will be explained in this
paper, life insurance savings are intimately connected with the provisions

of the permanent life insurance policy. Namely, it is a policy that provides life insurance coverage in addition to savings, is quasi—contractual
in nature and whose return is taxed (through the intermediary) under a

special set of rules known as the Menge formula. As a result of these
peculiarities, among possible reasons for the decrease in life insurance

are decreased demand for the life insurance coverage component of an indi-

vidual life insurance policy. Decreased insurance demand might be due to
sociological considerations such as smaller family size and the increased

economic independence of women, or to increased exogeneous insurance
protection in the form of group life insurance from employers, and survivors benefits from the Social Security Administration.

Alternatively,

the increased exogeneous provision of contractual savings in the form of
pensions aiid Social Security retirement benefits lessens the need for

savings of the type connected with the life insurance contract.

Finally,

any increase in the after tax rate of return differential between alternative endogenous savings vehicles and life insurance savings such as might
occur due to differential tax treatments (and in particular, as will be
explained, under the Menge formula in inflationary periods) can be a reason
for the decline in life insurance savings.
While there is an element of truth in all three explanations of
life insurance's relative decline, this paper exphasizes and explicitly

tests for the effect of differential taxation of life insurance savings.

There are two reasons for this choice. One is practicability. With a
proper understanding of the life insurance intermediary and its

taxation,

it is possible to specify the after-tax return on life insurance savings
and compare it to the returns on alternative forms of household savings.2

It is much more difficult to explicitly formulate and test models incor-

porating the first two explanations. The second reason is a judgment,
based in part on some casual empiricism and in part on econometric evidence
presented in the last part of the paper, that the trend and variability in

—2—

the after—tax rate differential explains the major share of the trend and

variability of the propensity to save through life insurance. An example
of casual empiricism debunking the decreased life insurance coverage demand
theory is the introduction (in 1965) and subsequent popularity of term
(pure) life insurance coverage policies.

The reasons for the decline in life insurance savings should have

more than parochial or academic interest. Shifts in savings patterns
affect the term structure of interest rates and the configuration of portfolios, thus indirectly and directly affecting the size and nature of capi-

tal formation. This has been shown to hold especially in the case of life

insurance savings.3 If life insurance savings has been subject to
increased (differential) taxation, there are further implications. Before—
tax long—term interest rates, ceterus paribus, should rise4, thereby
lowering optimal debt/equity ratios and capital formation.

Finally, if

increased (differential) taxation caused a reduction in life insurance
savings and if life insurance is the only endogeneous contractual

savings

contract available to households, then in addition to the above occurences,
there will have been a drop in the savings rate of the economy and therefore in the steady—state capital labor ratio.5

The magnitudes of these

effects, of course, depend on the relevant magnitudes of life insurance and
other savings flows.

as

Reasons for Life Insurance Savings

Along with commercial banks, life insurance companies were the
first financial intermediaries in the American economy.6 There were, no
doubt, many reasons why this form of intermediation occurred in the late

1800's and early 1900's, some of which may

still

exist today (see below).

Even if the positive economic reasons for life insurance savings no longer
exist, however, life insurance companies would continue to have an impor-

tant place in personal savings simply by virtue of their previous

existence. Thus if the industry is flexible in its reactions to economic
changes, and

is

not impeded by any competitive disadvantages imposed exter-

nally, there is sufficient reason to explain the phenomenon of savings
through life insurance by institutional factors alone.

Implicit in any

institutional explanation of nonatomization and status quo is the industrial organization theory of high initial start—up costs and scale eco-

nomies. These costs, in the case of financial intermediation, may

include

gaining a trustworthy reputation, forming consumer habits, necessary scale
economies in the assumption of financial risk, and scales in production of

inside financial information and transactions. The implication of this
non-specific approach is that explanations for variations, trends, and/or
structural changes in life insurance savings are the same as those for
changes in the economy-wide savings rate --

national

income (in a Keynesian

interpretation), after—tax interest rates (in a classical interpretation)
and other variables that come up in the life cycle—liquidity constraint
context.

Before mentioning the possible specific economic reasons for life
insurance savings it will be helpful to go over some of the particulars of

life insurance contracts. The following 2x2 matrix exhibits the four main
categories of policy contracts.

STATUS

A life insurance policy is a contract between the policyholder

and the life insurance company that entitles the holder to certain benefits
under certain life contingencies in exchange for a premium payment to the

company. Under a constant term life policy, the insurance company agrees
to pay a fixed amount (the face value of the policy) to the named benefi—
ciary upon the death of the insured, in exchange for payment of a premium

that increases with the age of the insured. The increases represent
increasing mortality probabilities. There are no other benefits and in

particular no cash value. A permanent life policy provides in addition to
death benefits, the lifetime benefit of a cash value.

In return for

—5—

payment of a usually constant premium, the insurance company agrees to pay

a fixed amount (the face value) to the named beneficiary upon the death of
the insured, to pay an accumulating cash value (less than the face value

until the policy's maturity) anytime the policyholder lapses the policy, or
to lend up to the accumulated cash value to the policyholder if the policy
remains in force and interest payments are paid at an interest rate as set

forth and fixed in the policy at the time of sale. The most fruitful way,
therefore, of looking at a permanent life policy is as a combination of an
accumulating savings account and a declining term life insurance contract.

Part of each premium pays for term insurance and part enters a savings

account. Since the cash value of the policy and the amount that corresponds to actual term life insurance always add up to the fixed face value,

as the amount in the savings account accumulates, the term component must

decline. Therefore, as a permanent policy ages, it becomes more and more a
savings account.

Still another categorization is used for life insurance

contracts, in a participating policy, the holder participates in improvements in the company's mortality experiences and interest income via

payments of dividends by the company. In a non—participating policy, the
implicit interest and mortality rates are fixed at the time of the policy
sale and no payments are ever made to reflect improvements in these rates.
Most permanent policies are participating.7

—6—

The close institutional connection between the term life insur-

ance ad savings components of a permanent life contract uggest several
positive economic reasons for savings through life insurance. Since term
life insurance premiums are paid annually (or even more frequently), from
the point of view of both policyholder and insurance

company, average

transaction costs can be reduced if a savings plan is tacked onto the life

insurance policy. More specifically, the policyholder economizes on time,
effort, and check clearance costs if he invests at the same time as he pays

his insurance premiums. The marginal costs for the insurance company of
initial bookkeeping record maintenance, and investing premium payments
(both direct brokerage costs and financial research-management fees) are

almost zero once a term life contract has been made. Therefore the life
insurance company can afford to (implicitly) charge less for its investment
sevices than other financial intermediaries and certainly less than direct

investment bonds with high commercial brokerage fees. This argument is
especially true for small investors.

A second reason for saving through life insurance is economic

self—control.8 In other words, permanent life insurance operates as the
life—cycle version of a Christmas Club. The features of a permanent life
policy ——

constant,

periodic required payments whose neglect results in the

cancellation of life insurance protection —— mesh well with
tistics of a forced life cycle savings plan ——

highly

the

charac—

regular installments

with a large penalty for disruption. While other long—term private savings
plans can be designed, any enforcement besides cancellation of a service

connected with the regular payment is probably illegal. In the case of

-7—
life insurance the penalty of temporary lapse of insurance protection is
augmented by the possibility that through the usual underwriting process,
subsequent life insurance will be impossible or more expensive to obtain.

There is also a further fianncial penalty for

early lapsation, as will be

mentioned below. Of course, it is possible to maintain life insurance
coverage, avoid lapsation and still disrupt the savings plan by borrowing

against one's cash value via a policy loan. There are no legal or other
restraints against doing so, and when interest rates are above the policy
loan rate, there are addi tional interest and tax arbitrage incentives to

such behavior. Such an occurrence has become more commonplace, but considering, for example, the rate differential between a 5% policy loan rate

and 15% yield on LU bonds in 1981, it is remarkable that such behavior is
not more widespread.9
The first two reasons for the relative attractiveness of saving
in a life insurance company- depend on the peculiar existence of the life

insurance component of the contract. It is also possible that the
existence of the savings component reduces the cost and ensures the existence of the pure life insurance coverage. It has been recognized that the
singular problem of competitive insurance markets is anti—selectjon.1O A

company may offer term insurance at the average mortality rate for a particular age—sex combination in the population, only to have low risk individuals avoid the purchase of insurance or drop it soon after purchase, and
high-risk individuals rush in to buy and maintain the favorably priced

policies. The result, of course, is that the insurance company will lose
money and there is a distinct possibility that the entire market will dis—

-8-

appear. The theoretical mechanism proposed to ensure an insurance equi—
librjum ——

the

simultaneous control of insurance price and quantities

allowed to be purchased ——

is

subject to two attacks, however.ll It is not

robust to all forms of strategic behavior and does not seem to be empiri-

cally founded. Rather, the real world devices of underwriting (thereby
removing the underlying informational asymmetry), high pressure sales,

group insurance and permanent insurance have arisen. It is relatively easy
to see why the device of high pressure sales helps alleviate the problem of

anti—selection. If insurance is "sold," instead of "bought," a more representative mortality sample is thereby assured. This is confirmed when it
is noted that those companies who most carefully underwrite their policies

have the lowest key "soft sell" sales teams.12 To

explain why permanent

insurance alleviates the problem of anti—selection, more background is

needed. Due to a large initial commission paid to the agent upon the sale
of a permanent policy and the savings with penalty nature of the plan,
legal and competitive conditions allow insurance companies to delay the
natural accumulation of cash value several years into the life of the

policy. In other words, a policyholder is severely penalized if he lapses

his permanent policy early in its lifetime. Thus permanent policyholders
are less likely than term policyholders to lapse their policies either
after a hard sale or after further information about one's om mortality

prospects becomes available. In this manner, anti-selection is avoided and
the existence of life insurance markets is ensured (at lower average cost).

—9—

It should be parenthetically remarked that life insurance savings

have a slight advantage over other forms of savings as a bequest. Since
1840, the law provides that the proceeds of a policy made out to a widow as
beneficia.y would be paid to her and are exempt from claims of creditors.
The implication of this highly specific approach is that short

of examining trends in relative transaction costs, the psychological
necessity for self—control, the existence of other forms of contractual

savings such as pensions, or the complicated issue of variation in mortality risk within demographic groups, the close connection between life
insurance savings and life insurance coverage indicates that explanations
for variations, trends and/or structural changes in life insurance savings
are the same as those for life insurance coverage demand. These variables
might include life insurance—in—force under Social Security, real income,

and sociological considerations such as number of children and their age
distribution, future prospects for the widow (or widower), extended family
structure, an& so on.

While both the non-specific and the above—mentioned specific
approaches to life insurance savings are interesting and appropriate, we

look at another aspect of the problem here. We investigate the after—tax
return to life insurance savings and compare it to the after-tax return on

a "home—made" bond fund of similar maturity and risk. This is a specific

approach that can be specified. Furthermore, if there are no other savings
instruments available in the economy that have the characteristics of a

quasi—forced savings plan with low transaction costs, it is clear that a
change in the third specific characteristic —— the after—tax interest rate

—10-

differential ——

will

result in a one-for—one corresponding change in the

savings rate.

There are three reasons why there would be an after-tax interest
rate differential between buying a permanent life insurance policy with
full expectations of keeping it in force and buying a series of long—term
bonds.
1)

The interest rate implicit in the life insurance policy differs
from that available in the long-term bond market.

By law and by

conservative business practice, life insurance companies them-

selves buy bonds for their portfolios. Therefore, any interest
rate difference as perceived by the prospective life insurance
investor must be due to the institutional practices of the life

insurance intermediary. In particular, when someone purchases a
life insurance policy, he receives the current average rate of
return on the company portfolio, and not the marginal rate of

return on new money. When market rates suddenly increase and the
average maturity of the company portfolio is fifteen years, a
small wedge appears between the return from purchasing the life
policy and paying premiums for the next twenty years and constructing one's own bond portfolio by periodic purchases over the

next twenty years. Furthermore, if the life insurance company is
constrained to earn below market rates on part of its portfolio
even in the future (for example, on policy loans), the wedge is
enlarged.

—1 •1 —

2)

The interest rate differential may also be due to differences in

costs. While we mentioned several reasons why transaction costs
might be lower for life insurance, there are other costs to con-

sider. In particular, sales agents receive a large initial sales
commission and smaller renewal commissions for the life of the
policy, as long as they work for or are vested with the life
insurance company.
3)

Finally, an after—tax interest rate differential might appear if

the two forms of investment are taxed differently. Interest
income on directly held bonds is taxed under the individual

income tax. Interest income on life insurance is exclusively
taxed through the company under the federal life insurance
company income tax acts (we study the 1952 and 1959 Acts) and
state premium

taxes.

It is not surprising that there should be

a difference arising from these different forms of tax treat-

ments. In fact, the difference is large and has changed
dramatically over time.

2. Sone Actuarial Mathematics
Our goal is a variable defined as the after—tax interest differential between paying premiwns on a permanent life insurance policy for
twenty years and. similar investment in a AAA long—term bond fund. We
introduce some actuarial notation that will be helpful in approaching the

life insurance rate of return computation. The standard references for
actuarial mathematics are Kellison (1970) and Jordan (1975).

Therefore, if the "life insurable" (adults with families) population is

positive function of income, then the total real change in insurance

savings)

would be

where in is the differential growth rate between the life insurable popula-.

tion and the income producing population, and a is the life insurance

savings rate. If all life insurance were term

insurance,

then a would be

zero.

In this paper, c, the current after—tax life insurance rate of
return is calculated based on Imowledge of the current average earnings
rate on investments as reported to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (NAIC) and the federal tax law in effect.

It is hypothesized

that a is a behavioral function of the after—tax interest rate differen-

tials mentioned above. In other words, net premiums paid for permanent
life insurance, depend on alternative after—tax yields. (Life insurance is
assumed actuarially fair and in

is

assumed constant.) The rate differen-

tial, which is really the heart of the paper, derives from the

pcted

after—tax level effective life insurance return, as computed below, and the
expected after—tax level effective long—term bond return, also computed
below.

3. A History of Life Insurance Company Taxation
Even though our study starts in the 1950's, it will be useful to

review the trends in life insurance company taxation from 1921 forward.

The account here derives from Valenti (1957). The main issues that legislators have had to deal with are whether life insurance is a service (and
thus should be taxed like other businesses) or a savings institution (and

therefore should be taxed similar to banks), whether mutual (participating)
life insurance companies are profit making ventures or not, how to deal
with for—profit stock (non—participating) companies, how to tax the income
from new life insurance company products (e.g. pensions, health insurance,
term life), and how to recognize the long—run nature of the business. From
1921 to 1941, the "free investment income" tax approach was used. The

assumptions were that there could be no true

underwriting

income since, in

the aggregate, from any group of policies the premiums collected would
actuarially be sufficient Only to meet loading costs (administrative and
acquisition costs) and present and future claims under this group of pol-

icies. (Correct actuarial procedures and either competitive pricing or
fair participating dividends are assumed.) The only taxable income was
investment income after deduction of i) investment expenses and 2) additions to policy reserves of interest earnings on such reserves. The inter-

est income deductible was 4% applied to the mean of the reserve amounts for
the years 1921 to 1931 and 3—3/4% for 1931 to 1941.

Any interest earned

above that amount was taxed at regular corporate tax rates. This formula
eliminated underwriting profits completely, as was reasonable when most

life insurance companies were participating. In point of fact almost no

-18-

federal taxes were paid throughout this period due to a retroactive legal
ruling in 1928 and low market interest rates for the rest of the period.
The "industry ratio" method was used in the tax formulas applic-

able to the years 1942 through 1957. Under this method, the allowance for
interest requirements was computed as the product of the company's net
investment income (excluding tax-exempt interest) and a percentage either
fixed by statute (as in 1951 through 1957) or determined according to a
formula specified in the law (the "Secretary's ratio" for 1942—1950). The

Secretary's ratio increased slowly from 92% in 1943 to 96% in 1946, but
then suddenly it rose to over 100% in 1947 and 1948; i.e. life insurance
companies paid no federal tax for the years 1947 and 1948.

Although the

1942 formula remained on the books as the "permanent" tax formula through
1957, it was superseded on a year to year basis after 1948 by various stop-

gap measures. In the formula applicable to the years 1951 through 1957,
the allowance for interest requirements permitted each company was, in
effect, 87—1/2% of its investment income.

In 1958 and continuing until 1982, a new, more complicated,

method of taxation was adopted. It is basically an "adjusted reserve"
method. The adjusted reserve is determined by adjusting the company's
total reserves to the amount of reserves which would have been held using
the interest rate on which the statutory credit for reserve interest is to
be based (while retaining the use of the mortality and morbidity tables

actually employed by the company). Thus, if the statutory credit is based
on the assumption that, on the average, 3% reserves are being held, each
company would compute its credit as the product of (i) 3% and (ii) the

—19—

amount of reserves it would have held if all of its reserves had been based

on a 3% interest assumption. By providing for this sort of adjustment of
reserves before the application of the interest deduction rate, the
"adjusted reserve" method corrects one of the principal deficiencies of the

"free interest" method: the defect that companies with otherwise similar
operations might pay significantly different amounts of tax solely because
of differences in the average reserve interest

rates employed. In particu—

lar, it eliminated the differential tax treatment of

participating (low

reserve interest rate) and non—participating (higher reserve interest rate)
permanent policies.

Obviously, if the "adjusted reserve" method were to be applied on
an exact basis, a company would have to make one valuation for annual
statement purposes and another for federal income tax purposes. There is,

however, an actuarial rule of thumb which can be used in approximating
changes in reserves arising from changes in the assumed interest rate.
This rule provides that for typical distributions of life insurance poli-

cies by plan, age at issue, and policy year, an increase (decrease) of 1%
in the reserve interest rate will result. in a decrease (increase) of 10% in

the amount of the reserve. Under this rule, known as the "ten—for—one" or
"Nenge" rule, if the average required interest rate for a company's
reserves is 2-1/2%, for example, the amount of reserves which would have
been held on a 3% interest assumption can be approximated by multiplying
the reserves actually held by 95% (100% minus 1/2 of 10%). For small differences in interest rates, the condition prevailing in the 1950's, the

rule works well. As the difference increases, the approximation becomes

—20—

less and less accurate. For large differences the poor approximation can
result in a very heavy tax assessment. This certainly occurred in the
1970's since the interest rate used under the "adjusted reserve" method is
defined as a function of the individual company's

interest earnings rate,

which increased dramatically from the interest used in the original reserve
calculations.

—21—

4. The 1959 Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act
A mathematical representation of the 1959 tax law was first given

by Fraser (1962). The main results are reproduced here. Tinder the law, a
tax at the regular corporate rates is imposed on the company's "life insur-

ance company taxable income." This taxable income is the sum of three
parts, called phases in the law, as. follows:

i) mm

[T,G]

ii) 1/2 (G—T) < o

iii)W
T is the Taxable Investment Income

C is the Gain from Operations, and
W is the Amount Withdrawn from the Policyholders' Surplus Account.
T is basically computed under the "adjusted reserve" approach.

In regard to C, the aggregate deductions for dividends to policyholders and
for certain other items have been limited to $250,000 plus the excess, if
any, of the Gain from Operations C (before taking account of these deductions) over the Taxable Investment Income T (i.e. the underwriting gain,
T + U — $250,000.
U), C
Thus, under the 1959 law, a mutual company generally is not able, by increasing the amount of dividends paid to policyholders, to reduce its taxable income below Taxable Investment Income minus

$250,000. For most mutual companies, therefore, the "life insurance company taxable income" will, under present conditions (i.e. reasonable dividends), be equal to the T - $250,000.

For a stock company, 1/2(G-T) <

0,

is also taxed, and the other half is added to the policyholders' Surplus

—22—

Account. Additions to

the, Surplus

levied. Furthermore, we will only investigate Phase 1 taxation, since only
nominal amounts of interest income are taxed under Phase 2.

It will be recognized that

this reserve adjustment represents an approximate adjustment based on the
"Menge"

rule.
The tax

function is homogeneous in the first degree, aside from

the constant statutory deductions and limitations.

Therefore, a company

that is, say, exactly twice the size of another company in the same tax
situation will pay exactly twice the tax (except to the extent of the tax
effects attributable to the constant statutory deductions and limitations).
This is a fortunate result; it means that we can aggregate over different
size companies without having to know the size distribution of companies to
compute the effective after—tax life insurance return.

Formulas for Current and Expected Future
Life Insurance Rates of Return

Under the following assumptions T, taxable investment income,
simplifies.

a) The company correctly assigns interest and tax liability to
its pension and non—pension accounts.

Therefore, we can ignore P

in the formula.

b) The company does not invest in tax—exempt securities. Until
recently, it would not have done so, since the marginal after-tax
return from taxed securities was higher than the marginal after-

tax return from tax—exempt securities. (This is due to a quirk
in the law, as can be shown.)

c) S and K can be ignored.

d) I =

i(v+)

=

iA.

Assets defined in the 1959 law include

assets resulting from surplus funds and other life insurance com-

pany obligations, such as incurred expenses, mandatory reserves
for fluctuations in security values and insurance premiums paid

in advance. These assets are denoted by .

The ratio V/V+ is

assumed to be constant throughout the period studied at .85.
This assumption is supported by examining the life insurance
industry balance sheet.

—26—

e) t is the corporate tax rate. Therefore

T =

t[iA(1.x

that is an increase in interest rates, has at the margin and under reason—
able conditions, a much less than one for one proportional increase in the
current life insurance rate of return.

We have found the i to be used in the construction of the depen-

-27-

dent variable. It is possible to proceed from here to the construction of
i, the expected level after-tax life insurance rate of return on a policy

held for twenty years, or 80 quarters.l3 The approach taken is to solve for
implicit

that satisfies S

80

= bT, where bT has been calculated by

1

algorithm. This is done numerically, as an explicit analytical solution of
an 80—degree polynomial is imposible. It is done for every quarter
(denoted T) from 1952:1 to 1982:2, based on the interest and tax rates then
prevailing and expected to prevail.14

It is probably easiest to write out the algorithm explicitly and
explain the assumptions afterwards.

We start our explanation with equation (1), building the struc-

been a drag on the ability of life insurance companies to get new market

rates. Equation (2) exhibits the fact that the life insurance policyholder
receives the average rate of return and therefore can expect to receive

market (marginal) rates, i, only after some time. The specific assumptions imbedded here are that the portfolio turns over (on average) every

fifteen years and is growing 1.3% per quarter. The securities retired in

Equation (3) is self—explanatory and is necessary because of the

tax formula. Equation (4) lists other expenses specific to life insurance.
The first number in the Et sum represents the sales agent's commission on

premium paid for the tth quarter after policy purchase. These are New York
State legal maximums and they haven't changed over the period being inves-

tigated. .022 is the average state premium tax. This figure has also been
steady over time. It should be noted that these percentages of premiums
paid are absolutely large, and in periods of low interest rates, relatively

large also. Equation ()

is

self—explanatory in light of the "Menge" for—

mula and represents the after—tax, after—expense expected rate of return t

quarters after T. The form of expenses subtracted was chosen for analytical convenience. It basically says that a declining proportion of expenses
is subtracted from total interest earned on an individual's life insurance

account. While not technically correct, the correct formulation (adding

still another subscript on i to distinguish between positive commissions
and state tax expenses subtracted from interest on new money and zero

—3 1—

expenses
to

subtracted from interest on old money) would have been impossible

There is, therefore, econometric support for the original contention that
the tax treatment of life insurance savings (in an inflationary environment) has been a significant determinant of the amount saved.

There are several caveats to this empirical work. The problem of simultaneity bias presumably lurks in the regressions. A proper specification of
interest rate determination, such as might occur in a simultaneous
equations flow—of-funds model with due consideration of taxes would solve

that problem. The assumption of a constant personal tax rate is a weak one
and ultimately should be replaced. This improvement, however, would likely
support our results since marginal tax rates were very high in the 1950's

and recent inflationary increases in personal tax rates in no way cancel the

after-tax rate differential reported here. Indeed, improved specification
would probably be enough to include the 1952:1 to 19584 period in the
regressions. Further research on these points would seem desirable.

—36—

Conclusion
The main substantive results have already been stated in the

introduction. One methodological point, however, has yet to be stated. As
is emphasized in Feldstein (1982), a well specified fiscal framework is

necessary for a complete analysis of monetary policy. Increases in the
inflation rate are clearly not neutral in the case of life insurance
savings due to tax considerations and it is reasonable to expect that similar non—neutralities induced by taxes exist.

This is not logically sur-

prising, because as in the history of life insurance taxation, there is a
close connection between an industry's tax mechanism and its institutional
characteristics and structure.

Footnotes

1. See Friedman (1980) for a discussion of these and related changes in
post—war American financial markets.

2. Other studies of life insurance savings flows either assume that the
flows are exogenous (Hendershott, 1911) or depend simply on the private
placement yield (Cuirmiins, 1915).

3. This is because life insurance companies mainly invest in long—term

corporate bonds and mortgages. See Friedman (1982).
4.

See Feldstein (1918a) for a general model.

5. For interesting (and different) macroeconomic implications of life
insurance savings flows see Geren (1913) and Feldstein (1982).
6.

See Keller (1963) for a detailed history of the early industry.

7. This institutional review is taken from Warshawsky (1982).
8.

Thaler

and Shefrin (1981) give a rigorous treatment of the idea. It is

also connected to issues of the investor's horizon and holding period.
See also Feldstein (1918b).

9. Warshaws1r (1982) develops a model of policy loan demand where self—
control is implicitly assumed to be the behavioral background.
10.

Rothschild

and Stiglitz (1916) introduced the problem into the litera-

ture.

11. The existence of equilibrium under different behavioral assumptions in
a continuous parameter model is discussed in Riley (1979).
12. This is a personal observation.

—38—

13. The twenty year average persistency was computed as follows:
140

1/140 ST =

20.5.

I.e. the lapse rates are uniform throughout the

hypothetical range of forty years. In 1911—12, the empirical average
persistency was closer to fifteen years.
114. The year 1951 is included even though the tax law only applied to 1958

and beyond. Since the computation involves future interest rate expectations, it is reasonable to also make an assumption regarding expec-

tations of the future tax law. It was known as early as middle 1956 that
the Treasury Department was proposing an increase in life insurance

company taxation. It is assumed that this information was widespread
and furthermore that some knowledgeable guesses could have been made
about the form of the new law.
15. The assumption of 1.3% quarterly growth in reserves derives from a

regression of log V on time. It therefore implicitly includes interest
earned and reinvested. The 1.3% figure is also relatively steady for
the period studied.

16. In defining the dependent variable, T obviously must be the quarterly
(and not annual) interest earned. This is because we are investigating
quarterly increases (decreases) in life insurance savings flows and

using quarterly reserve numbers. Furthermore, T is computed using
actual interest rates and tax laws, not expected ones. Therefore, the
1959 law applies only back to 1958, and not 1957, as it does for i.
