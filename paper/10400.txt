The Institutions of Monetary Policy
Mervyn King
NBER Working Paper No. 10400
March 2004
JEL No. E0, G0, H0
ABSTRACT
I argue that it is useful to think about the optimal design of monetary institutions using the insights
from the theory of incomplete contracts. The core of the monetary policy problem is the uncertainty
about future social decisions resulting from the impossibility and the undesirability of committing
our successors to any given monetary policy strategy. The impossibility stems from the observation
that collective decisions cannot be enforced so that it is impossible to commit to future collective
decisions. The undesirability reflects the fact that we cannot articulate all possible future states of
the world. Monetary institutions expand the possibility frontier of the technology of collective
decisions by raising the costs of making inefficient deviationsng from pre-announced paths.
Institutions also become repositories of experience and knowledge to facilitate learning about the
economic environment and communication to society as a whole. I illustrate the importance of
institutional design for the operation of monetary policy by reference to three case studies: the
collapse of exchange rate regimes in Brazil and the United Kingdom; currency arrangements in Iraq
and their reform after the 2003 war; and the relationship between central banks and governments
when the zero constraint on nominal interest rates is binding.
