Factor Prices and Factor Substitution in U.S. Firms' Manufacturing Affiliates Abroad

NBER Working Paper No. 10442
April 2004, Revised July 2007
JEL No. F23,J23
ABSTRACT
Using confidential individual firm data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis survey of U.S. firms'
manufacturing operations abroad, we investigate the determinants of capital intensity in affiliate operations.
Host country labor cost, the scale of host country production, and the capital intensity of the parent
firm's production in the United States, are all significant influences. The parent's capital intensity is
the strongest and most consistent determinant of affiliate capital intensity. Affiliates that export are
more sensitive to these factors in their choice of factor proportions than affiliates that sell only in their
host countries.

Introduction
U.S. manufacturing multinationals employed over a third of their labor force in countries
outside the United States in 2004 (Mataloni and Yorgason, 2006, p. 57). What distinguishes the
parts of their operations that they place in foreign countries? The supposed rise in the
fragmentation of production presumably permits firms to match parts of their production that
they wish to keep under their control to the factor prices of individual locations. They might do
this either by selecting among parts of their output or by adapting production methods to
different factor prices in different locations. One well-documented fact is that U.S.
multinationals’ operations in developing countries are much more labor-intensive than those in
developed countries, and those, in turn, are more labor-intensive than U.S. parent firms’
domestic operations. Do the multinationals simply shift their more labor-intensive operations
abroad, or do they take advantage of lower labor costs to produce their range of output in a more
labor-intensive fashion where labor is relatively cheap?
While the main differences in the factor intensity of production in different countries are
clear in the aggregate data, it has been impossible to measure the extent and nature of choice of
activities or adaptation of methods of production in a comprehensive way within detailed
industries, within individual countries, or particularly within individual firms. The reason is that
there are no publicly available data that link individual affiliates outside the United States to their
own parents. The main contribution of this paper is to use the unique matched data from the
foreign investment survey of the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of
Commerce to observe the size and nature of adaptations to foreign factor prices and other foreign
market conditions. Another is to examine how the choice of factor proportions is related to the
use of foreign affiliates to export to other markets.

2

One possible explanation for differences in capital intensity is that the multinationals
(MNCs) produce the same things everywhere, but adapt to differences in wage levels by using
more labor and less capital in production where labor is cheap. Another possibility is that multiindustry firms do not produce the same things everywhere, but put their production in laborintensive industries in developing countries and their production in capital-intensive industries at
home or in developed countries. A third possibility is that affiliates of different firms, with
different technologies at home, produce with different capital intensities abroad. Perhaps, firms
that use labor-intensive technologies at home in the United States place affiliates in developing
countries, where labor is cheap, and firms that use capital-intensive technologies at home place
affiliates in developed, or higher-wage countries. A fourth possibility is that affiliates in small
markets, typically in developing countries, produce on a small scale, not suited to capitalintensive production techniques, while affiliates in countries with large markets, more likely
developed countries or countries with more open trade regimes, produce on a large scale that
lends itself to capital-intensive production methods.
It has been difficult for researchers to figure out what determines these affiliate capital
intensities, because the data for individual parent firms and their affiliates have not been publicly
accessible. For this paper, we were able to obtain access to data for individual U.S. parent firms
and their affiliates from the 1999 Benchmark Survey of the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA), and can therefore dissect the relationship between parent and affiliate capital intensities
into several elements.
Earlier studies
During the 1970s, the extent of adaptation by multinational firms was discussed in the
development literature in connection with the fear that multinationals often used “inappropriate”

3

technology in their developing country production. They did this supposedly out of ignorance of
labor-intensive techniques, because their experience was gathered in developed countries, or
because adapting technologies was too expensive. As a result, their entry into a developing
country failed to make optimum use of the country’s abundant labor resources, particularly
unskilled labor.
Among the studies at the time, Cohen (1975) found no adaptation in the production of
integrated circuits, where highly automated techniques were used, even in poor countries.
Courtney and Leipziger (1975) found that there were differences in factor intensity between U.S.
affiliates in developing countries in some industries, but that in half the cases, it was those in
developing countries that used the more capital-intensive techniques. Morley and Smith (1974)
found in Brazil that there were large differences between capital intensities in affiliates there and
those in the parent companies at home, but attributed them mainly to differences in scale rather
than to differences in wage costs. Lipsey, Kravis, and Roldan (1982) examined U.S. and
Swedish multinational operations across countries, using individual firm data, and reported
responses of capital intensities to both wage levels and scales of production. Small scale
production and low wage levels were associated with high labor intensity. The differences in
labor intensities among U.S.-owned affiliates could have resulted from either differences in
industry mix among affiliates of a firm or from adaptation within industries. The two could not
be distinguished well because the industry categories were broad. However, the Swedish data
showed strong responses within the more detailed industries in their data.
A study of multinationals in Taiwan’s electronics industry (Chen, 1992) found that
multinationals’ affiliates did adapt to the local environment and adapted increasingly over time,
substituting less-skilled for more skilled labor and increasing the share of value added within

4

Taiwan. Exporting affiliates adjusted their technology more quickly than firms catering to local
markets.
More recent studies have been fostered by the interest in the “fragmentation” of
production and the greatly increased competition among countries for segments of fragmented
production, or roles in multinational firms’ international production networks. “Inexpensive
labor” was cited by Japanese firms as a strong point in favor of many Asian nations in Japanese
firms’ location decisions, in a survey quoted by Kimura and Ando (2006, p. 95), although the
possibility of changing factor proportions is not mentioned. Tran Van Tho (2006), in the same
volume, relates the export propensities of foreign-owned firms in Viet Nam to their capital
intensities and found that there was a strong negative relationship, reflecting Vietnam’s
comparative advantage (pp. 402-403).
Much of the literature on fragmentation refers to international trade in intermediate
goods, but not specifically to intrafirm trade. The same differences in factor prices are at work,
but not the choices of factor proportions by a single decision maker (see, for example, Helg and
Tajoli, 2005). Data on intrafirm trade are difficult to obtain, except for the United States. A
study of intrafirm shipments of intermediate inputs between U.S. parent companies and their
affiliates related the propensity of affiliates to source such inputs from their parents to
characteristics of parents and affiliates, and suggested a division of labor that placed higherskilled activities with parents and lower –skilled activities with the affiliates (Borga and Zeile,
2004).
Data
The data we use are from the 1999 Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad,
conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The

5

survey, answers to which are compulsory, asks each parent firm questions about its own
operations and those of each of its affiliates, including primary industry, employment, labor
compensation, fixed capital, sales, and many other topics. The industry is the detailed NAICS
industry, of which there are almost 100 in manufacturing. The wage level faced by an affiliate in
a country is the average wage per hour for production workers paid by affiliates in the same
NAICS industry in the same country. The assumption implied is that affiliates in the same
industry probably hire workers similar to those the affiliate is hiring.
Affiliate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses denominated in a foreign currency
must be translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, specifically FASB Statement 52. Under FASB 52, revenue and expense items, such
as sales and labor compensation, are translated into U.S. dollars using a weighted exchange rate
for the period. Assets and liabilities are translated by end-of-period exchange rates. The capital
input measure is the net stock of plant and equipment. Since an exchange rate conversion is
used, we are, in effect, assuming that a multinational firm buys capital equipment in a worldwide
market rather than for each affiliate in its own host-country market, possibly a non-existent local
market in the case of at least some developing countries. Scale of production is measured by
gross product minus operating profits. Profits are excluded because they are volatile, sometimes
negative, and sometimes their inclusion produces negative gross product measures, not a good
measure of scale of operations.
Affiliate Capital Intensities
Part of the story we are trying to understand better can be summarized in Table 1. The
average net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) per worker in manufacturing parent
operations in the United States was about $106,000, while it was $57,000 in majority-owned

nonbank affiliates of these parents in all industries in developing countries. Even within the 13
broad industries shown in Table 1, there were large differences, and although there were a couple
of industries in which the capital/labor ratios in affiliates were similar to those of the parents, and
even one where the affiliates were more capital intensive, the parents were twice as capital
intensive or more in seven of the industries. The differences between affiliates in developed
countries and those in developing countries were also large. For manufacturing affiliates alone,
the capital intensity in developed countries averaged $75,000 and that in developing countries,
$40,000.
That large difference in capital intensities between affiliates in developed and developing
countries is peculiar to manufacturing. In other industries, capital intensities of affiliates in
developing countries were higher than those in developed countries in the aggregate. What
cannot be discerned in aggregate data such as these is what determines these differences in
capital intensity in manufacturing industries. The individual firm data can help us to discover
that.
Determinants of Differences in Capital Intensities
U.S. firms operating abroad could respond in many different ways to the fact that wage
rates and market sizes differ enormously among potential host countries and that parent firms
differ greatly in capital intensity. Firms could produce abroad the same products they produce at
home, and with essentially the same technology, but altering factor proportions by using more
labor input relative to capital input to take advantage of the lower wages in some countries. We
test that possibility by comparing the capital/labor ratios in low-wage and high-wage countries
and at home in the narrowly defined main industry of the parent. Firm might also find, even if
they do not alter factor use in response to wage costs, that capital-intensive methods of

8

production require larger volumes of production than labor-intensive methods. They would,
therefore use more labor-intensive methods in markets where the scale of production was low.
Even within the same narrowly defined industry, there are U.S. firms using more capitalintensive production methods at home and firms using less capital-intensive methods. A possible
explanation for differences in affiliate capital intensities might be that affiliates of capitalintensive firms bring capital –intensive technologies to host countries, while affiliates of laborintensive parent firms carry labor-intensive technologies. Even if each firm’s affiliates in its
parent’s industry produced with the same capital/labor ratios everywhere, affiliates of capitalintensive firms might tend to gravitate to high-wage countries, while affiliates of labor-intensive
parent firms might gravitate to low-wage countries. In that case, differences in parent capital
intensity would help to explain the apparent response of affiliate capital intensities to country
wage levels. Still another type of adjustment to wage levels could be associated with the fact
that most parents own affiliates in manufacturing industries other than the main industries of the
parents. In that case, firms might adapt to wage level differences by placing affiliates in laborintensive industries in low-wage countries and affiliates in high-wage industries in high-wage
countries.
Several determinants of affiliate capital intensities are tested in Table 2, across all
affiliate locations. If we fit log equations to the data and make the necessary assumptions about
the nature of the production functions,1 we can calculate elasticities of substitution between
capital and labor (Table 2). Across all affiliate locations, the elasticity is 30 percent for affiliates
in the parents’ main industries in manufacturing as a whole. The industry elasticity coefficients
1

It must be assumed that the production functions have a constant elasticity of substitution

between factors and that capital costs do not differ among countries.

that are significant at the 1 per cent level or better, covering 9 of the 13 industries, are higher,
with one exception, ranging from 29 to 55 per cent. Larger scale is also associated with higher
capital intensity, overall and in most of the individual manufacturing industry groups. Parent
capital intensity is significant in almost all industries, with elasticities indicating that a parent
capital intensity higher by 10 per cent is associated with an affiliate capital intensity higher by 6
to 8 per cent in most industries. Parent capital intensity is the dominant influence on the capital
intensities of affiliates, significant in almost every industry group.
In Table 3, the capital intensities of the affiliates are calculated relative to those of each
affiliate’s parent firm in the United States. The degree to which these ratios are explained is
much smaller than the degree to which the affiliate capital intensities are explained in Table 2, 7
per cent as compared with 24 per cent. In other words, about three quarters of the variance in
affiliate capital intensities is explained by the capital intensities of the parent firms. The
technology or product mix of the parent mostly determines the capital intensity of the affiliate.
However, there is still strong evidence that adaptation to local conditions affects how
affiliates produce. In most industry groups, and in manufacturing as a whole, labor is used more
intensively in production where wages are low. And in about half of the industry groups, and in
manufacturing as a whole, labor is used more intensively where the scale of production is
smaller.
Since parent capital intensity is such a strong determinant of affiliate capital intensity, an
additional method of adaptation to local conditions would be if high capital intensity parents
tended to place affiliates in high-wage countries and low capital intensity parents concentrated
theirs in low-wage countries. That possibility is tested in Table 4 where parent capital intensity
is related to average host-country per capita income. The idea that part of the adaptation to low

wages is for capital intensive parents to place affiliates in high-wage countries and laborintensive parents to place theirs in low-wage countries is firmly refuted by these results.
Although the relationship is not strong, and in many industry groups not significant, where it is
significant it indicates that, on average, capital intensive parents tend to operate not in high-wage
countries but in low-wage countries. And labor-intensive parents appear to locate in high-wage
countries. The selection of locations for affiliates to match the factor intensities of the parents
does not at all explain the low capital intensities of affiliates in low-wage countries.
Differences in the price of labor and the scale of production may be only two out of many
determinants of affiliate factor proportions in a host country. To test whether there are other
country determinants of factor proportions, we add country dummies to the equations of Table 2
and show the all-industry and major sector equations in Table 5. Many of the labor price
coefficients disappear and the labor price coefficient for all industries shrinks, but it remains
statistically significant. The scale coefficients are much less affected, and the parent capital
intensity coefficients hardly at all. The degree of explanation is improved slightly. Thus, given
all the characteristics of a location, large scale of operations and high capital intensity in the
parent both promote high capital intensity in production. Across all industries, high wages in a
country lead to more capital-intensive production. In individual industry groups, the wage effect
is incorporated into the country dummies, along with some other country influences.
Since we have linked parent and affiliate data, we can examine the choices made by
individual parents by including parent dummy variables in the regressions. That procedure
removes all the idiosyncratic elements of the parent, including its factor proportions, to reveal
how individual parents respond to local factor prices. On the whole, the individual parent
response to factor prices is the same as the aggregate response reported in Table 2. For an

individual parent, high wage levels in a country and larger affiliate scale promote the
establishment or operation of relatively capital-intensive operations (Table 6). A similar
equation for affiliates in developing countries explained even more of the variation in capital
intensities, but scale is less important. Presumably, the parent dummies, representing, among
other influences, parent capital intensity, are more important (Table 7).
The behavior of individual parents is highlighted by the relationship of affiliate to parent
capital intensity. For manufacturing as a whole and for most of the manufacturing groups, for
any given parent, higher affiliate country capital intensities result from higher wages and larger
scale production (Table 8). Among affiliates in developing countries, about a third of the
variance in capital intensities relative to the parent is explained, as compared with half across all
countries, and fewer individual industries are well enough explained to have statistically
significant coefficients, but the main outlines are similar. One reason for the weaker results is
that there are few affiliates to compare across parents in some industries in developing countries
(Table 9).
Export orientation and affiliate capital intensity response to labor cost
It might be expected that an affiliate competing in world markets would be more sensitive
to producing in a way that minimizes costs than one selling only in a host country market,
especially if it is a protected market. Affiliates established to serve local markets may be more
affected by factors such as local market size or per capita income, especially if host country trade
regimes do not encourage production for wider markets.
To examine this possibility, we divided the affiliates into two groups, those that exported
and those that did not. We fitted an equation like those of Table 2, separating the effect of the

host country price of labor from that of parent capital intensity (the dependent variable is the log
of affiliate capital intensity) (Table 10).
For affiliates in the same industry as their parent, across all countries, the capital
intensities in the exporting affiliates respond more strongly to the price of labor and parent
capital intensity than those in non- exporting affiliates, and much more of the variance in capital
intensities is explained. When the analysis is confined to the much smaller group of affiliates in
developing countries, the elasticity of the response to the price of labor is twice as high in the
exporting affiliates.
There are several ways to explain these results. One is that affiliates with factor
proportions unsuitable to their environments (e.g., capital-intensive in low-wage countries, or
labor-intensive in high-wage countries) are high-cost producers for their countries and therefore
unable to compete in world markets. Another interpretation would be that in open, tradeoriented economies, affiliates must adapt to local conditions in order to export, but that in closed
economies, firms face less competitive markets and do not need to undertake the costs of
adaptation of their production methods to survive.
What determines whether a firm will be an exporter or a non-exporter? Table 11
represents an attempt to relate the probability of being an exporter to affiliate scale and
deviations of its capital intensity from that predicted from labor costs, scale of operations, and
parent capital intensity, called the Residual. For manufacturing as a whole, across all countries,
and for developing countries, the residual, indicating higher capital intensity than expected, was
a positive influence, but it was a statistically significant influence only in Chemicals. Scale of
operations, on the other hand, was a significant positive influence overall and in every industry

group but one. These results were mirrored in the equations for developing countries, although
only four industries provided enough observations for the analysis.
Conclusions
Affiliates of U.S. MNCs carry their parents’ technology with them when they produce
abroad, in the sense that affiliates of relatively capital intensive parents produce in a relatively
capital intensive manner wherever they are located. U.S.MNCs adapt to low wage production
locations by producing in a more labor intensive manner than in high-wage locations. They
adapt to small scales of production by producing in a more labor-intensive way than in larger
operations.
Capital-intensive U.S. parent firms do not tend to concentrate their affiliate production in
relatively high-wage locations. There is no such concentration that would help to explain the
relationship between high wages and capital-intensive affiliate production.
Equations with country dummy variables show that even within individual countries,
parent capital intensity strongly affects affiliate capital intensity: more capital-intensive parents
own more capital-intensive affiliates. Larger scale of operations is associated with higher capital
intensity overall and in about half the industries.
Equations with parent firm dummy variables show that an individual firm adapts to low
labor costs by producing in a more labor-intensive way and responds to operating at a larger
scale by operating in a more capital-intensive manner.
Affiliates that export are more responsive in their factor proportions to the price of labor
than affiliates that sell only in their host countries. The responsiveness to labor cost is
particularly strong among affiliates in developing host countries. But scale of operations is not a
significant influence on capital intensity among exporting affiliates in developing countries. The

24

greater responsiveness of exporting firms echoes the findings of Chen’s (1992) study of
electronics affiliates in Taiwan, which found that export-oriented affiliates adjusted their
technology faster than domestically-oriented firms, because “…competitive pressure in the
international market forces firms to tighten up on managerial slack and to move quickly toward
more efficient use of primary factors, including taking advantage of cheap unskilled labor,”
while “…a more permissive domestic market enables multinationals to make only sluggish
adaptations…”
The probability of being an exporter is somewhat related to operating with higher than
usual capital intensity, especially in the Chemical industry. However, the most consistent
determinant of being an exporter is the scale of operations. Larger scale is strongly associated
with higher likelihood of being an exporter, across all industries and within almost all industry
groups. The causation could run the other way. The ability of an affiliate to export might
warrant a larger scale of production.
