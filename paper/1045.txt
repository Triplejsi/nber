I. INTRODUCTION

This paper argues that the structure of

long—term employment contracts

is influenced by the possibility that at least four different kinds of

opportunistic behavior, or "malfeasance,' may occur in them. While the
consequences of some of these problems have been examined in various papers,
no single model has yet treated all four and thus brought out their

essential symmetry. In particular, a certain kind of malfeasance by firms
has apparently been universally overlooked —— an oversight we try to remedy

by developing a simple model here. Other advantages of the present model are
that, unlike other models, it endogenizes the path of both sides of the
contract —— wages and effort —— and
has fairly intuitive first—order

conditions. It also shows how earlier conclusions, such as the notion that
wages are likely to rise faster than marginal products in equilibrium, are
the results of less—than—general model

specification, and has some interesting

implications when applied to unionism: by proposing that unions act as workers'
equivalent to certain contract enforcement policies like the disciplinary
dismissals used by firms, it provides what is to the author's knowledge the
only consistent theoretical explanation of the quite commonly observed U—
shaped pattern of the union wage effect by age and shows how unions might
play a positive efficiency role in this regard.
The paper begins in Section II with an overall discussion of the

malfeasance issue and a brief review of the existing literature in light of

that discussion. The model's structure is set out in Section III, and
Section IV draws out some of its more basic implications.

The model is

THE GENERAL PROBLE OFMALFEASCE

CONTRACTS

In

general, any contract between a firm and a worker over a

s1gnifjcan period of time T, involves an agreement on both what
the
firm supplies to a worker —— a
complex bundle of wages, fringes, and
working conditions which we assume is

and what the worker supplies in

summarized by the measure w(t) ——

return, which we might loosly term "effort"

or h(t). Any such contracts can in principle be broken by both parties
in two quite distinct ways —-time t, of unilaterally

In short, in designing long

run contracts, firmsand workers must take

account of the possibility of four different

may quit the firm in order to avoid

their contractual obligations to the firm if they can do better elsewhere.

Second, firms may dismiss workers to whom they owe more than they expect

to receive for the same reason. We shall refer to these two activities

as "unilateral withdrawal" from the contract, or "Type 1"
malfeasance —— even though an activity like worker quitting

contract may all of a sudden decide to supply less effort than was
initially agreed upon, or to raise

their wages by stealing or other means.

Finally, the firm at any point might

begin to let working conditions

deteriorate, fail to increase wages at the agreed—upon rate, or

speed—ups or stretch—outs not

expected when the "contract" was made.

These last two activities might

be called "malfeasance by trying to alter

the terms of the contract," or simply "Type 2" malfeasance.

been formally treated until Hashirnoto and Yu (1980) and Hall and
Lazear
(1982), who consider symmetrjcai models in which the wage/effort
bargain
is prespecified but both parties to the contract have the
right to
terminate it unilaterally.

Again, "second best" contract structure,

plus the result that quits and dismissals

are greater than ootimal, are

derived. Finally, a number of models of contracts that deal
primarily
with the problem of e1icitjn effort from workers (TvDe
II malfeasance) have been
developed, such as Eaton and Rosen (1981) or Lazear and Rosen (1981).
These tend not to deal with any sort of firm malfeasance at all,

except

for the interestipg case of Lazear (1979, 1981): in this
model, workers
cheat by changing the terms of the contract (Type II), i.e., supplying

less effort in "shirking", or

stealing, while firms cheat by unilaterally

terminating the contract (Type I). Some mention of worker quits is made
(1981, p. 612, the reference to "slavery") but it is not treated formally,

and Type II cheating by firms is not considered.
The present model uses some of the notation and mechanics of Lazear's

model

In order for a contract not to be vulnerable to quits
by workers or
dismissals by firms as means of
avoiding contractual obligations, it must
be true that, throughout the

contract period, firms and workers both expect
to do better during the remainder
of the contract within the firm than they
can do by leaving it. Formally this

constraints embodying threats or the

effects on overall rents to being in the firm, and finally
some probably

less—important factors that have been

mentioned elsewhere in the literature.

We discuss these in turn below.
(a) are threats

We propose as a working

hypothesis that, while any firm of a reasonable

size is likely to have access to threats over malfeasant
only in unions where workers can enforce

workers, it is

credible threats over firms. The

main reason for this is simply that the ex

bargaining game that occurs

because of the bilateral

monopoly situation within contracts is played many
times by a typical finn but
only once by a typical worker: To prevent

worker shirking, firms can make

'examp1es'

of malfeasant workers through

disciplinary dismissals and still gain in the long run because they acquire
a reputation for doing so

among their own labor force. To prevent workers

making all—or—nothing wage demands,f inns can categorically refuse to make

—22—

individual wage bargains, thus for example attaching wages to jobs, not

workers, activities which Williamson etal. (1975) have labelled "internal

labor market" policies. Individual

workers have access to no such methods,

since firms know that actually exercising a

threat does not make sense if

the losses

Cc) other effects

Some other comments about

unions' effects on contracts have been made

in the literature; these tend on

the whole to fit in rather nicely with

—23—

the previous hypothesis. For one, Freeman (1981) has suggested that
unions help to realize important scale economies in the provision of
information regarding employer compliance with complex contract provisions.
This only strengthens our notion that unions lower Kf due to an

ability to discipline the employer. Also, Lazear (1981) has suggested that
unions, again unlike individual workers but like

firms, may acquire with

their longer lifespans a reputation for delivering labor services of a

certain quality. If unions do tend to screen and police their own members
in this way, it reinforces the conclusion that union overall wage effects

are likely to lower K. Finally a third factor has been commented on that
does not fit with our proposition that unions lower both K and
Kf ——
is the notion that unions

this

may interfere with firms' ability to make genuine

disciplinary dismissals, which is a factor that will tend to raise Kw in

unions. We shall not include this in

our maintained hypothesis here, noting

that it would have to outweigh the two other negative effects on K ——

especially

the greater loss should a dismissal occur ——

to

make a difference,

and if this is actually true, it will become apparent when the present
example's predictions are compared with the evidence.

tions of the Example and Derivation of First—Best Contracts

To make it easy to characterize the shape of first—best contracts, let
us make the convenient assumption that utility,

disutility—of—effort, and

production functions all have the simple constant absolute risk aversion
forms, f(x) = aX.

This means ,

optimal wage profile is linear, To further simplify

matters, imagine 5=r,

and conclude with a brief discussion of the empi-

rical evidence on the question.

—25—

Figure l(c) shows how second—best contracts are likely to deviate
from first—best contracts by indicating where the first—best contract
violates the malfeasance constraints.

It shows roughly what the first—

best path of remaining present value of utility will look like (derived
from Figure l(a) by first depicting the

instantaneous utility stream it

implies——Figure l(b)——and then taking present values) and indicates it is

likely to violate worker malfeasance constraints

(directly from equation

(7) or (9)) near the ginning of the contract, and firm malfeasance constraints (derived by putting the minimum PV rr levels in (8) or (10) into

the indirect utility function PVW(.)) near the end of the contract.

What does this mean? Near the end of the contract, workers' productivity is low and falling, and it is optimal to utilize them less without

lowering their compensation, But this means the remaining profits from
employing the worker are low and probably negative, so firms will cheat.
Second—best contracts will compensate for this by lowering ' and raising 1i

from their first—best levels, as is indicated when Af is positive in

(25) and (26), In other words, secondbest contracts underpay and overwork
older workers in order to reduce firms' incentives to break those contracts.

Near the start of the contract, workers should have already received an
"advance" on their future productivity in first—best contracts and now face
a period where their productivity and effort levels rise but their compen-

sation remains flat. But this means ex post utility is relatively low, so
workers will cheat. Second—best contracts compensate for this by raising
and lowering ii of younger workers, as a positive Aw in (25) and (26)

indicates. Thus, second—best contracts give young workers less of an
"advance" on their future productivity (in other jargon, pay for a smaller
