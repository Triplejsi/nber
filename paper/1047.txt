The Real Interest Rate: A Multi—Country
Empirical Study

ABSTRACT

How real interest rates behave over time is critical to our understanding
of many macroeconomic issues, and much recent research has pursued this ques-

tion. Very little of the research, however, has focused on real interest

rates outside the United States. This paper is an empirical exploration of
real interest rate movements in seven OECD countries from 1967—Il to 1979—Il.
Further research is needed on real rates in other countries for several

reasons. Not only are measures of foreign real rates of interest in their own
right, but extending an analysis of real rates to other countries also has the
f.ollowing additional benefits: it can generate more powerful statistical tests
of propositions previously tested on U.S. data and yield information on whether
results found for the U.S. hold up in other countries.
This study pursues several questions that have arisen naturally from this

earlier work. IS the hypothesis that the real rate is constant rejected when
the analysis is extended to other countries? Does the real rate decline
with increased inflation and money growth in other countries besides the

United States? How reliable is the Fisher effect, in which nominal interest
rates reflect changes in expected inflation? Are movements in nominal interest

rates a reliable indicator of movements in real rates? What kind of variations
in real interest rates are there in different countries? Have real rates
declined from the '60s to the '70s for other countries besides the U.S.?

I. INTRODUCTION

How real interest rates behave over time is critical to our understanding
of many macroeconomic issues, and much recent research has pursued this

question.1. Very little of the research, however, has focused on real
interest rates outside the United States.2 In contrast, this paper is an
empirical exploration of real interest rate movements in seven OECD countries
from 1967—11 to 1979—Il.

Further research is needed on real rates In other countries for several

reasons. Not only are measures of foreign real rates of interest in their own
right, but extending an analysis of real rates to other countries also has the

following additional benefits: it can generate more powerful statistical
tests of propositions previously tested on U. S. data and yield information on
whether results found for the U. S. hold up in other countries.

A previous paper, Mishkin (1981a), analyzed real interest rates in the

United States. This study pursues several questions that have arisen
naturally from this earlier work. Is the hypothesis that the real rate is
constant rejected when the analysis is extended to other countries? Does the
real rate decline with increased inflation and money growth in other countries

besides the United States? How reliable is the Fisher effect, in which
nominal interest rates reflect changes in expected inflation? Are movements

METHODOLOGY

Each country's real rate of interest for a one—period bond is defined
from the Fisher (1930) equation3

rr+1t

(1)

where i =

the nominal interest rate earned on a one—period bond
maturing at time t—--i.e., it is the nominal return from

holding the one—period bond from t—1 to t.

=

the rate of inflation from t—1 to t, expected at time t—1.

All returns, inflation and interest rates in the empirical
work are assumed to be continuously compounded so that the
usual additional second order term is not necessary in the
Fisher equation (1). Note that if holding period real
returns are used in the empirical work here rather than
continuously compounded returns, there is almost no change in
the results. Note also that the definition ignores the
taxation of nominal interest rates. As pointed out in
Mishkin (l981a) it is extremely difficult to know what the
appropriate marginal tax rate is for holders of these one
period bonds. However, to the extent that the effective
marginal tax rate is above zero, it will just strengthen some
of the results found here, such as the negative correlation
of real rates and inflation.

—3—
rr =

the

one—period real rate of interest expected for the bond

maturing at time t.

Hence, the real interest rate, rrt, is just the difference between the nominal

rate of interest and the expected rate of inflation: it is the real return
from holding the one—period bond from t—1 to t which is expected at time t—

1. Because the real rate is a return expected at the beginning of the period,
it is also frequently referred to as the ex ante real rate. The more precise
terminology is used to differentiate it
the

from the ex post real rate, namely,

actual real return from holding the one—period bond from t—1 to t.

It

equals the nominal interest rate minus the actual inflation rate from t—1 to t
and can be written as

(2)

where

eprr i —
eprrt =

rr

—

(it —

the one—period ex post real rate for the bond

maturing at time t,

=

the actual inflation rate from t—1 to t.

Note that for expositional convenience, the ex ante real rate is always
referred to as the real rate throughout this paper, while the ex post real
rate always refers to the variable defined in (2).
The underlying assumption behind the methodology used here is rationality

—4--

of inflation expectations in the bond market, which yields the condition4

=

(3)

where

=

all

E(1rtIi)

available information at time t—1.

Note that the rationality of inflation expectations is necessary and
sufficient for the rationality of the ex ante real rate, implying that the ex
ante real rate equals the expected real return on the one—period bond,
conditional on available information: i.e.

(4)

rr =

E(eprrI41)

There is a large body of evidence that supports this rationality, or
equivalently the efficiency of financial markets, and tests directed more
specifically at the rationality of inflation forecasts in the bond market also
support the use of this assumption over long sample periods such as are used
here.5
If the real rate determined at t—1, rrt, is correlated with observable

variables, X_1 which are elements of the available information
set

then we can write the linear projection of rr into X_1 as:

An alternative methodology would involve using survey data to measure
inflationary expectations in order to construct real rates. Mishkin
(1981a) discusses why the methodology used here should be nre reliable.

See Mishkin (1983).

P(rrI1) =

Note that P(utjX_i) = 0 by using the law of iterated projections,6 and so Ut
is orthogonal to X_1. Furthermore, Ut is also in the information
set

because economic agents observe the ex—ante real rate even if the

econometrician cannot.

Equation (5) cannot be estimated because rr is not

observable. However, substituting (6) into (2) and writing the inflation
forecast error as

we get:

Since data on the ex post real rate are observable, the above equation

can be estimated for each country with ordinary least squares (OLS). How do

6

the law of interated projections.

—6—
the resulting estimates relate to what would have been obtained from OLS

estimates of (6) if it were estimable? The rationality of inflation
expectations implies that the error term

has the attractive property that

E(EtIt_i) = 0

(8)

so that it is uncorrelated with all past available information which includes

Xtl and u. It is then easy to demonstrate, as in Mishkin (1981b), that the
resulting

estimates will have the desirable property that they will be

consistent estimates of .

This result indicates that, although we cannot

observe the ex ante real rate, rr, we can infer information about its
relationship with variables known at time t—l via ex post real rate
regressions.

Although the procedure followed here will yield consistent estimates of
the real rate projection in (5), we must be careful in interpreting the

results. Nothing in the empirical work here demonstrates that the variables
in X_1 are exogenous and thus there is no guarantee that the estimated

are

consistent estimates of the effects on real rates from exogenous changes in
the X—variables.

An even more interesting issue for the methodology here is the situation

where relevant information has been excluded from X1. Assume that the true
real rate has the following linear relationship to X_1 and another relevant
set of information Z_1 which has been ignored by the econometrician.

(9)

then

rr =

Equation (10) above tells us that the

estimate from the ex—post real rate

Indeed the larger is

and the more correlated Z1 is with

*

the more

serious this bias becomes. Hence, even if X_1 were exogenous, leaving out
relevant information would lead to inconsistent estimates of the effects from

changes in X1.
The remarks above indicate that, without further identifying information,
it is not appropriate to make inferences on causation from the results

produced here. Nonetheless they are useful. This paper is a study in the
measurement of real rates. Knowing how real rates have moved with other
variables and how they have moved over time is important to constructing

theories of what determines real rate movements. The estimates of the
projection equation yield exactly this information.
For purposes of inference on the movement of real rates and the
relationship of real rates with the X—variables, we need to calculate
appropriate standard errors for the

and the estimated real rates. An

important element of the methodology in this paper is the use of non—
overlapping data——i.e. where the forecast horizon is never longer than the
observation interval——because rational expectations then implies that c is -

serially

uncorrelated. As has been emphasized in Nelson and Schwert (1977)

and Mishkin (l981a,b), forecast errors of inflation are probably extremely

large and much greater in magnitude than the ups. Hence, even if u were
serially correlated or correlated with past C,
correlation in the composite error term u —

c,

the amount of serial
should necessarily be slight.

—8
Evidence in Mishkin (l981b) supports this view and the results below also find
that serial correlation is not a serious problem.7

One advantage from using data on several countries is that we can conduct

joint tests for several countries at once. This can result in more powerful
statistical tests of propositions such as the constancy of real rates because

more data are exploited in conducting these tests. One pitfall to beware is
that these joint tests cannot be conducted by estimating each country's OLS

constrained and unconstrained regressions separately, adding up their sum of
squares, and then carrying out the usual comparison to construct the F—

For example, in the regressions used to generate the estimated real rates
in Figures 2—8 the residual autocorrelations do not display any evidence
of serial correlation. The Durbin—Watson statistics range from 1.74 to
2.36, none of which indicate the presence of first order serial
correlations and none of the Ljung—Box (1978) Q(12) statistics reject the
null hypothesis that the first twelve residual autocorrelations all equal
zero: the Q(12) statistics range from 5.23 to 17.88 while the critical
value at the 5% level is 21.0 In regressions with fewer explanatory
variables there are a few cases where Durbin—Watson statistics sometimes
fall below 1.6 but never below 1.0. However, this is an unusual
occurence. Coldfeld—Quandt (1965) tests also did not indicate that the
homoscedasticity assumption is strongly violated. For example in the
regressions used to generate Figures 2—8 there was only one rejection of
homoscedasticity in the seven CPI regressions and one in the seven WPI
regressions. However, these rejection were not for the same country and
there was no consistent pattern of the variance of the residuals having a
similar upward or downward trend in all the countries.

This is equivalent to generating the test statistics using a standard
seemingly unrelated regression package where the variance—covariance
matrix of the residuals is specified to be diagonal.
Since we must allow for covariance of the residuals and the parameter
estimates In order to generate correct F—statistics, why are the models
estimated here with OLS rather than a GLS seemingly unrelated regressions
technique. Furthermore, using OLS was actually far more costly in time
and effort than GLS because standard econometric packages (such as SAS or
TSP) are not set up to calculate the F—statistics in (12) easily. There
are two primary reasons why OLS Is preferred. First, one sensible view of
results from cx post real rate regressions is that they are nothing more
than useful summary statistics when OLS is used. The OLS results have an
easy interpretation In terms of the comprehensible concept of
correlation. If the regressions are not viewed as reduced forms, however,
then GLS results have no easy interpretation. Second, when GLS is used in
estimation, the parameter estimates from ex post regressions no longer
have the desirable property that they are equal in the expectation (or in
the probability limit) to those obtained from cx ante real rate
regressions. It is easy to demonstrate that they will only be equal if
the variance—covariance matrix of C is proportional to the variance—
cov-arjance matrix of u. The use of OLS rather than GLS does not
appreciably affect the results in this paper. The GLS standard errors are
slightly smaller and test statistics slightly higher as we mIght expect,
while the parameter estimates are quite close to those reported in the
text. The basic conclusions of the paper thus do not change. The GLS
results are available from the author on request.

The following points about the rr estimate of the real rate are now easily
seen. It will be a consistent estimate of rr only if u equals zero. This
will occur if no relevant information is left out of the explanatory variables
in the ex post real rate regression or if the information left out is

perfectly correlated with the X_1 information. Therefore, the consistency of
the real rate estimate does not depend on the consistency of the

estimate. Indeed, paradoxically, the more highly correlated is the left out

information with X_1, the more inconsistent is the

estimate, but the more

consistent is the rr estimate.
Even if rr is not a consistent estimate of the real rate because u is
non zero, we can still use it to conduct inference about the actual real rate

because we can calculate the variance of its within sample error. Mishkin

Since we do not know the relative size of the variance of u and C,

the

formula in (17) cannot be used directly to yield the standard errors of the

estimated real rates. However, we can calculate bounds on the standard errors

This can be achieved by including lags of the ex post real rate in
This is not necessary in the models used to derive rr in Figure 2—8
because they do not display any' serial correlation in the residuals (see
footnote 7) and four lagged values of the ex post real rate do not add
significant explanatory power to these models.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS

THE DATA
Obviously, there is no unique real interest rate. The magnitude of a
real rate depends not only on the risk charcteristics of the security being

studied, but also on the price index used to calculate real returns. What is
the appropriate price index depends on what economic decision is being

analyzed. For example, if we are interested in the savings——consumption
decision, a price index based on a commodity bundle of consumption goods, such

as the CPI, is appropriate. If, on the other hand, we are interested in
decisions to trade among countries, then a price index with tradeable goods a
larger proportion of its commodity bundle, such as the WPI, is more
appropriate.

This study analyzes real interest rates in the Euro deposit market in the

1967—Il to 1979—11 period for the following OECD countries: the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, the Netherlands,

and Switzerland. Quarterly data on threemonth euro rates obtained from the
Harris Bank tape are used in this study for several reasons.'2 High quality
data for domestic, short—term interest rates are not readily available for

other countries besides the United States and Canada. Unlike the U. S. and
Canada, other countries' treasury bill rates are not market clearing, so that

12

Only seven of the ten countries' data available in the tape are used here
because three of the countries——Italy, Belgium and Japan——either had a
high proportion of the data missing or did not satisfy interest partity
because of two—tiered exchange rates. In the few cases where euro rate.
data were missing for the seven countries, the euro rate was calculated
from the interest parity condition. The rest of the data were checked by
verifying that there were no large deviations from interest parity.
Several obvious errors in the tape were found in this manner and were
corrected.

— 14 —

these data, although available, do not reflect the true cost of credit. Euro
rates, however, are market clearing. In addition, euro deposits denominated
in different countries' currencies are issued by the same bank and therefore
have similar default risk and are not subject to capital controls because they

are offshore securities. Hence a comparison of real euro rates across
countries will not have to be adjusted for differing default risks or non—

comparability because of capital market controls. Quarterly data on three—
month rates have the advantage that the data are non—overlapping and timing
problems that would arise with monthly data are avoided.'3 The dating

convention is as follows. The ex post real rate for a quarter is the actual
real return on a three—month euro deposit held from the beginning to the end

of that quarter, continuously compounded. For each country the ex post real
rate is constructed by subtracting the continously compounded inflation rate
for that country from the continuously compounded nominal return on the euro

13 See Mishkin (1981a).

— 15 —

deposit

denominated in that country's currency.'4 Both the CPI and WPI are

used in the empirical analysis to calculate inflation rates for the reasons

discussed above. The money growth and inflation variables are calculated as
the change in the log of the money stock or price level, from the last month
of the previous quarter to the current quarter, and are also quarterly

rates. The euro rate and U. S. treasury bill data were obtained from the
Harris Bank tape maintained at the University of Chicago and the CPI, WPI and
money stock data were obtained from the International Financial Ststistics
(IFS) tape maintained by the International Monetary Fund.

RESULTS
The null hypothesis of the constancy of the euro real rates is studied
heçe with two types of tests which are similar to those carried out in Fama

(1975) and Mishkin (1981a). These tests correspond to the weak form and semi—
strong form distinction discussed in the efficient markets literature by Fama
(1970).

Table 1 contaIns the weak form tests whIch look at the first twelve

14 These real rates seem to be the most natural to study, but matching
up the
country's price index with the euro deposit rate denominated in its
currency is somewhat arbitrary. Clearly a Frenchman might also be
interested in his real return from holding a U. S. dollar denominated euro
deposit even though the price index relevant to him is, say, the French
CPI. If uncovered interest parity holds, which will be the case when the
forward exchange rate is an unbiased forecast of the spot exchange rate
since interest parity in euro rates is a pure arbitrage condition, then
the real euro rate for a Frenchman will be the same regardless of the
denomination of the euro deposit. Thus in this case only the real euro
rates analyzed in this paper need to be studied. However, recent evidence
does not support the unbiasedness of the forward rate prediction or
uncovered interest parity (for example see Cumby and Obstfeld (1981,
1982), Hansen and Hodrick (1980) and Mishkin (1982). Thus it is
potentially worth studying real rates where the currency denomination of
the euro rate is not matched up to the price index for that country. This
Is not done here because it would make this already long paper unwieldly.

of the ex post real rates. The constancy of the real rate

implies that all the autocorrelations should equal zero. It is formally
tested with the adjusted Q—statistic suggested by Ljung and Box (1978). The
Q(12) statistic is distributed approximately as x2(12), and its marginal
significance level is the probability of getting that value of the test
statistic or higher under the null hypothesis of all autocorrelations equaling

zero: i.e., a marginal significance level less than .05 indicates a rejection
of the null hypothesis at the five percent level. The serial correlation
pattern for the ex post real rate in Table 1 is similar to that found for U.S.

treasury bill data in Mishkin (l981a). The first four or five
autocorrelations are usually positive with a high percentage significantly

different from zero. The Q(12) statistic rejects the null hypothesis implied
by the constancy of the real rate (at the 5% level) in 11 out of 14 cases, and
only the ex post real rate for the dutch guilder displays no evidence of
serial correlation.

Table 2 contains the semi—strong form tests for whether the ex post real
rates in the seven OECD countries, and hence the real rates, are correlated
with other variables whose values are known when the real rate was determined,

i.e., at time t—1. The F—statistics in Table 2 test the null hypothesis that
all coefficients of the explanatory variables in the real rate model for each

country, except the constant terms, are zero. Line 2.1 follows Mishkin
(1981a) in conducting a mechanical test of the constancy of the real rate by
postulating that the real rate for each country moves with a fourth order

to explain real rate movements while line 2.3 uses both the economic and

noneconomic time variables to explain real rates. Note that the ex post real
rate regressions for each country use only its own economic variables for

explanatory variables and not those of other countries. Clearly other
countries economic variables might affect domestic real rates, but if each
country's regressions included all other countries' economic variables, almost

all degrees of freedom would have been used up. Again, the rejection of the
null hypothesis is strong, and in one case the marginal significance level

drops below io"38. The rejection in Table 2 of the constancy of the real
rates jointly in all seven countries is stonger than is the case for any

country alone.'6 This demonstrates the increased power of joint statistical

(1981a) found a strong negative correlation of real U.S. Treasury bill rates
with U. S. inflation lagged one period. Does this negative realationship of
real rates and inflation hold up in the data here? The CPI results in System
3.1 to Table 3 provides only weak evidence that It does. The negative
association of each country's real rate and lagged inflation appears in all

seven countries. However, only two of these seven negative coefficients is
signficantly different from zero, and the F—test for whether all of the

inflation coefficients are zero is not rejected at the 5% level. Particularly
surprising is the weak association of the U. S. euro dollar real rate and
lagged U. S. inflation, considering the strong association found with Treasury
bill data in Mishkin (l981b).
This result Illustrates the important point that real rates for

securities with different risk characteristics need not move together. The
U.S. Treasury bill is a rlskless interest rate in nominal terms while the euro

dollar rate bears some default risk. The risk preminum for the three month
euro dollar rate is plotted in Figure 1 and It does have substantial variation

over time. Two periods are particularly important in this regard: 1969 and
1974. Both periods displayed a very large premium of the three month Euro
dollar rate over the three month U.S. Treasury bill rate. Both periods were

explanatory power Is .00003 versus l.l2xl08 for the joint
test.
17 One factor behind the positive correlation of the premium and inflation
could be Regulation Q. When inflation rises, nominal interest rates would
rise as well in the U. S. via a standard Fisher effect. With Regulation Q
binding so that banks cannot compete for deposits in the U.S., they might
go into the euro market and bid for funds, thus possibly raising euro
rates relative to U. S domestic rates. Another factor might be the
greater uncertainty in the international financial system as a result of
financial crises: the Penn Central bankruptcy and major bank failures such
as Franklin National and the Herstadt bank. The determination of the
premium on euro dollar rates over U.S. T—bill rates is an interesting
question that deserves further research.

also a time of high inflation.'7 Hence, the positive correlation of the risk
premium and inflation could be obscuring the negative relationship of real

rates and inflation. This possibility is explored by adjusting the euro
dollar rates for default risk by subtracting the premium of the three—month
euro dollar rate over the three—month U.S. Treasury bill from each country's

euro rate. In the case of the U.S., this leaves us with the three—month
Treasury bill rate, while for other countries this leaves us with a nominal
rate that is adjusted for bank default risk, but not for any political risk

borne by domestic securities.'8 The resulting estimates can be found in
system 3.2. All the inflation coefficients are negative, and now the
inflation coefficient in the U.S. regression is statistically significant and
has a very similar value to that found in Mishkin (1981a) which used a
soniewhat different sample period. The joint test of the null hypothesis that
the inflation variables have no explanatory power is now rejected at the 5
percent level.

Systems 3.3 and 3.4 add three more lags of inflation to the models of
Systems 3.1 and 3.2 because they have significant additional explanatory
power,'9 and here the evidence is far stronger on the negative realationship

of real rates and inflation. The sum of the inflation coefficients in each
country is always negative, and the explanatory power of the inflation

variables is highly significant: the null hypothesis that their coefficients
equal zero is rejected at extremely small marginal significance levels.

Panel B of Table 3 contains the results using the WPI for each country as

— 21 —

the price index. The inflation coefficients always have negative sums and,
even in the System 3.5 results where the euro rates are not adjusted for
default risk and only one lag of inflation is included, the hypothesis that
these negative inflation coefficients equal zero is rejected very strongly.

Overall then, the results in Table 3 do strongly support the existence of a
negative correlation between Inflation and real rates in other countries
besides the United States.

Mishkin (l981a) found evidence that, as we might expect from standard
monetary theory, money growth and real rates in the United States are

negatively correlated. However, only weak evidence was found that money
growth has explanatory power over and above that associated with inflation.
Table 4 yields evidence on this issue for the seven countries studied here.

Note that only one lag of each country's money growth is used as an
explanatory variable because additional lags did not contain significant

additional explanatory power.2° The CPI results in Panel A show that real
rates for other countries besides the U. S. are negatively associated with
lagged money growth in that country. The money growth coefficients are
negative in 13 out of 14 cases in Panel A, and the hypothesis that all the
money growth coefficients equal zero is always rejected at the 1 percent

20

The null hypothesis that coefficients on three more lags on money growth
are zero cannot be rejected at the five percent level. Using the CPI,
F(21,308) = 1.46 and using the WPI,F(21,308) = 1.34, while the critical
value of F at 5% is 1.6.

21 For example when one lag of inflation for each country is added as a
explanatory variable to the regressions in System 4.1, the null hypothesis
that the coefficients on money growth are zero can be rejected at the one
percent level, F(7,322) = 3.70 while the critical value of F at 1% is
2.04. Although we could Interpret this result as indicating that monetary
policy has an independent effect on real rates, it is also possible that
money growth has significant explanatory power because it helps forecast
inflation, and it is expected inflation which is negatively correlated
with the real rate.

In addition when lagged inflation for each country is also included

in the regressions, the money growth coefficients continue to be negative and

significantly different from zero. The finding here of an Independent
association of money growth and real rates over and above that coming from
inflation is stonger than was found for U. S. data alone, as in Mishkin

(1981a). Again this demonstrates the usefulness of analyzing data from many

countries. The WPI

results

display only a weak tendency towards a negative

association of real rates and money growth: the money growth coefficients for
each country are negative in 9 out of 14 cases in Panel B, and the explanatory

power of money growth is not strong: the null hypothesis of zero money growth
coefficients cannot be rejected at the 5% level.

Results with U. S. data in Nishkin (1981a) indicated that movements in
noniinal interest rates were not positively correlated with real rates in the

post war period. Hence, nominal interest rates may have been a misleading
indicator of the tightness of monetary policy in this period. Has this been
true for other countries besides the United States? Table 5 presents evidence
on the relation of real and nominal rates for the seven OECD countries.22

The System 5.1 CPI results indicate that not only is the real euro rate
not significantly correlated with the nominal euro rate for the U. S., but

this is also true for the United Kingdom and Canada. The 5.1 results for the
other countries are, however, quite different. France, Germany, the

22

Additional lags of euro rates are not included as explanatory variables
because this would have cut down on the sample period and because evidence
on their explanatory power is mixed. The null hypothesis that
coefficients on three lags of euro rates are zero cannot be rejected at
the five percent level. Using the CPI: F(21,287) = .90 However using
the WPI, F(21,287) = 1.81, while the critical value of F at 5% is 1.6.
Note that the degrees of freedom in this test are smaller than In
footnotes 19 and 20 because three observations for each country are lost
when three lags of euro rates are included as explanatory variables.

Netherlands and Switzerland display strong significant positive correlations
of nominal and real euro rates. Indeed, the null hypothesis that the real
euro rate moves one for one with the nominal euro rate cannot be rejected for

these countries. Thus, contrary to the U. S. case, movements in nominal
interest rates do provide information on the movements in real rates in
France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
We might suspect that positive associations of real and nominal euro
rates using the CPI appear because of the substantial variation in the default
risk premium pictured in Figure 1, which is reflected in both real and nominal

euro rates. However, when the cx post real rates are adjusted for default
risk in System 5.3, the positive correlation of the real rate with the nominal
euro rate continues to be significant for France, Germany and the

Netherlands. The WPI results in Table 5 do not display as strong a positive
association between real and nominal rates as the CPI results. Only France
and the Netherlands display a significant positive correlation of real and

nominal rates, and when the real euro rate is adjusted for default risk, the

correlation is no longer significant for the Netherlands. Nevertheless the
pattern displayed in the CPI results is repeated in the WPI results: real
rates in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland are more positively

23

24

Even though all variables in the empirical work are calculated as
quarterly rates the figures report the real rates as annual rates.
For the CPI system the F—statistic which tests the null hypothesis that
the coefficients on the time variables arg zero is F(28,266) = 3.05 with a
marginal significance level of 1.57 x l0 . For the WPI system, F(28,266)
= 1.53 with a marginal significance level of .0484. As should be clear
from footnote 15, the time variables are proxying for additional economic
information over and above the inflation and money growth variables that
belong in the real rate projection equations. One possiblity is that the
time variables proxy for world wide economic factors that are related to
red rate movements in all countries.

— 24 —

associated with nominal rates than is true for the U.S., Canada, and the
TJ.K. Thus, using movements in nominal rates as a guide to movements in real
rates would me more misleading for the latter countries than the former,
regardless of whether the CPI or WPI is used in calculating real rates.

We now turn to measures of the real euro rates for the 1967—Il to 1979—Il

sample period. Figures 2 through 8 contain estimated real rates derived from
model 2.3 in Table 2 which includes as explanatory variables for each country
all the economic variables as well as a fourth—order polynominal in time.23
The time variables are included because they do contain significant additional

explanatory power in the CPI and WPI systems.24 Figures 2 through 8 also
contain 95% confidence intervals for the estimated real rates for the two

extreme cases of equations (18) and (19) where: a) all the variance of the
composite error term is attributed to forecast errors of inflation (the dotted
lines) or b) none of the variance of the composite error term is attributed to

the forecast errors of inflation (the dashed lines). Here, the discussion of
inference will focus on the dotted—lines confidence interval because, as
argued in Section II, this case is likely to be closer to reality.

The U. S. results in Figure 2 are qualitatively similar to those found

with Treasury bill data in Mishkin (l981a). In the period of the '60s the
real euro dollar rate is positive and is frequently significantly so. In the
'70s the real rate has fallen and fluctuates around zero. The significantly
negative real rates for U. S. Treasury bills in the '70s rarely appear in the
euro market because, as is seen in Figure 1, the default risk premium averages

around 2 percent during this period. Canada's real rates are very close to
those of the U. S., as might be expected, while the British real euro rates

have greater fluctuations with significantly negative estimated real rates

appearing in 1975 and 1976. The greater fluctuation in British real rates is

not surprising considering the larger fluctuations in the British inflation
rates. The French estimated real rates are particularly interesting because
the results are so different depending on whether the CPI or WPI is used to

caldulate real returns. Both the CPI and WPI results indicate very high rates
during the exchange rate crisis of 1968 and these are significantly

positive. In 1974 both real rates rise substantially. However, the WPI real
rate reaches an annual rate of 33 percent, while the CPI real rate only rises

to 8 percent. The sharp differences in the French CPI and WPI real rates are
the result of widely diverging patterns of CPI and WPI inflation for

France.25 Particularly striking is the fact that the French WPI actually
declines in 1974 while the CPI inflation rate is substantial. This deflation
of the WPI when the nominal French euro rate was high is the source of the

unusually high WPI real rate in 1974. The German, Dutch and Swiss estimated
real rates are also positive in the late 60's, sometimes significantly so;
decline somewhat until 1974, rise and then fall in 1974; and then fluctuate
around zero thereafter.
The estimated real rates in Figures 2 through 8 do have substantially

different values in the seven OECD countries —

real

rate differentials of

over 10 percent are not uncommon — but there are some similarities. The real
euro rates are positive for most countries in the late '60s, decline

thereafter, rise in 1974 and then fall back down again. More formal tests of
the relations of these real rates across countries can be found in Mishkin
(1982).

The estimates of the real rate in Figures 2—8 can be used to derive
estimates of the expected inflation rate for each country, ITe.

25 See Frenkel (1981a).

It is easily

— 26 —

calculated

by substracting the estimated real rate, rr, from the nominal

interest rate, i: i.e.

(20)

1r=it_rr=it_Xtif3.

and its error is

(21)

=

=

—(rr

—

rr).

Because this measure of expected inflation is likely to be more rational than
alternative survery measures, Mishkin (1981a) argues that it is a potentially

more accurate measure of the expected inflation rate. In addition, since the
absolute value of Its error equals that of the estimated real rate, standard
error bounds are obtainable from equations (18) and (19).
Figures 9—15 show the relationship between each country's estimated

expected inflation, real rates and nominal interest rates.26 Table 6 provides
the correlations of these variables for each country. Because there may be
non—stationarity in these variables, we must be somewhat cautious in drawing

inferences from these correlations. They are useful, however, as summary
statistics that can help us pick out the co—movements in the figures.
As we would expect from the significant correlation of ex post real rates
and lagged inflation, the negative correlation of expected Inflation and real

euro rates Is sizeable. However, despite this, there is evidence of the
Fisher effect: i.e., the positive correlation of expected inflation and

26

The nominal euro rate plotted in these figures is the
continuously compounded rate rather than the coupon rate
reported in the Harris Bank tape.

nominal interest rates. It is strong for the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom using both the CPI and WPI price indices, but is much less so

for Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. As is found in the
earlier regression results, there is an usually strong positive association
between nominal and real euro rates for France, Germany, the Netherlands and

Switzerland, while this is not the case for the United States, Canada and the

United Kingdom. However, what is striking in Table 6 is the finding that
Fama's (1975) conclusion that, in the post—war period, movements in nominal
rates primarily reflect movements in expected inflation is not generally true

outside of the United States. Only Canada and the United Kingdom join the
United States in displaying this phenomenon. To the contrary, for France, the
Netherlands and Switzerland using both price indices, and Germany using the
CPI, movements in nominal rates are less highly correlated with movements in
expected inflation than they are with movements in real rates.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

This paper has studied real rate movements in seven OECI countries over

the 1967—Il to 1979 II sample period. The empirical analysis has been
directed at several questions posed in the introduction and now, is an
appropriate time to provide answers by way of summarizing the empirical
evidence.

1.

The hypothesis that the real rates in these countries is constant is

rejected at extrmely low marginal significance levels. The
rejections here are exceedingly strong and confirm a similar finding
for U. S. data alone.

2.

The real rates in these countries do decline with increased

inflation. This confirms that this relationship is not unique to the
United States.

3.

Real Rates in these countries also decline with higher money

growth. This non—neutrality result which has been previously found
for the U. S. seems to be prevalent elsewhere.

4.

Nominal Euro rates have not been reliable indicators of the movements
in real rates for the United Kingdom and Canada as well as the United

States. This gives some further justification for why nominal
interest rates might have been a misleading target for monetary

policy in these countries. In contrast, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, and Switzerland frequently exhibit a strong positive

correlation of nominal and real rate movements. Thus nominal
interest rates may be less misleading as an indicator of monetary
tightness in these countries than has been true for the United
States, the United Kingdom and Canada.

5.

In the seven countries, real euro rates have been most positive inthe late 1960's, decline somewhat thereafter, rose briefly in 1974

and then have come back down again. Significant negative real euro
rates rarely appear in the 1970's in contrast to findings for the
U.S. Treasury bill market, but this is explained by the substantial
default risk in the euro market in this period.

6.

There is a strong negative association of real Interest rates and
expected inflation for all seven countries, but nevertheless there is
some evidence of a Fisher effect where higher expected inflation is

associated with higher nominal interest rates. However, this effect
does not appear to be as strong for France, Germany, the Netherlands

and Switzerland as it is for the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom.

7.

Fama's (1975) finding that movements in U. S. nominal interest rates
in the post war period are more closely associated with movements in

expected inflation than with movements in real rates is not generally
true outside of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

The opposite result Is found for France, the Netherlands, Switzerland
and sometimes Germany.
