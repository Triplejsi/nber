The Take Up of Social Benefits
Janet Currie
NBER Working Paper No. 10488
May 2004
JEL No. I38
ABSTRACT
This paper offers a review of recent literature regarding the take up of social programs in the
U.S. and U.K. A few general conclusions are drawn: First, take up is enhanced by automatic or
default enrollment and lowered by administrative barriers, although removing individual barriers
does not necessarily have much effect, suggesting that one must address the whole bundle. Second,
although it may be impossible to devise a definitive test of the “stigma hypothesis”, other, more
concrete types of transactions costs are probably a good deal more important. Third, although people
generally have means-tested programs in the United States in mind when they discuss take up, low
take up is also a problem in many non means-tested social insurance programs and in other
countries.
Historically, economists have paid little attention to rules about eligibility, and virtually no
attention to how these rules are enforced or made known to eligibles. Hence, the marginal return to
new data about these features of programs is likely to be high in terms of understanding take up. In
an era of social experiments, it might also prove useful to consider experimental manipulations of
factors thought to influence take up.

Virtually all developed countries and many developing countries have a system of
income maintenance. In countries with universal programs, the aim of these systems is to
maintain a minimum level of income for all individuals, at a reasonable cost to government. In
the United States, the goal is to maintain such a standard for selected groups of vulnerable or
“deserving” individuals, such as children, the elderly, and the disabled. One of the main
problems with designing such programs, is that the government typically has imperfect
information about the income-generating capacity of any given individual. Hence, a central
problem is to design a system that aids the vulnerable while minimizing work disincentives
given these information asymmetries. For example, Besley and Coate (1995) present a model in
which a negative income tax policy supplemented by workfare for the lowest earning
individuals, is optimal.
Besley and Coate (1991) argue that redistribution from rich to poor can also be achieved
through the provision of in-kind goods at a quality level such that the rich “opt-out” and
purchase the good privately, while Blackorby and Donaldson (1988) show that in-kind provision
provides a way to get people with special needs to self-select into the group receiving aid, and
can thus be a second-best optimum in a world in which the government cannot judge needs
perfectly. Bruce and Waldman (1991) offer a third, dynamic scenario, in which persons offered
a cash transfer in the first period have incentives to spend it in a way that maximizes their
eligibility for additional transfers in future periods. Offering a tied (i.e. in-kind) transfer to the
target group in the first period avoids this problem. These papers build on an insight from early
work by Nichols, Smolensky, and Tideman (1971) discussing the way that waiting times can be
used to ration public goods.
Notwithstanding this literature on optimal targeting, most developed countries other than
3

the United States continue to provide many social programs universally rather than targeting
them to particular groups. Smolensky, Reilly, and Evenhouse (1995) offer an in-depth
discussion of targeting and outline several costs that may offset the potential budgetary benefits.
First, targeting may in fact be administratively expensive, though costs can be reduced by means
of applying categorical screens and providing benefits in a way that causes the target group to
select into the program while others select out. Second, targeting may be socially divisive to the
extent that it divides society into those who give and those who receive. Conversely, programs
that offer universal benefits may enjoy greater political support.
The third problem with targeting is the subject of this essay, and that is the fact that
targeting will always be imperfect. Some of those who take up benefits will not “deserve” them,
and some of those who are eligible for benefits will not take them up. If take up by eligible
individuals is low, then the targeted program may fail to reach its main goal of providing a
minimum bundle of goods for the target group. If take up by ineligibles is too high, then
government revenues will be diverted from other productive uses.1
This chapter reviews what we know about the take up of social programs, most of which
offer in-kind benefits in a targeted fashion. Section I provides some comments about an
economic model of take-up. Section II reviews the literature on the take up of means-tested
programs in the United States with an eye towards what we can learn about the way that program
characteristics affect participation. In Sections III and IV, I also consider what can be learned
from the take up of several important non-means tested or universal programs in the United
States, and provide a brief survey of the evidence regarding take up of programs in the United

1 In his comments, Irving Garfinkel identifies another cost of targeted transfers, which is that they create
disincentives for the poor to work and to marry. There is a large literature on the labor supply and demographic

4

Kingdom, the country outside of the United States that has inspired the most work on these
questions. Section V offers some conclusions and directions for future research.

1. An Economic Model of Take Up
Moffitt (1983) was one of the first to model non-participation in social programs as a
utility-maximizing decision. His model emphasizes “stigma” as the main cost of participation in
a means-tested program, but the model can easily be extended to include other types of costs,
such as transactions costs. In Moffitt’s model, utility is given by:
(1) U = U(Y + aPB) – bP.
Here, Y is income in the absence of the program, and B is the benefit derived from the program.
P is an indicator equal to one if a person participates, and zero otherwise. Moffitt distinguishes
between “flat” stigma, which is a fixed cost associated with participation in the program, and
“variable” stigma, which is a function of the size of the benefit received. Flat and variable
stigma correspond to b and a, respectively.
The two types of stigma(costs) have different implications for participation, since with
only flat stigma, participation will always be increasing in the size of the benefit, whereas with
variable stigma, this may not be the case. If B=G-tWH-rn, where G is the guarantee level, t is
the marginal tax rate, W is the wage, H is hours of work, r is the marginal tax rate on non-wage
income, and N is non-wage income, then flat stigma implies that the probability of participation
is increasing in G, and decreasing in t, W, H, R, and N, holding Y constant. If there is variable
stigma, then the individual will only participate if a>0.
Moffitt goes on to add the individual’s leisure to the utility function, and to consider the

effects of such programs, which is beyond the scope of this survey.

5

fact that eligibility for targeted welfare programs is contingent on being below an income
threshold (as Burtless and Hausman (1978) show, the latter gives rise to a non-linear budget,
which creates work disincentives). In this model, stigma increases the cost of participating in
the program, so that some households who would participate in the absence of stigma choose not
to participate.
The review of the literature below suggests that other costs associated with the takeup of
social programs are more important than stigma. Individuals eligible for means-tested programs
face costs of learning about, and applying for the programs. These costs may be sufficient to
deter some individuals from using them. Moreover, the costs may be highest for precisely those
individuals in greatest need, and in cases where the beneficiary is a young child or an infirm
adult, the costs may be borne by an individual other than the beneficiary. To the extent that the
principal’s agent bears the costs of utilizing the program while the principal receives the benefit,
agents may be less willing to bear the costs than the principal would be if he/she were in a
position to choose for themselves. Agency problems provide an additional rationale for
providing benefits in kind rather than in cash.
This basic cost/benefit framework has remained the basis for empirical investigations of
non-participation in social programs. However, there have recently been two interesting
additions to the basic model. First, there is growing interest in the role of social networks in
potentially reducing the costs of participation. For example, Bertrand, Luttmer and Mullainathan
(2000) show that a woman's propensity to use welfare increases with the number of coethnics in
the area, if those coethnics have a high propensity to use welfare nationally. This work builds
on earlier research by Borjas and Hilton (1996) which showed that the types of benefits received
by earlier immigrants influenced the types of benefits received by newly arrived immigrants
6

from the same origin country. Hence, they speculated that there might be ethnic networks that
transmited information about the availability of particular benefits to new immigrants, or
reduced stigma.
However, as Manski (1993, 2000), Brock and Durlauf (2001), Moffitt (forthcoming) and
others have highlighted, these correlations could reflect an endogenous effect where the
propensity of an individual to behave in a particular way is causally influenced by the behavior
of other members of the group; an exogenous effect where the individual=s behavior is influenced
by an exogenous characteristic that defines group membership; or a correlated effect where
individuals from the same group tend to behave the same way because they have similar
individual characteristics, or face similar constraints.
Aizer and Currie (2004) attempt to distinguish between these effects by exploiting a rich
panel of Vital Statistics data from California, and examining the propensities of women in different
groups to use publicly funded prenatal care services. They find that the use of public programs is
highly correlated within groups defined using race/ethnicity and zip codes. These correlations
persist even when they control for many unobserved characteristics by including zip code-year fixed
effects, and when they focus on the interaction between own group behavior and measures of the
potential for contacts with other members of the group (Bertrand, Luttmer and Mullainathan’s
concept of “contact availability”).
However, the richness of our data allows us to go further and to test the hypothesis that
networks affect take up through information sharing.

In particular, we find that the estimated

effects are as large or larger among women who have previously used the program as among firsttime users.

Thus, these effects cannot represent information sharing, since women who have

already used the program already know about it.
7

It is also worth noting Duflo and Saez’s (2001) experimental study of the effects of
information on the take up of a retirement plan option by employees. Employees were randomly
selected to receive payments if they attended a workshop providing information about the benefit.
Duflo and Saez then look at whether giving information to one person in a group affected the
behavior of other members of the employee’s work group. They find effects which are statistically
significant, but small.
A second theoretical insight comes from the growing field of “behavioral economics”.
O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999) argue that conventional economic models incorrectly assume
exponential discounting—that is that “a person’s relative preference for well-being at an earlier date
over a later date is the same no matter when she is asked” (page 103). They further argue that a
more accurate model would allow time inconsistency in the sense that people tend to put more
weight on the present than on the future in making decisions. The model allows for this feature by
adopting hyperbolic rather than exponential discounting.
The model has an obvious application here, in that many of the costs (though perhaps not the
stigma) of enrolling in social programs are borne immediately, whereas the benefits are in the future.
Hence, a person with time-inconsistent preferences might put off enrolling the program, even
though she would find it utility maximizing to be a participant at some later date. This might be
particularly true of programs such as public health insurance, where the benefit might not even be
needed until a future health shock occurs.
So far, there has been little research investigating the applicability of this model to
participation in public programs. Some of the most convincing evidence in favor of the model
comes from studies of the participation in private benefit programs, such as 401K plans.

For

example, Madrian and Shea (2000) analyze a change in one company’s policies towards 401K plans
8

that replaced a system in which employees had been required to elect participation in the plan, to one
in which they were automatically enrolled in a default plan. They find that participation was
significantly higher after the change, and that a substantial fraction of the enrollees stuck to the
default plan, even though most enrollees prior to the change had not selected the default. These
results suggest substantial stickiness in behavior, even though enrollees could have changed their
plan at any time with a simple phone call.
While these results are striking, they do not necessarily imply hyperbolic discounting rather
than high costs of changing the default rule. While it is true that a phone call is not costly, most
people would have to spend substantial time and mental effort to inform themselves about the
various options available and make a decision. This too, can be regarded as a cost. Moreover, in
the context of non-participation in social programs, it is not clear that the two hypotheses (i.e. that
non-participants in social programs are “irrational” in the sense that they have time-inconsistent
preferences or that non-participants just face high costs of enrollment) have different policy
implications. Both suggest that reducing the immediate costs associated with enrollment, or
adopting default enrollment, would increase participation. Of course, if participants in social
programs are on average more “present-oriented” than other people, than this may still have
implications for the appropriateness of paternalistic government policy (c.f. O’Donoghue and Rabin,
2003).
2. Take Up of Means Tested Programs in the United States
Table 1 provides a selective overview of the literature about the take up of means-tested
transfer programs in the United States, focusing on more recent studies. Most of these programs
are surveyed in more detail in Moffitt (2003). Table 1 provides a thumbnail sketch of each
program in terms of when it started, what it does, who it serves, and at what cost. The programs
9

are grouped by type and expense.
Perusal of the Table suggests several broad conclusions. First, take up varies a great deal
across programs. In the case of programs that are not entitlements, take up often appears to be
constrained by the amount of funding available (e.g. public housing programs, and child care
subsidies). However, even among entitlement programs offering similar services, there is a
good deal of variation both across programs and across different groups eligible for the
programs.2
For example, take up of the new State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) has
been very low (8 to 14%), with the result that the number of uninsured children has changed
relatively little since the introduction of the program. Estimates of the take up of Medicaid
coverage among children also suggest that it is low. For example, Currie and Gruber (1996b)
estimated that while the fraction of children eligible for Medicaid increased by 15.1 percentage
points between 1984 and 1992, the fraction covered increased only 7.4 percentage points, while
Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004) find that expansions of eligibility to all poor children born after
September 30, 1983 led to about a 10 percentage point rise in Medicaid coverage for children
born just after the cutoff date. In contrast, they estimate that the further extension of Medicaid
to children under 6 in families with incomes below 133 percent of the poverty line had relatively
small effects.3
On the other hand, 35 to 40 percent of all U.S. births are now paid for by the Medicaid
program, suggesting extremely high take up of that program by eligible women who are

2 An entitlement program is one in which all qualified applicants are served. In contrast, non-entitlement programs
have fixed budgets, and cannot serve more people than the funding allows.
3 The Card and Shore-Sheppard estimates of take up are lower, because they include child age-specific trends in
their model, while Currie and Gruber (1996), and Cutler and Gruber (1996) (discussed below) did not. Nevertheless,
all three sets of authors emphasize the low take up of the Medicaid expansions, relative to take up of many other

10

delivering. Interestingly, take up of Medicaid-covered prenatal care lags take up of Medicaid
covered delivery services (Ellwood and Kenney, 1995).

a) Explanations for Variations in Take Up
Three explanations for low take up are generally offered in the literature. They are
stigma, transactions costs, and lack of information. Of course, these are not entirely separate
explanations. In particular, a person’s incentive to obtain information about a program, may be
influenced by the size of the benefit relative to the transactions costs/stigma associated with
applying. For example, Daponte, Sanders and Taylor (1998) find that people are more likely to
know about Food Stamps when they are entitled to larger benefits. And it has proven difficult
to define stigma and transactions costs as completely separate constructs. For example, a person
who is required to fill in a 30 page application form that asks about a great deal of personal and
seemingly irrelevant information, may well feel stigmatized.

Nevertheless, the next few

paragraphs will focus on what is known about the relative importance of these factors.
There is considerable evidence that transactions costs are important determinants of take
up rates.

For example, Currie’s (2000) finding that enrollments in Medicaid among immigrant

children increase with family size strongly suggests that it is benefits relative to transactions
costs (or stigma) that matter. Those with more children benefit more while facing a similar cost
of enrollment. Moreover, her finding that enrollments follow a seasonal pattern, with
enrollments spiking before school entry in the fall also suggests that transactions costs or stigma
rather than information plays the dominant role since people are apparently timing their window
of enrollment to coincide with a period when they know that they will need services.

social programs.

11

Blank and Ruggles (1996) study of participation in AFDC and the Food Stamps Program
showed that participation increased with the size of the benefits people were eligible for,
suggesting an important role for transactions costs/stigma. Daponte, Sanders, and Taylor (1999)
conducted an experiment, and found that informing people about their eligibility for the FSP
increased the probability of participation. However, people eligible for larger benefits were
more likely to take them up, once again suggesting a non-trivial role for transactions
costs/stigma.
On a cautionary note, both sets of authors also find that it is likely to be difficult to assess
eligibility for most social programs accurately using survey data. An important problem is that
most surveys have little information about assets. For example, Hu (1998) found that adding
asset information increased estimated take up of SSI by 60% (since people who were ineligible
because of their assets were excluded from the denominator). This problem may be particularly
acute in the low-income population, where even employment and wages are often inaccurately
reported (Haveman and Wallace, 2003).
Currie and Grogger (2002) focus directly on transactions costs, and show that reducing
re-certification intervals had a negative effect on participation in the Food Stamp Program,
particularly among single heads and people in rural areas, both groups that could be expected to
have relatively high transactions costs. While it is possible that single mothers and people in
rural areas feel more stigmatized by participation in the Food Stamp Program than others, the
available evidence for rural areas suggests the reverse (McConnell and Ohls, 2000). Moreover,
the introduction of electronic-debit cards for Food Stamps, which might have been expected to
reduce the stigma associated with food stamps by allowing people to use the program more
discretely, had no detectable effect on Food Stamp take up rates, suggesting that stigma is not a
12

major cause of low take up of the Food Stamp Program.
There has been a great deal of debate over the extent to which the dramatic decline in
AFDC/TANF roles over the 1990s can be attributed to welfare reforms that increased the
stigma/costs of being on welfare rather than to favorable economic conditions (see Blank (2002)
for a summary) but most studies suggest that at least a third and possibly as much as two thirds
of the decline is due to “reforms” which increased the cost of using the program. Moffitt
(2003c) examines specific policies that accompanied welfare reform and documents that nonfinancial factors including work requirements, sanctions, and “diversion” (the practice of trying
to prevent people from applying for welfare by meeting some immediate need) were important
determinants of entry and exit into the TANF program in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio.
Grogger (2002) and Grogger and Michaelopolous (2003) examine the effect of the
PWRORA provisions limiting benefit receipt to five years, and provide evidence that this change
had a profound effect on the way that women used their benefits. In models that interact child
age with time limits, they find that women with young children were less likely to use their
benefits other things being equal, presumably because they wanted to conserve benefits “for a
rainy day”. On the other hand, among women with older children the benefits have a “use it or
lose it” quality, so that there was no reduction in the probability of benefits receipt in this group.
These results suggest that women make fairly sophisticated cost-benefit calculations when
deciding to participate in this program, and that such decisions are not driven primarily by
stigma (which presumably would be larger for mothers of older children than for mothers of
young children).
Medicaid, AFDC/TANF, and the FSP are large, well-established programs and it is likely
that most low income people know of them. Therefore, to the extent that information is lacking,
13

it is likely to be very specific information about exactly how one qualifies or applies for the
program.
Lack of information could be a greater problem for take up of some of the smaller
programs. For example, in their study of current and former welfare recipients, Meyers and
Heintze (1999) asked mothers eligible for employment-related child care subsidies why they
were not receiving them. The majority replied that they were not aware of the programs. Still,
given that transactions costs associated with the program have not been systematically examined,
it is impossible to draw any conclusion about their importance relative to lack of information.
The Bound, Kossoudji, and Ricart-Moes’s (1998) finding that in Michigan, 2/3 of the
people applying for SSI in 1990-1991 had just been kicked off of General Assistance is
particularly striking since the benefits available under SSI were always much higher than those
available under GA. Apparently, people doing the cost/benefit calculation did not find it
worthwhile to pursue SSI when GA was an option. It is also possible that the state helped direct
people who had been kicked off of GA onto the federally-funded SSI program thereby changing
the relative transactions costs associated with the two programs. One would expect the stigma
associated with GA (welfare for the truly indigent) to be much greater than the stigma associated
with SSI, so stigma cannot explain the Bound et al. results.
Finally, there is considerable evidence that transactions costs associated with WIC
matter. Brien and Swann (1999) show in cross-sectional data that requiring income
documentation of WIC applicants reduced participation rates. Bitler, Currie, and Scholz (2003)
find in a panel, that requiring more frequent visits to the WIC office also reduces participation,
while Chatterji et al. (2002) find that restricting the types of foods that can be purchased (i.e.
reducing the value of the benefit) discourages take up. Hence, even in smaller programs,
14

transactions costs relative to benefits appear to be very important determinants of take up.
These observations about the importance of transactions costs and other non-financial
barriers to participation raise two questions: 1) Are the non-financial barriers screening out the
“right” people? That is, are the various administrative requirements attached to these transfer
programs targeting benefits to the neediest eligibles? And 2) To the extent that needy
individuals are not being served, what can be done to increase their take up rates?

b) Do Non-Financial Barriers Screen Out the Right People?
In many cases attempts to answer the first question are hampered by the fact that we do
not have a very precise idea of who is eligible. For example, in the case of SSI, we need to know
not only that someone has low income, but also that they are “disabled” a concept that is socially
determined and liable to change over time. Benitez-Silva, Buchinsky, and Rust (2003) look at
“classification errors” in the SSI and DI programs (see Table 2 for DI) under the assumptions a)
that the individual’s report to the Health and Retirement Survey about their disability status is
the truth and b) that both the Social Security Administration’s assessment of the individual’s
disability status and the self-report are noisy but unbiased measures of true disability. Under
either assumption, they find that 28% of the SSI/DI applicants who are ultimately awarded
benefits are not disabled (by their own reports to HRS), while 61% of the applicants whose
applications are denied are disabled.
They construct a computerized model of disability based on a subset of relatively
objective health indicators and argue that it may be possible to do better than the current regime
in terms of reducing both type I and type II errors. In any case, taken at face value, their results
suggest that the SSI system does not do a very good job of identifying and assisting the neediest
15

individuals, perhaps because the neediest people are least likely to be able to endure a lengthy
and complicated application process. Similarly, Reeder (1995) finds that the poorest households
are less likely than slightly better off households to live in public housing, again perhaps because
these vulnerable households are unable to get through the application process.
Evidence about racial and ethnic differences in participation also suggests that programs
are not always reaching the neediest people. Duggan has found that conditional on being poor,
Hispanic children are less likely to be enrolled in the SSI program. Similarly, Currie (2000)
finds that immigrant children, many of whom are Hispanic, are less likely to be enrolled in
Medicaid conditional on being eligible. This finding mirrors a large literature on the
determinants of welfare participation among immigrants which generally finds that while
immigrants are more likely to be eligible for welfare, they are less likely to take it up, other
things being equal. However, immigrants become more likely to take up benefits with
assimilation (c.f. Blau (1984); Borjas and Trejo (1991, 1993); and Borjas and Hilton (1996);
Baker and Benjamin (1995) and Regina Riphahn (2002) find similar results for Canada and
Germany, respectively).
An interesting exception is that, as Hu (1998) documents, elderly immigrants have
similar welfare take up rates to elderly native born persons, and have higher overall usage of
these programs. The difference is particularly pronounced among immigrants who arrived after
age 55. It is possible that barriers to participation are less formidable for elderly immigrants than
for prime-age immigrants with children, or that elderly immigrants are selected differently than
prime age ones. For example, the elderly immigrants might come intending to take up benefits,
while prime aged immigrants come primarily to work.
On the other hand so programs do seem to serve the neediest applicants. For example,
16

participation in the National School Lunch program is higher among children in poor families,
and Head Start, which is required to serve the neediest children first, seems to fulfill this
mandate. This may be because Head Start programs are required to set out specific criteria for
identifying needy children. Similarly, the WIC program guidelines lay out a very clear
hierarchy for which groups should be served if funds are insufficient to serve all eligibles, and
WIC participants appear to be much more disadvantaged than other eligibles, on average.
Hoynes (1996) and Moffitt (1998) provide evidence that take up of AFDC decreases with
expected wages, suggesting that at least on average, it is the poorest who take up the benefits.
Hence, the evidence regarding whether the neediest are being served is somewhat mixed, and
program specific.
Households may also be receiving aid when they do not appear to be eligible, but it is
important not to assume that all these households are in violation of program rules.
Recertification intervals provide a potential reason for households with incomes above the
thresholds to be on public assistance. We know, for example, that households tend to seek out
public assistance when their income is unusually low (c.f. Ashenfelter, 1983). In this case, we
might expect household income to rise after program enrollment, whether or not the family was
involved in a public program. Since families tend to be certified for a fixed period, such a
pattern might lead us to observe many families in a cross section who participated in a public
program even though their incomes were above the threshold. In some programs, families are
required to report any improvement in their incomes, but enforcement of this provision is often
weak. In other programs, such as WIC, families are certified for fixed periods, regardless of
what happens to their income during this period.
The question of whether benefits have been correctly targeted to those in need has
17

recently been perhaps most exhaustively studied in the case of the Medicaid program. Many
authors have attempted to judge the extent to which expansions of the Medicaid program led to
increases in the take up of public insurance by the target group--people who would otherwise
have been uninsured. These authors have also attempted to gauge the extent to which the
expansions led people who would otherwise have had private insurance to take up Medicaid.
The latter phenomena has been dubbed “crowd out”.
Despite the dramatic increases in eligibility for public insurance coverage documented in
Currie and Gruber (1996a,b) the fraction of children without insurance coverage has stayed
remarkably constant in recent years because private health insurance coverage has fallen by
about the same amount that public insurance coverage has risen (U.S. General Accounting
Office, 1995b). However, private health insurance coverage has also been falling among groups
that one would not expect to be affected by the Medicaid expansions, such as single men (ShoreShepard, 1996). Thus, it is not obvious to what extent the relationship between increases in
public insurance and decreases in private insurance is causal.
Estimates of the extent of crowd out are sensitive to the methods used to control for
possibly pre-existing trends in the provision of private health insurance coverage. At the high
end of the spectrum of estimates, Cutler and Gruber (1996, 1997) estimate that for every two
people covered by the Medicaid expansions, one person lost private health insurance. However,
some of these people (such as household heads who decided they would no longer purchase
health insurance once their children became eligible) were not themselves eligible for
Medicaid--so not all of the people crowded out ended up getting insurance at public expense.
They calculate that in fact about 40 percent of those crowded out ended up on Medicaid.
Other observers have posed the question somewhat differently, and come up with
18

correspondingly different estimates. For example, Dubay and Kenney (1997) find that about 22
percent of the increase in Medicaid coverage came from people who used to be privately insured.
Since not everyone who became eligible for Medicaid did so as a result of the expansions, this
number is necessarily smaller than Cutler and Gruber's estimate. Finally, one might ask what
share of the overall decline in private insurance coverage is a result of the Medicaid expansions.
The answer to this question is about 15 percent which suggests that a great deal of research
remains to be done on the causes of this decline.
One issue obscured by the focus on crowd out is the fact that Medicaid insurance coverage
may be better than what is privately available to many families. For example, many private
policies do not cover routine pediatric preventive care such as immunizations, and most have copayments and limits on what they will pay. Hence, the substitution of Medicaid for private
insurance coverage may improve children's health care, and this improvement should be valued
when the costs and benefits of the expansions are weighed. Also, from a societal point of view,
it does not matter whether private or public insurers pay for health care, except in so far as
taxation creates a dead-weight loss, and public insurance transfers resources to families with
children. Still, policy makers reluctant to raise (or eager to cut) taxes remain deeply concerned
about crowdout. The crowd out literature suggests that it is extremely difficult to target
programs only to those who need them, such as children who would not otherwise have health
insurance.

c) What Can be Done to Increase Take Up?
Turning to the second question of what can be done to increase take up among the
19

“deserving” eligibles, the research summarized in Table 1 suggests some hypotheses but yields
few definitive answers.

For example, it may be the case that the high take up of the EITC

program and of Medicaid among pregnant women reflects the fact that businesses as well as
individuals have a stake in promoting take up of these programs. In the case of the EITC,
anecdotal evidence suggests that commercial tax preparers have moved into low income areas in
response to the EITC. Many preparers advertise instant cash back, which is essentially the
person’s EITC credit less the preparer’s fee. Subsidies for H&R block may not be the most
desirable use of government funds, but the example does illustrate the potential role of
institutions in enhancing take up.
In the case of Medicaid, hospitals have a stake in getting pregnant women who are
eligible signed up, because they are required to serve women in active labor whether or not the
women can pay (as long as the hospital accepts any payments from Medicare). There is
evidence that pregnant women were responsible for much of the uncompensated care provided
by hospitals prior to the Medicaid expansions (Saywell, 1989). Many hospitals have
subsequently established Medicaid enrollment offices on site. These offices assist people in
completing applications and tell them how to obtain necessary documentation. Hospitals in at
least 32 states and the District of Columbia began to employ private firms to help them enroll
eligible patients in the Medicaid program (GAO, 1994).
Conversely, Medicaid enrollment rates may have remained low for other groups despite
increases in income cutoffs because of lack of support for the program among vendors of
medical services. Baker and Royalty (1996) use data from a longitudinal survey of California
physicians observed in 1987 and 1991 and find that expansions of Medicaid eligibility to
previously uninsured women and children increased the utilization of care provided by public
20

clinics and hospitals but had little effect on visits to office based physicians. This is consistent
with much previous evidence that many providers either do not accept Medicaid payments, limit
the number of Medicaid patients in their practice, or otherwise limit the amount of time that they
spend with Medicaid patients (Sloan, Mitchell, and Cromwell, 1978; Decker, 1992).
This failure of private providers to “take up” the Medicaid program is likely to be related to
the costs of doing business with the states, relative to the benefits represented by reimbursement
levels. Andreano, Smolensky, and Helminiak (1986) document the problems that some vendors in
Wisconsin had getting reimbursed from the Medicaid program. Gruber (2003) summarizes the
literature relating Medicaid reimbursement levels to physician participation (starting with Currie,
Gruber, and Fischer, 1995) and concludes that there is a strong relationship.
These examples suggest that giving businesses (or other entities) a stake in getting people
enrolled could boost participation rates. This approach has been tried recently in California. Aizer
(2003) studies a program of application assistance in which community organizations were paid $50
per successfully completed Medicaid application. Aizer finds that this program had a large impact
on Medicaid enrollments, particularly in the Hispanic and Asian communities, and that the increase
in Medicaid coverage resulted in fewer preventable hospitalizations among eligible children. In
contrast, statewide advertising of Medicaid and the Healthy Families program seemed to have
effects only on the enrollment of infants. It appears that people with older children already knew
about these services.
Direct attempts to reduce the barriers to participation by government have not always been
as successful. Currie and Grogger (2002b) show that prior to welfare reform, receipt of Medicaid
by pregnant women was closely tied to receipt of cash welfare, even though earlier expansions of
eligibility meant that most low income women were eligible for coverage of their pregnancies
21

even if they were not on welfare. The key seems to be that women who are on welfare are
automatically eligible for Medicaid, and do not have to undergo the Medicaid application
process. One might think then, that measures states took to make it easier for pregnant women to
apply for Medicaid would have had some impact. These measures included: presuming that
pregnant women were eligible for Medicaid while their applications were being processed and/or
expediting the processing of applications for pregnant women; Aoutstationing@ Medicaid eligibility
workers in hospitals that serve low income women; dramatically shortening and simplifying
application forms; and eliminating the requirement for face-to-face interviews by allowing mail-in
applications from pregnant women. However, Currie and Grogger (2002b) were unable to find any
consistent effects of these measures, suggesting either that they were insufficient or that they were
ineffective.
Yelowitz (2000) provides evidence that altering enrollment requirements for one program
can have spillover effects onto the enrollments in other programs. He estimates that for every 10
newly eligible families who took up Medicaid benefits, four also took up the Food Stamp Program.
It is possible that families learned about their eligibility for the FSP when they went to the welfare
office to apply for Medicaid. Alternatively, it may be more worthwhile to bear the application costs
in the case of Medicaid and the FSP together than in the case of FSP alone. Thus, making it easier
to apply for multiple programs might increase take up among eligibles.
Conversely, reductions in the welfare caseload have impacted enrollments in other programs.
For example, Zedlewski and Brauner (1999) and Currie and Grogger (2002) find that these
reductions reduced enrollment in the Food Stamps Program. And changes in other programs can
also affect AFDC(TANF) caseloads--Garrett and Glied (2000) find that many families switched
from AFDC to SSI after the 1990 case of Sullivan v. Zebley expanded eligibility for the SSI
22

program among children. Moreover, families were more likely to switch from AFDC to SSI where
the difference between SSI and AFDC benefit levels was greatest.
In summary, this section suggests that take up will be higher a) the more people want the
service; b) the fewer the barriers that are place in their way; and c) where institutions (including
private ones) have incentives to assist individuals in taking up their benefits.

3. Take Up of Non Means-Tested Programs
Take up is generally considered to be a problem associated with means-testing.
Therefore, it is worth considering whether anything further can be learned about take up from
studying a few large non means-tested programs in the United States. For example, one might
expect the stigma involved in participating in a non means-tested program to be less than the
stigma associated with participation in a means-tested one. Hence, if participation rates were
universally higher in the former than the latter, then this might be taken as indirect evidence of
the importance of stigma costs.
Table 2 provides an overview of four large social security programs in the U.S. that are
not means-tested.

The most striking thing about this table is that there is almost as much

variation in the take up of these non means-tested programs as there is in the take up of the
means-tested programs that were reviewed in Table 1, which would seem to provide some
indirect evidence against the stigma hypothesis.
For example, Medicare forms an interesting contrast to Medicaid, because there is almost
100% take up of the optional Part B coverage of outpatient services.

This is perhaps surprising

because it is not free--people have to pay premiums for Part B insurance, even though those
23

premiums are highly subsidized. A key difference between the two programs is that when
people turn 65 years old, they have to fill out a form in order to decline Part B coverage, whereas
people have to go through a complicated process in order to apply for Medicaid coverage.
Thus, Part B works very much like the 401K intervention studied by Madrian and Shea (2001).
The three other programs outlined in Table 2 all suggest that take up may be a problem
even for non means-tested programs.

It is difficult to estimate the size of the eligible pool for

Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Workmen’s Compensation (WC) given that we do
not know which people are truly disabled or injured. However, Table 2 summarizes a good deal
of evidence that participation in these programs varies with the size of the benefits, suggesting
that take up is more likely when benefits are higher relative to costs of enrollment.

Similarly,

take up of Unemployment Insurance (UI) is generally much less than full (generally similar to
take up of programs such as AFDC and Food Stamps), and varies with the size of the expected
benefit, as well as with the tax treatment of benefits (Anderson and Meyer, 1997).
These less than full take up rates suggest that eligibles perceive substantial costs
associated with participation even in non means-tested programs (otherwise, take up would be
100 percent for any positive benefit).

If those costs were driven primarily by stigma, the

evidence would suggest that the stigma associated with non means-tested social insurance
programs is of the same order of magnitude as stigma associated with using “welfare” programs.
If we believe, on the other hand, that the stigma associated with using non means-tested social
insurance programs (which everyone pays into) is less than that associated with means-tested
programs, then we would have to conclude that transactions costs are major determinants of
participation in all types of programs.

24

4. Take Up in the UK
Low take up of social programs is also often perceived as a peculiarly American problem,
possibly because of the U.S.’s heavy reliance on means-tested programs in its social security
system. Hence, it is also of interest to examine take up of social benefits in another country,
such as the United Kingdom.4 Table 3 provides a brief overview of the main social benefits
available in the U.K. It is less complete than Tables 1 and 2, given this author’s relative
unfamiliarity with these programs, and less emphasis on the take up issue in the British literature
(although see Craig (1991) for an early survey).
The main point, is that many U.K. programs also exhibit less than full take up. Estimates of
take up of the Working Families’ Tax Credit (which is similar to the American EITC) by single
mothers range from 67 to 81%, which is comparable to Scholz’ estimate of 80 to 87% for the
EITC. Take up of Income Support among non-pensioners, which (at least for lone mothers)
corresponds roughly to AFDC, seems to be higher in the U.K. than in the U.S., though at 80%, is
still much less than full. Take up of Income Support for pensioners (which corresponds to SSI
for the elderly) is somewhat higher than in the U.S. at between 64 and 78%, but again, is much
less than full.
These rough comparisons suggest that perhaps more attention should be paid to factors
determining take up of social benefits outside the U.S. It is interesting to note that the one U.K.
program with near universal take up is the Child Benefit. Mothers receive the application
materials for this program in hospital, which presumably greatly reduces application transactions
costs.

4 Take up estimates for various other countries and programs are also available. C.f. Koning and Ridder (1997)
who study a rental assistance program in the Netherlands and find a 64% take up rate, and Storer and Van

25

The introduction of several new programs, such as the “New Deal” for the unemployed in
1998, would seem to offer an interesting opportunity for research. The New Deal made
participation in jobs programs compulsory for many groups of unemployed. It would be
interesting to know what effect this had on the probability of participating, and which categories
of recipients dropped out. More generally, cross-country collaboration between researchers
might uncover variations in transactions costs and other factors that affect take up, and could
help to isolate their effects.
The discussion of social benefits in the U.K. might also lead us to think beyond the
question of “who takes up programs?” to “do recipients make optimal use of programs that they
have taken up and if not, why not?” Research on the National Health Insurance program
suggests that although there is universal take up, the rich receive more services than the poor,
conditional on their health status. Possible reasons range from higher transactions costs (e.g.
lack of transportation, or inability to take time off from work); superior connections and
communication skills and/or better rapport with medical providers; and differences in attitudes
towards illness and medical care (Dixon et al, 2003). This example suggests that the same
factors that inhibit take up may also affect utilization of social programs.

5. Summary and Conclusions
It is generally agreed that people do not take up benefits if the costs outweigh the
benefits. But after many years of research, we still have relatively little insight into precisely
what types of costs matter most, and what types of measures are most likely to reduce them. A
few general conclusions can be drawn, however. First, take up is enhanced by automatic or

Audenrode (1995) for a summary of take up of UI in Canada

26

default enrollment and lowered by administrative barriers, although removing individual barriers
does not necessarily have much effect, suggesting that one must address the whole bundle.
Second, although it may be impossible to devise a definitive test of the “stigma
hypothesis”, it seems clear that stigma cannot be the only cost facing participants. Other, more
concrete types of transactions costs are probably a good deal more important to most people than
stigma or lack of information. Third, although people generally have means-tested programs in
the United States in mind when they discuss take up, low take up is also a problem in many non
means-tested social insurance programs and in other countries.
Historically, economists have paid much attention to rules about eligibility, and virtually
no attention to how these rules are enforced or made known to participants.

This review

suggests that the marginal return to new data about these features of programs is likely to be high
in terms of understanding take up. The anecdotal evidence that exists, suggests that there is a
great deal of variation in the ways that similar types of programs are implemented both within
and across countries, and this variation could be exploited to identify the most important barriers
to participation.
For example, some states implemented SCHIP as an extension of their Medicaid
programs, while others created separate, stand-alone programs in order to reduce the stigma
associated with receiving public insurance. However, to my knowledge, this difference has not
been exploited to investigate the “stigma hypothesis”. About half of the 109 Food Stamp offices
surveyed in a recent USDA program access study provided services such as extended hours,
while a small number of programs required applicants to attend a series of meetings before they
were even permitted to sign their application forms (Gabor et al., 2003). Procedures such as
requiring third party verification of income are not standardized across locations either, and
27

could easily explain variation in take up across areas. More systematic collection and analysis of
this type of data would add a great deal to the study of take up.
In an era of social experiments, it might also prove useful to consider experimental
manipulations of factors thought to influence take up. For example, it might be possible to
design an outreach program that would directly test the hypothesis that take up is influenced by
information exchange among members of social networks. Similarly, parameters such as
application procedures, recertification intervals, payments for community enrollment assistance,
and incentives to service providers to give application assistance could be varied across areas in
order to study their effects.

Table 1: Take-up of Means-Tested Programs in the United States
Means-Tested Program

Take-up estimates

Reasons for low/high take-up

Selected Literature

Medicaid
Established in 1965. Provides
health insurance for lowincome women and children,
the disabled, and elderly in
nursing homes. Eligibility for
the program greatly expanded
over 80s and 90s to women and
children who were not on
welfare. Income cutoffs depend
on child age, and state.
Projected to serve 34 million
people at a federal cost of $159
billion dollars in 2003 (state
matching cost will be > 100
billion) (Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, 2002).

- As of the early 1980s, children on welfare
were automatically eligible and take-up in
this group was close to full.
-By 1996, 31% of children were eligible, but
only 22.6% were enrolled, for an average
take-up rate of 73% (Gruber, 2003).
- Cutler and Gruber (1996a) and Currie and
Gruber (1996a,b) estimate that of
newly eligible children and women of
childbearing age only 23% and 34%
respectively took up coverage, but many of
these eligibles were already covered by other
insurance.
- Over 35% of births in the U.S. now covered
by Medicaid (NGA, 2002).
- No take-up estimates are available for the
elderly and disabled, although they account
for over two-thirds of Medicaid spending.

- Applicants who are not on welfare may be
required to show birth certificates and/or
citizenship papers, rent receipts and utility bills to
prove residency, and pay stubs as proof of
income. Many states have a time limit on the
number of days the applicant can take to provide
documentation and applicants are often required
to return for several interviews. Up to a quarter of
Medicaid applications are denied because
applicants do not fulfill these administrative
requirements: They cannot produce the necessary
documentation within the required time or fail to
attend all of the required interviews (GAO, 1994).
- Coverage may need to be re-established as often
as every six months.
- Many physicians do not treat publicly insured
patients because of low reimbursement rates.
- Conversely, those who are sick may be able to
retroactively obtain Medicaid coverage.
- The newly eligible may not be aware of their
benefits, particularly if they have not previously
used public programs.

State Children’s Health
Insurance Program

LoSasso and Buchmueller (2002) estimate
take-up rates that range from 8.1% to 14%
of the newly eligible.

- The newly eligible may not be aware of their
benefits, particularly if they have not previously
used public programs.

- Currie and Gruber (1996a) find that the take-up was higher among
newly eligible women who were likely to have had contact with
other welfare programs, than it was among newly eligible women
of higher income levels. May reflect slow diffusion of information
about coverage among new eligibles.
- Currie (2000) finds that immigrant children are more likely to be
eligible for Medicaid but less likely to participate given eligibility.
Probability of participation is higher in larger families and there is a
strong seasonal effect in participation with people most likely to
take-up benefits prior to start of school each year (when
immunizations and checkups for school are mandated).
- Currie and Grogger (2002) find that loss of welfare leads to loss of
Medicaid coverage among pregnant women although most women
leaving welfare remain eligible. They find little impact of state
efforts to reduce non-price barriers to Medicaid coverage, such as
shortening enrollment forms.
- Aizer (2003a,b) compares the effects of application assistance and
advertising on enrollments in California’s Medicaid program. She
finds that while a positive impact of application assistance is found
for children of all ages, the effect of advertising is limited primarily
to infants.
- Aizer and Grogger (2002) find that making parents eligible for
Medicaid increases child coverage. Effects were largest among
black and Hispanic children.
- Card and Shore-Sheppard (2002) find that the expansion of
eligibility to all children born after September 30, 1983 in poor
families led to about a 10 percentage point rise in Medicaid
coverage for children born just after the cutoff date, and a similar or
rise in overall health insurance coverage. Expansions to children
under 6 in families with incomes below 133 percent of the poverty
line had relatively small effects.
- LoSasso and Buchmueller (2002) use CPS data from 1996 to 2000
and find that SCHIP had a small but statistically significant positive
effect on insurance coverage.
- Aizer (2001) finds that gains in enrollment were larger in status
that contracted out outreach for SCHIP.

A block grant to states begun in
1998, SCHIP provides funds to
cover health insurance for
children in families with
incomes > the State’s
Medicaid-eligibility threshold
but<200% of poverty. States
may either expand Medicaid or
develop stand-alone programs.
It is not an entitlement
program.

1

Supplemental Security
Income Program (SSI)
Enacted in 1972, but began
paying cash benefits in 1974.
Provides federal assistance for
aged, blind and disabled
individuals with low incomes.
It has grown to become the
largest federal means-tested
cash assistance program.
Served 6.5 million people in
January 2003, total costs for
2002 were $31.6 billion (Social
Security Administration, 2003).

The Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC)
Established in 1975, it is
now the largest cash
antipoverty program. There
were three large expansions
of the credit in 1986, 1990
and 1993. The EITC grew
from $3.9 million in 1975 ($99)
to $31.5 billion in 2000. It is
estimated that 5 million people
were raised out of poverty by
the credit in 1999 (NGA,
2002).

- Daly and Burkhauser (2003) calculate that
participation among the poor elderly
declined from 78.5 percent in 1974 to 53.6
percent in 1982. Since then, participation
rates have fluctuated from year to year, but
have remained well below the highs recorded
in the early years.
- Recipiency rates among poor working age
adults rose from 14.8 percent in 1974 to 20.7
percent in 1998.
- Recipiency rates for poor children also
increased rapidly during the 1990s, rising
from 2.1 percent in 1989 to 6.6 percent in
1998 due to a change in the definition of
disability for children with Sullivan vs.
Zebley in 1990.
- Estimated participation rates among the
poor elderly range between 45 and 60 percent
(Menefee, Edwards and Schieber (1981);
Warlick (1982); Coe (19 85); Shields et al.
(1990); McGarry (1996)).

- Low enrollment among the elderly could be due
to lack of knowledge about the program and
eligibility criterion; stigma; or transactions costs.
- Participation among low-income working age
adults and among children is also likely to be
affected by the benefits and costs of participation
in SSI relative to other programs.

- Scholz (1994) calculates that 80 to 86
percent of taxpayers eligible for the EITC
received it in 1990.
- The IRS (2002ª) estimated that between
82.2 and 87.2 percent of eligible households
filed tax returns and hence claimed the EITC.
- Scholz (1997) reports that roughly 95
percent of EITC claimants are either legally
required to file tax returns or would file to
recover the over-withheld taxes.

- The marginal cost of obtaining the EITC for
someone who is filing is simply the cost of filling
out Schedule EIC.
- Claiming the credit becomes more likely in cases
where the potential credit is larger and where the
filer´s familiarity with the program and the U.S.
tax system is greater.
- Comercial tax preparation firms can reap
substancial profits by targeting those eligible for
EITC and offering “rapid refunds”.
- The IRS notifies all taxpayers who do not claim
the credit but appear to be eligible for it based on
their filing information.

- Coe (1985) reports that of the SSI nonparticipants classified as
eligible (48 percent of all eligible individuals), a significant fraction
were not aware of the program or did not think they were eligible.
Coe also finds that benefit levels were positively and significant
related to participation.
- Warlick (1982) concludes that lack of program information and
difficulty applying were the primary reasons for low participation
rates among the eligible elderly.
- McGarry (1996) used detailed asset and income information from
the 1984 SIPP to more accurately identify eligibility. She concludes
that participation is determined primarily by the financial situation
of eligible individuals and by their health status and finds little
evidence that welfare stigma or informational program costs affect
participation.
- Daly and Burkhauser (2003) conclude that the elderly poor are not
generally constrained by transaction costs.
- Bound, Kossoudji and Ricart-Moes (1998) found 2/3 of new
applicants for SSI in Michigan between 1990 and 1991, were
people who had been terminated from General Assistance. The
Fact that these people had not applied for more generous disability
payments to begin with, suggests that it is onerous to apply.
- Daly and Burkhauser (1998): two-thirds of children found eligible
for SSI in the early 1990s were in families already receiving some
type of welfare assistance.
- Kubik (1999): a 10 percent increase in SSI benefit generosity
increases the probabilty of SSI participation among families with
less educated heads by 0.39 percentage points.
- Benitez-Silva, Buchinsky, and Rust (2003) estimate that 28% of
SSI/DI applicants who get benefits are not disabled, while 61% of
applicants who are denied are disabled.
- Garrett and Glied (2000) find that the larger SSI benefits are
relative to AFDC, the more likely it is that children switched
programs after Sullivan vs. Zebley made it easier for them to
qualify. There was no effect on adults, who were not affected by
SZ.
- IRS (2002) calculations suggest that the EITC
changes between 1990 and 1996 had relatively little net effect on
EITC participation.
- Hotzblatt (1991), McCubbin (2000), and others find that a
significant fraction of taxpayers receive the EITC when they are not
technically eligilble. Violation of the qualifying child eligibility
criteria (i.e. misreporting a child) is a major reason.
- Hotz, Mullin and Scholz (2000a, 2000b) find that the EITC has
large, positive effects on the employment of adults from welfare
families in California. The implied elasticity of labor force
participation with respect to net income ranges from .97 to 1.69.
- Similarly, Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001) find that the EITC is
responsible for much of the recent rise in labor force participation
among low income single mothers.
- Liebman (2002) matches tax records to CPS data and finds that

2

most overpayments went to families with children and that
ineligible families are likely similar to eligible ones.
-Hotz and Scholz (2003) provide an overview of the recent
literature.

The Temporary
Assistance for Needy
Families Program
(TANF)
Created in 1996 to replace the
Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC)
program. To be eligible,
income must be less than a
state-determined needs
standard. In contrast to AFDC,
the TANF program has strong
work requirements, time limits
on receipt, options for
provision of non-cash
assistance, and by a block grant
financing structure. The
federal block grant has been
16.8 billion through 2002.
States must contribute an
additional 10.4-11.1 billion.

Housing Programs
Began in 1937. Programs
typically reduce rent to 1/3 of
the families income. Most
assistance reserved for
households with incomes less
than 50% of the local median
income. Early programs built
public housing. Since 1982,
most new assistance has been
in the form of voucher
programs. In 2000, 5.1 million
households were assisted at a
cost of $20.3 billion (Green
Book, 2000).

- Recipiency fell from 11.5 to 7.2 million
recipients between 1990 and 1999. In 1990,
12.1% of all children were on AFDC,
compared to 7.2% of all children on TANF
in 1999 (Green Book, 2000).
- Blank (2001) estimates AFDC take-up rates
among familias with female heads over time.
They range from 80 to 90% when she uses
administrative data, and from 60 to 70%
when she uses CPS data for 12 states (twothirds of the caseload). Blank (2002)
summarizes literature investigating whether
the decline in the caseload should be
attributed to welfare reform or to economic
expansion. Welfare reform accounts for
between 1/3 and 2/3 of the decline.
- Moffit (2003b) shows TANF participation
rates over time for single mothers and for
poor single mothers. Both decrease over
time, and are about 40% for single mothers
and 50-55% for poor single mothers. Moffitt
(2003c) shows that non-financial factors had
a large effect on entry and exit from TANF.

- The cost of being on welfare is raised by many
rules that TANF recipients must obey.
- With a few exceptions, the studies show preTANF waivers allowing states to impose work
requirements and other requirements on AFDC
recipients had a negative effect on participation.

- For the entire system of housing subsidies,
the participation rate among eligible
households is far below 50 percent for each
combination of income and family size
(Olson, 2003).
- Reeder (1985) examines the percentage of
households in each income and family size
class who participated in any HUD program
in 1977. The highest participation rate in any
of the 77 classes was less than 25 percent.
For unknown reasons, the poorest households
of each size have very low participation
rates. Within each income class, participation
rates are highest for one-person households,
reflecting the strong preference received by
the elderly in housing programs.

- Assistance is available only to a fraction of
eligible households and many housing authorities
have lengthy waiting lists, and/or closed waiting
lists.
- Participants whose income rises above the
thresholds for admission are rarely terminated,
and local housing authorities are allowed to admit
people with incomes higher than the 50% of
median income cutoff. So persons of higher
income may crowd out persons with lower
income.

- Blank and Ruggles (1996) estimated that single mothers used
AFDC in 62 to 70 percent of the months in which they are eligible.
Women who are eligible but do not participate tend to be older,
white, and nondisabled, with fewer children and more education.
Higher benefits also encouraged participation. These results suggest
that the AFDC was used by those with the greatest long-term need,
and whose alternative earning opportunities were limited.
- Hoynes (1996) and Moffit (1998) estimate participation equations
which confirm that confirm that participation is positively

affected by a guaranteed level of benefits and negatively
affected by the marginal tax rate on benefits. Participation is
also negatively affected by the hourly wage rate available
and by non- program nonlabor income.
- Grogger and Michalopoulos (2003) use data from a randomized
experiment, the Florida Family Transition Program and find that
time limits affect welfare use before they become binding (people
save their 5 years of eligibility for a “rainy day”). In the absence
of other reforms that increased welfare use, FTP’s time limit would
have reduced welfare receipt by 16 percent. Grogger (2003) finds
that time limits had a much greater effect on women with younger
children, since women with older children had no incentive to
conserve eligibility for benefits.
- Wallace and others (1981) compare the fraction of eligible
households and participants in the Section 8 Existing and NewConstruction Programs. For Section 8 Existing they find that in
1979 the percentage of participants who were elderly was about the
same as the percentage of eligibles in this category, that minorities
were a slightly larger fraction of participants than eligibles, and
very-low income households were a noticeably larger fraction of
participants than eligibles. For Section 8 Construction, elderly,
white, females, and small families were greatly overrepresented in
the sense that they were a higher fraction of participants than
eligibles.
- Olsen and Barton (1983) finds that in public housing in New York
City in 1965, blacks had a much higher participation rate (about 20
percentage points) than whites with the same characteristics.
- Crews (1995) used data from 11 metropolitan areas in 1987 and
found that the poorest households, nonwhites, food stamp and
welfare participants, the unemployed, and the elderly had higher
participation rates.
- Currie and Yelowitz (2000) conclude that the participation in
housing programs increases with the size and is influenced by the
sex composition of the family (due to program rules)., It declines
with the age of the head, is much lower for married heads, and is

highest among blacks and those with less than high school
education.

Food Stamp Program
(FSP)
Established in 1961 as a pilot
program and became
nationwide in 1975. It serves
households with gross incomes
< 130% of poverty, without
other categorical requirements.
FSP provides coupons that can
be redeemed for food with few
restrictions on the type of
foods. The federal cost is 19
billion ($1998) and FSP served
20.8 million persons per month
in 1998 (Currie, 2003).

National School Lunch
Program (NSLP)
Established in 1946. It cost 5.8
billion and served 27 million
lunches in 1998 (Currie, 2003).
Lunches are free to those with
incomes<130% of poverty.

The Special
Supplemental Nutrition
Program for Women,
Infants and Children
(WIC)
Begun in 1972 as a pilot
program and became
permanent in 1974.

- Only 69% of households eligible for the
FSP participated in 1994. A 40% increase in
enrollments between 1988 and 1993 was due
mainly to a higher participation rate among
eligibles rather than to an increase in the
number of eligibles (Currie, 2003).
- Take-up of FSP is high among some subgroups of eligibles, but low among others. In
1994, 86% of eligible children participated,
but only one-third of eligible elderly persons.
Virtually all eligible single-parent
households were enrolled compared to only
78% of eligible households with children and
two or more adults. Participation rates were
higher in some state than in others.
Participation rates also tended to fall as
income rose (U.S. Committee on Ways and
Means, 1998).
- Blank and Ruggles (1996) found that
participation in the FSP increased with the
size of the benefits. They also estimate takeup rates that range from 54 to 66 of all
eligibles.
-99% of public schools and 83% all (public
and private) schools participate. Nationally,
92% of students have the program available
at their school (Burghardt et al., 1995).
-In 1996, 57% of the children enrolled in
participating institutions participated in the
NSLP. Eighty-six percent of these
participants received free lunches.
- 87.2% of children 5-17 with incomes less
than 130% of poverty participated in 1998
(Currie, 2003).
- The USDA estimates that 75% of eligible
persons, participated in the program in 1995.
Among infants take-up has been estimated to
exceed 100% (Rossi, 1998).
- Bitler, Currie & Scholz (2003) include
those who were adjunctively eligible through
participation in other programs and calculate
that 58% of all infants in any given month in
1998 were eligible for WIC. The take-up rate
among eligible infants was 73.2%. Among

- Possible reasons for non-participation include:
lack of knowledge about eligibility; transaction
costs associated with enrolling in the program;
and stigma associated with participation.
- Transaction costs: The average FSP application
took nearly 5 hours of time to complete, including
at least two trips to a FSP office. Out-of-pocket
application costs averaged about $10.31 or 6% of
the average monthly benefit (Currie, 2003).

- In addition to the usual reasons for nonparticipation, familias may not enroll in the
program if their children are unlikely to eat the
meals.

- Possible reasons for non-participation include:
lack of knowledge about eligibility; transaction
costs associated with enrolling in the program;
and stigma associated with participation.
- In addition, WIC is not an entitlement program,
so that funds may not be sufficient to serve all
eligibles who present. However, in practice, there
have been no waiting lists in recent years
(National Research Council, 2003).
- Estimates of takeup are complicated by the fact

- Three-quarters of non-participating households said that they were
not aware that they were eligible. Only 7% of households gave
stigma as their main reason for non-articipation, but half answered
affirmatively to at least one of the survey questions about stigma
(Currie, 2003).
- Haider, Schoeni and Jacknowitz (2002) find that many elderly
people who are eligible for FSP say that they do not need benefits,
which may indicate that there is stigma associated with using the
program unless one is very needy.
- Currie and Grogger (2002) show that recertification intervals have
a negative effect on participation. The introduction of electronic
debit cards instead of coupons, which might have reduced stigma,
had little effect.
- Daponte, Sanders and Taylor (1999) conduct an experiment and
find that informing people about their eligibility increases
participation. The effect is greater, the larger the benefit that
people are eligible for.
- Yelowitz (2000) estimates that for every 10 newly eligible
families who took up Medicaid benefits, 4 also took up FSP. This
fact suggests either that those who applied for Medicaid learned
about FSP, or that it was more worthwhile to apply for both
programs than to apply for only one (i.e. that benefits relative to the
cost of applying matter).
- Participation in the NSLP is higher among children from the
poorest families.
- Gleason (1995) finds that the characteristics of the meals are
important determinants of participation. Glantz et al. (1994) find
that if children indicate that they will not eat the meals, then parents
do not apply.
- Burghardt et al. (1993) found that over half of eligible nonparticipants believed they were ineligible, 10% thought the
certification process was onerous, and 20% cited stigma.
- Brien and Swann (1999) show that administrative barriers such as
requiring income documentation discourage people from applying
for WIC.
- Chatterji et al. (2002) show that in addition, restrictions on the
type of food that can be purchased discourage participation.
- Bitler, Currie and Scholz (2003) find that requiring more frequent
visits to WIC offices also has negative effects on participation.

The federal cost is 4 billion

Child Care Subsidy
Programs
First established in 1954.
PRWORA consolidated 4
major programs into the Child
Care Development Fund in
1996. Program provides
subsidies to working/training
families with income<85% of
state median income (or lower
cutoff). Average monthly
number of families served in
1998=907,351 at a cost of $5.1
billion (Green Book, 2003).

Head Start
Established in 1964. A
preschool program for mostly
poor 3 and 4 year old children.
In 2000, Head Start served
860,000 children at a cost of
5.3 billion (see Currie and
Neidell, 2003).

children 1 to 4, 57% were eligible for WIC
and 38% of eligible children received
benefits. Estimates for pregnant and postpartum women are less accurate because of
lack of information about infant feeding
practices: It is estimated that 54% of all
pregnant and post-partum women are eligible
for WIC and that 66.5% of these women
received benefits.

that one must be at nutricional risk to qualify.
However, it appears that virtually everyone who
meets income criteria is likely to meet nutricional
risk criterion (National Research Council, 2003).

- It is estimated that the CCDF serves only
15% of eligible children (Administration for
Children and Families, 1999). There is no
systematic information available on how
CCDF funds are allocated among eligible
children though info is available on type of
care subsidized.
- No figures are available on the percentage
of eligible children served by other subsidy
programs.
- Witte (2002), using administrative data and
survey data for states that guarantee subsidies
for all eligible families, and estimates the
family-level take-up rate for child care
subsidies to be around 40% in early 2000.
There are large variations across states.

- The enrollment process may be particularly
difficult for working parents.
- Some child care providers do not accept state
subsidies.
- It may be difficult to maintain continuous
eligibility for the subsidy if income is variable.
- It is difficult to get information about the various
programs available.
- There is insufficient funding to meet the
demand. In addition to the CCDF block grants,
status reallocated a billion dollars of their TANF
block grants to child care in 1998.

- Meyers and Heintze (1999) examine a sample of current and
former welfare recipients in four counties of California in 1995.
16% of employed mothers received a child care subsidy, 30% of
mothers enrolled in education or training programs received a
subsidy, and 34% of mothers in neither activity received a subsidy
(including Head Start). The acceptance rate of mothers who
applied for a subsidy was 72%.
- Fuller et al. (1999) estimate a model of the child care subsidy
take-up decisions of mothers enrolled in TANF using data collected
in San Francisco, San Jose and Tampa in 1998. Of the women in
their sample who used any non-maternal child care, 37-44 percent
received a subsidy, depending on the site.

- In 2000, about 2/3 of poor 3 to 4 year old
children were served. It is not known how
many of the remaining children were
constrained by lack of supply.
- Black and Hispanic children participate at
higher rates than other children.
- Programs are required to identify and take
the most disadvantaged applicants.

- Most programs are part-day, which means that
they do not satisfy all child care needs of working
families.
- Program has never been fully funded and many
programs have waiting lists.

- Currie and Thomas (1995, 2000, 2002) investigate Head Start
participation. Participation falls with income and maternal AFQT
scores, but is higher at all levels of income for blacks than for
whites.
- Currie and Neidell (2003) find little evidence that children in
high-spending programs are selected differently than children in
low spending programs.

- Participants in other programs including
Medicaid are automatically eligible for WIC.
USDA has ignored this linkage, resulting in
under-estimates of the number of eligibles
and over-estimates of participation rates.

Program

Take-up estimates

Medicare

In 2002, 33,410,000 people were
enrolled in Part A and 32,000,000 in
part B. So the implied takeup of Part
B is 96%.
(http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS).

One reason for high take-up of Part B is that
everyone is automatically enrolled in Part A when
they turn 65 years old and they have to fill out a
form to decline Part B.

McGarry (2002) provides an overview of Medicare:
Part A is financed by a payroll tax instituted for this
purpose and accounts for about 60% of Medicare
spending. Part B is financed from general revenues and
a monthly premium paid by beneficiaries. In 2002, the
premium was $54 per month, and represented about
25% of the cost of the insurance. In addition, enrollees
pay deductible and co-payments on most covered
services.

After the 1984 liberalization of the
Federal Disability Insurance
Program, the fraction of non-elderly
adults receiving DI rose by 60%
(Autor and Duggan (2003)). The
number of beneficiaries increased
from 2.8 million in 1988 to 5.5
million in 2002. The number of
applications increased from 1 to 1.7
million and the number of awards
from 409,000 to 750,000.
(http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/
dibStat.html). These figures suggest
that take-up increased since it is
unlikely that the number of disabled
was rising so rapidly

Applicants provide detailed medical, income, and
asset information to the Social Security
Administration office. Individuals currently in the
labor force are not normally eligible. It is difficult
to estimate the eligible group. Some work suggests
that minorities and low SES people are more likely
to be disabled (Bound et al. 1995, 1996) though
self-reports of disability status may be biased
(Bound, 1991).
Benítez-Silva, Buchinsky and Rust (2004) provide
an overview of the long and complicated
application process.
Yelowitz (1996) concludes that rising health
insurance costs over 1987-1993 were an important
reason for participation in DI, since DI recipients
are automatically eligible for Medicaid.

Blank and Card (1991) estimate a
take-up rate of 70.7 in 1977 falling to
65.8 in 1987. They also find that
rates vary widely across states. Over
1980-82, they find a take-up rate of
83% using micro data and 72% using
state data.

Blank and Card (1991) find that at least half of the
decline in take-up rates over the past decade is due
to a shift in unemployment from high to low takeup states. Benefit levels and state unionization rates
have a strongly positive affect on take-up, while the
disqualification rate. The average number of weeks
worked in the last year in the unemployed pool also
has a negative impact. In individual-level data,
there is little evidence that declining take-up is due
to increasing administrative strictness by state
programs or changes in eligibility. Instead,
demographic variables and household
characteristics are significant determinants.
Krueger and Meyer (2002) note that individuals

Bound and Waidman (1992) find that half of the
decline in labor force participation among men 45-54
between 1949 and 1987 could be due to the expansion
of programs such as DI.
Mitchell and Phillips (2002) find that older people
initially in poor health and of low economic status are
more likely to apply for DI.
Autor and Duggan (2003) find that DI benefits impact
labor supply. State-level reductions in benefits induced
large increases in labor force participation of male and
female high school dropouts from 1979-1984, followed
by large declines during the DI expansion of 19841998.
Benítez-Silva, Buchinsky and Rust (2004) look at the
magnitude of classification errors in the award process
assuming that self-reports of disability status are
correct and find that 28% of the SSI/DI applicants
who are ultimately awarded benefits are not disabled
while 61% of applicants who were denied benefits are
disabled. This is consistent with Bound’s (1989)
earlier finding that less than 50% of rejected DI
applicants work.
While Blank and Card (1991) find that about one
quarter of the decline in take-up is still unexplained,
Anderson and Meyer (1997) use administrative data
from the late 1970s and early 1980s from UI system in
six states, and find that a change in the tax treatment of
UI benefits could be totally responsible for the
unexplained portion of the decline over the early
1980s. (In 1979 UI became subject to income taxes).
Card and Levine (1998) study the effects of changes in
the duration of unemployment insurance on the
behavior of UI claimants. They find that the New
Jersey Extended Benefit Program (i.e. 13 additional
weeks for the large majority who were initially eligible
for 26 weeks of benefits) raised the fraction of UI

Signed into law in 1965. Provides health
coverage for the elderly and disabled.
It consists of two parts: Part A: mandatory
hospital coverage and Part B which provides
optional outpatient insurance. Since 1997 Part
C has provided optional insurance for services
not included in the traditional package.
In 2001 40.1 million persons were covered of
whom 34.4 million were elderly and 5.7
million disabled. Expenditures in 2001 totaled
$241 billion or $6,199 per enrollee.

Social Security Disability Insurance
(DI)
The largest U.S. income replacement program
directed towards non-elderly adults.
Established in 1956, it is an insurance program
that provides monthly cash benefits to workers
who are unable to work because of long-term
severe disabilities. In 2001, it provided
benefits to 6.7 millions individuals at a cost of
$55 billion.

Unemployment
Insurance (UI)
An unemployed worker must satisfy three sets
of requirements: 1) no job in the covered sector
& searching for work; 2) minimum waiting
period; 3) previous minimum level of
earnings, weeks, or hours. Approximately,
97% of all wage and salary workers are in jobs
that are covered by unemployment insurance.
UI benefits are typically paid on a weekly
basis, and typically replace 50-60% of lost
earnings. Federal law levies a 6.2% tax on the
first $7,000 in wages per year and the law

Less than 40% of the unemployed
received UI in the recent years,
because many do not meet eligibility
requirements (Krueger and Meyer
(2002)).

Reasons for low/high take-up

Selected Literature

provides a credit of 5.4% to employers that pay
State taxes under an approved UI system. In
2002, the UI system paid out $41.6 billion in
benefits, and took in $21.4 in revenues
(http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/
contents/data_stats).

Workman’s Compensation
(WC)
Each state runs their own program. Employers
are required to purchase insurance or selfinsure to provide a specific amount of cash
benefits, medical care, and in some cases
rehabilitation services to workers who are
disabled.
In 1985, this program covered 87% of the
workforce and paid out a total of 22.5 billion in
benefits (Krueger, 1990).

Krueger and Meyer (2002) state that
about 97% of the non-federal UI
covered labor force is covered, plus
all federal employees. However,
many workers ineligible for UI are
eligible for WC since workers are
eligible when they begin work. It is
difficult to estimate take-up, given
the difficulty in accurately
identifying the eligible.

who are new entrants or reentrants to the labor
force, who have irregular work histories, or who
quit or are fired are typically ineligible.
Meyer (1995) surveys a series of experiments that
paid bonuses to people who left unemployment and
concludes that such economic incentives affect the
speed with which people leave UI.
Lemieux and MacLeod (2000) find that response to
a 1971 increase in the generosity of the Canadian
UI system increased with an individual’s experience
of the system, leading to long-term increases in
unemployment as individuals who became
unemployed discovered their new entitlements.
Benefits are about twice those of UI and are not
taxable (hence the actual replacement rate may be
near one) (Krueger and Meyer (2002)).

claimant who exhausted their regular benefits by 1-3
percentage points. Moreover, for individuals who were
receiving UI when the extension was passed, the rate
of leaving UI fell by about 15%.
Anderson and Meyer (1997) estimate that a 10%
increase in the weekly benefit amount would increase
the take-up rate by 2-2.5 percentage points, while a
similar increase in the potential duration of the benefits
would increase take-up by .5-1 percentage points. A
tax increase that decreased the value of after-tax
benefits by 10% would lower take-up by 1-1.5
percentage points. Assuming take-up rates of .40-.60,
they estimate benefit elasticities between .33-.60.
Krueger (1990) finds that higher workers’
compensation benefits are associated with greater
participation in the case of men, and that the waiting
period has a substantial negative effect on
participation. In particular, a 10% increase in
temporary total benefits would lead to a 4.6-6.7
percentage increase in workers’ compensation
recipiency overall.
Card and McCall (1995) ask if workers’ compensation
is covering uninsured medical costs. They find that
workers without medical coverage are no more likely
to report a Monday injury than other workers; and
employers are no more likely to challenge a Monday
injury claim – even for workers who lack medical
insurance.
Krueger and Meyer (2002) summarize the empirical
evidence on WC and say that more generous WC is
associated with higher reported injury rates, but that
the effect is small.

Takeup estimates

Reasons for low/high takeup

Selected literature

Working Families’ Tax Credit

Clark and McCrae (2001) find
that official estimates of take-up
of the Family Credit (72%) are
much higher than what they
simulate using the TAXBEN
model: 48%. Take-up rates vary
widely across groups: e.g. 67% of
single parents take-up compared
to 40% of couples. Take-up also
increases with the size of the
benefit.
Brewer et al (2002) estimate takeup rates as over time: 77% in
1993/4 and 81% in 1998/9 for
lone parents (66% and 58% for
couples).

Because the credit operates
through the tax system, stigma
effects should be minimized
(Blundell (2002)).
Dorsett and Heady (1991) note
the close relationship between the
Family Credit and Housing
Benefit (see below). Finds that
HB entitlement is an important
determinant of take-up of both FC
and HB.

Clark and McCrae (2001) find that 26% of people who
received the benefit were not eligible. This may reflect the
fact that the entitlement period is six months regardless of
changes in family circumstances.

A refundable tax credit for low-income
families with children and a adult who
works 16 hours a week or more. It began in
1999 as a replacement for the Family
Credit (introduced in the late 1980s). It is
more generous than FC in terms of
maximum benefits, the income level where
the phase out begins, and the phase-out rate.
Once granted, entitlement continued for six
months, regardless of whether the family’s
financial circumstances changed. It
includes a new nonrefundable Childcare
Tax Credit. In addition, the
nonrefundable Children’s Tax Credit
provides income support to low income
families with children.

Child Benefit
Began in 1945. A universal transfer
program for families with children. Fifteen
pounds (10) a week for the first
(subsequent) child. Normally paid to the
mother. When a child is born, the mother
receives the claim package at the hospital.

Income Support
Formerly called “Supplemental Benefit”.
Means-tested benefits paid to the household
head in workless families, make up the
difference between income and a minimum
guarantee level.

Brewer (2000): Take-up of the
child benefit was almost 100% in
2000-2001.

Brewer (2000): Income Support

take-up is estimated to be
around 80%.
Duclos (1995) take-up among
eligibles (in 1985) is 64%, but
about 82.8% of the value of
the benefit is received. About
6% of recipients are ineligible.

Brewer and Gregg (2001): There has been little change in
the Child Benefit over time.

Duclos (1995) finds that take-up
higher when the value of the
benefit is greater. Less than full
take-up reflects transactions costs.

Brewer and Gregg (2001): Income Support benefit rates
have greatly increased since 1998.

Recipients must abide by a “job
seekers agreement” or risk losing
benefits.

Job Seeker’s Allowance
Begun in 1995, it replaced income support
among the unemployed. Benefits are tied to
previous wages. Must be 18 or older and
have savings less than 8,000 pounds and be
working less than 17 hours per week.

New Deal Programmes
Introduced in 1998. Means-tested programs
for the unemployed. For 18-50 year olds
include personal advisors, a gateway period
of 4 months then one of: training or
education, subsidized work, volunteer work,
public sector employment. Help with
childcare and travel costs. Less intensive
services offered to those over 50, lone
parents, and the disabled (Brewer et al.
2002).

Income Support for Pensioners
(now Minimum Income Guarantee)
provides the difference between ones
weekly income and a minimum benefit
level. MIG will be replaced in 2003 with a
new program called Pension Credit. It is
expected that roughly ½ of elderly will be
eligible for PC (Hancock et al., 2003).

At the end of June 2003, there
were 91,380 youths 18-24
participating (Blundell, 2002).

Participation is compulsory after
6 months for 18-24 year olds and
after 18 months for 25-50 year
olds. Eligible individual who
refuse to participate lose their
entitlement to benefits.

Among those pensioners eligible
for income support in 2000-2001,
between 64% and 78% received
the benefit (Department of Social
Security, 2001)

Forms are complex and those
eligible for small amounts may
not apply. Also, stigma may be
greater for income support than
other forms of support such as
Council Tax Benefit (Hancock et
al. 2003).

Income support for pensioners rose considerably from
1997 to 2002: for example, by 31% for a single pensioner
under 75, and 25% for a pensioner couple where one is
aged 75 or over (Brewer et al, 2002).

Brewer et al (2002) estimates
take-up rates for housing benefits
of : 89% for pensioners, 99% for
non-pensioners with children and,
92% for non-pensioners without
children, in 1999/2000.
Department for Work and

Clark, Giles, and Hall (1999) note
that the Council Tax Benefit is
very complex which discourages
take-up. However, those entitled
to Income Support are
automatically entitled to HB and
CTB and forms are issued

Blundell et al. (1988) use the 1984 Family Household
Survey and find that there is positive relationship between
take-up and the level of entitlement. This support the view
that there may be significant costs (ignorance or stigma)
associated with claiming. Household characteristics affect
takeup rates. The effect of extra household income is to
reduce take-up significantly. Those in local authority

Programs for the Disabled
Incapacity Benefit: A social insurance
program that pays fixed (high/low) benefits
to people unable to work. Requires medical
evidence.
The Severe disablement allowance and
Disability Living Allowance are noncontributory, non means-tested programs
that also make small fixed payments.
Those unable to work may also be eligible
for income support.
Disability working allowance: eligibles
must be in paid work >= 16 hours per week,
with an illness or disability which creates a
disadvantage in securing employment, have
savings of 16,000 pounds or less, and be in
receipt of a qualifying benefit such as
Disability Living Allowance.

Housing Programs
Housing Benefit: A means tested payment
designed to subsidize the rent of those with
low incomes. It is paid by local

councils.
Council Tax Benefit: A means-tested
program that pays the council “rates” of

eligible families. It is the most
commonly received means-tested
program in Britain.

Pensions (2003) estimates that 7%
of elderly eligible for HB do not
receive it, compared to 31% of
elderly eligible for the CTB.

together which is likely to
increase take-up for IS (Hancock
et al., 2003).

rented accommodation are more likely to take-up their
entitlement than those in private rented and rent-free
accommodation. Among those either in or seeking
employment, part-time workers and unemployed with no
record of occupation are more likely to take-up. Those
under retirement age are substantially less likely to take-up
than those over that age. Both age and education have a
negative effect on take-up for the employed/unemployed.
The presence of both additional adults and older children
in the family increases the probability of take-up, although
younger children appear to have no significant impact.
