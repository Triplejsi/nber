A government deficit is said to be 'moneti-ed" when the
central bank purchases the bonds that the government issues to
cover its deficit.

Because of the central bank's balance sheet

identity, such p urchases increase bank reserves unless offset

by other transac tions. By contrast, new government debt
purchased by pri vate parties does not increase bank reserves.

Because of this difference, whether or not a deficit is
monetized is o-ft en thought to have important macro— economi c

ramifications.

And there is considerable evidence that thi 5
-

supposition is c orrect.
This paper

is

organized around two questions; Does

monetization mat ter? and, What factors determine how much

monetization the Federal Reserve will do? Both of these
questions have b een asked before, and my answers will be less
than startling.

My aims are more modest: to bring a bit more

evidence to bear on the issues and to add a few new thoughts to
the discu ssi on.
Sect ion I takes up the first question: For a given
budget

deficit, will nominal or real variables behave differently
depending on whether the new bonds are purchased by the central

bank or by the public? Notice that this is basically the same

as asking; Do open—market operations matter? Virtually all
macro models give an affirmative answer. But some recent
theoretical developments, which I review, suggest that the

issue is a good deal more complicated than indicated by simple

models like the quantity theory or IS—LM. After sorting out

PAGE 2

some theoretical issues that arise in a dynamic context,

I

present some new time series evidence which supports the old
idea that monetization matters.

Section II addresses the second issue: How does the Fed
decide

how much of each deficit to monetize?

First, some

normative rules dictating how the Fed should make this decision

are presented and brie-fly evaluated. Then a gametheoretic
argument is offered to explain why a central bank with
discretionary authority may choose not to monetize deficits at

all and mayinstead do the opposite, i.e., contract bank
reserves when the government raises its deficit! Finally,

I

offer some empirical evidence suggesting that there is a
systematic link between budget deficits and growth in reserves.
This relationship suggests that the Federal Reserve moneti:es
deficits less when inflation is high and when government
purchases are growing rapidly.

I. DOES MONETIZATION MATTER?

Elementary macro models, including both the quantity
theory and IS—LM, suggest that budget deficits have a greater
effect on aggregate demand if they are monetized.
This difference is extreme under the crude quantity

theory. Obviously, if Py=MV and V is a constant, then deficits
increase nominal demand if and only if they are monetized. <1>
A slightly more sophisticated quantity theory, which recognizes
that nonmonetized deficits raise velocity by raising interest
rates, allows for an effect of deficits on aggregate demand.
But the supposition that the effect of money is greater is
maintained.

Essentially the same conclusion emerges from the fix—

price IS—LM model. Figure 1 shows an initial IS—LM equilibrium
at point A. Higher government spending or a cut in taxes
raises the IS curve to IiSi.

If the deficit is not monetized,

the LM curve is unchanged and equilibrium moves to point B;

output rises. But if the deficit is monetized, the LM curve
shifts as well (to L1M1) and output increases even more (point
C).

This is all very simple, but it leaves out much. Among
the important omissions are:
-

(1) wealth effects on the IS and/or LM curves and the

resulting dynamics that are implied by the government budget

constraint;

(2) changes on the supply side of the economy as

higher or lower interest rates affect investment;
(3) expectation al effects set up by the government's

financing decision (which , among other things, intervene
between the real interest rate and the nominal interest rate).

The next three subsections take up each of these in turn.

1. WEALTH EFFECTS AND THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET CONSTRAINT
The government budget constraint states that any excess of

total expenditures

How can this be true in view of Figure 1? Suppose we add
wealth effects to the analysis and assume that government bonds
are net wealth. <2> Start with the case of bond financing

(point B). The additional wealth represented by the new bonds
augments consumer spending and pushes the IS curve further to

the right. At the same time. however, the LM curve shifts
leftward if there is a wealth effect on the demand for money

<3> The net result of these two wealth effects is clearly to
increase r. But the net effect on V seems to be ambiguous.
However, Solow and I showed (as is obvious) that in a stable
system the net impact of the two wealth effects must increase
income.

The

injection

dynamic adjustment proceeds as follows. Each
of bonds increases income, and the process continues

(in a stable system) until the induced tax receipts bring the

budget into balance. The dynamics are similar under money
financing, except that each dollar of newly— created money has
an additional liquidity effect on the LM curve which malr:es Y

rise even faster.

Why, then, do bond—financed deficits have larger effects

in the long run? The reason, loosely speaking, is that bond—
financed

deficits "last longer." More precisely, bond—

financed deficits raise the government's interest expenses
whereas money— financed deficits reduce them. Thus, while each
$1 billion bond issue expands V by less than a $1 billion issue

PAGE 6
of high—powered money, the total amount of new paper assets
that must be created before the deficit is closed is greater
under bond fi nancing.
How do we know that the net result is that V expands more

It also ignores e<pectati ons, the be havior of prices,

and changes in the capital stock, items which I take up next.

2. CAPITAL CCUf1ULTION IND THE LONG RUN
The original paper by Solow and myself allowed -For capital

accumulation and showed that, apart from modifications in the
stability conditions, this wrinkle did not affect the basic

results. However, the model we used maintained the
(inappropriate) assumption of a fixed price level.

PAGE 7
Fortunately, subsequent work established very similar
conclusions in models which deal more satisfactorily with the
price level. <4>

If

-

the labor force and technology are more or less

exogenous, then the long—run effects of monetization depend on

how the capital stock reacts. Neoclassical growth models lead
to the supposition that money financing of deficits is better
for capital formation than bond financing, <5> but adding even
a minimal amount of complexity to standard macro models
introduces enough ambiguity so that even this intuitive
conclusion cannot be derived.

The ambiguities arise from the interaction of wealth
effects and interest elasticities, neither one of which can be

ignored without assuming away the problem. Consider, as an
example, the following simple IS—LM model augmented to include
wealth effects:
(4) y =

c(y—t(y).

Equations (4) and (5) are IS and LM curves augmented to include

-real wealth, a, which is defined in (6). Here r denotes the
nominal interest rate and iT

the

expected rate of inflation.

The difference between M and H is ignored. Equations (7)—(9)

PAGE 8
give the dynamics of the three state variables: P. K, and

either M or B. Equation (7) is the government budget
constraint; equation (8) is an expectational Phillips curve;
and equation (9) updates the capital stock.

The signs of most of the short— run comparative static
multipliers implicit in (4)—(6) can be determined with only the

usual qualitative assumptions. An important exception.
however, is dr/dM which., even ignoring possible effects of M on

expected inflation (about which more later), has the sign of:
CaLy -

(1_L.a)[1_c(1._tI')]

an expression which is negative in the absence of wealth

effects, but ambiguous in their presence. The economics behind
this ambiguity is quite simple. Normally, an increase in II
lowers interest rates by shifting the LM curve to the right.

But the wealth effects of an injection of money shift the UI
curve to the left and the IS curve to the right, thereby

pushing up interest rates. These wealth effects could
conceivably be strong enough to offset the original effect of .M
on the LM curve.
-

As might be surmised, this ambiguity is devastating to

long—run analysis where primary attention focuses on the

behavior of the capital stock. If we do not know in which
direction II pushes r, then we certainly will not be able to
• tell in which direction it pushes K,

In fact, none of the

long—run comparative static derivatives (obtained from

equations (4>—() and from equations (7)—(9) set equal to zero)

PAGE 9
are of determinate sign unless wealth effects are assumed away.

But this is not a legitimate way out of the indeterminacy
because Solow and I (1973) showed years ago that wealth effects
are intimately involved in the stability conditions. <6>
The conclusion, unfortunately, seems to be that theory
will tell us little about the long—run consequences of the
monetization decision. Econometric estimation arid simulation
of quantitative models seem to be the only ways out.

3. THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET CONSTRAINT AND EXPECTATIONS
The dynamic constraints across choices of policy mixes set
up by the government budget constraint bring expectaticDnal

issues to the fore.. The identity points out that today's

deficit and monetization decisions have implications for the
feasible set of fiscal—monetary combinations in future periods.
For example, suppose an expansionary -Fiscal policy today

leads to a large deficit that is not monetized. Future
government budgets will therefore inherit a larger burden of
interest payments, so the same time paths of 6, M, and tax

rates will lead to larger deficits. What will the government

do about this? That depends on its reaction function. For
example, large deficits and high interest rates might induce
greater monetary expansion in the future (the possibility
emphasized by Sargent and Wallace (1961)).

Alternatively, it

might induce future tax increases (the case stressed by Barro

PAGE 10

(1974)), or cuts in government spending (the apparent hope of

Reaganomics).

Yet another possibility is that the government

will simply finance the burgeoning deficits by issuing more and

more bonds. <7>
All of these are live options, and have different

implications for the long—run evolution of the economy. In
fact, under rational expectations, they may have different
implications for the state of the economy today.
As an example of a nor-imonetized deficit, consider

a tax

cut financed by issuing new bonds. Such a tax cut today
enlarges current and prospective future budget deficits,
thereby requiring some combination of the following policy
adjustments:

(1) increases in future taxes;
(2) decreases in future government expenditures;
(3) increases in future money creation;
(4) increases in future issues of interest— bearing
national

debt.

To the extent that the current decisions made by individuals
and firms are

fUture,

influenced by their expectations about the

each of these alternatives may have different

implications for the effects o-f the tax cut today.

For example, if people believe that a tax cut financed by
bonds simply reduces today's taxes and raises future taxes

order
not

in

to pay the interest on the bonds, then consumption may

be affected. This is essentially Darro's (1974) argument.

PAGE 11

Alternatively, people may believe that the policy will
eventually lead to greater money creation.

If

so

the

inflationary expectations thereby engendered may affect their
current decisions in ways that are not captured by standard

behavioral functions. This is essentially the point made by
Sargent and Wallace (1981) in arguing that tight money may be
inflationary.

Still different reactions would be expected if people
thought the current deficit would lead to lower government

spending or to more bond issues in the future. The theoretical
possibilities are numerous, limited only by the imagination of
the theorist. <8>
Rational expectations interact with the government budget

constraint in an obvious way. Feople's beliefs about the
future consequences of current monetary and fiscal decisions
ar-b conditioned by their views of the policy rules that the

authorities will follow. To the extent that these beliefs
affect their current behavior, different perceived policy rules
actually imply different short—run policy multipliers under
rational expectations.
This is easily illustrated in the context o-f the preceding

IS—UI model. Consider the short—run multiplier dy/dg allowing
for a possible effect of g on inflationary expectations via the
mechanisms just discussed.

It follows directly from (4)—(6)

that:

and from the chain rule that:

The first term is the standard (positive) government
spending
multiplier in IS—LM analysis. The second term is the product
of a positive effect of inflationary expectations on output and
an effect of g on i which depends on the factors enumerated
above.

If it is positive, as seems likely, then expectational

effects make the short—run multiplier larger. But it is
conceivable that dir/dg could be zero or even negative.

A key question for policy formulation is: how important
are these expectational effects in practice? This seems to
depend principally on how forward—looking urrent economic
decisions really are.

Take the tax cut example again. Under the pure permanent
income hypothesis (PIH) only the present discounted value of
lifetime alter—tax income flows affects current consumption.
<9> So expectations about future budget policy should have

iniportant effects on current

consumption. But if short-

sightedness, extremely high discount rates, or capital market
imperfections effectively break many of the links between the
future and the present, then current consumption may be rather
insensitive to these expectations and rather sensitive to

current income. Even under fully rational expectations and the

PAGE 13
pure PIH, consumption may depend largely on current income if
the stochastic process generating income is highly serially

correlated. These are issues about which knowledge is

accumulating; but much remains to be learned. The evidence to
date does not lead to the conclusion that long—term
expectations rule the roost. <10>

The other two places where expectations about future
fiscal and monetary policies might have significant effects on
current behavior are wage and price setting and investment.
Investment, of course, is the quintessential example of an

economic decision which is strongly conditioned by expectations

about the future.. Even Keynes knew this! Eut, once again,
there are some real—world considerations that interfere with
the strictly neoclassical view of investment as the
unconstrained solution to an intertemporal optimization

problem. One is that capital rationing may interfere with a
firm's ability to run current losses on the expectation of

future profits. A second is that management may use ad hoc
rules such as the payback period criterion in appraising

investment projects. A third is the emerging "business school'
view that managers are more shortsighted than they "should be"

because they face the wrong incentives. A fourth is that there
may be a strong accelerator element in investment spending,

which ties the current investment decision much more tightly to
the current state of the economy than neoclassical economics

recognizes. As in the consumption example, each of these

PAGE 14
things diminishes the Importance of the future to current
decision making and thereby renders expectational effects less
important.

Wage and price setting is another important example. Ad
hoc rules which adjust wages or prices in accordance

with "the

law of supply and demand," or which are mainly backward
looking, render expectational effects rather unimportant.

contemporary preoccupation with
rational expectations would suggest. For example, how much
current decisions than the

influence does the two—week—ahead weather forecast have on your
decision about whether or not to plan a picnic on a given

date?
Similarly, the importance of expectations for macroeconomic
aggregates is diminished by the likelihood that different
people hold different expectations about what future government
policies are likely to be. <12> If some people believe today's
tax cuts signal higher future taxes, some believe they signal

PAGE 15
higher future money creation, and some believe they signal

lower future government spending, then expectations about the
future may have meager current effects in the aggregate.

The conclusion seems to be that, while we should not
forget about expectational effects operating through the
government budget constraint, neither should we get carried

away by them. There is no reason to believe that they are the
whole show.

4. NEW TIME SERIES EVIDENCE
The two preceding sec tions showed that capital
accumulation and expectati ons considerably complicate
theoretical discussion of the monetization issue. The former

creates complexities that can be handled in principle, but not

in practice. The latter opens up so many possibilities that it
may be intractable even i n principle. Can we let the dat

a

speak for themselves? Th is is hazardous in the absence of a
reliable structural model embodying many of the effects

it

enumerated. What I offer in this section is far less
ambitious: some simple t ime series evidence on whether or not
knowledge of the monetiza tion decision helps predict movements
in nominal GNP, real GNP, and the price level.

The framework for suc h an analysis has been well

established by Granger (1969) and Sims (1972 ), and will not be
repeated here.
(1)

Two points are worth making, however:

Granger—causation has nothing to do with

causation in the

usual sense.

Since it is quite possible,

especially once expectational influences are accounted for.
that the "effect" might precede the "cause," learning that X
Granger—causes V tells us nothing about whether or not V moved
"because of" X.

It means that X adds to the ability to

predict Y, no more and no less.

(2) Whether or not X contributes to the ability to
predict Y may depend on what other information is considered.

Thus, for example, it is perfectly possible that X might
Granger— cause V when some other variable, Z, is excluded from
the regression, but fail to Granger—cause V when Z is
included.

In this context, I will interpret the question

"Does monetization matter?" as asking whether or not changes

in bank reserves Granger—cause nominal GNF growth (or
inflation) once we control for growth of the national debt.

Letting V denote nominal GNP. R denote bank reserves, D
denote the outstanding stock o-f government bonds (including

the portion owned by the Fed), and

a unitary long—run elasticity for bank reserves and a zero

These hypotheses are all testable by standard F tests.

In estimating (13), D was defined as the increase in
government indebtedness to the public during fiscal year t.

Fiscal, rather than calendar, years were used so as to get a

more accurate measure of the deficit. Budget numbers in the
national income and product accounts (NIPA) differ in several
ways from those in the unified budget, and the deficit series
I used differs further from the unified budget owing to the

activities of off—budget agencies. This suggests a
potentially large slippage between, say, quarterly NIPA
deficit numbers and the true government borrowing
requirement.

In order to use the fiscal year as the unit of time,

quarterly data on adjusted bank reserves, P, <14> and nominal

GNP. V, were put on a fiscal year basis. <15> Results from
estimating equation (13) by ordinary least squares over the
period 1952—1981 appear as regressions (1) and (2) in Table 1.

Roughly speaking, the regressions make it look as if only the

first lag of each variable matters. But, in keeping with the
spirit of this sort of work, the "insignificant" variables
were not dropped.

To address this question,

the results from regressions analogous to

equation (13), but using the GNP deflator in place of nominal
GNP.

The results differ from those obtained with nominal GNP
in a number of ways, and are far more favorable to the

quantity—theoretic approach. Unfortunately, in contrast to
the case of nominal GF'IP, some of the results depend on whether

we use the regression with three lags (column 1) or the

SOME SUGGESTED MONETIZ½TION RULES
Before estimating (17) let us consi der some specific rules

that have been suggested for the monetiz ation decision.

MONETARISM
The most famous and most widely—discussed suggestion for a
monetary rule can be attributed, more or less accurately, to

Milton Friedman. Under Friedman's suggested regime, the Fed
would keep the money supply growing at some constant rate
regardless of budget policy and would refuse to deviate from

PAGE 24
the rule for cyclical reasons. Here I interpret this policy as
a constant growth rul e for bank reserves (or for the monetary
base)

Under such a rule the marginal monetizat ion rate,

•

in

equat ion (17), wou ld presumably be zero.

This

is not t he place to offer a comprehensi ye review of

the pros and con S

of

the k—percent rule, but one new element

that has entered the debate in recent years is worth
ment ioning. Some yea rs ago. Solow and I (1 97-:) showed that a

This finding, while derived i n a very simple

and spec ial case with fixed prices, proved to b e remarkably
robust.

Tobin and Bu iter (1976) established a parallel result

for a fu 11 —empi oymen t economy with perfectly fl exible prices.

Pyle

and Turnovsky (1976) and others showed that analogous

results obtain

models intermediate between these two

SUCh as models with an expectations— augmented

Phillips curve.

Recently, McCallum (1981, 1982), Smith (1982) and Sargent
and Wallace (1981) have re—emphasized the importance of this
result for the monetari st policy rule. Though using rather

different models, each has made the same point: that the system
is liable to be dynamically unstable under a policy that holds
both fiscal policy (def med in various ways by the different

authors) and the money supply (or its growth rate) constant.

PAGE 25
The mechanism behind these results is not hard to

understand. Suppose some shock (such as an autonomous decline
iii demand in a Keynesian model) opens up a deficit in the

government budget, and the monetarist regime is in force.

Bonds will be issued to finance the deficit. With both
interest rates and the number of bonds increasing, interest

payments on the national debt will be increasing. But

this

increases the deficit still further, requiring even larger
issues of bonds in subsequent periods, and the process repeats.

Consequently, unless bonds are totally

irrelevant to other economic variables (as in the non—
Ricardian view of Barro (1974)). the whole economy will
explode. <17>

So the stabilizing properties of the monetarist rule are

open to serious question, to say the least. What about its
longer—run effects?
As a long—run defense against inflation, the monetarist

rule seems to be very effective. Although academic scribblers
can, and have, constructed examples of continuous in-flaton

without growth in reserves, my feeling is that policy makers
can justifiably treat these models as intellectual curiosa and
proceed on the assumption that a maintained growth rate of
reserves will eventually control the rate of inflation.

But what about capital formation and real economic growth?

It seems to me that much

of

the c urrent fuss over lack of

fiscal— monetary coordination and the concommitant pressures
for monetization derives from concern over the implications of
the policy mix for investment.

If so, then hard—core

monetarism, which eliminates t he coord ination issue by
eliminating policy, does not look like a very good solution.

better name, Gary Smith (1982) suggested that we call the

policy "bondism" because it treats bonds in much the same way
as monetarism

Under the

Fr iedman policy, the marginal monetization

rate would be unity, not zero. Speci4ically, Friedman

PAGE 27
suggested that government spending and tax rates be set
according to allocative considerati ons so as to balance the
budget on average, and that all def icits be financed by
creation of money. <19> Both McCall urn (1981. 1982> and Smith
(1982) observed that this policy regime is equival ent to the

"money financing" scenario in Blinder and Solow (1 973), and

hence probably leads to a stable system. On this score alone,
it has much to recommend it over monetarism.

But there is more to the story. Consider what

WCL(l d

happen when, for example, a deficiency of aggregate demand

brought on a recession. Falling incomes would open up a budget
deficit, and this would aL(tomatically induce the Fed

the notion that cyclic al disturbances would probably be quite

should

not be a major worry.

Monetary expansions should

subsequent ly be reversed by monetary contractions. <20> If the

PAGE 28
rule is believed, even large injections of money should not
raise the spectre of secular inflation.
While I have never been an advocate of rigid rules,, it

seems to me that all this adds up to a clear conclusion: the
old Friedman rule ought to get more serious quantitative
attention and the new Friedman rule ought to get less.

2. GAME THEORY AND MONETIZATION
We have seen that it has been suggested that the optimal
marginal monetization rate is zero and that the optimal

marginal monetization rate is one. These suggestions would

seem to bracket the relevant alternatives. ut such is not
necessarily the case once we remember that stabilization policy
in the United States is in the hands of two independent
authorities, one in charge of fiscal policy and the other in
charge of monetary policy, with neither one dominating the
other. <21>
When the two policy makers are at loggerheads, a policy
mix of tight money and loose fiscal policy frequently results,
with deleterious effects on interest rates and investment. <22>
What outcome does theory lead us to expect when fiscal and
monetary policy are in different hands and the two parties have
different ideas about what is best for the economy?
A natural way to conceptualize this situation is as a

twb—person non—zero—sum game. And a natural candidate for what
will emerge, it seems to me, is the Nash equilibrium. Why the

PAGE 29

This explains the entries in the payoff matrix (Figure 2).

Now where is the Nash equilibrium? The example is a case of
the Prisoners' Dilemma since each player has a dominant

strategy. Specifically, if the Fed raises bank reserves, the
administration will plan for a higher deficit and the Fed will
wind up

with

its least— preferred outcome (the lower righthand

box). So the Fed will reduce bank reserves, Knowing this, the
administration's best strategy is to raise the deficit, so the

outcOme will be the lower lefthand box. Clearly, this is the
only Nash equilibrium for this game. It also seems to be the
most plausible outcome of uncoordinated but intelligent
behavior.

But notice two interesting aspects of this outcome.

First, the deficit goes up and bank reserves go down; looked
at from the perspective of equation (17), the marginal

monetization rate is negative
Second, both the Fed and the fiscal authority agree that
the upper riqhthand box —— easy money plus tight fiscal policy
——

is

superior to the Nash equilibrium. Under full monetary—

fiscal coordination, they might well select this policy mix.
But, if they cannot reach an agreement, then the Nash
equilibrium —— a Pareto— inferior outcome ——

is

likely to

ar i se.

If

this

example is typical, then switching from a system

of two uncoordinated policy makers to one with a single,

PAGE 31
unified policy maker might yield substantial gains.

And there

is good reason to think that it is typical, because it has long

been known that there is no reason to expect Nash equilibria in
two—person non— zero— sum games to be Pareto optimal.

The problem • of course, is that achievi ng greater
coordination is more easily said than done.

The two

authorities have reasons for disagreei ng —— reasons which may
not be easily ir oned out. <23> However

this

example

illustrates that full coordination (wh ich is probably
impossible in an y event> may not be cri tical. What we need in

this case is no more than an agr eement to consult

with

one

another enough t o avoid outcomes that b oth parties view as

inferior. Maybe this is not too much to ask.
However, th ings become far less clear if one policy maker

lacks knowledge of either the preferences or the economic model
of the other.

Then there is no particLilar reason to think the

Nash aquilibri urn wi 11 result, and other solutions become
equally plausi ble.

For e>a.mp le, each player may simply pursue

his global optimum, ignoring the decision of the other. There
are other

possibi 1 i ties

as well. <24>

3. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON MONETIZATION
Econometric study of the Fed's "reaction function" began
some years ago and has generated some interesting papers.

In

recent years, several authors have investigated whether or not
Federal deficits per se increase the growth of money

PAGE 32

(presumably via monetization).

The evidence obtained so far is

decidedly mixed.

PREVIOUS LITERATURE
The first papers to focus on the monetization issue, by
Barro (1978) and Niskanen (1978>, reached more or less the same

conclusion: that the size of the federal deficit has rather
little to do with money growth.

Barro studied the period 1941—1976,

using an

equation he

had developed elsewhere to divide money growth into anticipated

and unanticipated components. He found that the federal
deficit (NIFA basis), when added to his annual regression
(which included a federal expenditure variable), obtained the
"wrong" sign. suggesting that deficits actually deter money

growth. However, when the expenditure variable was omitted,
the coefficient of the deficit was corr ectly signed. In view

of the literature that followed, it is also worth mentioning
that the estimated coefficients of the deficit in Barro's
regressions changed dramatically when the war years (1941—1945)
were excluded from the sample.
-

Niskanen's specification looked more like a traditional

reaction function. Using annual data covering 1948— 1976, he
sought to explain money growth by the lagged growth rates of
real GNP and prices (reflecting stabilization objectives) and

the federal deficit. His regression fit the data rather poorly
but, unlike Barra's, yielded a correctly signed and

statistically significant coeflicient on the deficit. However,

PAGE 33

Niskanen found that the coefficient of the deficit became small
and insignificant when he included a dummy variable for the
years 1967—1976.

Hamburger and Zwick (1981) changed Barro's money growth and
government spending variables to make them more comparable to
his measure of the deficit and also to align them better in

time; they also shortened the period to 194—1976.

Consistent

with Barro, they obtained a coefficient of 1..C)9 (with a t—ratio

of 2.2) on spending and a coefficient of —0.26 (with a t—ratio
of 0.6) on the deficit. However, when they further shortened

the period to 1961—1976 (leaving Just 16 observations) the

results changed dramatically. The coefficient of the spending
variable fell to 0.18 (and became insignificant) while the
coefficient of the deficit rose to 0.92 (with a t—ratia of
1.9).

These results appear to tell us as much about the extreme
sensitivity of the estimates to the choice of sample period as
they do about whether or not the Fed monetizes deficits.
However, in a very recent paper Hamburger and Zwick (1982)
extend their results through 1981 with very little change in
the estimates.

These studies lead to no firm conclusions about the

determinants of monetization. <2> However, they do create a
skeptical attitude about facile assertions that deficits induce

faster money growth. More importantly, the studies teach us
some valuable lessons about the formulation c-F. an approprate

PAI3E 34

research strategy. Specifically:
(1) Results are extremely sensitive to the choice of time

period, suggesting that the Fed's behavior pattern may have

changed over time. This led me to do considerable testing of
the estimated relationships for temporal stability.
(2> Results are also rather sensitive to the particular

time series that are used, suggesting a relationship that is

far from robust. This led me to pay careful attention to the
measurement of certain variables ——

especially

"money" and "the

deficit" —— and their alignment in time. <26>
A FIRST LOOK AT THE DATA
My point of departure is equation (17), which can be
thought of as a modified version of the government budget

constraint. Until we specify the nature of

more fully, all

this equation does is remind US that (a) "monetization" means
creation of high—powered money, not of any of the standard M's,

and (b) currency changes ought to be controlled for in
analyzing the determinants of changes in bank reserves.

Figure 3 plots the change in adjusted bank reserves
against the increase in the outstanding stock of government

interest—bearing debt. As in the regressions in Section L4,

the fiscal year is the unit for measuring time. The scatter
diagram covers fiscal years 1949 through 1981.

Though the measure of "money" is quite different from that
used in earlier studies, <27> we see immediately that more
subtle techniques will be required to unearth a relationship

claim to rob ustness) .

equations that had been

estimated on the ful 1 sample (1949—1981) were esti mated on

subsamples to see wh ich empirical relationships survi ved.

these cri ten a were the rate of inflation (lagged, to mini mi ze
least squares bias) and the rate o-F growth of real federal

period. According to this regression, 7.67. of any deficit
would be monetized if there were no inflation last year and

real purchases were unchanged. Both inflation and growth of
purchases tend to decrease the fraction of the deficit that is

monetized. The coefficient of currency is reasonable. The
explanatory power of the equation (R2..36) is moderate, at
best. <30>
Regressions (3) and (4) break the sample into two
subperiods, 1949—1960 and 1961—1981.

This break point was

prompted both by the Hamburger—Zwick results and by the
observation that several of the residuals for years prior to

1960 were quite large. Although Levy placed the break in his
regression after 1969, a series of regressions confirmed that
the 1960/1961 break created a local minimum in the combined sum
of squared residuals of the two equations.
Substantial differences emerge between the two equations.

The effect of inflation on the rate of monetization is only
about one—seventh as large in the later period, suggesting a

greater tolerance of inflation. The coefficient of currency is
reasonable in the later period, but unreasonable in the earlier

period. The Durbin—Watson statistic is also far better in the
later period.

In general, the equation performs much better in

1961—1981 than it does in 1949—1960.

It is tempting to conclude that a stable relationship has

PAGE 38
existed since 1961, but not before, which would help explain

some of the earlier results. To test this notion further, the
time period for the 1961—1981 regression was changed by
alternatively adding or subtracting a year from the start of
the sample.

I found a remarkably stable relationship as the

period was shortened to begin later than 1961. For example,
the regression over 1968—1981 (which has only 14 observations)
is reported as regression (5) in Table t.

Except for the

currency coefficient, it looks amazingly similar to regression

(4). There was considerably less stability as the sample was
lengthened by beginning earlier than 1961, however. As an
illustration, regression (6) reports the results for the
1954—1981 period.

Two further tests for equation stability were performed.
First, the equation for 1961—1981 was differenced, a procedure
suggested by Plosser and Schwert (1978) as a test for

specification error. The estimates changed little, which
provides further support for the specification.

(Changes were

greater for the 1949—1960 regression, where we are a bit short

on degrees of freedom.) Second, a Chow test was performed to
for evidence of a structural shift starting in 1973,

look

the period of floating exchange rates. The F statistic for
this test was nearly zero.

The implied marginal monetization rates for the two
periods, based on regressions (3) and (4) in Table L1,

OTHER RESULTS
The measure of the Federal deficit used in the empirical
work violates elementary princi pies of i nflation accounting

because it fails to net out the decrease in the real value of
the outstanding debt caused by i nflation.

Putting the same

PAGE 40
point somewhat differently, it fails to include the implicit

receipts from the inflation tax. Should the deficit be
corrected for inflation?
If we want to model the Fed as a rational government
bureau free of inflation illusion, then it is hard to argue

against making the correction. True, it is the entire
(uncorrected) deficit that must be financed by selling bonds.

But some of these "new" bonds merely replace existing bonds

whose real values are eroded b' inflation. Since we do not
count rollover as part of the government's borrowing
requirement., neither should we count the portion of the

putative deficit that merely maintains the real value of the
existing debt.

On the other hand, casual empiricism suggests that it is
only a minority of economists and accountants who are free o-f

this particular form of inflation illusion. If we are
interested in describing how the Fed actually behaved, rather
than how it should have behaved, then perhaps the uncorrected
deficit is the appropriate variable to use.

In fact, when I ran regressions like those in Table
using the inflation— corrected deficit, the fits of the

regressions deterioriated enormously. The adjusted R2 for the

new version of regression (2) actually became negative! In
other words, whatever success we have in explaining
monetization of the uncorrected deficit completely disappears
when we seek to explain monetization of the corrected deficits

PAGE 41

This leaves two possibilities. Either we have a passable model
of the monetization decision of a Federal Reserve which suffers
from inflation illusion, or the Fed is free of inflation
illusion but its behavior is unpredictable.

I am personally

inclined toward the former view, but the data admit of both
interpretations.

A second issue is raided by Barro's non—Ricardian
equivalence theorem.

I have tacitly accepted the view that

taxes are something quite distinct from debt by taking debt and
money as alternative ways of financing the excess of

expenditures over tax receipts. But, if debt and taxes are
equivalent,.then the true decision is among current taxes,

future taxes (i.e., debt), and money as alternative ways of

financing government expenditures. On this view, expenditures,
not the deficit, should be the independent variable in a
regression explaining money creation.

To study this issue, I disaggregated the deficit into
three additive components ——

outlays,

tax receipts, and net

off—budget borrowing —— and re—ran the regressions in order to
test the following two constraints:
-

U)

that outlays and the off—budget deficit have the same

coefficient;

(ii) that the coefficient of tax receipts is equal and
opposite to that of outlays.
Both constraints are imposed by the regressions in Table i, and

the results strongly supported them. Not only did an F test

PAGE 44

III. SUMMARY

- Simple- "old—fashioned K:eynesian" macro models suggest that
budget deficits always expand aggregate demand., but that their

effects are stronger if

they

are monetized; that is., monetary

policy matters.

The time series evidence on nominal GNF' growth offered

here, though incapable of giving structural information, is
consistent with these ideas.

In-Formation on changes in bank

reserves helps predict nominal I3NP changes, even when changes

in government debt are controlled for. Symmetrically, changes
in outstanding debt are a significant predictor of nominal GNF
changes even after controlling for changes in reserves.
If we focus on inflation rather than nominal BNP growth,

however, more surprising results are obtained. Growth in
government debt is a significant predictor of inflation, even
after growth in bank reserves are controlled -For.

But,

surprisingly enough, the evidence that bank reserves
contributes anything to the prediction of inflation that is not
already supplied by debt is decidedly mixed.

The received theory gives us far less guidance on long—

run issues. Some ambiguities arise from interest elasticities
and wealth effects; others arise from complexities stemming
from the reaction of expectations. A believable empirical
model for addressing these issues is sorely needed, but has yet

whole, the

statistic fell to 1.18, giving strong evidence of

estimates conformed reasonably well to the constraints. By
contrast, the non—Ricardian equivalence hypothesis would seem
to call for a coefficient of zero on taxes, a restriction that
was easily rejected.

point of view of this hypothes is) Finally, the lagged
dependent var iable was totally in significant when added to the

using money growth as the dependent variable. (See footnote

29).
There is still one further possibility. Perhaps the Fed
really ignored deficits, but systematically reacted to either

to be developed.

If the coefficients of the time series

regressions are interpreted as reduced form multipliers, they
imply that both monetized and nonmonetized deficits have
sizable, though not always statistically significant, long—run

effects on nominal GNP and prices. But this "evidence" is no
more than suggestive, if that, given the non— structural
approach that has been followed.

I regard the question as

open.

While the Fed has not followed any rigid monetization
rule, its postwar behavior comes far closer to the "new
Friedman" monetarist rule (no monetization at the margin> than
it does to the "old Friedman" bondist rule (complete

monetization at the margin>. But when inflation has been high,
the Fed typically has reduced bank reserves despite government

deficits; that is, monetization has been negative —— an

outcome "predicted" by the game—theoretic analysis of monetary
and fiscal policy presented here.

In general, the empirical relationship between budget
deficits and the creation or destruction of bank reserves seems
far more stable and systematic than previous research would

lead us to believe. However, the relationship appears to date
only from 1961 or so.
This paper has focused on two empi rical questions. The

tentative answer s suggested here are:

matter ——

certai nly

Yes, monetization does

for real variables, and maybe for nominal

variables as wel 1. nd: the Fed seems to look chiefly at the

PAGE 46
inflation rate and the growth rate of real government purchases
in deciding what fracti on of the deficit to monetize.

I would

like to close, however, by posing a theoret ical question:

Exactly why does the monetization decision matter?
The question is both deep and vexing.

The usual story ——

that easy (tight> money creates a surplus (shortage> of the
medium of exchange which, in turn, spurs (retards) economic
activity ——

strains

the credulity of many observers. Vet money

creation does seem to have real effects in practice. Why?
One possibility, raised first by Tobi n (1970) and recently

by King and Plosser (1982), is that money simply reacts

passively to real activity. On this view. money has no causal
role; real activity simply pulls money al or-ig,

creating

statistical correlation with no causal mterpretation.

a

I have

some sympathy with this view.. However most economists,, and
virtually all businessmen, seem to thi nk they can identify

periods in which tight money led to a downturn in economic
activity.

A second possibility, which Joseph Stiçljtz and I (1982)
are developing in a

f or thcoming

paper, is that creation of new

bank reserves leads to an expansion of credit which loosens
quantitative constra in ts that were previously binding. On this
view, the statistica 1 correlation between money and real

economic activity is no accident, but it merely reflects their
mutual connection to the same important phenomenon ——
and flow of credit.

the

ebb

PAGE 47

Neither of these views has yet been fully worked out and
subjected to empirical testing.

It may be that neither will

prove correct. But little progress can be made in resolving
the theoretical issues pertaining to monetization until we have
a more convincing story of why monetary policy has real effects
in the first place.

13. Nothing in the Granger—Sims methodology, which is

atheoretic, tells us in what form to enter the variables. The
form of equation (13) is suggestive of a theoretical model in
which asset stocks influence income flows, like the quantity

theory. By contrast, in Keynesian models the flow of income
depends on the stock of reserves, but on the flow of additions
to the national debt (i.e., on the deficit ).

This

motivated me

to experiment with a reformulation of equation (13) in which

replaced AD. However, this alternative version had less
explanatory power than equation (13) in al most every regression
I ran.

The series comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.

amounts to the same thing. It is the schedule relating money

17. In a complex system, many more things are going on than I

can describe in a single paragraph. For example, income and
prices are changing, with important consequences for the budget

deficit. Vet the basic mechanism described here seems to come
shining through in all the models.

18. Or unless inflation itself is sufficiently damaging to
investment via, for example, the deterioration of the real

value of depreciation allowances. This last factor has been
stressed in a number of places by Feldstein. See, among
others, Feldstein (1980).

19. There is no distinction between money and high—powered

money under Friedman's plan, since part of his plan was the
elimination of fractional reserve banking.

20. This statement is predicated on defining high employment as

approximately the natural rate. With a Humphrey—Hawkins type
definition of high employment, the old Friedman rule can lead
to inflationary- disaster.

21. In reality, things are more complicated still because the
President and Congress often disagree over national economic

policy. A model with three stabilization authorities may be
better.

24. In the simple example of Figure 2, "going it alone" also

leads to the Nash equilibrium. But this is not generally true.
A fuller discussion of some alternatives appears in Blinder

25. McMillan and Beard (1982) study the same issue, reaching
conclusions opposite from those of Hamburger and Zwick (1981).

But Hamburger and Zwick (1982) argue that this is because
McMillan and Beard fail to align the data correctly in time.

A

fifth study, far similar in spirit to my own, is that of Levy
(1981).

I will comment on Levy's work as I present my own

results.

26. Hamburger and Zwick (1981, 1982) obtain stronger results
when they use a better measure of the deficit, a measure which

is similar to my own. They also stress the importance of
properly aligning the data in time.

PAGE 6

to my own

The main dilference is that he uses (quarterl y)

changes i n the adjusted base, whereas I use (annual) changes in

adjusted bank reserves. Viewed from the perspective of
equation (17), Levy's choice imposes a coefficient of —1 on
dC/dt.

As will be seen below, the estimated coefficient is

closer to zero.

28. To correct for potentially severe heteroskedasticity, all

variables were divided by nominal GNP.

Also, to allow for some

"trend" prcvisi on of reserves even in the absence o-f deficits,

a constant was added to the regression.

29. Barro (1978). Hamburger—Zwick (1 981), and McFlillan— Beard
(1982) all found the lagged value of money (not reserves) to be

important. Levy's (1981) study of changes in reserves also
found a significant lagged dependent variable, but he worked
with quarterly data.

30. Levy (1981 ) estimated a (constant) marginal monetization
rate o-f 6.47. f or the period 1952—1978, quite close to my

estimate. The two equations cannot be compared in terms of
goodness of fi t because Levy did not make the correction for

heteroskedast i city mentioned in footnote 2, used quarterly
data, and got much of his explanatory power from the lagged
dependent van able and seasonal dummies.

I presume the fits

PAGE 7
are comparable, and so cannot agree with his conclusion that
"any implication that the largest portion of monetary policy is

random (should) be rejected" (p.!65).
