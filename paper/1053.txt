December 1982

The Accuracy of Individual and Group
Forecasts from Business Outlook Surveys

Abstract

This paper reports on a comprehensive study of the distributions of
summary measures of err1r for a large collection of quarterly multiperiod
predictions of six variables representing inflation, real qrowth, unemployment,
and percentage changes in nominal GNP and two of its more volatile components.
The data come from surveys conducted since 1968 by

the

National Bureau of

Economic Research and the American Statistical Association and cover more than
70 individuals professionally engaged in forecasting the course of the U. S.
economy (mostly economists, analysts, and executives from the world of corporate

business and finance). There is considerable differentiation among these forecasts, across the individuals, variables, and predictive horizons covered.
Combining corresponding predictions from different sources can result in
significant gains; thus the group mean forecasts are on the average over time

more accurate than most of the corresponding sets of individual forecasts. But
there is also a moderate deqree of consistency in the relative performance of a
sufficient number of the survey members, as evidenced in positive rank
correlations among ratios of the individual to group root mean square errors.

I. Introduction

Empirical

studies of

forecasts and expectations based on survey data have

qenerally concentrated on the performance of time series of averaqes of the

participants' responses. As a rule, these represent means or medians for
groups whose size and composition vary over time. This raised the possibility
of serious aggregation errors due to the neqiect of the cross—section and dis-

tributional aspects of the data: differences among the individuals and subgroups; sampling variation; consistency and representativeness of the employed

averages. That such matters can be important is not in doubt, hut they seem to
have attracted relatively little attention in the literature.1
This paper examines the accuracy of a larqe number of individual forecast
series and of the corresponding average forecast series from a quarterly survey
conducted by the author for the National Bureau of Economic Research in collab-

oration with the American Statistical Association. The survey questionnaire is
mailed by the ASA in the middle month of each quarter to a list of persons who
are professionally enqaqed in forecasting the course of the economy, and

regular reports on the results are released in the third month.2 The respondents are economists,. mainly from corporate business and finance hut also from

independent consulting firms, qovernmemt aqencies, academic and research

1An early study which dealt with certain characteristics of the relation
between aggregate and individual forecasts is Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 123—126. A
recent analysis of disaqqreqated data from surveys of inflation forecasts is
Figlewski and Wachtel, 1981.
2The reports, prepared by the NBER, are now published in the NBER
Reporter, and in AmStat News. They discuss mainly the median predictions of
current interest, For some of the broader historical evaluations, see Moore,
1969, 1977; ZarnOwjtz, 1972, 1979; Fair, 1974; Christ, 1975; McNees, 1975,

organizations. This study covers 79 individuals (persons or firms) who
participated in at least 12 of the 42 surveys in the period from 1968:4 through

1979:1.
The forecasts relate to rates of change in four variables:

gross national

product in current and constant dollars (labeled GNP and RGNP); the GNP impli—
cit price deflator (IPD); and consumer expenditures for durable qoods (CEDG).

that is, as differences, predicted level minus actual level. These series,
unlike the others which have strong upward trends, can be treated as

stationary. Here it is the levels that are of primary interest, not the rates
of change as in the cases of RGNP (real qrowth) and IPD (inflation).

The questions addressed are the following: How accurate are the individual forecasts relative to the corresponding group averages? How representative

behavior and performance will be taken up in other papers.5

41n contrast, forecasts of averaqe changes over increasing spans
(0—1, 1—2, ...) have overlapping tarqet periods, and they are therefore
necessarily intercorrelated. On the definitions, measures, and merits of level
and chanqe errors, see Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 32—35, now 1979, p. 6, and Mcees,
1973., pp. 7—10.

(denoted

responded to the same surveys. In our simplified notation, the RMSE for the

Ratios of root mean square errors, Mj/Mqj provide convenient measures of
relative accuracy of individual forecasts. They are comparable in a way in
which absolute errors for sets of predictions that differ in tarqet dates are
riot.

The qroup averaqes represent an important benchmark of forecasting

performance that is reasonably accessible and, as shown
efficient.

The Mj/Mqj Ratios: Individuals vs. Group Averages

Inspection of qraphs for 30 d-istrihutions of ratios of root mean square
errors,

Mj/Mqj (one for each of the six variables and five target quarters)

shows that every one of them is skewed to the riqht. This is illustrated in

and 03,

respectively. It is clear that only minorities of the individuals had ratios
of less than 1, that is, outperformed the qroup averages over time.
Summing up the evidence from all such qraphs (for 00, ..., Q4), the best
(lowest) iatios fall between 0.7 and 0.9, the worst (hiqhest) between 1.4 and

2.2. The means of the ratios (marked M) are all located to the right of the
unity (broken vertical) lines. The histograms tend to qet tiqhter and also,
often, less skewed for the more distant quarters.8

Table 1 shows that the mean ratios are remarkably close: when rounded,
all but nine of the 30 statistics are 1.1. The higher mean ratios, ranging
from 1 .2 to 1 .4, refer to the shortest predictions, for QO and, less so, for

Q1, The standard deviations of the Mj/Mqj ratios tend to decreaase stronqly
with the distance to the tarqet quarter, from QO to 39 An exception is CBI,
where the horizon of the expectations apparently does not matter much (all the
means are approximately 1.1 and the decline in the dispersion of the ratios is
very small).

The proportions of the better—than—average forecasters (Mj/Mqj < 1) vary
strongly with the tarqet quarter for some variables, much less so for others.
Thus for IJR the rariqe is 8 to 42 percent, for CBI it is only. 29 to 38 percent.

Averaqed across Q0—Q4, the figures fall between 20 percent for GNP and 33
percent for CEI (see the last section of Table 1).
It is known from past studies (and shown again below) that the averaqe
accuracy of forecasts varies considerably across the individuals, variables,.

and target periods. Highly volatile series such as CEDG and CBI are much more
difficult to predict than relatively smooth, trend—dominated series such as

GNP. In general, the uncertainty and difficulty (hence errors) of prediction
tend to increase for the more distant future. . The remarkable degree of

standardization in the

ratios stands in sharp contrast to the diversity

of the avraqe accuracy measures for the individuals, M.

9The series for QO, QI, 02, and Q3 start in 1968:4, 1969:1, 1969:2, and
1969:3, respectively, and extend throuqh 1979:1. The series for Q4. start in
1969:4 and end in 1979:1 but miss the first three quarters in 1970, 1971:1, and
1975-:3 (because a few surveys did not ask for the Q4 predictions). For these
reasons, the number of the surveys covered is 42 for QO, 41 for Qi, 40 for 02,
39 for Q3, and 33 for Q4. Our comparisons are somewhat impaired by these disparities; in particular, the relatively larqe fiqures for 04 compared to those
for Q3 probably reflect the drop in survey coveraqe.

The advantage of the group means Mgi is the greatest for the nearest
targets and it becomes less and less important as the predictions reach out

further into the future. One may speculate that the individual forecasts for
QO and Qi contain more independent information than those for Q2-Q4, hence the
qains from averaging are larger for the former than .f or the latter.1° The

abilities to predict CBI are particularly limited, even for the nearest

quarters, so here the means and dispersion of the ratios Mi/Mgi depend little
on the distance to the target quarter (j = 0, 1, .

. •, 4).

Earlier data, on predictions by members of a larqe group of business
economists organized into the New York Forecasters' Club,

produce

similar

results. The distributions of Mi/Mgi ratios for six—rnonthand twelve—month
forecasts of industrial production in 1947-63 show strong positive skewness,
with most of the values falling between 1 .0 and 1.3, the classes below 0.8

almost empty, and the average values all concentrated in the narrow range, 1.11.211

These findings indicate that it is difficult for most individuals to

predict consistently better than the group. Contemporaneous expectations for a
given target may be distributed more or less symmetrically about their mean,

but over time the individuals' positions within these distributions are likely

10Th large means and standard deviations of the ratios for QO may be
associated with the disparities in the quality of the current data available to
different individuals. Although the survey questionnaire provides the most
recent information on the values of the series to he predicted, some respondents choose to use different jump-off levels which may he more or less accurate. It is not quite clear why the figures for the shortest predictions of UR
should be particularly high, as Table 1, column 4, shows them to he, but it is
suqqestive that this is the only variable covered for which utonthly data are
available. Some individuals are likely to laq behind the majority inabsorbinc

spotty, with but transitory spells of relatively high accuracy. A series of
group averages has the advantage that it is helped by the cancellation of
individual errors of opposite sign.

Rank

Tests of Predictive Consistency
Success in

one class of predictions (say, for GNP in Q1) may or may not

coincide with success in another class (say, GNP in Q4, or for IPD). If the
degree of coincidence wre very low (e.g., if very few people managed to "beat"
the group mean in more than one class), then the success, being rather isolated, might be attributable more to chance than to better techniques or
skills.

-The NBER—ASA survey participants have been ranked accordinq to the Mi/Mgi
ratios for each of the variables and target quarters covered. The correlations
among the resulting ranks could be either close to zero (indicatinq very little
consistency in the relative performance of the forecasters across different
variables or predictive spans) or significantly necative (those who succeed in
one category tend to fail in another) or significantly positive (those who
succeed in one category also tend to succeed in others).
The rank correlations are presented in Table 2, both across the variables
for each target quarter (part I) and across tarqet quarters for each variable

(part II). All the correlations are positive and in qeneral they appear to be
significantly so (see note in the table)

Thus there is some degree of con-

sistency in the predictive performance of the individuals as revealed by

their Mi/Mgi ranks.

closely related, the correlations are much lower (e.g.,

p =

0.23 for CEDG and

IPD, and also for CEDG and UR). However, only 15 of the 75 coefficients (P
in part I of the table are less than 0.2. The overall mean of the p
statistics is 0.36.

For any of the variables, people who rank high (low) in predicting one

quarter also tend to rank hiqh (low) in predicting the next quarter. The
p's for 90—91 average 0.61, those for 91—92, Q2—Q3, and 93—94 average 0.52—
0.55 (see part II of Table 2). For non—adjoining target periods, the rank
correlations are lower,

p being 0.40 where the distance is two quarters (90—

92, 91—93, and Q2—Q4) and 0.31 where it is three quarters (90—93 and Q1—Q4).
The further apart the target periods, the less correlated are the values to be
predicted, and the above results suggest that the ranking consistency declines

correspondingly. But the reductions in the rank correlations vary considerably in size and regularity, beinq most pronounced for CEDG, least for GNP.

When averaged over the quarters 91—94, the p coefficients are relatively low
for CEDG, GNP, and RGNP (.27—.33) and hiqh for I?D, UR, and CBI (.55-66).

III. Distributions of Summary Measures

of

Error

It is instructive to examine the distributions of the statistics that sum

up the records of the individual forecasters. The discrepancies in time
coverage reduce the comparability of absolute accuracy measures across the

respondents to the surveys. However, in the ASA-NBER data there appears to be
no significant bias due to missed observations. No pattern has been found to
suqqest

any

that the participants covered selected the times

systematic

of their responses in

manner; rather it is random factors (absences, work pressure,

neqljqence) that account for the allocation of the missed surveys among the

individuals. Interest in the overall picture provided by the summary measures

—14—

of each forecaster's performance is also enhanced by the fact that the number
of surveys (42) is relatively large and the coverage of each is adequate (on
the average, 43 participants with a standard deviation of 9)•12
The distributions of the summary measures of error for the individual
forecasts are further compared with the corresponding measures for the overall

group

forecasts. The latter refer to the series of mean predictions, of which

there are thirty, one for each of the targets covered (6 variables x 5
horizons). These averages comprise all forecasters who predicted the qiven
target at any time

during

the period under study, so that the series are

continuous, each including predictions from all surveys covered. Thus the
RMSE for any of these group mean ("q") series is simply

Overall Accuracy
For each of the six variables, the means of the individual RMSE's taken
across the tarqet quarters 90, ...,Q4 exceed the corresponding RMSE's for the

overall qroup mean forecasts. The ratios of the summary statistics of error
(entries in column 2 of Table 3 divided by those in column 5) vary from 1 .04

to 1.16 and averaqe 1.11.

The performance of the series of group mean forecasts is also superior to
the averaqe performance of the series of individual forecasts in terms of

correlations with the actual values. The averages of the

important exception of RGNP. This reflects the familiar tendency toward underestimation of chanqes in most forecasts. The average overestimation of real

explained by

the

the 1970s gave rise to a novel phenomenon commonly called staqflation and art

unexpectedly serious recession. As would he expected, since the individual
predictions are randomly distributed over the same period as that covered by
the overall group mean series, the two sets of forecasts have much the same
mean errors (cf. columns 1 and 4).

As a rule, it is some simple average rather than the underlying individual
forecasts from economic outlook that are regularly published and used, arid i.t

is certainly worth knowing that the predictive value of the former tends to be

measurably greater than that of the latter; hut how accurate have the men
predictions been, considering the accessible data and techniques? One approach
to answering this broad question would he through comparisons with benchmark

preditions from time—series models appropriately selected to fit the characteristics of the variables in question and estimated with data available at the

time the ex ante forecasts to he assessed were actually made. This task is

beyond the scope of the present paper. To qath some insight into the order of
the magnitudes involved, however, it is useful to compare the average forecast
errors with the averaqe values of the outcomes for each of the target series,

—17--

and some summary statistics are provided for this purpose in the last section
of Table 3.

Plainly, the absolute values of the mean errors are at least smaller than
the mean actual values in every case, and they are indeed for most of the

variables quite small in these terms (cf. columns 1 and 4 with column 7). More

telling, the RMSEs are less than the corresponding root mean square values of
the tarqet series, again in most cases by larqe margins (cf. columns 2 and 5

with column 9). The RSME's for the group mean forecasts are also qenerally
less

than the standard deviations of the actual values (columns 5 and 8). The

and GNP rank

CEDG when

as the first and second best in all of these

rank lowest when the ME figures are used, RGNP and

the RMSE figures are.

Characteristics of the Distributions
The medians of the RMSE's for the individual forecasts are with few

exceptions lower than the means, but by relatively small margins (see Table 4,

columns 1 and 4). This indicates a weak

tendency for these distributions to be

skewed to the right, that is, toward the large RMSE1S.

In virtually all instances, the averages of the individual RMSE's exceed
the RMSE's for the correspondjnq group mean forecasts (compare the entries in

columns land 4 with their counterparts in column 6). The measures for the
group mean tend to be closer to the lower quartile than to the median of the

distribution of the individual RMSE's (cf, columns 3, 4, and 6). This is
roughly consistent with the earlier finding, based on more strictly comparable

measures, that the overall proportion of cases in which M <

columns 1 and 3—6 of Table 4. However, the increases taper off: the forecasters on the average predict QO substantially better than Qi, and 01 still
noticeably better than Q2, but their ability to anticipate Q3, is not much less
limited than their ability to anticipate Q2, and the same applies even more to

Q4 vs. Q3. In short, these measures suqqest that the R1SE's tend to approach
asymptotically a hiqh plateau at the more distant target quarters.
Note that these results apply to the marqinal prediction errors for each
successive quarter (in a shorthand notation used earlier, to changes 0—1, 1—2,
...).

To the extent that such errors are positively correlated, their

cumulation can produce much qreater increases in the average prediction errors

The absolute dispersion measures (standard deviations in column 2 and
interquartile ranges implied by columns 3 and 5) increase from QO to Q4 for tJR,

GNP and RGNP. In contrast, relative dispersion measures, viz.,

of variation SD/M (ratios of entries in column 2 to those in

column 1) show strong tendencies to decrease for the more distant target

quarters. They are also on the average similar for most of the variables
(ranging from .23 tá .26, except for CEDG and CBI, where they are .19 and .31,
respectively).

12The

buildup of average prediction errors with increasing spans is a

general phenomenon to he expected and is well documented in forecast evaluations. However, some evidence for earlier periods has shown marginal errors
varying narrowly and irregularly over the range of several quarters ahead,
without any systematic upward drift (Zarnowitz 1967, pp. 64—72, and 1979, op.
18—19; McNees 1973, pp. 24—25). The present results may differ because of the
nature of the period covered (and Zarnowitz 1979 provides some support for this
hypothesis), hut they also inspire more confidence than those of other stuiies,
ei-iq based on much larqer samples of better controled data.

—20—

The qroup mean forecasts have tracked the actual changes better than the

average individual forecasts: the correlation measures in column 9 of Table 4

are, with but a few exceptions, higher than those in column 7. The listed r2
coefficients decline strongly with the lenqtheninq horizon between 00 and 02,
much less so for Q3 and Q4, for both the individual and group mean forecasts.
Only for UR, where the correlations are high for reasons already noted, do

these declines exteid clearly through the entire target range (Q0-Q4). The
coefficients across the individuals declines as the

dispersion of the

distance to the tarqet quarter increases, except for UR where the opposite
happens (column 8).

IV. Summary and Interpretations of Findings

The results of the study support the following statements:
1 •

The

group mean forecasts from a series of surveys on the averaqe over

time more accurate than most of the correspondinq sets of individual

predictions. This is a strong conclusion, which applies

to all vari-

ables and predictive horizons covered and is consistent with evidence
for different periods and from other studies. It is based on an
intensive analysis of a large collection of authentic macroeconomic
forecasts, in two forms:

(1) individual-to—qroup PJ4SE ratios Mj/Mgj

which turn out to be predominantly larqer than 1 .0, and (2) distribu-

tions of summary measures of accuracy, in which the series of the

overall mean predictions Mg place better than half or more of the
individuals.

and, particularly, across the horizons 00—Q4 (e.g., 11-37% for IPD,

8—42% for UR). In each of the thirty cateqories combining specific
variables and target quarters, most of the forecasters show RMS

most of the categories these majorities are larqe. The Mi/Mgi ratios
average 1.1 and cluster between 0.9 and 1.4.

are positive for all variables and target quarters, and they are sta-

tistically significant in most cases by the conventional tests. For
this result to obtain, a moderate deqree of consistency must have
•

existed in the relative performance of a sufficient number of the

survey members. It is still true, as earlier reports also indicate,
that

no sinqle forecaster has been cserved to earn a long record of

superior overall accuracyi13 and indeed nothing in the

encourage us to expect any individual to reach this elusive qoal.

But a small number of the more regular participants in the ASA-NI3ER

surveys did perform better in most respects than the composite fore-

To go beyond the observations in point 3 above, a further study of the

characteristics, methods, and results of the forecasters
records will he needed. To mention just one question of
remains to he

with the best

interest, it

seen whether weighted combinations of selected forecasts

from this subqroup would yield siqnificantly larqe and persistent gains

in accuracy, hut our results do not rule out this possibility. It

13See, e.g., Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 123—132; and McNees,

1979,

pp. 4—17.

—22—

seems more doubtful that weighting could be applied with much benefit
directly to large nuthbers of forecasts from the surveys.14

Absolute measures of error depend strongly on the characteristics of

5.

the predicted variables and vary accordingly, in contrast to the

standardized Mi/Mgi ratios. For example, relatively smooth series
such as the unemployment rate and growth in nominal GNP are easier to
predict and are in fact much better predicted than the more volatile
series such as qrowth in real GNP and the IPD inflation, as indicated
by comparisons of average size and variability of foreôast errors and
realizations.

The overall composite forecasts Mg have RMSE's that are

6.

for

almost

all categories smaller than the medians, and indeed often close to the
lower quartiles, of the distributions of the RMSE's for the correspond-

ing individual forecasts. Also, the correlations of predicted with

actual values (r2) are typically higher for Mg than fore most of the
individuals, frequently by substantial margins. These results are

apparently

unrelated to the differential characteristics of the

variables covered.

There is a qeneral tendency for the errors to increase in absolute size
with the time distance to the target cuarter, but by decreasing margins.

1so, correlations between predictions and realizations typically
decline as the target, period recedes into the future, but again more so

for the nearest than for the more distant q.farters. The relative dispersion measures tend to decrease with the predictive horizon for 'the

RMSE's and rise for the correlation statistics, while the absolute
dispersion measures show no common patterns of change.
