Heterogeneous Productivity Response to Tariff Reduction: Evidence from Brazilian
Manufacturing Firms

NBER Working Paper No. 10544
June 2004
JEL No. F1, L1, L6, O3
ABSTRACT
This paper studies the effects of trade liberalization on the evolution of firm productivity. The
productivity of each firm was estimated using an unbalanced panel data of 4,484 Brazilian
manufacturing firms from 1986 to 1998, following the procedure first proposed by Olley and Pakes
(1996) and further developed by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003). First, the effect of nominal tariffs on
firms' productivity levels is identified. After controlling for the endogeneity of nominal tariffs, the
estimated coefficient for tariffs in the productivity equation turns out to be negative. Second, a
measure of tariffs on inputs is added in the productivity equation. The coefficient associated with
tariffs on inputs is also negative, and the inclusion of this new variable reduces the size of the
estimated coefficient of nominal tariffs. Thus, it seems that, along with the increased competition,
the new access to inputs that embody better foreign technology also contributes to productivity gains
after trade liberalization. Third, it is shown that there is a huge degree of heterogeneity of responses
to trade liberalization. The effect of the tariff reductions depends heavily on observed and
unobserved characteristics of the firm.

1. Introduction
There is plenty of evidence that tariff reduction increases the efficiency of
manufacturing firms. Tybout, de Melo and Corbo (1991) studied the impact of trade
liberalization on the performance of Chilean firms in the 70’s. They concluded that
industries that experienced higher tariff reductions were the same as those that experienced
higher efficiency gains. Similar results were found by Harrison (1994) for the Ivory Coast,
by Iscan (1998) for Mexico and by Hay (2001) for Brazil. More recently, several papers
sharing similar methodology, which solves some econometric problems regarding
productivity estimation, also tried to answer whether trade liberalization enhances firm
productivity gains. Pavcnik (2002) found that the in-plant productivity improvements in
Chile can be attributed to trade liberalization. Fernandes (2003) and Muendler (2002) using
data from Colombia and Brazil, respectively, found a negative relationship between
nominal tariffs and productivity, reinforcing the perception that trade liberalization has a
positive impact on productivity. Tybout (2000 and 2001) surveys several papers on
productivity and trade, based on firm-level databases.
However, little has been said about the channels through which tariff reduction
affects productivity. Usually, trade liberalization is seen as a sharp reduction in nominal
tariffs that leads to a much higher degree of competition in domestic markets, which in turn
pushes firms to reduce inefficiencies. The other – less examined – side of trade
liberalization and nominal tariff reduction is the reduction of tariffs on inputs, which
reduces the costs and increases the access to foreign intermediate and capital goods by
domestic firms. The overall reduction of nominal tariffs leads not only to a reduction of
tariffs on inputs but also creates an incentive for firms to adopt outsourcing strategies. From
a theoretical point of view, both embodied technology in imported inputs and outsourcing
can explain productivity gains when trade increases.
Muendler (2002) seems to be the first attempt to deal with this issue. Besides testing
the effect of nominal tariffs on productivity, he explicitly includes foreign capital and
intermediate inputs in the production function, to test whether firms with higher usage of
foreign inputs have higher productivity.
Here a very similar hypothesis is tested: whether increased availability of foreign
inputs (intermediate and capital goods) affects the firm’s productivity. The approach,
2

however, is different. Here, instead of considering the impact of trade liberalization on the
observed volume of imported inputs, the impact of tariff reduction on the intermediate and
capital good markets is considered. The first reason to do so is because imported inputs
may be used by firms indirectly, since most of manufacturing inputs undergo local
remanufacturing. Secondly, it tests the impact of trade policy more directly.
Another point discussed in this paper is the heterogeneous response to tariff
reduction. It is a stylized fact that there is a substantial difference between and withinindustry heterogeneity in output, input and productivity in the manufacturing sector. Thus,
it is relevant to ask whether the average impact of tariff reduction is representative for most
of the firms, or if there is substantial cross-firm variation in the productivity response to
reduced tariffs. To sort out the effect of trade liberalization on different firms, these firms
were classified according to observed and unobserved characteristics, and the estimation of
the impact of decreased tariffs is conditioned on such characteristics.
To address these questions, I use a data set of Brazilian manufacturing firms, which
has information on production and inputs used by those firms between 1986 and 1998.
Brazil, as many Latin-American countries, relied heavily on import-substitution
industrialization programs for decades. Although a very diversified industrial sector
flourished in the country, the firms faced a very protected environment with very limited
competition from abroad and reduced access to imported inputs and capital goods.
In less than a decade, Brazilian trade policy suffered a significant change. Average
nominal tariffs decreased from 77% in 1987 to 13.6% in 1994. The tariff dispersion was
also sharply reduced. The standard deviation fell to 8.4% in 1994 from 53.8% in 1987.
Despite the fact that there was a relative setback in the last half of the 90’s, the decade
ended with nominal tariffs 20 percentage points below their initial value. Brazilian
manufacturing firms were undoubtedly much less protected than before. The impact on the
volume of imports was also very significant. During the 90’s, imports grew 170%, almost
10.5% per year. Imports of capital goods increased 196% and of intermediate goods, 259%.
Import penetration, according to Moreira (2000) rose from 4.5% in 1989 to 19.3% in 1998.
This paper yields important findings. First, it shows that both nominal tariffs and
tariffs on inputs have a negative impact on firm productivity. Thus, it seems that along with
higher competition, new access to better inputs also contributes to enhance productivity
3

after trade liberalization. Second, it argues that the effect of trade liberalization upon a
representative firm is not the best way to evaluate the impact of tariff reduction on the
productivity of a given firm. There is much heterogeneity in the response to trade
liberalization, and this heterogeneity is far from random. Observed and unobserved
characteristics of firms can explain why firms react differently when tariffs are reduced.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next two sections describe
the Brazilian trade liberalization process and the data. Section 4 presents the structural
model and how it is implemented to yield a measure of firm productivity. Section 5 relates
to productivity and tariffs, while section 6 shows the heterogeneity of such relationships
among different firms. The last section presents a summary and conclusions.
2. Brazilian Trade Liberalization1
Until the end of the 80’s, Brazilian trade policy meant extremely high nominal
tariffs and a huge amount of non-tariff barriers. Nominal tariffs were in general redundant.
The price difference between domestic and international prices was much lower than the
tariffs suggested. Imports were restricted not because of high nominal tariffs, but mainly by
innumerous non-tariff restrictions like lists of prohibited imported goods, difficult access to
government import authorization and limits on imports for each firm. On the other hand,
there were several exception rules that reduced both the tariff and the non-tariff barriers for
the import of some specific goods.
In 1988 there was the first attempt to rationalize trade policy. Some of the non-tariff
barriers were extinguished (elimination of some taxes on imported goods and some of the
special regimes faced by several industries) and nominal tariffs had a small reduction.
In 1990, the newly elected government announced a new trade policy that would
change substantially the old regime. At first, all but a few non-tariff barriers were
eliminated. Trade policy thereafter would rely mostly on tariffs and on exchange rate
management (although the exchange rate regime was much more flexible than before).
Secondly, a four-year schedule of tariff reductions was announced. After these four years,
the tariff range would be between 0% and 40%. The average tariff would decrease from
slightly lower than 50% in 1989 to 14% in 1994. According to Kume, Piani and Souza
1

This section relies heavily on Kume, Piani and Souza (2000).

4

(2000), at first there was no discrimination among industries except for a higher protection
for the production of goods with high technological requirements such as computers, some
chemical sectors and biotechnology. The tariff structure was designed according to the
comparative advantage, the initial tariff level and tariff on inputs. There were some
exceptions, but the result was a much more rational tariff structure.
The schedule of tariff reduction was constructed so as to have first a reduction of
tariffs on inputs and only then a more aggressive reduction of tariffs on consumer goods.
The program was fully implemented in the second semester of 1993 – several months
before schedule.
After the stabilization plan was launched in July of 1994, there was a further push to
reduce tariffs, mainly on those goods that had a significant impact on inflation indices. In
order to increase the supply of imported goods to discipline domestic prices, there was also
an anticipation of the adoption of the Mercosur common external tariff, which in several
cases implied a reduction in current tariffs. If the Mercosur tariff was higher than the
current one, the lower tariff was maintained. Trade policy during this period had an
important role in helping to stabilize inflation in Brazil.
However, the Mexican crisis in December of 1994, the currency overvaluation due
to the huge capital inflows observed after the introduction of the Real and the huge increase
in imports led to a revision of the recent trade policy changes, since the external imbalance
became a major concern. Tariffs were increased as the government asked for the inclusion
of several goods in the exception list, since by this time Mercosur imposed some
restrictions on tariff rises. As a result, from 1995 to 1998 the nominal average tariff went up
almost 3 percentage points, from 12.8% to 15.5%.
3. Data: Pesquisa Industrial Anual
The data source used to construct measures of productivity is the Pesquisa Industrial
Anual (PIA) carried out by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE), the
Brazilian census bureau. PIA collects firm-level economic data annually since 1986 –
excluding 1991.
Firms are qualified to enter in the PIA sample if they have at least half of their
income related to industrial activity. The initial sample was based on the 1985 industrial
5

census and includes all of the biggest industrial firms and a random sample of mediumsized firms. All newly founded firms were supposed to be included yearly, although it
seems that the surveying method was not rigorously applied2. After cleaning the dataset3,
the sample of firms utilized in this study is of 4,844 firms, compared to a total of 9,130
firms identified with at least one year of positive sales. Table 1 displays the number of
firms in each industry for different periods of time. The reduction of the number of firms in
the sample is due to several factors. The most direct one is the fact that new entries were
not fully incorporated in the survey sample before 1996. The change in the questionnaire
after 1996 in which the balance sheet data are no longer reported implied that only firms
sampled in 1995 were kept in the sample for the following years, since the construction of a
capital series was then changed to the perpetual inventory method. There are certainly other
factors that may have contributed to the reduction of the number of firms, probably related
to trade liberalization, such as mergers and acquisitions and the exit of firms that did not
adapt to the new liberalized economic environment.
PIA contains information on the number of production and non-production workers,
sales, inventories of inputs and of produced goods and other inputs (materials). There is
also balance sheet data, which allows us to construct a capital stock series. In table 1 some
information is displayed regarding these variables.
Unfortunately, information on sales, inventories and materials are given at nominal
levels at the end of each calendar year. Due to extremely high inflation during most of the
period covered by the survey, each series was first inflated so that it best represented the
sum of the monthly values at the end of the year, and only then converted to a common
currency – reais as of August of 1994. Although this procedure is necessary, one should
bear in mind that these variables may suffer from measurement errors. The higher the
inflation and price dispersion, the higher the error.
The capital stock was the only item in the balance sheet that was indexed to the
official inflation rate until 1995. However, the official correction was systematically below
the observed inflation rate, calculated by several organizations (even by the government).
2

Muendler (2001) offers a complete and detailed description of PIA’s sample procedure and the survey’s
contents.
3
The outliers were discarded (1% of the highest and lowest values for labor-production, capital-production
and materials-production ratios) as well as firms with less than two consecutive observations. The dataset was
carefully screened and clearly misreported values were also discarded.

6

The series was then corrected for this and real August 1994 values used. One possible
setback of this series is the fact that the government, recognizing that official correction
systematically reduced the real value of capital stock, allowed firms to make a once-andfor-all optional correction in their capital stock in 1991, by the amount they judged it was
undervalued. Since the survey was not carried out this year, it is impossible to say which
firms made the correction and by what amount. I thus utilized here the uncorrected series.
After 1995, PIA stopped collecting information on capital stock. Since only investment
values were available, only firms that were in the sample before this year were included,
and the capital stock was calculated adding the investment net of depreciation to the
previous year's capital stock.
In order to estimate the production functions that will allow me to measure firms’
productivity, firms were grouped in 27 manufacturing industries (close to two-digit SIC
classification – or nível 50 in the Brazilian industrial classification). As table 1 shows, there
is a significant difference in firms’ characteristics across industries and, especially, within
industries, represented by the standard deviation higher than the average.
Data on nominal tariffs is available from 1986 to 1998 for industries classified
according to nível 100 in the Brazilian industrial classification (close to three-digit SIC
classification) from Kume, Piani and Souza (2000). Tariffs on inputs were constructed
using input-output tables, available for 1985 and annually from 1990 to 1996. For each
industry a vector of inputs is associated with nominal tariffs to give tariffs on inputs.
Average nominal tariffs and average tariffs on inputs are displayed for the 27
manufacturing industries in table 1. There is significant variation of tariffs over time and
across industries.
4. Productivity Measure
Productivity is usually calculated as the difference between the observed output and
the output predicted by an estimated production function. Thus, the main empirical concern
is how to estimate an unbiased production function. Let us suppose that the technology of
firm i is well described by a Cobb-Douglas production function:
y it = β 0 + β lw lw it + β lb lb it + β m m it + β k k it + µ it
7

where yit is the gross output, lwit and lbit are the amount of labor on administrative tasks
and on production, respectively, mit is the quantity of other inputs (materials) and kit is the
stock of capital used by firm i in time t. The firm i specific residual term µit can be
decomposed as µ it = ω it + ε it , where ωit is an efficiency term (or productivity level) that is
known by the firm but not by the econometrician and εit is an unexpected productivity
shock (unobserved both by the firm and the econometrician and with zero mean).
The fact that ωit is known by the firm when it takes the decision as to whether to
stay in the market and produce and, if deciding to produce, which input combination to use,
makes the OLS estimate of the production function biased. The error term is not
uncorrelated with the explanatory variables, the key assumption for OLS to produce
unbiased estimates. There is not only a simultaneity bias, that arises due to the fact that the
unobserved efficiency level is taken into account when the firm decides what input
combination and quantities it will use to produce, but also a selection bias, which comes
from the fact that the firm chooses whether to stay in the market or exit after it knows its
productivity level ωit, which is not observed by the econometrician.
The alternative is to use fixed-effects to correct for this bias, assuming that ωit is
firm-specific but constant over time. However, during periods of substantial changes in the
economic environment, it is not a reasonable assumption to let a firm’s productivity be
fixed over time. In fact, I am interested in measuring the change occurred in productivity
due to trade liberalization.
So far, the standard alternative to solve the bias introduced by acknowledging that
ωit is known by the firm but not by the econometrician is given by Olley and Pakes (1996).
Starting from the same production function described above, they propose an econometric
method based on a structural model that is able to solve both the simultaneity and the
selection bias.
Those authors developed a model where the firm maximizes its expected current
and future profit values. In each period the firm decides whether to exit the market or to
continue to produce, by comparing the net profit cash flow and the exit value. If it decides
to produce, it chooses the inputs. The firm-specific efficiency factor is known at the
beginning of time t and determines the firm’s choices.
8

To overcome the fact that ωit is not observed by the econometrician, they write
down an investment function that depends on the unobserved efficiency variable and the
capital stock. Assuming that investment is always positive if the firm decides to continue in
the market, it is possible to invert this function and write ωit as a function of the observed
capital stock and investment made by the firm in time t.
I follow quite closely the Olley and Pakes (1996) methodology (O-P hereafter).
However, a few changes need to be made to make sure that the proposed method is suitable
for the Brazilian data set I work with.
First, I cannot use investment as a proxy for the unobserved efficiency variable
because in my data set most of the firms, most of the years, do not have positive
investment. Pavcnik (2002) shows that there is a significant change in the estimated
coefficients when you include the zero-investment observations. Levinsohn and Petrin
(2003) recognize that observing lots of zero-investment observations is a common feature
of developing country data sets. They propose to use other inputs as a proxy for the
unobserved efficiency variable.
Second, it is not a reasonable assumption to set labor as a free mobile factor as it is
assumed in O-P algorithm. In Brazil, due to the high cost of dismissing workers, firms at
first adjust the labor requirement by adjusting the working hours. Only when significant
changes in production or in technology take place is there a change in the number of
workers. Since the information on firms' labor usage is on the number of workers, labor
seems to be better treated as a state variable.
Third, O-P addresses the selection bias by explicitly modeling the firm’s probability
of continuing in the market as a function of the observed variables. Although PIA provides
the information as to whether a firm is active or exited, there are several observations in
which a firm is not producing but did not choose to exit definitively (it is said to be
paralyzed). Moreover, some firms cease appearing in my sample without any information
as to whether they exited or if it is a missing observation. As a consequence, I do not
explicitly correct for the selection bias. Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), however, argue that
by using an unbalanced panel of firms, the selection bias is significantly minimized.

9

4.1 Structural Model and Implementation
As before, firm i’s technology can be described as a Cobb-Douglas production
function such as
y it = β 0 + β lw lw it + β lb lb it + β m m it + β k k it + µ it
µ it = ω it + ε it
The unobserved productivity level variable ωit is assumed to follow a 1st order
Markov process. The expected value of ωit is a function of an unexpected shock with zero
mean and of its value at time t-1.
ω it = ω it −1 + ζ it ⇒ ω it = E(ω it /ω it −1 ) + ζ it
Besides labor and capital, the firm needs other inputs (materials) to produce
according to the above production function. The demand for these other inputs is a function
of the efficiency variable ωit and of the state variables, labor and capital. The usage of these
other inputs is adjusted immediately to different states of the efficiency variable, or
productivity. Labor and capital, on the other hand, take time to adjust due to adjustment
costs.
m it = f t (ω it , lw it , lb it , k it )
It seems reasonable to assume4 that the above function is monotonic in ω. That is,
given the stock of capital and labor in time t, the higher the productivity or efficiency level,
the higher the usage of materials, since the firm will produce more than another firm that
has the same stock of capital and labor but lower productivity. Thus, we can invert the
above equation and write ωit as a function of the observed variables, materials, labor and
stock of capital.
4

Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) detail the necessary conditions for the monotonicity of this function.

10

ω it = h t (m it , lw it , lb it , k it )
Substituting this equation in the production function, we have
y it = φ t (m it , lw it , lb it , k it ) + ε it
where φ t (m it , lw it , lb it , k it ) = β 0 + β lw lwit + β lb lbit + β m mit + β k k it + ht (m it , lw it , lb it , k it ) .
As in Olley and Pakes (1996) and Pavcnik (2002), the function ϕt is approximated
by a polynomial series on the observed variables – materials, labor and capital stock. Since
an underlying assumption is that the input market is not only the same for all firms but also
that the market structure does not change over time, the function ϕt is estimated for three
distinct periods (1986-1990, 1992-1994, 1995-1998) to take into account the changes
observed in the Brazilian economy. Thus, the first stage of the O-P procedure is to estimate
ϕ t.
The assumption that the firm’s efficiency follows a 1st order Markov process allows
us to write its expected value as a function of its past value
E(ω it /ω it −1 ) = g (ω it −1 )
The g(.) function can then be expressed as a function of the past values of the
observed variables by replacing ωit-1 with the functions ht-1 and ϕt-1.
g(ω it −1 ) = g (h t −1 (m it −1 , lw it −1 , lb it −1 , k it −1 ))
= g(φ t -1 (m it −1 , lw it −1 , lb it −1 , k it −1 ) − β 0 − β lw lw it −1 − β lb lb it −1 − β m m it −1 − β k k it −1 )

11

Using the predicted values of ϕt-1 estimated in the first stage, we can then estimate
in a second stage the coefficients associated with the observed variables by non-linear least
squares of the function below
y it = β 0 + β lw lw it + β lb lb it + β m m it + β k k it +
+ g(φ t -1 (m it −1 , lw it −1 , lb it −1 , k it −1 ) − β 0 − β lw lw it −1 − β lb lb it −1 − β m m it −1 − β k k it −1 ) + ζ it + ε it
4.2 Estimation
A production function was estimated for each of the 27 industries using the equation
and methodology discussed above. In table 2 the estimated coefficients for each industry
and corresponding OLS estimates are displayed.
Most of the coefficients associated with the capital stock estimated by the O-P
methodology are larger than the OLS estimates (23 out of 27), which evidences that the
simultaneity bias is strong with OLS estimation.5
The standard errors shown are not corrected for the fact that in the second stage the
non-linear least squares uses estimated variables instead of the true ones. Although in Olley
and Pakes (1996) there is not much difference between the corrected and the uncorrected
standard deviation when using the series approximation, it seems important to confirm their
findings. Bootstrapped standard deviations were calculated for only one fifth of the
industries due to the heavy computational time required. Although they are higher than the
analytical ones, they do not seem to change either the significance of the estimated
coefficients or the conclusion that the O-P algorithm produces higher capital coefficient
estimates than the OLS ones.
To have a measure of firm productivity, I followed Pavcnik (2002) and Aw et al.
(2001) and constructed a productivity index that can describe both the evolution of the
productivity of the firm over time and its relative position compared to a reference firm in a
reference year.

5

If capital stock and labor usage are positively correlated, and both capital and labor are correlated to the
productivity variable, (which seems to be the case) then the estimated coefficient on capital tends to be underestimated and the labor coefficient tends to be over-estimated. Levinsohn and Petrin (2000) discuss further the
sign of the bias.

12

In this case the reference firm is a synthetic firm, which has the mean output, labor,
capital and materials usage of each industry in 1986. To put it more clearly, the productive
measure prodit is calculated as follows
prod it = y it − β̂ lb lb it − β̂ lw lw it − β̂ m m it − β̂ k k it − (y r − ŷ r )

where y r = y it and ŷ r = β̂ lb lb it + β̂ lw lw it + β̂ m m it + β̂ k k it . The bar over each variable
denotes the simple average of all firms of each industry in 1986.
Table 3 shows that there is a lot of heterogeneity of productivity evolution between
different manufacturing industries in this period. It is also important to point out that the
evolution of productivity within an industry over time is far from regular. From one year to
another, productivity measures change a lot in most of the industries. That is not surprising,
given the huge macroeconomic instability and several different policies that were
implemented in Brazil over the 13 years that the data set covers.
5. Productivity and Tariffs
The first empirical concern, when addressing the question of whether the reduction
of tariff barriers observed over the last years of the 80’s and the first years of the 90’s
affected firms’ productivity, is how to disentangle the effects of trade liberalization from
other changes in macroeconomic policy. One way to do that is to include year (or period, or
before-and-after) dummies as explanatory variables in the regressions. This treatment is
sufficient to guarantee consistent estimators if we believe that the sector-specific impact of
other macroeconomic policies is not correlated with the sector-specific tariff reduction
observed in the period. Certainly, there is a connection between reduction of tariffs and
other policies adopted over this period (privatization, disinflation, financial liberalization),
but it is reasonable to assume that the reduction of trade protection across industries is
relatively independent from other kinds of macro policy. Given this assumption, I used year
dummies to control for any other policy that affected all industries over this period
(although each industry responded differently to these policies, I assume that they are not
correlated with the tariff structure).

13

Another concern relates to the political economy of tariff reduction. From the policy
maker's point of view, the choice regarding which industry should be more protected and
which industry needs more competition is far from random. On the other hand, it is
reasonable to assume that firms pressure policy makers for more protection, either through
higher tariffs on its competing imported goods, or through a reduction in tariffs on the
inputs they use. Ferreira (2000) argues that there is a positive correlation between nominal
tariffs and industry concentration in Brazil. Using a panel data set of Brazilian industries
from 1988 to 1994, he shows that the more concentrated the industry, the higher its nominal
tariff in relation to other industries. As a result, it is difficult to assume that tariffs are
exogenous in a regression where productivity is on the left hand side. In both cases, from
the policy makers’ or from the lobby's point of view, we can argue that the tariff is
correlated with productivity. In the first case, policy makers may have used trade policy to
induce more competition in industries in which they might have thought that the lack of
foreign goods in the domestic market had had a negative impact on productivity. Lobbies in
low productivity sectors, on the other hand, may have pressured for higher tariffs to
maintain the domestic market closed to foreign competition.
It is not easy to find good instruments for nominal tariffs. A good instrument should
be correlated not only with the time trend but also with the cross-industry pattern of the
tariff structure and uncorrelated with the productivity measure. However, in the Brazilian
case, the trade liberalization process changed the structure of protection very little. The
Spearman rank correlation of nominal tariffs among the 27 industries between 1986 and
1998 is above 80%. From 1989 on, the year-by-year correlation is above 87%. It seems that
the political economy behind the tariff reduction did not change much during the period
analyzed. As a consequence, using industry dummies that control for these time-invariant
characteristics of the political economy of trade liberalization can reduce significantly the
bias in the OLS regression. This is the same assumption used in Goldberg and Pavcnik
(forthcoming).
When estimating the relationship between protection and productivity, I left aside
the period between 1986 and 1988. As Kume, Piani and Souza (2001) argue, the tariff
reduction observed in these years was mainly due to the reduction of redundant tariffs.
There was not much change in the environment of protection that most domestic firms were
14

facing. Thus, including this data will bias the estimated relation between productivity and
protection, since productivity changes over this period are not related to changes in
protection.
Table 4 shows the results of OLS regressions of productivity on nominal tariffs.
Once industry dummies are included, the sign of the coefficient related to nominal tariffs
changes from positive to negative, although it is not significant. When firms' fixed-effects
were included to correct a bias that may arise because the production function is estimated
for each industry and not for each firm, the coefficient not only is negative but is also
significant at 1%. This result confirms that using dummies (for industries and firms)
reduces the bias found in the OLS regression. This result is maintained when the OLS
productivity measure is used.
The fact that nominal tariffs are negatively correlated with productivity was often
associated with competition being the main source of increased productivity observed in
some industries. Even the reduction of productivity in some other industries could be
explained by the inability of domestic firms to compete with more productive foreign firms.
Those firms reduced production, which in the short run (given that labor and capital take
time to adjust) means lower productivity.
However, the reduction in tariffs leads to a reduction also in the price of imported
inputs necessary for production. It also certainly increases the supply of these inputs, which
are often thought of as having a better quality-price ratio, and which can increase
productivity through the embodied technology transferred from more advanced economies.
To proxy this greater availability of foreign inputs I used a measure of tariffs on inputs. The
measure of the tariffs on inputs was constructed using the nominal tariff of each industry
and input-output tables.
Adding this measure of tariffs on inputs to the above regression (table 5), the sign of
the coefficient of nominal tariffs (using industry dummies and firms' fixed-effects) did not
change. The magnitude, however, is much lower. Part of the effect is now captured by the
coefficient related to tariffs on inputs.
In general, the sizes of the coefficients associated with each of the tariff measures
are similar. This result can be interpreted as evidence that the availability of imported
inputs also plays a role in enhancing firms' productivity. We can also say that it is likely
15

that the impact of increased competition on productivity is not much larger than the impact
of the possibility of using imported inputs in production.
6. Heterogeneous Response to Tariff Reduction
One stylized fact of the manufacturing sector is that there is huge heterogeneity
between firms in different industries and also among firms in the same industry. The
Brazilian case is no exception. Therefore, the above results, although true for an average
firm, are not sufficient to disentangle the effects of tariff reduction on firms' productivity.
Thus, I make here an attempt to have a more precise answer concerning the
relationship between productivity and tariffs, by conditioning the above results on the firms'
characteristics. First, the firms were classified according to some observed characteristics
such as size, type of good produced (capital, intermediate, transport and consumer goods),
type of technology used (capital, labor, natural resources and technology intensive),
industry concentration (Herfindahl), initial nominal tariffs and imports and exports as a
percentage of production, as table 6 shows.
Firms were considered small when they have less than 50 workers the first year they
are sampled and large if they have more than 500 workers at that time. Firms were
classified as having low or high import and export share, Herfindahl index and initial
tariffs, if they belong to industries in the first and last quarter of the distribution of these
variables in 1986.
When conditioning for the firms' characteristics, the general result that productivity
is higher with lower nominal tariff and lower tariff on inputs is no longer true. Not only are
some of the estimated coefficients not statistically significant, but also some of them have
the opposite sign (higher tariffs implies higher productivity). Table 7 presents the marginal
effects of an increase of nominal tariff and on tariffs on inputs for different firm
characteristics. Although this is a very interesting point, the results are in general not very
robust to different specifications.
Table 8 shows that productivity dispersion is extremely high among firms of the
same industry, which raises the hypothesis that there are still significant differences among
these firms that are not explained by characteristics related to specific industries. These
unobserved characteristics can possibly affect the relationship between productivity and
16

tariffs. To capture those unobserved characteristics quantile regressions6 were estimated.
The assumption is that the relative position of the firm in the industry productivity
distribution is related to some of these unobserved characteristics such as management
quality.
The quantile regression results for the nine deciles of the productivity distribution
are shown at table 9. There is a clear-cut distinction between the effect of nominal tariffs
and of tariffs on inputs on the productivity of the firms when they are classified according
to their relative productivity. The productivity of the less productive firms (the first decile)
increases when both nominal tariffs and tariffs on inputs are reduced. For more productive
firms, the marginal effect of a reduction in nominal tariffs is positive.
The general result is that while a reduction in tariffs on inputs has a similar and
positive effect on firm productivity, the marginal effect of the reduction of nominal tariffs
varies significantly across firms. It is positive for firms at the lower end of the distribution
but turns out to be negative for the most productive firms. Unlike the analysis concerning
observed characteristics, the above results are robust to different specifications.
The first impact of a tariff reduction is to reduce productivity of domestic firms due
to the lower production resulted from a reduced market share. Since some inputs are fixed
in the short run, lower production means lower productivity. However, firms at the lower
end of productivity distribution cannot stay in the newly liberalized market unless they
increase productivity. Muendler (2002) shows that when tariffs are reduced, higher
competition from foreign firms leads to a higher probability of firms with low productivity
exiting the market. Thus, firms at the lower end of productivity distribution have to work
hard and fast to increase productivity. The same does not happen to firms with higher
productivity.
In the quantile regression, only firms at the low end of productivity distribution that
were able to increase productivity are sampled. Firms that were not successful in increasing
productivity left the market. This can be an explanation for the results from quantile
regressions: firms that face higher probability of exiting the market are the ones that
respond faster to higher foreign competition from tariff reduction.

6

A complete reference for quantile regression is Buchinsky (1998).

17

Where tariffs on inputs are concerned, both firms with high and low productivity
adapt at the same pace, increasing the share of foreign inputs, which in turn leads to higher
productivity.
7. Summary and Conclusions
This paper studies the effects of trade liberalization in Brazil on the evolution of
firm productivity. The productivity of each firm was estimated using an econometric
framework that avoids the endogeneity bias incurred by the ordinary OLS production
function estimation. Using an unbalanced panel data of 4,484 Brazilian manufacturing
firms from 1986 to 1998, I estimated 27 industry production functions, following the
procedure first proposed by Olley and Pakes (1996) and further developed by Levinsohn
and Petrin (2003).
The fact that nominal tariff changes are not independent from firms' productivity is
usually a problem in OLS regressions, where productivity is on the left hand side of the
equation. The bias introduced by the political economy of trade protection cannot be known
a priori, since policy makers and firms may have different incentives to lobby for tariff
movements. The choice of good instruments for nominal tariffs is always problematic. In
the Brazilian case, however, the fact that the structure of protection did not seem to have
changed much after trade liberalization means that, by using industry dummies, the OLS
bias can be significantly reduced. The positive correlation between productivity levels and
nominal tariffs turns out to be negative when such fixed effects are added to the estimated
equation.
Due to the estimated negative marginal effect of nominal tariffs on productivity, it is
usually agreed that trade liberalization promotes productivity gains by inducing domestic
firms to reduce X-inefficiencies and trim their fat in order to compete with more productive
foreign firms. However, using tariffs on inputs to proxy for the increased availability of
foreign inputs with better foreign technology, I found that tariffs on inputs also have a
negative marginal effect on productivity. Thus, it seems that, along with the higher
competition, new access to better inputs also contributes to productivity gains after trade
liberalization.

18

The above statement, however, is not valid for every firm. There is a huge degree of
heterogeneity of responses to trade liberalization. The effect of tariff reductions depends on
the characteristics of the firm, such as size, type of good it produces, type of technology it
uses, degree of concentration of the industry it belongs to, initial nominal tariffs and the
share of imports and exports. It also depends on unobserved characteristics here proxied by
the relative position in the productivity distribution of the industry the firm belongs to.
