ABSTRACT
We estimate the effect of factor proportions on the pattern of manufacturing specialization in a
cross-section of OECD countries, taking into account that factor accumulation responds to
productivity. We show that the failure to control for productivity differences produces biased
estimates. Our model explains 2/3 of the observed differences in the pattern of specialization
between the poorest and richest OECD countries. However, because factor proportions and the
pattern of specialization co-move in the development process, their strong empirical relationship is
not sufficient to determine whether specialization is driven by factor proportions, or by other
mechanisms also correlated with level of development.

Introduction1

The Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) theory states that di¤erences in the pattern of specialization
across countries are determined by di¤erences in their factor endowments. It answers the
crucial question of what explains trade between countries by focusing on the determinants of
sectoral specialization. In this paper we investigate the empirical relationship between factor
endowments and specialization. We show that failure to control for the independent in‡uence
of productivity di¤erences on output leads to omitted variable bias, in particular since
productivity a¤ects incentives to accumulate factors. Our empirical approach eliminates
this bias. We show that di¤erences in factor endowments within the OECD can explain
two thirds of the di¤erence in the pattern of specialization between the relatively poor and
the relatively rich countries in the group. But we also show that, since the identifying
variation in relative factor endowments comes from di¤erences across countries in level of
development, any economic mechanism that links the pattern of specialization to the stage
of development could generate these results.
This paper is related to an extensive empirical literature that estimates the e¤ect of
changes in factor endowments on the pattern of specialization. Two main approaches characterize this literature, yielding results that have quite di¤erent empirical implications.
We provide for the …rst time a unifying framework that explains why the results of the
two approaches are di¤erent. The …rst approach assumes that all countries have access to
the same technology. The majority of these studies motivate their estimation strategy by
focusing on a very particular case of the H-O theory which yields a linear relationship between sectoral output levels and aggregate factor endowments - the Rybczynski equations
[Harrigan (1995), Davis and Weinstein (1998), Reeve (1998), and Bernstein and Weinstein
(2002)]. Other studies [Leamer (1987) and Schott (2003)] are less restrictive, but maintain
the assumption that technology is identical everywhere. All of these studies …nd a striking

regularity: increases in the capital stock are estimated to have a positive and statistically
signi…cant impact on output levels in almost all manufacturing sectors. In the words of
Harrigan (2001), “Capital is manufacturing’s friend.” The second approach is represented
by Harrigan (1997) and Harrigan and Zakrajšek (2000). Their empirical framework di¤ers
from the other studies in that they derive loglinear estimating equations that relate sectoral
shares of output to relative factor proportions from a translog approximation to the revenue
function. Their speci…cation allows productivity levels to di¤er across countries. They …nd
that the e¤ect of increases in the relative stock of capital on sectoral output shares is not
uniformly positive across sectors. This implies that, as a country accumulates capital, some
manufacturing sectors will expand while some others will contract as a share of total output.
In the second section of the paper, we lay out the particular case of the H-O theory used
to derive a linear relationship between sectoral output and aggregate factor endowments.
We explain how failure to account for cross-country productivity di¤erences leads to a multiplicative form of omitted variable bias in the estimation of these equations. The bias is
likely to be important because productivity levels and factor endowments are strongly correlated. We derive productivity-adjusted Rybczynski equations and estimate alternatively
standard and productivity-adjusted Rybczynski equations for 25 manufacturing sectors using a cross-section of 21 OECD countries in 1988. We …nd that the omission of productivity
tends to bias upwards the estimated coe¢ cient on capital. This goes a substantial way
towards explaining the apparent inconsistency between the results of the two approaches
just described.
In the third section of the paper, we transform the linear Rybczynski equations, relating
them to a reduced form that expresses output shares as a linear function of factor proportions. This solves the problem that in the standard Rybczynski equations, there is no
relevant null hypothesis against which to test the e¤ect of relative factor endowments on
specialization. We estimate the reduced form and …nd that a substantial fraction of the
di¤erence in patterns of specialization between countries at di¤erent stages of development
can be explained by di¤erences in factor proportions. The estimated coe¢ cients are con-

3

sistent with evidence on factor intensities across sectors, even if we are not always able to
estimate with precision the independent e¤ects of particular factor ratios on specialization.
In the fourth section of the paper we interpret these results, taking into account the
links between development, accumulation and specialization. We note that our evidence
of a strong relationship between factor proportions and specialization does not prove that
specialization is driven by di¤erences in factor proportions as in the H-O model. Since factor
endowments are correlated with level of development through the process of accumulation,
any model that links specialization to level of development will predict such an empirical
relationship. We brie‡y describe two plausible alternatives to the H-O model that make
this prediction, and we o¤er suggestions about how future research could test the empirical
validity of these alternatives. We point to the relationship between our estimated coe¢ cients
and actual sectoral factor intensities as a potentially important piece of evidence.

Rybczynski equations and productivity bias

The standard framework used to investigate the empirical relationship between sectoral
output and aggregate factor endowments comes from a very special case of the HeckscherOhlin theory. Here, we describe and estimate this special case. We show that the failure to
control for productivity di¤erences across countries biases the estimated relationship.

2.1

Rybczynski equations

Assume gross output of sector j in country c, yjc , can be written as a neoclassical constant
returns to scale function of factor inputs and intermediate inputs:
ejc ; mcj
yjc = fjc v

(1)

ejc is a vector of factor inputs and mcj a vector of intermediate inputs. Given perfect
where v
competition in input and output markets, the solution to the unit cost minimization problem
for producers in sector j and country c can be expressed as:
e
e c ; pc )
zcj = gjc (w
4

(2)

e c is the vector of factor prices and pc is
where e
zcj is the vector of unit input requirements, w
the vector of goods prices (including intermediate goods).

Assume also that technology is identical in all countries (fjc = fj and gjc = gj ), the
law of one price holds in goods markets (pc = p), and there is factor price equalization
e c = w). Then, e
(w
zcj = e
zj . That is, unit factor input requirements and unit intermediate

input requirements are the same across countries. Denote by ebf j the unit input requirement

e
of factor f in sector j. Stacking, we get the unit direct factor input requirement matrix, B,
common to all countries. Market clearing requires that
e c=v
ec
By

(3)

e c is its
hold in every country, where yc is the vector of gross output of country c and v

vector of factor endowments. Assume that there are the same number of goods and factors
e is invertible. Let B
e
(J = F ), and that B

1

= R. This yields

yc = Re
vc

(4)

That is, there is a linear relationship between gross output and factor endowments. These
are known as Rybczynski equations. Since prices and unit input requirements of both direct
factors and intermediate inputs are common across countries, in each sector the share of
value added in gross output is also common across countries. This implies that (3) also
e
holds when yc is the vector of sectoral value added instead of gross output. In that case, B
is the matrix of direct factor input requirements per unit of value added.
Rybczynski equations can be empirically implemented by estimating
yjc = rj0 + rj1 v1c + : : : + rjF vFc + "cj

(5)

for each sector j, where the dependent variable is either gross output or value added. Given
that in the data there are more sectors than factors (in our data, we have 25 sectors and four
factors: capital, skilled labor, unskilled labor and arable land), the structural interpretation
of the constant is the mean e¤ect of omitted factors, and the interpretation of the error
term is the deviation from the mean e¤ect of omitted factors. In order for estimates to be

5

unbiased, it must be the case that endowments of omitted factors are uncorrelated with
endowments of observed factors.

2.2

Productivity di¤erences and econometric bias

A central assumption of the classic Heckscher-Ohlin model is that technology is identical
across countries. However, there is overwhelming evidence that technology di¤erences across
countries are important [e.g. Conrad and Jorgenson (1995) and Hall and Jones (1999)]. So
far, the empirical literature based on Rybczynski equations has failed to take account of
these productivity di¤erences. We show that this failure leads to biased estimates of the
relationship between specialization and factor endowments.
Suppose that di¤erences in technology across countries can be represented as Hicksneutral productivity di¤erences, identical across sectors within a country.2 Then one unit
of factor f in country c is equivalent to ac units of that factor in a numeraire country. The
variables with tildes in Section 2.1 can be reinterpreted as corresponding to factors measured
ejc = ac vjc where vjc is the vector of unadjusted factors, and the
in e¢ ciency units. Then v

e c . Assume that the law of one price
vector of returns to e¢ ciency units of factors is w

holds. Following Tre‡er (1993), assume that conditional factor price equalization holds.

That is, it is rewards to e¢ ciency units of factors that are equalized across countries: i.e.
e c = w = wc =ac . Then, e¢ ciency-equivalent unit input requirements for each industry,
w

ebf j , are the same across countries. These ebf j can be stacked to form B,
e the unit direct
e¢ ciency-equivalent factor input requirement matrix, common to all countries. Denoting
e
R=B

1

, we obtain a linear relationship between output and e¢ ciency-equivalent factors.

This is the system of productivity-adjusted Rybczynski equations: yc = Re
vc = Rac vc .
They can be estimated by regressing sectoral output on e¢ ciency-equivalent factors:
yj = rj0 + rj1 ac v1c + : : : + rjF ac vFc + "cj
2 Tre‡er

(6)

(1995) and Davis and Weinstein (2001) …nd that accounting for productivity di¤erences signif-

icantly improves predictions of the factor content of trade, and that Hicks-neutrality is a good …rst-order
approximation to these technological di¤erences.

6

When productivity di¤erences across countries are ignored, estimates of the Rybczynski
coe¢ cients are subject to a multiplicative form of omitted variable bias as we now demonstrate. Suppose we estimate the misspeci…ed model:
yj = V s0j +

(7)

j

when the true model is
yj = AV r0j + "j

(8)

where A is the diagonal matrix with the productivities ac on the diagonal. The OLS estimate
^
s0j of the parameter vector is given by
^
s0j = (V 0 V )

1

V 0 AV r0j + (V 0 V )

1

V 0 "j

(9)

The expected di¤erence between the estimated parameter vector and the true Rybczynski
coe¢ cients r0j is
E ^
s0j

h
r0j = (V 0 V )

1

V 0 AV

i
I r0j

E (V 0 V )

1

V 0 "j

(10)

Even if we assume that "j is uncorrelated with V , unless A = I, i.e. unless there are no
productivity di¤erences across countries, this expected di¤erence is non-zero. That is, the
estimates ^
s0j of the Rybczynski coe¢ cients are biased.
In general, it is not possible to sign this bias. If the ac s were randomly drawn from a
distribution with mean 1, independent of factor endowments V , the expected bias would
be zero. However, A and V are likely to be correlated. A standard result in traditional
growth models is that more productive countries face greater incentives to accumulate capital
(physical and human) relative to their labor endowments. If, as the evidence suggests,
productivity di¤erences are persistent, countries which are now more productive will have
been more productive in the past and as a result will have accumulated more capital relative
to other factors. This would imply that in the cross-section, more productive countries
should be more capital-abundant. We do indeed observe in the data that endowments V
and productivity A are correlated. This implies that the bias we identify is likely to be
important. We note further that this type of bias is not speci…c to linear models of the
7

relationship between specialization and endowments. More generally, it may occur in any
speci…cation linking specialization and endowments where productivity di¤erences are not
appropriately taken into account.

2.3

Data and estimation results

Here we brie‡y describe the data we use. The details are given in Appendix A. All data
are for 1988. Our sample consists of 21 OECD countries.3 We restrict ourselves to OECD
countries because many of the assumptions of the Rybczynski framework, such as FPE and
the absence of trade costs, are less plausible for a larger sample than they are for the OECD.
GDP data come from the OECD, and sectoral production data from UNIDO. Our sectoral
production data consist of gross output and value added in 25 3-digit ISIC manufacturing
sectors, converted into dollars using market exchange rates. We choose value added as our
baseline measure of output, but we also check robustness using gross output. In most cases,
the results are very similar.
There are four factors in our data set: capital, skilled labor, unskilled labor and arable
land. We use non-residential capital, from the Penn World Tables (PWT), as our measure
of the capital stock. The labor force is also from the PWT. It is divided into skilled and
unskilled labor using data from the OECD on educational attainment. Workers who have
at least some senior cycle second level education are considered skilled.4 The rest of the
labor force is considered unskilled. Arable land comes from FAO.
We need a measure of Hicks-neutral TFP di¤erences (ac ) across countries to estimate (6).
We construct a TFP measure that is consistent with the hypothesis of conditional factor price
equalization.5 Conditional factor price equalization and Hicks-neutrality together imply that
for any factor f , wfc = ac wfU S , where wfU S are returns to factor f in the numeraire country
(the US), for which aU S = 1. Within the set of countries for which conditional FPE holds,
3 We

use all countries in the OECD in 1988, except for Iceland and Luxemburg, excluded because of their

size, and Switzerland, excluded because sectoral production data are very incomplete.
4 The OECD classi…cation “Senior cycle second level” corresponds approximately to those who have
attended beyond 10th grade in the US education system.
5 We obtain very similar results using alternative measures that do not rely on conditional FPE.

and for given goods prices, the revenue function is linear in factor endowments.
Yc =

vfc wfc = ac

f =1

vfc wfU S :

f =1

Hence, with information on factor returns in the US, we can calculate ac as
ac =

Yc
F
P

f =1

(11)

vfc wfU S

To calculate factor returns for the US, we divide total factor income for each factor by the
relevant factor endowment. The details are described in Appendix B.
Summary statistics of sectoral value added shares are reported in Table 1. They show
that there are indeed cross-country di¤erences in production structure. Endowment data
unadjusted for productivity di¤erences are reported in Table 2 in the form of factor abundance ratios vfc =vfw = (Y c =Y w ), where Y denotes GDP, and the superscript w denotes the
world (i.e., all the countries in the sample). We report the FPE-consistent measure of TFP
in Table 2. More productive countries appear to be scarce in all factors because output
is high relative to endowments. Less productive countries appear to be abundant in all
factors because output is low relative to endowments. This is Tre‡er’s (1995) “endowments
paradox.”
We …rst estimate (5), the unadjusted Rybczynski equations, sector by sector. Since all
variables are in levels, we weight each observation by the inverse of GDP to correct for
size-related heteroskedasticity. Table 3 shows the results. We reproduce the only …nding
that is consistent across all studies using the linear Rybczynski framework: the coe¢ cient
on capital is systematically positive, and frequently signi…cantly positive [Harrigan (1995),
Davis and Weinstein (1998), Reeve (1998), and Bernstein and Weinstein (2002)]. As noted
in the introduction, this is also true in studies that work with larger samples of countries,
and do not assume a uni-cone model [Leamer (1987) and Schott (2003)].6
Using the productivity measure to obtain factor endowments in e¢ ciency units, we
then estimate (6), the productivity-adjusted Rybczynski equations, implementing the same
heteroskedasticity correction as before. The results are reported in Table 4. They are
6 Schott

(2003) …nds this for the only cone with a substantial number of observations.

9

strikingly di¤erent from those in Table 3 in one main respect: the coe¢ cient on capital is no
longer systematically positive, indeed it is more often negative than positive. This con…rms
our priors about the existence of a productivity bias. In addition, the striking di¤erence
between the two sets of estimates indicates that the magnitude of the bias is not trivial.7
Three independent additional pieces of evidence are consistent with the existence of this
bias. First, Bernstein and Weinstein (1998) estimate equation (5) for both a sample of OECD
countries and for Japanese regions. In the case of the OECD (in contrast to the Japanese
regions), the coe¢ cient on capital is positive and signi…cant in most manufacturing sectors.
Since technology di¤erences across Japanese regions (in contrast to OECD countries) are
probably small, the bias is also small. Second, Harrigan (1997) and Harrigan and Zakrajšek
(2000) examine the role of factor endowments as determinants of production allowing for
productivity di¤erences. They do not …nd systematically positive and signi…cant coe¢ cients
on capital in most manufacturing sectors. Finally, Turkey is an outlier in our sample in terms
of productivity. When we exclude it in the estimation of (5), the strong pattern of positive
and signi…cant coe¢ cients on capital is considerably reduced. But when we exclude it from
the estimation of (6), the results do not change.

3

Heckscher-Ohlin reduced form

Despite the simplicity of their linear form, Rybczynski equations, whether corrected for
productivity di¤erences or not, are still a knife-edge result derived under very strong assumptions. In particular, they require an equal numbers of goods and factors, absence of
trade costs, and (conditional) factor price equalization. The reason for their popularity with
empirical trade researchers is that the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, in its classic generalized
formulation (see Deardor¤ (1982)), does not provide a clear alternative since it does not
yield empirical predictions at the sectoral level.
7 Harrigan

(1995) gets positive and signi…cant coe¢ cients on capital when he runs the Rybczynski regres-

sion on a panel with …xed e¤ects. In this case, there is probably a cyclical correlation between factors and
omitted productivity.

10

However, the restrictiveness of the assumptions used to derive them is not the only
problem with the empirical implementation of Rybczynski equations as presented above.
First, the estimated coe¢ cients are hard to interpret in the spirit of the H-O theorem because
they are silent on how di¤erences in factor proportions a¤ect the pattern of specialization,
(i.e. the relative importance of each sector in total GDP). For example, a Rybczynski
coe¢ cient of rjf for capital in the Beverages sector indicates that an increase of one unit
in the absolute level of the capital stock induces an increase of rjf in the absolute level of
production in that sector. But this information alone cannot say whether, as a result of
capital accumulation, the production of Beverages will increase or decrease as a share of
GDP. Second, without appropriate rescaling, Rybczynski equations fail to nest the obvious
alternative hypothesis that sectoral output levels depend on country size alone: if larger
countries have larger factor endowments and tend to produce larger quantities in every
sector, we will still estimate some positive and possibly signi…cant coe¢ cients on endowments
in (6), even if relative endowments play no role as determinants of specialization. The
estimated coe¢ cients will just capture this size e¤ect.
The approach we take to these problems is to propose and estimate a reduced form relationship between sectoral output and endowments that captures more closely the intuition
of the H-O theory, but still preserves a close relation to the Rybczynski estimates. This reduced form relates relative sectoral output (i.e. specialization) to relative factor abundance
(i.e. factor proportions):
yjc

GDP c

j0

+

jK

Kc
+
Lc

jS

Sc
+
Lc

jA

Ac
+
Lc

c
j

(12)

where Lc = S c + U c is total labor in country c. Note that for four factors, there are only
three measures of relative factor abundance. This speci…cation has the distinct advantage
over the standard Rybczynski equations that it nests a meaningful alternative hypothesis
to the Heckscher-Ohlin theory: if the level of output depends on size alone, this should be
captured by the constant term, while the coe¢ cients on the factor proportions should be
zero. In addition, as long as productivity di¤erences are Hicks-neutral and identical across
sectors and factors within a country, (12) does not su¤er from productivity bias of the type
11

described in the previous section.8 Lastly, (12) has the desirable feature that it is very
similar to a transformation of the Rybczynski equations (6). To see this, drop the constant
term in (6)9 and divide by ac Lc to obtain

Since S c =Lc + U c =Lc = 1 there is no independent variation between these two regressors.10

There are two points to note about (14). First, the results from estimating (14) can be
recovered from (6) if this last equation is estimated omitting the constant and using weights
proportional to adjusted labor. Second, (14) and (12) are identical except for the denominator of the dependent variable. Empirically, the two speci…cations yield very similar estimates
as the correlation between ac Lc and GDP c is 0.9987. This implies that a transformation of
the Rybczynski coe¢ cients and their standard errors can be given a reduced form interpretation in the spirit of the H-O theorem. It is this feature that motivates us to work with
this particular reduced form. Alternative speci…cations are otherwise equally plausible, and
it is not our goal here to assess which …ts the data best.11

3.1

Reduced form estimates

The results from estimating (12) are reported in Table 5. We do not report the results
from estimating (14), but they are very similar. When we use gross output instead of value
8 With

forms of productivity di¤erences other than Hicks-neutrality, the productivity adjustment would

not necessarily cancel out in factor endowment ratios.
9 For most sectors, inclusion or exclusion of the constant term does not signi…cantly a¤ect the results.
1 0 This particular restriction is an artifact of the factors we use. But taking into account that aggregate
output depends on factor endowments, rescaling by GDP c instead of ac Lc would also result in linear
dependence among all four independent variables.
1 1 Harrigan and Zakrajšek (2000) estimate a similar (loglinear) speci…cation derived from a translog approximation to the revenue function that is not subject to any of the problems that we have pointed out so
far. The qualitative results from estimating the log-linear version of (12) using our data are very similar to
those from estimating (12).

12

added as the dependent variable, the results are also almost unchanged. No one country
drives the results. In particular, when Turkey is excluded the results do not change, except
for a loss of precision on average. We test for the presence of nonlinearities by including
quadratic terms for each variable (we do not have su¢ cient degrees of freedom to include
also interaction terms). For only one sector can we reject (at the 10% level) the restriction
that the coe¢ cients on the non-linear terms are jointly zero.
Except in the 2-good, 2-factor case, the Heckscher-Ohlin theory does not guarantee
a monotonic relationship between the sector-speci…c coe¢ cients we have estimated and
sectoral factor intensities. However, we …nd that an interesting empirical relationship does
in fact exist. Sectoral factor intensities for US manufacturing are reported in Table 6.
Considering only those sectors with coe¢ cients signi…cantly di¤erent from zero, the sign of
the estimated coe¢ cient on a particular factor in a particular sector in Table 5 tends to match
the actual intensity of factor use in that sector. Most of the positive signi…cant coe¢ cients on
S=L are in sectors that use skilled labor intensively. The two negative signi…cant coe¢ cients
on S=L are in Leather Products and Footwear, two of the sectors with the lowest skill
intensity. For K=L, most of the negative signi…cant coe¢ cients are in sectors with low
capital intensity, while the only positive and signi…cant coe¢ cient is in Non-ferrous metals,
a capital intensive sector. Figure 1 is a scatter-plot of the estimated coe¢ cients on S=L
against the actual skill intensity in the US. The relationship between the coe¢ cients we
estimate and sectoral factor intensities is in fact very strong. Figure 2 graphs the estimated
coe¢ cient on the K=L ratio against the sectoral capital intensity. Capital intensive sectors
do not tend to have positive estimated coe¢ cients on the K=L ratio.
The basic mechanism of the H-O theory suggests that the more abundant is a country in
a particular factor, the lower is the autarky price of that factor, the cheaper is the autarky
price of goods intensive in that factor, and hence the stronger the comparative advantage and
specialization of the country in those goods. However, despite its appeal, this intuition need
not always carry through for all goods [See Deardor¤ (1979) and Aw (1983)]. Examining
the match between estimated coe¢ cients and factor intensities tests not the H-O theory, but

13

something stronger. The existence of a strong positive correlation for the share of skilled
labor poses a challenge for future research: Are there stronger versions of the H-O theory
that can explain this …nding?12

3.2

Prediction

As the R-squared indicates, the ability of variation in relative factor endowments to explain
variation in the share of total output in individual sectors di¤ers a lot across sectors. We want
a measure of the ability of relative factor endowments to explain the pattern of specialization
as a whole. In our cross-section data-set, most of the variation in relative factor endowments
across countries is between relatively poor and relatively rich countries. As a summary
measure of the ability of relative factor endowments to explain the pattern of specialization
across the OECD, we compare the actual di¤erence in pattern of specialization between rich
and poor countries with that which would be predicted by the model, conditional on the
endowments of rich and poor countries. The exercise is performed as follows. We rank our
sample of countries by GDP per capita, and select the bottom quartile (Turkey, Portugal,
Greece, Spain, and Ireland) and the top quartile (Japan, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and
the US). For each of these two groups, we calculate the group average of the three factor
abundance ratios. For the resulting two groups, “poor” and “rich”, we use the estimated
model (12) to predict the expected share of GDP in each manufacturing sector. We can then
predict how the pattern of manufacturing specialization would change if a “poor” country
were to grow and become “rich”.
The results are shown in Table 7. The …rst two columns of the table show the average
of the observed sectoral shares of GDP for the two groups of countries. Column 3 shows
the observed di¤erence. Poor countries have larger GDP shares than rich countries in 13
sectors and smaller GDP shares than rich countries in 12 sectors. On average, sectors
that grow as countries become richer double as a share of GDP and sectors that shrink as
1 2 Romalis

(2003) provides a model with imperfect competition, trade costs, and two types of countries. In

this case, the Heckscher-Ohlin link between factor abundance, factor intensities and trade (or specialization)
applies not only as an average across sectors, but also to individual sectors.

14

countries become richer shrink by half. Column 4 gives the prediction of the model for the
expected di¤erence in the shares and column 5 the standard error of this prediction. The
sign of the predicted change matches the sign of the actual change in all sectors except one.
The predicted change is signi…cantly di¤erent from zero (at the 10% level) in 16 of the 25
sectors. Focusing on these sectors, the model predicts that as a “poor” country becomes
“rich” – within the development range of these countries – it shifts production towards
Wood, Furniture, Paper and publishing, Plastic products, Non-ferrous metals, Fabricated
metal products, Electrical machinery, Non-electrical Machinery and Transport equipment.
On the other hand, it shifts production away from Textiles, Apparel, Leather products,
Footwear, Glass, and Other non-metallic mineral products.
The last three columns of the table examine how well the observed change in specialization pattern is predicted by the factor proportions model. Column 6 gives the absolute value
of column 3. The sum of the entries in column 6 is a measure of the implied inter-sectoral reallocation of output shares in manufacturing if a “poor”country grows and becomes “rich.”
Of the observed inter-sectoral reallocation (13.44 percent of GDP), the model explains 8.83
percentage points. Prediction error accounts for the remaining 4.61 percentage points. That
is, the model is able to explain two thirds (66%) of the observed di¤erence in sectoral allocation between the poor and rich quartiles. These results suggest that di¤erences in what
countries produce are strongly correlated with di¤erences in their factor proportions even
among OECD countries. This is in spite of the fact that di¤erences in factor proportions
and output specialization in the OECD are small compared with those in broader samples
of countries.

Specialization and development
Factor accumulation and development

As we mentioned when discussing the productivity bias, the growth literature both predicts
and …nds a systematic relationship between relative factor endowments and per capita in-

15

come. This is true for our sample of OECD countries. Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 plot TFP and
the three measures of factor abundance against GDP per capita. These plots are consistent
with di¤erent OECD countries being at di¤erent points along similar paths of development.
As GDP per capita rises countries accumulate capital and skilled labor, the capital-labor
ratio rises, the share of skilled labor in total labor rises and TFP also increases. We cannot take a stand on the causal links between these variables. But we note some profound
implications for the interpretation of our results that arise from their comovement. First,
our independent variables are not linearly dependent, but there is nevertheless a systematic
relationship between them. In particular, the correlation between K=L and S=L is 0.74.
Given this correlation and the small sample size, it is not surprising that we cannot always
identify with precision the independent e¤ect of changes in K=L and changes in S=L on the
pattern of specialization in Table 5. What we identify is the common e¤ect of moving along
a similar path of development.
In fact, it turns out that the variation in relative factor endowments that is correlated
with di¤erences across countries in level of development is the main source of identi…cation
for almost all sectors. This can be shown by including GDP per capita as an independent
variable in our reduced form speci…cation:

In Table 8 we report the estimated coe¢ cients and t-statistics on GDP per capita. In only
two sectors does GDP per capita add explanatory power after relative factor endowments
have been controlled for. We also report the F-statistics and p-values for the joint restriction
that the estimated coe¢ cients on K=L, S=L and A=L are all zero. In only 5 sectors can
we reject this joint restriction at the 10% level or lower. When both factor proportions and
GDP per capita are included, we cannot estimate with precision the independent e¤ect of
each, because they are strongly correlated. But when sectoral shares are regressed on each
independently, the estimated e¤ect on specialization of both factor proportions and GDP
per capita is statistically signi…cant in a number of sectors. In unreported results, we …nd
that for factor proportions, we can reject the restriction that the coe¢ cients on all regressors
16

in (12) are equal to zero in 12 sectors. Similarly, the coe¢ cient on GDP is signi…cant in 12
sectors when we regress sectoral value added shares on GDP per capita alone.
The existence of a strong relationship between GDP per capita and pattern of specialization has been noted for decades [e.g., Chenery (1960), Leamer (1974), Harrigan and
Zakrajšek (2000)]. However, so far it has not explicitly been noted that this relationship
calls into question whether the power of factor proportions to predict specialization can be
used as evidence in favor of the Heckscher-Ohlin theory of specialization. Using (15) alone,
it is not possible to say whether specialization and relative factor endowments are each
independently determined by the level of development, or whether the level of development
determines relative factor endowments, and these in turn drive the pattern of specialization.
We now develop this argument.

4.2

Alternative hypotheses linking specialization and development

Any model in which both factor accumulation and specialization are systematically related
to development will generate a reduced form similar to (12). We suggest two plausible
alternatives to the Heckscher-Ohlin theory that make similar predictions. First, suppose
that as countries become richer, TFP increases and physical and human capital accumulate.
Suppose also that there are inter-sectoral non-homotheticities in consumption [e.g. as in
Hunter and Markusen (1988)]. That is, more developed (i.e. richer) countries have higher
expenditure shares in some sectors than low-income countries, and vice versa. If countries
trade very little relative to their total consumption (e.g. because of trade costs), production structure will necessarily be correlated with consumption patterns. In such a world,
we would observe a correlation between the pattern of specialization and relative factor
endowments, even without any Heckscher-Ohlin mechanism at work.
A model of specialization based on Ricardian productivity di¤erences alone could also
generate a correlation between factor endowments and specialization. Suppose that richer
countries are on average more productive than poorer countries, but that the productivity
di¤erential is not uniform across sectors. Then richer countries will have a comparative

17

advantage (driven by Ricardian di¤erences) in the sectors with the highest productivity
di¤erentials, and they will tend to specialize in these sectors. At the same time, since richer
countries have a higher aggregate productivity, they will be more capital and skilled-labor
abundant. As a result, there will be a systematic correlation between factor endowments
and specialization even if there is no causal link between the two.
Since both of these models (and potentially others) can generate correlations between
specialization and factor endowments similar to those in a Heckscher-Ohlin world, the …nding
that factor proportions are good predictors of specialization does not allow us to distinguish
between these alternative theories. Identi…cation must come from testing predictions that
di¤er across di¤erent alternative hypotheses. For example, if non-homotheticities in consumption drive specialization, sectors in which rich countries specialize should have high
income elasticities of demand, and sectors in which poor countries specialize should be income inelastic. Alternatively, if Ricardian technology di¤erences are the driving mechanism,
sectors in which rich countries specialize should be those with relatively large productivity
di¤erences between countries at di¤erent stages of development. Finally, we note that the
preferred theory of specialization should be able to explain the positive correlation demonstrated in Figure 1: Is it a coincidence that the sectors in which rich countries specialize are
more skilled-labor intensive? We see this as a promising direction for future research.

Conclusion

This paper addresses an old question: How do relative factor endowments a¤ect specialization? In the trade literature, in contrast to the growth literature, relative factor endowments
are usually taken as given. But they are in general the outcome of an accumulation process.
We explicitly take this endogeneity into account. This a¤ects both our choice of empirical
speci…cation and our interpretation of the results. We …rst show that the results of an important part of the empirical literature are biased by the failure to control for productivity
di¤erences across countries. The bias is exacerbated because productivity a¤ects factor accumulation, and hence di¤erences in productivity are correlated with di¤erences in factor

18

endowments. We adjust the classic Rybczynski framework to take account of productivity
di¤erences. This eliminates the productivity bias. We further transform this speci…cation
to arrive at an estimating equation that is a reduced-form approximation to a more general relationship between specialization and relative factor endowments. We show that the
identi…cation of this empirical model comes through cross-country di¤erences in levels of
development. Since factor proportions are systematically related through the development
process, regressions of specialization on relative factor endowments are unable to distinguish
between the Heckscher-Ohlin model of specialization and some other plausible alternatives
that we outline. However, our signi…cant coe¢ cients are consistent with evidence on factor
intensities across sectors. The factor proportions model also does a good job of predicting the pattern of specialization. In particular, it predicts 2/3 of the actual di¤erence in
manufacturing specialization between poor and rich OECD countries.

Appendix: Data sources and construction

A.1

Endowments

The capital stock in 1988 comes from the PWT. Investment series for di¤erent types of
capital are converted into million dollars using the corresponding investment PPPs. To
estimate the capital stock, we use the perpetual inventory method with the depreciation
rates used by the PWT: 3.5% for construction, 15% for machinery and 24% for transport
equipment.
The labor force in 1988 also comes from the PWT. It is measured in thousand persons.
To obtain skilled and unskilled labor, we use data on educational attainment from the
OECD publication Education at a Glance (1992 and 1993).13 For most countries, the data
refer to 1989, but for some they refer to 1987, 1988 or 1990. We de…ne as skilled all those
workers who have at least some upper-cycle second level education. We combine information
1 3 We

believe that the Barro-Lee data-set, though standard in the literature, mismeasures vocational

education and as a result underestimates educational attainment in European countries which form an
important part of our sample.

19

on educational attainment of the total population aged 25-64 (Table C.1 in Education at
a Glance) with information on labor force participation rates by educational attainment
(Table C.5) to obtain percentages of the labor force in each category.
The stock of arable land in 1988 is from the FAO Statistical Yearbook (FAO). It is
measured in thousand hectares.

A.2

Output

Sectoral output data (gross output and value added) for 1988 come from the UNIDO Industrial Demand-Supply Balance Database, 3-digit ISIC Codes. We exclude three sectors
from our sample. One is a residual category. The other two are Petroleum re…neries and
Miscellaneous petroleum and coal products. We exclude them because many countries do
not report data on these sectors. GDP data come from OECD National Accounts - Detailed Tables, 1983-1995 (OECD-DT). To get GDP at factor cost, we sum Consumption of
…xed capital, Compensation of employees paid by resident producers, and Operating surplus
(Table 1). To be consistent with our exclusion of residential construction from the capital
stock, we additionally subtract Gross rent (GR) from GDP (line 9, Table 2). This component represents on average 11% of GDP. Three countries do not report data on GR, but
on a slightly more aggregated item, Gross Rent, Fuel, and Power (GRFP). For them, we
impute the ratio of GR to GRFP in the other countries. For Turkey (which reports neither
GR nor GRFP), we use the average ratio of GR to GDP for all other countries to impute
GR. We call this measure Adjusted GDP (AGDP). This is the measure of GDP we use in
the paper.
All output measures are converted to thousand US dollars using the average yearly
market exchange rate for 1988 from International Financial Statistics (IFS). This conversion
implicitly assumes that the law of one price holds for manufacturing output (already assumed
for FPE). In converting this way, we follow the convention in the trade literature.

A.3

Factor prices and factor intensities

To construct our productivity indices, we use data on factor prices. Here, we describe the
data sources. We take the functional distribution of income from OECD-DT. We take the
share of self-employed in the labor force from the Yearbook of Labor Statistics (ILO). We
estimate the ratio of skilled to unskilled wages for the US from the Integrated Public Use
Microdata Series (IPUMS) for 1990. This is a 1% sample of the 1990 US Population Census.
From Ball et al. (1999), we obtain data on the total value of arable land in the US, and
its rental price in 1988. Data to estimate income to land in all other countries come from
OECD-DT
Factor intensities by sector are for the US. The capital stock for each sector is calculated from UNIDO current-price data on sectoral gross …xed capital formation (de‡ated
by the de‡ator for total gross …xed capital formation in the US) using the perpetual inventory method with rate of depreciation 10% per annum. The initial year used is 1963
and the …nal year used is 1987. Labor force is employment in each sector in 1988, also
from UNIDO. Capital-labor ratios are expressed relative to the average capital-labor ratio
across all included sectors. So in Table 4, a value of 0.82 in the Food products sector means
that the capital-labor ratio in Food products is 82% of the average capital-labor ratio across
manufacturing sectors. Skilled and unskilled shares are derived using the 1988 March CPS.
Employed workers are assigned to 3-digit ISIC sectors according to the industry they work
in (correspondence available on request). Those employed in a particular sector who are not
high school graduates are considered unskilled. Those with high school diplomas or above
are skilled.

Appendix: Productivity estimates

We calculate productivity levels as in (11). We require data on factor prices for the numeraire
country, the US. From OECD-DT, we divide AGDP into the compensation of employees and
a residual. We then divide the compensation of employees into the compensation of skilled
labor and the compensation of unskilled labor. We do this by taking the ratio of average
21

skilled wages to average unskilled wages. This ratio is 1.63. So if wu is the compensation of
unskilled, and ws is the compensation of skilled workers, then wu U + 1:63 (wu ) S = Total
compensation of labor. From this we can back out wu and hence ws . We divide the residual
of AGDP into the compensation of capital and the compensation of land. From Ball (1999)
we take the total compensation of land. Dividing this by the stock of land, we obtain the
return to land, wl . We subtract the total compensation of land from the residual of AGDP
to get the total compensation of capital. We divide this by the stock of non-residential
capital to obtain the return to capital, wk . For the US in 1988, we estimate factor prices of
$ 15877 for unskilled labor (wu ), $ 25952 for skilled labor (ws ), $ 143 per hectare for arable
land, and $ 0.266 per dollar of capital stock, inclusive of depreciation.

Dependent variable is sectoral value added. Observations are weighted by the inverse of GDP to correct for heteroskedasticity.

Indep. vars are raw factors multiplied by TFP. Const. is divided by 10000000, coeffs. on capital, unskilled and arable by 1000, on skilled by 10000.

R-squared = 1-SSR/SST where SSR is sum of squared residuals, SST is n times sample variance of dep. variable, calculated from weighted model
