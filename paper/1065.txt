The Short—Run Relation Between
Inflation and Growth in Latin America

ABSTRACT

This

paper investigates the relationship between monetary policy and growth

in five Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru).

The analysis focuses on the effects of expected and unexpected monetary growth
on output, and explicitly incorporates the relationship between fiscal deficits

and money creation in these countries. Open economy considerations are explicitly introduced into the analysis.

Contrary to previous findings (Hanson, 1980), the results obtained in this
paper indicate that these countries exhibit very different behavior with respect

to the relationship between unexpected money and growth: While for Chile and
Brazil no evidence was found of a positive relation between monetary policy (expected or unexpected) and growth, for Colombia, Mexico and Peru a positive
relationship was found between unexpected monetary policy and growth.

In analyzing the relationship between unanticipated monetary policy and

growth for a group of Latin American countries, using the approach of Lucas
(1973) and Barro (1977), James Hanson (1980, p. 987) concludes that for these

countries "[A]s a rule of thumb, ten percentage points of unexpected inflation

raise output about one percentage point above trend...". However, Hanson's
results are not robust and depend critically on the functions he uses to gener-

ate expectations of monetary growth. If more general monetary processes are
used, and open economy considerations are introduced into the analysis, Hanson's
results are substantially changed.

The purpose of this note is to show that when a monetary process that explicitly incorporates the role of fiscal deficits is considered, Hanson's
general result ——

that

suggests an elasticity of .10 between output growth and

1/
unexpected money for all these countries —— does not hold.—

In particular, this

alternative monetary process indicates that these countries exhibit very different behavior with respect to the relationship between unexpected money and

growth. Furthermore, Lucas' (1973) proposition of an inverse relationship between the effect of (unexpected) monetary policy and the variability of the

money supply seems to hold for these countries. The paper also incorporates
into the analysis the fact that these countries are open economies, This is done
in three ways: (1) changes in the terms of trade are explicitly incorporated as
possible determinants of growth; (2) for the case of Mexico —— which maintained
a fixed exchange rate during most of the period —— unexpected domestic credit
is also used as the relevant policy variable; (3) the possibility that all these
countries are subject to common external shocks is incorporated explicitly in
the estimation procedure.--'

Hanson's study is •based on the estimation of equations for Brazil, Chile,

Colombia, Mexico and Peru of the following type:

where Y is the log of real output, DYt = (log

and DMR is the

unexpected change in the log of the quantity of money, Hanson tries several
specifications for DMRt. Some of his best results are obtained when DltRt is
replaced by actual changes in the quantity of money DMt (Hanson, Table 1),
and when DMRt is defined as actual growth of the quantity of money minus past
inflation ——

(Hanson, Table 4). Table 1 presents the re-

sults obtained from the estimation of equation (1) using these definitions of

DMRt. Even though the data used do not correspond exactly to Hanson's, the
results are very similar.-" These results were obtained, as in Hanson's paper,
using a narrow definition of money (M1). When a broad definition of money is
used, however, the results are similar. These results, together with pooled
estimations, constitute the base of Hanson's analysis. However, as is shown below, once fiscal deficits and open economy factors are introduced, the similarity
across countries of output response to monetary changes reported in Table 1 tends
to disappear.

I. Fiscal Deficit and Monetary Growth in Latin America
A well—known feature of developing countries in general, and Latin—American
countries in particular, is that money creation is an important source of
government revenue (see, for example, Harberger, 1964, 1978; Ffrench—Davis,

1973; and Baer and Beckerman, 1974). In this section, I present results obtained from the estimation of monetary growth equations that incorporate ex-

plicitly the role of the fiscal deficit in money creation. Specifically, it is
assumed that in every period the growth of the quantity of money responds partially to the current fiscal deficit, and to past rates of money creation:

are used in section TI as a measure of unexpected money.!
Table 2 presents the estimates of (2) for these five Latin—Anerican

countries. In most cases, k equals 3. For Chile, however, k equals 2, and
for Peru k equals 4, to produce white noise residuals. In addition, for
Mexico —— the only country in the sample that had a fixed exchange for most of
the period —— an equation for domestic credit is also reported.—' As may be

seen, in most cases DEFt is positive and significant. One might also note that
in all cases, the F statistic indicates that the regression is significant at
conventional levels. The Durbin—T4atson statistic, and analysis of the autocor—
relation functions of the residuals using the Box—Jenkins (1976) procedure show
that the residuals of these monetary equations are white—noise, indicating that

they are appropriate candidates for the measure of unexpected money. An important characteristic of the money equations presented in Table 2 is that,
when measured by the standard deviation of the prediction error, they outperform
simple autoregressions and past inflation in predicting actual changes in the

money stock.-'

II. Monetary Shocks and Growth in Latin America
This section re—examines the relationship between growth and unexpected
monetary policy in Latin America, using the residuals from the money supply equa-

tions reported in Table 2 as a measure of unexpected money. The possible role
of changes in the terms' of trade (DTOT) in these countries' growth is also in-

vestigated. For each country, the following equation was estimated:

are residuals from the estimation of (2)The time variable is

where

included only for Brazil in order to reduce the degree of serial correlation
observed in the residuals.

In the analysis k ranges from zero to three. There are several ways to
justify the inclusion of lagged values of DMR in equation 3. First, as Barro
(1978, P. 553) has argued, lagged DtRs may capture the effects of unexpected

monetary shocks on stock variables (like capital) that are carried forward.
The inclusion of lagged values of DMR also pick up both short—run and long—

run effects of monetary shocks on growth. While y captures the short—run
k
y. captures the long—run effect of
effect of unexpected monetary shocks,
i=0
these shocks. This interpretation of the coefficients of lagged values of
DNR in an equation of the type of (3) has recently been suggested by Korinendi

and McGuire (1981). Furthermore, if the natural rate hypothesis is true,

k
E

should not be significantly different from zero.

1=0

Equation (3) was estimated in two alternative ways. First, OLS were applied for each country, using the residuals from the monetary process equations

reported in Table 2 as measures of unexpected money. Second, equation (3) was
also estimated using Zeliner's (1962) seemingly—unrelated regression procedure

(SURE) for the cases of Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru for 1954—1974. Since
all these countries are open economies, and hence are subject to common external
shocks, the residuals (Es) from the growth equations for each of them could be

correlated. The use of this CLS procedure is superior to simply pooling the
different equations since it still allows for differences in the y.'s across
countries.

The results obtained from the OLS estimation of (3) are reported in Table

3. Table 4, on the other hand, contains the seemingly unrelated regression results from the simultaneous estimation of equations (3.1), (3.3), (3.4) and (3.6)

—7—

for Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. As one can see the results are very

different across countries. For Brazil and Chile, no evidence was found of
a significant effect of unexpected money on output growth. On the other hand,
for Colombia, Mexico and Peru, some evidence of significant positive effects

of unexpected money on growth was found. However, the significant coefficients for unexpected money changes vary widely in both magnitude and lags.21

The results for Mexico are particularly interesting. While none of the y.'s
is significant when unexpected changes in domestic credit are used, a positive, significant coefficient for

is found when M1 is used as the relevant

monetary aggregate. This is, to some extent, surprising, since one would expect
that in the case of a small open economy with fixed exchange rates, domestic

credit would be the relevant policy variable.1' The results presented j
Tables 3 and 4 also indicate that changes in the terms of trade are positively
related to output growth in these countries (0 is positive in all cases).
However, these coefficients are only significant at the conventional levels
for the cases of Chile and Nexico.

III. Money, Inflation and Growth in Brazil and Chile
According to the discussion presented in the preceding section, for
Brazil and Chile, unexpected monetary changes have no effects on output growth.
These results, however, appear to be inconsistent with Hanson's findings ——

reported

in panel B of Table 1 of this paper. This inconsistency is more ap-

parent than real, and is due to the peculiar definition of unexpected money used
11/

by Hanson.—

In order to investigate this problem further, I re—estimated

Hanson's equations without restricting the coefficients of DM and DPt1 to

be equal and opposite. The results for Brazil and Chile are:

As may be seen, in both cases the coefficient of actual money changes is
not significant, while for Brazil the coefficient for past inflation is sig-

nificantly negative. Furthermore, for Brazil the restriction imposed by 1anson

of equality (with opposite signs) of the coefficients of DN and DPt1 is rejected at the conventional levels. When these results are looked at from this
perspective, they are perfectly consistent with our previous findings reported

in section II: in these highly inflationary countries, money growth (actual
and unexpected) has no effect on output growth. However, inflation tends to
have a significantly negative effect on growth in these countries.

DATA APPENDIX

1. Real Income: For Colombia it is real GDP taken from the International
Financial Statistics. For Peru and Brazil, real GDP obtained from U.N.
National Accounts was used. For Mexico, real CDP from ECLA,

as

re—

ported in UCLAs Statistical Abstract of Latin America, was used. For
Chile, data on real CDP taken from Ffrench—Davis (1973) was used.

2. Money (Ml and M2) and Domestic Credit: For Brazil, Colombia, Mexico
and Peru, yearly averages constructed from the IFS raw data were used.
For Chile, the series reported in Ffrench—Davis (1973) were used.

3. Prices: For Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, the data was taken from
the IFS. For Chile, Ffrench—Davis series were used.

4. Terms of Trade: Taken from ECLA's "America Latina: Relacio de Te'rminos
de Intercambio, 1928—1976".

5. Fiscal Deficit: For Brazil, Colombia, and Peru the data was taken from
the IFS, For Chile, data from Ffrench—Davis (1973) was used. For Mexico,
from Anuario Estadstico Compendiado (various issues).

FOOTNOTES

1/On the relationship between money creation and fiscal deficits see, for
example, Harberger (1964, 1978), Ffrench—Davis (1973), Aglieveli and Khan

(1978) and Baer and Beckerman (1974). Hanson (1980), p. 975) acknowledges
the importance of monetary emission as a source of government revenue in

Latin America. However, he does not incorporate the fiscal deficit as an
explanatory variable in his money supply processes,

•0n the relationship between growth and monetary policy in an open economy
using a Lucas—Barro type of framework see Leiderman (1979), Blejer and

Fernandez (1980) and Darby (1982). Barro (1978) also included a terms of trade
variable in his study of the U.S. case. An alternative way of introducing open
economy considerations is to include the growth of international reserves in

the money supply equation. Results obtained using this formulation for the
case of Latin America do not alter the results presented in this paper.
have followed, as far as pQssible, the indications in Hanson's (p. 979)

paper to construct my data. However, I have deliberately introduced some
changes. In particular, I have used ECLA's data on GDP for Brazil and Mexico,
since it is well known

that

the IFS data set contains serious flaws in these

series for the earlier periods. In private communication, Hanson has indicated to me that his monetary data for Colombia was taken from the Banco de

la Republica Bulletin. In this study, however, the monetary data for Colombia
and other countries —— except Chile ——

are yearly averages constructed from

the IFS data. See the Appendix for further details on the data. The non—
significance of a1 for Colombia contrasts with Hanson's results. The reason
for this is the different monetary series used.

is important to note that the use of equations of this type to generate expectations of money growth implicitly assumes that their parameters are stable

through the period. The reason for this is that, as Barro (1977, p. 105—6)
has pointed out, this procedure uses future information (not available at t—i)

to generat the estimated ci parameters. If these parameters are not stable,
however, a period by period sequential up—dating procedure should be implemented.

-'For all countries, equations for M1, N2 and domestic credit were fitted. However, due to space considerations, only the "best" results —— as measured by
the standard error of the regression ——

are reported in Table 2. For the

—13—

cases of Brazil, Colombia and Peru, the residuals from the domestic credit
equations exhibited serially—correlated errors.

-'With the exception of one case (Chile when three—period lagged inflation is
used to predict money), these equations' predictive power outperforms those
used by Hanson.

'lt is important to note that the parameters of equations (2) and (3) are
related, and that both equations could be estimated simultaneously imposing

cross—equation restrictions. Results obtained using this approach for these
Latin—American countries confirm the main conclusions presented in this paper.

Chile was not included in the SURE estimations in order for the estimations
to be based on a longer time period, Other sets of equations were also simultaneously estimated using SURE. The results are not reported here due to
space considerations. Equation (3) was also estimated in terms of levels.
The results obtained support the conclusions presented in this paper.

may be seen in Table 3, the null hypothesis that the ys are significant as
a group cannot be rejected at the conventional levels, Also, for all countries ——

Z y = 0 cannot be rejected at the 5%
except Peru —— the hypothesisi=O
i

level.

--"Blejer and Fernandez (1980), in a study on Mexico that distinguishes between
tradable and non—tradable goods, have found a positive effect of unexpected
increases in domestic credit on non—tradables output.

'However, it may be noted that theoretically, under certain restrictive as—
sumptions (expected money growth equals growth in nominal money demand, and
expected rate of inflation equals past inflation), it is possible to relate

(DN —

DPi)

to unexpected money growth.
