Productivity and R&D at the firm level in French Manufacturing

ABSTRACT

In a companion study to that of Griliches and Mairesse for the United

States, we have investigated the relationship between output, labor, and physical

and R&D capital during the 1972—1977 period for a sample of 182

forming firms

R&D per-

in the French nnufacturing industries. Our results are quite

comparable to those obtained for the U.S. The relationship between firm
productivity

and

R&D

appears both strong and robust in the cross—sectional

dimension of the data; it
within—firm

is

less so in the time dimension. However, the

estimates are still significant and of a likely order of nagnitude.

In this respect, they are more satisfactory than the U.S. ones. We show that
this

is largely due

to

a better measurement of the variables: (1) the fact that

we can use a value—added measure of output instead of sales (or equivalently
that we include naterials among the factors of the production function); (2) the
fact that we can correct the measures of labor, physical capital and output for
the double counting or expensing out of the labor, capital and materials components of R&D expenditures.

Introduction

Following Griliches and Mairesse's study for the United States (this
volume), we use a similar analysis to assess whether or not there exists a
significant relationship between R&D expenditures and productivity performance

at the firm level in French manufacturing. Our purpose is twofold: to check the
type of results obtained by Griliches and Mairesse on their U.S. sample of firms
doing R&D against a comparable sample of French firms and to set the stage for a

careful comparison of industrial productivity growth in the two countries. The
framework and data used are basically the same as in the U.S. study. We have,
however, the advantage of being able to use value added which iray be a more

appropriate measure of production than sales. Moreover, having detailed information on R&D expenditures permits us to correct the measures of physical capi-

tal, labor, and production for the double counting or expensing out of R&D

labor, capital, or materials. One important drawback of our study is the
shorter period, 1972—77 as compared to 1966—77 in the U.S. study.
On the whole, our main findings are quite close to the results obtained

by Griliches and Mairesse. We come up with similar discrepancies between
the total and within—firm estimates of the two parameters of main interest: the
elasticities of physical and R&D capital stocks, a and y, based on differences

across firms and changes over time, respectively. However, due to better
measures of the variables, the problem is much less serious than it could have
been, and on the whole our estimates are statistically significant and of a
likely order of magnitude.

We describe our framework and data and present our main results in sec-

tion I. We document and discuss the changes in our estimates due to our
ixrroved measures of variables in section II. In both sections, we systematically refer to Griliches and Mairesse and stress the various comparative aspects
of the two studies.

I. Framework, Data and Main Results
A. Framework
Our basic nodel, as in Griliches and Mairesse, is the simple extended
Cobb—Douglas production function, which can be written in logarithmic form as
=

a +

t +

cx

a(ct

—

A

+

+i

k1 +

et

or

it — L±t)

= a + At +

£jt) + y(kt

—

Lit)

+ (P —

+ et.

The subscripts i, t refer to the firm i and the current year t; e is the error
term in the equation; v, c, P., and k stand for production (value added), phys-

ical capital, labor, and R&D capital, respectively; a, , and y are the
parameters (elasticities) of interest; p = a +

+y

is the coefficient of

returns to scale; and A is the rate of disembodied technical change.
We follow the common practice in analyses of panel data by assuming

that the error term

is composed of two components: a permanent effect

specific to the firm u. and a transitory effect w. Such a decomposition
generates two types of estimates, which can be viewed as providing cross—

sectional and time—series estimates, respectively: the between—firm estimates
based on the firm—means y. and the within—firm estimates based on the

deviations of the observations from the firm—means (y.— y.). The between—firm
estimates are not affected by the biases due to possible correlations between the

explanatory variables with the wts (at least in a long enough sample), while
the within—firm estimates are not affected by correlations with the u's.
Both estimates should be consistent under the assumption of uncorrelated errors,
while significant differences between them imply some sort of ndel misspecif i—

cation. The least squares estimates based on the original observations y,, the
total estimates, differ very little from the between—firm estimates, since
most of the variability in our data comes from the between—firm dimension rather

—3—

than from the within—firm dimension. Therefore, as in the U.S. paper, we
shall report only on the total estimates and the within—firm estimates, and not
also on the between—firm ones.

B. Data
Our sample is based primarily on the match of two different data
sources: INSEE provided us with balance sheet and current account figures (from
the SUSE files) while the Ministry of Research and Industry (DGRST and STISI)

provided the R&D information (from the annual survey on company R&D expendi-

tures). The size of the sample is larger than that of the U.S. sample: 182 firms
against 133 for the complete U.S. sample, or 103 for the U.S. sample that is
restricted to nonmerger firms.

The study period, however, is much shorter:

from 1972 to 1977, as compared with of 1966 to 1977 for the U.S. samples.

Like the U.S. sample, ours is very heterogeneous. This led us to
divide it into two subsamples: so—called scientific firms belonging to the
R&D intensive industries: chemicals, drugs, electronics and electrical equipment; and other firms belonging to the other manufacturing industries.
Our variables are defined and measured on a basis similar to Griliches

and Mairesse; however, we have taken advantage of the additional information we

had on materials and on the components of R&D expenditures. We measure
production by deflated value—added V rather than by deflated sales. We also
correct our value—added variable by adding back the materials consumption component of R&D expenditures, which is normally expensed out in current accounts.

Labor L is measured by the number of employees, physical capital stock C by
gross—plant adjusted for inflation, and R&D capital stock K by the weighted sum
of past R&D expenditures using a constant rate of obsolescence of 15 percent per

year.

Both our labor and physical capital stock variables are corrected for

the double counting of R&D already included in the R&D capital stock variable.
The available number of' R&D employees is thus simply substracted from the total

number of employees, while the part of physical capital stock used in R&D is
computed on the basis of the average ratio of the physical investment component
of R&D expenditures to total R&D expenditures and is likewise substracted.
Detailed information on the sample and the variables is given in Appendix A; see in particular Appendix Tables Al and A2 which are comparable to the

corresponding ones in the U.S. study. The much more rapid productivity growth
and higher R&D intensiveness of the scientific firms subsample (than for the

other firms subsample) are remarkable in both countries. Since our study period
is shorter, the within—firm variability is even a smaller proportion of the
total variability (about 1 percent for levels, and 5 to 10 percent for ratios)

than is the case in the U.S. sample. Note also that the French firms are much
smaller in size than their U.S. counterparts: an average of 1500 employees in
French firms as against 10,000 employees in U.S. firms.

C. Main Results
Our main results are presented in Table 1, again in a format comparable to the U.S. study: total and within—firm estimates of the production
function with and without R&D capital stock, assuming or not assuming constant
returns to scale, for all firms and for the scientific and other firms separately.

The total estimates are quite satisfactory on the whole. The elasticity of' physical capital x is perhaps somewhat too low but still of a likely

order of magnitude: about .20. In contrast, the elasticity of R&D capital

—5—

y

may be too high: about .20 for the scientific firms and .10 for the other

firms. The returns to scale are not significantly different from unity. As
could be expected from the average rates of productivity growth over our study

period, the rate of disembodied technical change is quite high (3 percent) for
the scientific firms, while it is actually negative (minus 2 percent) for the
other firms.

The within—firm estimates tend to differ from the total ones, although

not as nich as in the U.S. study. When assuming constant returns to scale,
both types of estimates are actually quite close, the only significant dis-

crepancy being the higher within—firm estimate of a for the other firms. However, when we relax this assumption, just as in the U.S. case, we obtain lower
estimates of a and y with rather implausible decreasing returns to scale
estimates.

II. Further

Results

A. Value Added versus Sales
The use of gross output or sales S instead of value added, or, alternatively, the omission of materials M among the factors in the production func-

tion is one of the possible misspecifications and sources of bias stressed by

Griliches and Mairesse. We are able to check with our data whether or not this
makes a real difference. Table 2 gives the results of such comparisons for the
scientific and other firms separately. The estimates on the first three lines
are comparable to those in Table 1, except that we use sales instead of value

added to measure output. In the estimates on the fourth line, nterials are
included as another factor of the Cobb—Douglas production function (with an
elasticity o).

The Griliches and Mairesse conjectures are verified by and large.

The total estimates using sales and omitting materials do not differ much from

those obtained with value added: the elasticity of R&D capital y is practically unaffected, and returns to scale remain constant; however, the elasticity

of physical capital a tends to be significantly higher. When materials are
included, we find a plausible total estimate of the elasticity of materials 6
of .5, while the estimate of the elasticities of physical and R—D capital

a and y are multiplied approximately by a factor of (1—6) ' .5 as expected.
The within—firm estimates with sales instead of value added also are similar

when we impose constant returns to scale. However, if we do not, large discrepancies occur; we get even more sharply decreasing returns to scale (.5 instead
of .75), while the estimate of y collapses for the scientific firms (.03) and

also that of a for the other firms (.o). When materials are taken into
account, the within—firm estimates are much improved; they become coherent again

with the within—firm estimates obtained using value added (granted the multi-

plicative factor l-) as well as closer to the total estimates.
Our results confirm that the omission of materials in the sales specification affects especially the within—firm estimates, which is related to the
fact that in the short—run materials usage varies much less than proportionally

with changes in output and other inputs. The value—added specification has the
advantage of being largely immune to such problems (implying in a sense that output and materials vary proportionally). It is clear, however, that the sales spe—
cification duly including materials and the value—added specification both suffer
from other problems since they still give rise to estimates of large decreasing

returns to scale in the within—firm dimension. One possible explanation is the
disregard for the simultaneity in the determination of output and labor, and

—T—

also materials. Griliches and Mairesse have investigated this second possibility by estimating what they call the seraireduced—form model, and we consider it
too.

B. Semi—Reduced Form Estimates Versus Production Function Estimates
If we assume with Griliches and Mairesse that firms maximize their
short—run profits and are price—takers on competitive markets, and if we lump
together the unobserved factor price variables with the errors in the equations,
we derive a "semi—reduced form model" expressing the relationship between the
endogenous output and labor variables only in terms of the predetermined physi-

cal and R&D capital stocks. Using value added and omitting materials (and
ignoring also constants, time trends or year dummies), we get:

we use sales rather than value added and include materials as

Note that if this last system of equations holds, it implies that materials vary
proportionally to sales, and hence that the value—added equation of the first

system and the first system itself will also be verified. That is the elasticities for value added a,

Unconstrained and constrained total and within—firm estimates of the
two semi—reduced form models using value added or sales are given in Table 3 for

the scientific and the other firms separately. The corresponding estimates,

a' and y', in the various equations are rather close. Although most differences appear statistically significant given the large number of observations,
constraining the coefficients to be equal entails only a very small loss of fit.
The within—firm estimates of the materials equation are the most out of line,

and also the poorest looking ones. All other estimates (i.e. the within—firm
estimates of
are

the

other equations, and the total estimates of all the equations)

coherent enough with the direct estimates of the production function

(given in tables 1

and

2).

—9—

The total estimates of the research capital coefficient y' are all
very significant and large; compared to the estimates of the physical capital
coefficient a', they indicate that the relative magnitude of the two capital
elasticities y/o.(= y'/a') is about two—thirds for the scientific firms and one—

third for the other firms. This is somewhat small but also more reasonable than
what we get from the direct estimates. Taking for example the true elasticity
of labor

to be .6 in terms of value added, we obtain indeed very sensible num-

bers for a and y: respectively .22 and .13 for the scientific firms, and .26
and .09 for the other firms.

The within—firm estimates of the research and physical capital coefficients are cich smaller than the corresponding total estimates, and they also indi-

cate a smaller relative magnitude for the research capital elasticity: about 30
to 40 percent for the scientific firms and 15 to 20 percent for the other firms.
Thus, the absolute size of the within—firm estimates is also a problem for the
semi—reduced form xxdel and the discrepancy between these estimates and the

total estimates remains. The fact that the estimated sum (a +

i)/(l

—

)

is

only about .4 to .5 in the within—firm dimension, while it is about .9 in the
total dimension, is the equivalent of the finding of decreasing returns to scale
for the production function within—firm estimates compared to the finding of

nearly constant returns to scale in the total estimates. The same pattern is
also observed in the U.S. study, but to a lesser extent: the semi—reduced form
within—firm estimates are much better looking than the production function
within—firm estimates.
On the whole, the semi—reduced form estimates do confirm the direct
production function estimates, but, contrary to what could be hoped, they do not

—10—

constitute a major improvement. Clearly the simultaneity between output and
labor is only one source of trouble. There are other problems which may affect
both types of estimates. The omission of labor and capital intensity of utilization variables (such as hours of work per employee) in the production function

considered by Griliches and Mairesse is presumably a very important one. The
failure of the assumption of competitive markets and errors in the variables are

two other possibilities also suggested by them. In what follows we are able to
show that the measurement problem of the double counting of R&D matters a lot.

C. Correcting for The Double Counting of R&D
The Griliches and Mairesse's study, as well as the other studies of the
contribution of R&D to productivity, suffers from the fact that R&D labor and
physical capital are normally counted twice, once in the available measures of

labor and physical capital and again in the measure of R&D capital stock. When
a value—added measure is used for output, it also suffers from the fact that R&D
expenditures (due to special fiscal rules in favor of R&D spending), are treated

as intermediate inputs and are expensed out. This is true for materials used in
R&D activities in France and for all R&D expenditures in the U.S. These pro—
bleras are generally overlooked for lack of information to make the necessary

adjustments. At best it is considered that the marginal product or rate of
return p, which derives from the estimated elasticity of R&D y in the production function, should be interpreted as the "net rate of return to R&D above and

beyond its normal remuneration" (Griliches 1979). For our sample of firms, we
can illustrate the importance of correcting the different variables for the

double counting of R&D and we can verify the excess return interpretation. We

—11—

find that such interpretation is roughly valid for the total (or between—firm)
estimates in the cross—sectional dimension of the data, but not for the within—

firm estimates in the time dimension of the data. Both types of estimates are
biased downward in the absence of correction, but in a rather untypical fashion

estimates are much more affected than the within—firm estimates.

the total

We document these findings in Table

we also attempt to rationalize them in

Appendix B.

Following Schankerman (1981), the biases due to R&D double counting and

expensing out can be analyzed in terms of the following omitted variables in the

production function: (v'—v), —c(c'—c) and —(.'—), where (v'—v), (c'—c) and
are the log differences of the uncorrected and corrected measures of

value added, physical capital and labor. These three corrections are approximately —3, 5 and 10 percent respectively in our sample of scientific firms and

—1, 1, and 3 percent for the other firms. Using the appropriate auxilliary
regressions, the overall biases (i.e. the differences between the estimates
based on

the uncc'rrected and corrected measures) can be decomposed into three

components corresponding to the three corrections for R&D materials, capital,
and labor. Table

gives the overall biases and their components for the scien-

tific and other firms separately. These numbers correspond to the estimates we
get when we impose constant returns to scale; but they are practically unchanged
if we do not.

In

spite of the limited magnitude of our corrections for R—D double

counting, the overall biases in the estimated elasticity of R&D capital y
quite

sizeable. On the other hand, the biases in the estimates of the

are

—12—

elasticity of physical capital

(and also of A and ,

or

are relatively

small. The total estimates of y are increased from about .10 to .20 (a
doubling) and from .09 to .12 for the scientific and other firms respectively,

while the within-firm estimates rise from .17 to .23 and .06 to .08 respec-

tively. The discrepancy between the within—firm and total estimates for the
scientific firms thus nearly vanishes. It is interesting to note that all three
y—bias components are always negative and that they tend to be larger when the

corresponding corrections are nre substantial, i.e. for the scientific firms
compared to the other firms and for the R&D labor correction compared to the
other two.

Summary and Conclusion

In a companion study to that of Griliches and Mairesse for the United

States, we have investigated the relationship between output, labor, and physical and R&D capital during the 1912—1911 period for a sample of 182 R&D per-

forming firms in the French manufacturing industries. Our results are quite
comparable to those obtained for the U.S. The relationship between firm
productivity and R&D appears both strong and robust in the cross—sectional
dimension of the data; it is less so in the time dimension. However, the
within—firm estimates are still significant and of a likely order of magnitude.

In this respect, they are nre satisfactory than the U.S. ones. We show that
this is largely due to a better measurement of the variables: (1) the fact that

we can use a value—added nasure of output instead of sales (or equivalently
that we include materials among the factors of the production function); (2) the
fact that we can correct the measures of labor, pbysical capital and output for
the double counting or expensing out of the labor, capital and materials com-

ponents of R&D expenditures. As in the U.S. study, the "semi—reduced form"
estimates which allow for simultaneity in the determination of output, labor and

also materials agree with the production function direct estimates and confirm

the importance of R&D capital relative to pbysical capital. However, both specifications yield rather implausible decreasing returns to scale estimates in

the within—firm dimension. This is a pervasive problem in this type of work
which needs to be solved before we

shall

be able to reconcile our cross—

sectional and time—series results completely.

*The estimates of the biases due to R&D materials, capital and labor are the estimates of the auxilliary regressions
on (v'—v), (c'—c) and (i.'—) respectively multiplied by 1, —a and —8, where
and 8 are taken as the unbiased estimates from the production function using the corrected asiires (i.e. the estimates in Table i). The corresponding
R2 and nan square errors (MSE) are those of the auxilUary regressions. These numbers are given in the case of the
production function with constant retirns to scale; they are practically unchanged, however, if we do not impose this
restriction, and the biases in the estimated returns to scale themselves are negligible.

APPENDIX A

Additional Information on the Sample, the Variables,

and Various Experiments

The construction of our sample is quite similar to that of the U.S.

sample by Griliches and Mairesse. Based on the two—digit French NAP and U.S.
SIC classification, the definition of the group of scientific firms is the same
in the two countries; however, we do not have firms in the computer and instruments industries in the French sample.

We preferred to exclude from our sample

the firms belonging to the air—crafts, boats and space vehicles industry (10 of
them); this is an extremely R&D intensive industry (with an average R&D to
value—added ratio of 35 percent) but most of it is public financed (about 80

percent) contrary to the other R—D intensive industries. The group of other
firms in the U.S. include some nonmanufacturing companies, and also petroleum
ref ining or food processing companies, which we have not considered as part of

manufacturing in constructing our sample. As it is, the French sample accounts
for nearly one half of the total R&D expenditures performed by French firms,
while the similar ratio is about one—third for the U.S. sample.
Actually, our sample is rrre comparable to the U.S. restricted sample,
since we removed about 25 "merger firms" (or firms which we assumed to be such
because they showed large jumps of more than 100 percent increase or 50 percent

decrease in gross plant, sales and/or number of employees). Since our study
period covered only six years, it

deal with such

—20—

Our value—added measure is at "factor costs", that is after deduction

of the value—added tax and it is adjusted for inventory changes. Materials
are taken simply as total purchases. Computing a proxy for value added as sales
minus purchases changed only slightly our within estimates. We have deflated
value added, sales and materials by the relevant national account industry price

indices (at the two—digit classification level). Using the gross output price
indices (rather than the value—added ones) to deflate value added did not change
our estimates.

In our data, the numbers of employees are generally given at the end of
the year and not computed as yearly averages which is the case for the U.S.

data. We used, therefore, the beginning of the year numbers (i.e. the lagged
numbers), as is also done for the capital stock measures. Taking the end of
year number of employees tended to deteriorate our within estimates.

This is

another indication that simultaneity between employment and output is one of the
sources of discrepancy between the total and within estimates.
The adjustment for inflation of the gross plant book value is made on
the basis of an estimated average age of capital and an assumed average ser-

vice life of 16 years. The average age of capital is derived from the ratio of
net plant to gross plant, this ratio being itself corrected to take into account

that the fiscal lengths of life used to compute depreciation in France are nch
shorter than the actual service lives.

Experiments using gross plant adjusted

for inflation in various ways, or even without any adjustment, made only very
little differences to our estimates, as was also the case in the U.S. study.
We have been able to obtain the (internal) R&D expenditures before 1972
and back to 1963 for most of the firms in our sample, by consulting original

—21—

listings of the first R&D surveys. Our R&D capital stock measures are thus
constructed from the past R&D flows for a long enough presample period (at least

9 years). Again as in the U.S. study, alternative measures assuming 0 or 30
percent rate of obsolescence per year instead of 15 percent, or using quite different initial conditions in 1963, had only minor effects on the estimates and
the quality of the fit.

In addition to information on the materials, wages and physical investment components of total R&D expenditures (and the number of R&D employees),
which we used to correct our measures of value added, physical capital and labor
for R&D expensing out and double counting, different definitions and measures

of R&D are available: total expenditures (whether they are financed by the firm
or not), expenditures financed by the firm itself (this is the sole measure
available in the U.S. study), and internal expenditures spent inside the firm
(this is the measure we have preferred, since we could obtain it before 1972).

We have also the distinction between development, applied and basic research

expenditures. Experiments with R&D

captial

stock constructed from these various

measures yielded basically the same results. Further detailed attempts to
investigate differences in the efficiency of company financed and public
financed R&D or development, applied, and basic R&D did not prove very success-

ful. At best there is some indication of positive composition and interaction
effects of the sort found by Mansfield (this volume). Public financed R&D
appears to be less productive per se than company—financed R&D, but it appears

also to enhance the productivity of the latter significantly. Similarly, basic
research, though it may not be as directly productive, interacts positively with
applied research and development.

—22--

Finally and following the example of the first studies by Terleckyj, we
have considered the number of R&D employees as a proxy for the R&D capital stock

in the production function. The total estimates are practically unaffected,
but the within estimates became nich poorer: the estimated y is about halved
for the scientific firms and is not anymore significant for the other firms.
For details on all these different experiments, the reader is referred

to the Cuneo thesis (1982). Table Al indicates our sample composition and size
at the two—digit industry level; it gives also the average labor productivity
growth rate and the average R&D value—added ratio over our study period 1972—77.

TableA2 lists the (geometric) means, (logarithmic) standard deviations,
(logarithmic) between and within—firm decomposition of' variance, and the

average rates of growth of our major variables, separately for the scientific
and other firms.

APPENDIX B
R&D Double Counting and the Excess Return Interpretation

In a recently published article (1981), Schankerman pointed out
forcefully and analysed explicitly the importance of R&D double counting and

expensing in measuring the returns to R&D. Using a large cross—section sample
of firms (already investigated by Griliches, 1980), he was able to show that the

resulting biases could indeed be quite large. He also made the point that the
excess return interpretation, even though it happened to be roughly verified in

his particular sample, should be considered as "conceptually incorrect". Using
our sample we can provide another striking illustration of the importance of
such R&D double counting biases, particularly in the cross—sectional dimension
(between or total estimates) and less so in the time dimension (within—firm

estimates). We find also that

the

excess return interpretation is not too far

off, at least for our total estimates. If

and

or (gross) rates of return to R&D capital and physical capital respectively, we
should verify that

For the scientific firms, we can take a and y to be .25 and

which

with uncorrected measures), implying that K/C should be around .4,

is

about the actual order of magnitude. The same is also roughly true for the
other firms.

It is not by mere chance that the excess return interpretion is, in
fact, roughly valid, and Schankerman's analysis must be

respect. It is easy to see intuitively why

such

qualified

in this

interpretation might apply to

—26—

a certain degree of approximation. Schankermants analysis in terms of biases due
to omitted corrections, although quite right, tends to obscure the matter. The
question is one of functional form, log—linear rather than linear, as much as
one of xn±sraeasurement.

If we consider only the issue of double counting R&D

labor and capital (and ignore that of expensing out R&D materials), and if we
assume a linear production function (instead of the Cobb—Douglas function), the
excess

return interpretation becomes quite intuitive. Assuming a linear for-

mulation we must be more careful about the "units" of nasurement of our

variables. Define C, L

and K as the true service flows of physical capital,

and R&D capital in value

will
and

actually estimate the excess rate of return
(L/K)

if

the variation in (Cr/K)

is small relative to that of K. This seems reasonable enough across

firms of widely different sizes, i.e. in the cross—sectional dimension, for the

total estimates. However, for a given firm over time the relative stability of

(Cr/C) and (L/L) may seem as plausible as that of (Cr/K) and (L/K). If this
is really so, whether one used the corrected or uncorrected ireasures of the

variables, one would estimate the rate of return
