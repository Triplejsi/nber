RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND MACRO E)NOMIC F)RECASTS

Abstract

This paper presents extensive results from testing for bias and serially
correlated errors in a large collection of quarterly multiperiod predictions
from surveys conducted since 1968 by the National Bureau of Economic Research

and the American Statistical Association. The tests of the joint null hypoth—
esis that the regressions of actual on predicted values have zero intercepts
and unitary slope coefficients are very unfavorable to the expectations of
inflation, hut they show the forecasts of several other variables in a gener-

ally much better light. There have been strong tendencies for the forecasters
in this period to underestimate inflation and overestimate real growth.
Considerable attention is given to the effects of the sample size——the issue of
the power of the tests——and also to the extent and role o.E autocorrelations
among the residual errors from these regressions.

Rationality in the sense of efficient use of relevant information implies
the absence of systematic elements in series of errors from the forecaster's
own predictions, measured strictly in the form in which such errors could have

been known at the time of the forecast. The frequencies of significant auto—
correlations among errors so measured vary greatly across the forecasts for
different variables, being very high for inflation, high for inventory investment and the unemployment rate, and much lower for most of the predictions of
the other variables covered (rates of change in nominal and real GNP and

expenditures on consumer durables). The corresponding tests for the group mean
forecasts show much less evidence of serially correlated ex ante errors, except
for inflation.

I. Questions and Data

On Economics of Expectations and Surveys of Forecasts

Much effort was spent in recent years on collecting and processing data
from periodic surveys of intentions, plans, or predictions of various groups:
consumers, corporate managers, business and financial analysts, economists.
This work was motivated mainly by the prospect of obtaining useful tools for
practical forecasting, but it is increasingly recognized that the data can have
important analytical uses for measurement and study of economic expectations.
Recent theorizing about expectations concentrates on market prices and
rawards that motivate people to use all information that can be acquired cost—

effectively. The

rational

expectations hypothesis assumes that a sufficiently

large number of agents know "how the world works," that is, recognize the
structure of their environment and efficiently process all available and

pertinent data. It is the so formed expectations that are decisive for what
transpires in the market place, and they are reflected in the equilibrating
behavior of prices and other endogerious variables (Muth, 1961; Poole, 1976).
Prices in a market may incorporate all information that matters, even though

price expectations of many, perhaps even most, traders do not meet the
rationality criterion,1

1For this to happen, all that is needed is that some resourceful participants have their way in eliminating the unexploited profit opportunities in
the given market. Those who succeed relatively often tend to reap gains: the
competitive game of economic prediction cannot be comprehended by treating
expectations as if they were simple-valued and universally shared. Thus it is
important to distinguish between individual and market expectations. For an
early argument that rational market reactions may coexist with a large amount
of individual "irrationality," see Becker, 1962.

—2--

However, under uncertainty and in areas of the economy other than the competitive auction markets, quantity signals may be as important as price signals. Economic agents are presumably most interested in local variables
relating closely to their own activities, hut aggregate measures such as real
GNP growth, inflation, unemployment, sensitive cyclical indicators, changes in
money and credit, interest rates, and exchange rates are also widely monitored

and selectively used. For most of the macrovariables, market expectations are
nonexistent or unobservable, but it is evident that numerous predictions are

being regularly made and used throughout the economy. Macropredictions serve
as important inputs to micropredictions.
Not surprisingly, professional business analysts and economists produce
the bulk of the macroeconomic predictions, both for public and internal uses,

and many of them participate in periodic business outlook surveys. It might be
argued that these are forecasts of people who study the economy (experts),
which are quite unlike the expectations of those who act in the economy

(agents). On the one hand, the experts are usually credited with more knowledge of the economy at large than the agents have. On the other hand, the
experts are often charged with being less strongly motivated to predict
optimally than the agents who are seen as having more at stake.
In practice, the distinction between agents and experts is at this point

very blurred. Macroeconomic forecasters who sell their services to governmental
and corporate decision makers and often conpete as well in the market for public
attention are treated as "experts" hut they are certainly also "agents" in their

own rights. Indeed, many of them are influential agents who have passed critical market tests, as certified by their positions and by the rewards their

forecasts and advice earn them in the business world. It can be presumed that,
in general, they do have incentives to perform well and strive to do so.

—3—

Consistent with this view, it is appropriate that the results of business
outlook surveys have received alternative interpretations in the literature.
They are treated either as agents' expectations, e.g., in tests of whether
they conform to the hypotheses of rational or adaptive expectations, or as
experts' forecasts, e.g., in comparisons with predictions from particular

econometric models.2 This paper will adopt the first of these perspectives.
An ideal survey would use a large, properly constructed random sample to
insure that the respondents represent well the universe of those whose expectations count, and a system of rewards and penalties to insure that they have

a stake in their responses. Of course, the ideal surveys do not exist and the
actual ones may be far from ideal. If a survey yields inferior or biased predictions, it is possible that carelessness, poor information, or other failings of particular respondents are to blame, which should not be generalized.
The evidence may be distorted and the results misinterpreted because of
reporting errors, outliers, undue reliance on averages from small samples,

spotty participation, or limited time coverage. But detailed knowledge of,
and attention to, the data can go far to safeguard against such pitfalls.
This work should benefit from the author's direct involvement with the
management of the surveys to be discussed.

a weak test, since rational expectations imply efficient use of pertinent

unbiased

predictions may still be far

from optimal or even accurate.

3consider as an example the much studied short-term expectations of
inflation: what is known about their determinants? There are the dominant
hypotheses of economic theory. But economists do not agree on all the
important features of their models, and insofar as their models contradict
each other they surely cannot all be properly specified. It is difficult to
accept the notion that the representative agent is free of the limitations of
knowledge that are evident in experts' analysis of the economy. But conse—
quences of incomplete information or deficient knowledge may he mistaken for
departure from rational expectations (ZarnoWitz, 1982a).

assumptions about the plausible data and models constituting the

information sets in question. For any variable, an important part of the
set

is made of past errors made by the forecaster and known (or at

least knowable) to him or her at the time of the forecast. The testable
requirement here is that there be rio significant autocorrelation among such

errors, i.e., that the predictions be essentially free of systematic error
components that could have been detected and corrected on a current basis.
In this study, the tests of bias and autocorrelation of errors are
applied to a large number of time series of multiperiod prediotions for six

selected macroeconomic variables. The data, described below, are believed to
represent well the contemporary "state of the art" in professional forecasting

of business conditions. Problems of how to measure the predictive errors and
how

of

to estimate the parameters in

question are best discussed in the context

of persons who are regularly engaged in the analysis of current and prospective business conditions. r4ost of the respondents are from the world of
corporate business and finance hut academic institutions, government,
consulting firms, trade associations, and labor unions are also represented.
The format of the survey remained unchanged from its inception in 1968:4
through 1981:2, with forecasts covering on each occasion the current and the
next four quarters, for eleven time series representing the principal measures
of national output, income, consumption, investment, the price level, and
unemployment.5

Past work on the survey data has concentrated on summary measures (mainly
group medians or means, in some cases standard deviations), whereas this paper
is part of a comprehensive study of forecasts by individual respondents in the

NBER—ASA group. Further, unlike the many recent studies which consider only
expectations of inflation, this report covers other important aggregative
variables as well.
The body of the data consists of 42 consecutive surveys covering the

period from 1968:4 through 1979:1. Altogether, the list of those who replied
to any of the questionnaires includes 172 names (which are treated confiden-

tially). However, many individuals responded only once or a few times, and

(since 1974) in mStat News. The forecasts have been regularly published and
frequently discussed in Economic Prospects, a report by the Commercial Credit
Company (1972-73), and in Economic Outlook USA, a report by the Survey

Research Center at the University of l Jgi (since 1974). On the origin of
the survey and the design of the questionnaire, see Zarnowitz, 1969a.
51n 1981 the coverage has been substantially extended. The surveys also
have regularly collected unique data on the methods and assumptions used by the
participants, and on the probabilities they attach to alternative prospects
concerning changes in output and prices. For references to some evaluations of
the overall results from the ASA—NEER surveys, see Zarnovjitz, 1982c.

—7—

some decision had to be made on the minimum number of surveys that would

qualify a participant for inclusion. It was set at 12, which still left as
many as 79 individuals in the sample.

Four of the variables covered have strong upward trends, and it is not
their levels that are of major interest hut rather their rates of change which

reflect their real growth and/or inflation. These are gross national product
and consumer expenditures for durable goods, both in current dollars (GNP and
CEDG); GNP in constant dollars (RGNP); and the GNP implicit price deflator

(IPO). For these series, forecast errors are measured as differences,
predicted minus actual percentage change.

The change in business inventories (CBI), a current—dollar series, is

trendless, being already in first-difference form. The unemployment rate (Tm)

represents the percentage unemployed of the civilian labor force and is dominated by short-term, mainly cyclical movements, not a long—term trend. For
these two variables, therefore, forecast errors are measured as differences,
predicted level minus actual level.6
Including the group averages, about 400 quarterly time series of forecasts
are available for each of the six variables (five series for as many target

quarters per each of the 80 sources). The volume and quality of the data are
such as to permit an intensive study of each of the various aspects of economic
predictions .

6See Zarnowitz, 1982c, for references to the treatment of level and
change errors.
7Neglect of data problems explains why some survey evaluations yielded
mixed and partly contradictory results of limited applicability. ( case in
point is the series of surveys of economic forecasters conducted semiannually
since 1947 by Joseph . Livingston, a syndicated financial columnist. See
Carlson, 1977; Pearce, 1979; and Figlewski and Wachtel, 1981). Several
aspects of the surveys are important here: their timing, its consistency and
the effective forecasting spans involved; changes

This paper is limited to one phase of this large research project, namely
the search for evidence on the extent and locus of those errors that appear to

by "systematic." What are the frequencies and significance of bias and auto—
correlated errors? How do the findings vary for different variables and

predictive horizons? For individual and composite forecasts? What do the
results indicate about the rationality hypothesis as applied to macroeconomic
predictions?

The next section defines the measures to be used, discusses problems with
the data and presents the evidence on the question of bias in multiperiod pre-

dictions by individuals. Section III addresses the problem of serially dependent residual errors and applies the tests for unbiasedness to group forecasts

from the surveys. Section IV deals with the tests for autocorrelation in the
"knowable" forecast errors. The final section (V) sums up the results and
places them in the context of

8 exception is the unemployment rate series which is available monthly.
9This procedure imposes on the forecasters the burden to predict future
revisions that are assumed to remove observational errors. n alternative is
to compare the forecasts with provisional data that are closer to the most
recent figures that were available to the forecaster. The most informative
approach is one that integrates the analysis of data errors and of predictive
errors, which would be a good task for another paper. On the role of prelim—
mary data and revisions in economic measurement and prediction, see Cole,
1969; Howrey, 1978; and Zarnowitz, 1979 and 1982a.

Estimating Regressions of Pctual on Predicted Values
Regressions of the actual on the predicted values have been computed for
each of the 79 individuals who participated in at least 12 surveys and also for
the series of means of the corresponding predictions (called the group mean

forecasts). For the unemployment rate (UR) and inventory investment (CBI),

However, it is uncertain whether the assumption that the U's are serially
uncorrelated is appropriate in the analytical situation before us. Consider

multiperiod forecasts issued each quarter for a chain of m quarters ahead:
clearly, both the actual and predicted values for the cumulative changes during
the overlapping intervals (0—1, ..., 0—rn) will show autocorrelatjons of, at

least, first to rnth order. But it may be possible to circumvent this
particular problem by focusing on marginal changes over nonoverlapping single—
quarter intervals instead of the average or cumulative changes, as it is done

in this paper. It is also important to note that the individual forecast
series contain gaps whenever a respondent missed any of the surveys (recall
that the criterion for inclusion is a minimum of twelve responses which need

not be consecutive). While such gaps reduce the informational contents of the
data available for estimating the regressions (6) and (7), they also reduce the

probable autocorrelations in the disturbance terms of these equations. It
would clearly be improper to try to replace the missing observations (predictions) by any kind of interpolation, since this would amount to augmenting

authentic forecasts with artifacts. (The worst thing to do, given our purpose
of forecast assessment, would be to use the available actual data to close the

gaps.) Forecasters miss surveys essentially at random because of reporting
problems (Zarnowitz, 1982c), which means that simply dropping the observations

—12—

forecasts are not available should be a reasonable procedure which will
a loss of efficiency in the OLS estimates but not bias or inconsistency.
In sum, this simplest approach to testing for unhiasedness in the regres-

sion framework is arguably justified by the nature of our data and objectives,
besides having the advantage of using the entire set of the more regular fore-

casts at our disposal. Of course, this does not reduce the need to check on
the autocorrelations among the disturbances, which can be caused by various
factors, notably shocks and/or measurement errors in the actual values that are

unanticipated and persist for more than one unit period. In this connection,
it .iill be instructive to pay particular attention to forecast series that have

no gaps such as the series of comprehensive group mean predictions, and to
apply to them the techniques of generalized least—squares (GLS) estimation.

Distributions of the Regression and Test Statistics
Table 1 presents the evidence from a very large collection of forecasts,

including 790 Pj and 1,560 P.. series. To provide a background of
descriptive statistics, the OLS estimates of the intercepts and slope coeffi-

cients in equations 6 and 7 are summarized in columns 1—4. There is a great
deal of dispersion in these figures, reflecting partly differences in the
ability of the individuals to produce unbiased forecasts and partly differences
in time coverage.

The means of a.(a) tend to increase with j,

the distance to the

contrast, the means of

more irregular fluctuations.

The Effects of Sample Size
Although broadly based and rich in comparison with the few small samples
used in most studies of economic forecasts, our data also have some important

limitations that need to he recognized. The forecast series are numerous but
inevitably much shorter than would he desirable, since our surveys began in

1968 only. The minimum requirement of participation in at least twelve surveys
improves the data by eliminating the occasional respondents and the shortest

series.12 As a result, the distributions of the admitted forecast sets are
skewed toward the longer series. But the average number of observations per
series is still no more than 23, with a standard deviation of 8.
The conventional 1% and 5% significance levels imply low (.01 and .05)

probabilities of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis H0 when it is true hut
also high complementary (.99 and .95) probabilities of wrongly accepting H0
when it is false. For small sample sizes, therefore, these tests have very low

12There are a few exceptions where a series contains less than twelve
observations. These refer to the longer horizons and arise because some forecasters occasionally predicted fewer than four luarters ahead. Thus of the
series for GNP, 16 (4%) have 10 or 11 observations each, all but four
of them for Q4.

power against the alternative composibe hypothesis which is merely a negation

of H0 (i.e., Hi: .

0,

1). This raises a serious question about the

meaning of the test results in such cases.13
A simple experiment strikingly illustrates the importance of the sample

size in this context. The frequencies of the F ratios that are significant
at the 5% level are throughout very much lower for the forecasters who participated in 12 to 19 surveys than for those who participated in 20 or more surveys

(Table 1, columns 9 and 10). Indeed, the proportions for the first subset,
F(s), are typically zero or less than five percent and average 1.9, except for
IPI) where they range between 9 and 24 percent and average 17.1. In contrast,
the proportions for the second subset F(.Q), are concentrated between 10 and 25
percent and average 14.4, except again for IPD where they range between 38 and

98 percent, and average 76.0! Clearly, had only the shorter series been at our
disposal, they would have led us to an overly favorable appraisal of the forecasts, though not without a correct warning about the relatively high incidence

of bias in the predictions of inflation. It should be noted that the predictions of both groups of forecasters, those with the shorter Cs) and those with

the longer ()

series,

are spread about equally across the 1968-79 period, so

that the large discrepancies between the reported results for F (s) and
F(.Z) cannot be attributed to differences in the periods covered.14

shown in Zeilner, 1979, several issues arise in analyzing regression
hypotheses, notably the asymmetric treatment of H0 and
in classical
tests, the associated uncertainty about the choice of significance levels that
are appropriate for different sample sizes, and the "sharpness" of null hypotheses. Although the problems are well known in principle, they are seldom given
much attention in textbooks and are almost habitually disregarded in applied
economic and econometric literature.
14The shorter series number 31—33, the longer series 44—46, depending on
the variable covered (see Table 1, note b for more detail). For the 42 surveys
of 1968:4—1979:1, the mean (standard deviation) of the participation numbers is
43 (9); for the two subsets of 21 surveys each, 1968:4—1973:4 and 1974:1—1979:1,

To increase power, higher significance levels may be employed. Table 2
shows that the F(s) frequencies at tile 10% level exceed their counterparts at
the 5% level by factors ranging from 3 to 14.

In

The symbols for the variables are identified in Table 1.

The entries in

columns 1, 4, and 7 refer to all individuals who participated in at least 12 of
the quarterly ASA—NBER surveys in the 1968:4—1979:1 period (75 for CEDO, 79 for
each of the other variables). The entries in columns 2, 5, dnd S refer to those
ho responded to at least 12 but fewer than 20 of the surveys (31 for CEDG, 34 for
IPO and RGNP, and 33 for each of the other variables). The entries in columns 3,

forecasts from our collection and observe how they vary with the choice of g
and relative to the (0, 1) point of the null hypothesis.
For purposes of illustration, two forecasters were chosen, one coded "8"
who participated in 13 consecutive surveys, 1972:1—1975:1, the other "48' whose

record includes 33 consecutive surveys, 1963:4—1976:4. Using their QO forecasts of inflation arid real growth, Chart 1 demonstrates the strong dependence

of the results on the sample size. For either variable, the ellipses for the
shorter series are much larger than those for the longer series (about twice as

long and twice as wide as measured by the major and minor axes). Had space
been available for more such comparisons, they would generally confirm the
large gains in the precision of numerical statements that can thus be derived
for the longer forecast series.

The concentric ellipses associated with the confidence coefficients of
.99, .95, and .90 (which correspond to the significance levels of 1%, 5%, and

10% in our tests of H0:

=

0,

=

1)

are close to each other for the longer

series, spaced more widely apart for the short ones. although understandably
motivated by the wish to reduce the probability of type I errors, the use of

high g values in analyzing small sets of predictions can be quite costly in
terms of the lack of precision implied by large confidence regions.
The high incidence of bias in the inflation forecasts is on the whole re-

affirmed by this analysis, as exemplified by the IPD graphs in Chart 1. Here

That the confidence ellipses in Chart 1 have downward sloping major axes

indicates that a and h are negatively correlated, which simply reflects the
fact that the mean values of the forecasts are positive.16

Mean Errors
The tests summarized in Tables 1 and 2 suggest the presence of certain

systematic errors in some of the forecasts. An analysis of the distributions
of the mean errors of the forecasts helps to identify the probable nature of
such errors.

A tendency toward underestimation of change has long been observed in a
great variety of forecasts; it is consistent with rational expectations, hut it

also can arise in biased predictions. Table 3 shows that almost all forecasters underestimated inflation, and did so increasingly for the more distant

future. In contrast, real growth as measured by the rates of change in RGNP
was predominantly overestimated in this period of an unexpected deterioration

in both inflation and the cyclical business performance. On the average, these
overestimates rise steadily with the predictive horizon. The underestimates of
the price component and the overestimates of the quantity component tend to
cancel each other in the predictions of rates of change in current—dollar GN'P,

where the means errors are negative for most individuals but on the average

15The critical values p99, p95, and p.90 are 2.86, 3.98, and 7.24,
respectively, for the smaller sample; the corresponding values for the larger
sample are 2.48, 3.31, and 5.36. The calculated values of F are listed on

Serially Dependent Residual Errors

Disturbances and Bias in Individual Forecasts

Tests for serial correlations among the regression residuals
(eqs. 6 and 7) have been made for all those series in our collection that

consist of at least 13 observations and contain no gaps. These data refer to
the forecasts by 18-20 individuals (the number varies somewhat depending on the

target) who participated in more than 12 consecutive surveys. The noncon—
secutive predictions by the same forecasters are omitted. The series number
452, vary in length from 13 to 33 and average 19 quarters, and cover Q0—93 (the
samples for Q4, which are smaller, are not included).

For each of the thus obtained residual error (ut) series, serial correlation coefficients

are computed for k

1, ...,

6.

(Since many of the

available series are short, only the first six coefficients are considered.)
On the assumption of homoscedasticity, these measures are defined as

=

cov(u, 1k)/var(u)

The Box-Pierce statistic Q serves as a convenient test for the presence

of autocorrelation in such sets of the 's .
calculated by

In

the present context, it is

—25—

Q = n(n

(10)

+

(n —

k)1

which is approximately distributed as chi—square with six degrees of freedom.17

1ost of the Q statistics computed for the inflation and unemployment
forecasts are found to be statistically significant at the 5% and 10% levels,
and the frequencies are particularly high for IPD (see Table 4, columns 1—4).

In contrast, only about one—sixth of the F

tests

for RGNP produces similar

results, and the frequencies for CEDG are not much higher. according to these
figures, then, the incidence of autocorrelated residual errors, varies greatly

across the variables covered.18

We next match up for each individual the results of the Q tests with those
of the previously discussed F

tests

and show the percentage distribution of the

forecasts according to the significance (at the 10% level) of both statistics

(Table 4, columns 5-8). Because the F

tests

are based on larger samples that

include nonconsecutive observations for the same forecasters, the measures
underlying this cross-tabulation are not strictly comparable, hut the broad
indications obtained are deemed to be meaningful and of sufficient interest.19

17If the errors formed random uncorrelated sequences, the
would
themselves be uncorrelated with variances equal to (n - k)/n(n + 2). For
large values of n and relatively small m, the variances approximate 1/n
and '7 = n

x

In view of the small size of the available samples, it

seemed advisable to avoid these common approximations. See Box and Pierce, 1970.
18The frequencies of significant Q 's increase from QO to Q3 for IPD, UR,
and CEl, hut appear to be unrelated to the predictive horizon for the other
variables.
19Given the nature of the available data, few alternatives to the adopted
procedures were perceived and none seemed preferable in terms of the prospec—
tive costs and returns.

Serial correlation in the error terms u may bias upward the F statistics, causing them wrongly to reject the null hypothesis. ut cases in which

both Q and F are significant represent only four to eight percent of our
observations for GNP, RGNP, CEDG, and CBI, and 14 percent for OR (column 5).
Once more, the situation is entirely different for IPD, where such cases account

for as much as 66 percent of the forecasts. Except for IPI) and OR, the F's

clearly are more likely to be significant when the F's are not (cf. columns 5

and 7). Often, too, the Q's are significant while the F's are not; this is
so in particular for GNP, OR, and CEDG (column 6). Finally, except for IPD,

tests which find neither Q nor F to he significant are very frequent,
adding up to more than half of the observations (column 8).

OLS Estimates and Tests for the Group Mean Forecasts
Consider now the overall group forecasts, that is, series of means of the

corresponding predictions by all individuals included in this study. For each
of our thirty target categories (6 variables x 5 horizons), actual values are
regressed on these composite forecasts by means of ordinary least squares.

Table 5 shows that the results vary greatly for the different targets. The

absolute values of the regression intercepts JaJ often increase with the
predictive horizon, while the signs of these estimates are about equally mixed
(column 1) .

All

of the slope coefficients (b) are positive but they other-

wise display no common regularities (column 2). For example, the b's tend to
be smaller than 1 .0 and declining with the horizon for IPD and OR, larger than
1.0 and rising with the horizon for RGNP and CBI.

For GNP, the values of a do not deviate significantly from zero and the

values of h from unity, according to the F and t ratios (columns 3-5)

In contrast, the F tests strongly reject H0: (, ) = (0, 1) for the inflation (IPD) forecasts, particularly in the more distant quarters, and the

Reflecting the favorable results of the bias tests, RV accounts for more

than 90% of M for GNP, tJR, and CEDG. The MC estimates are 6% or less, with
the important exception of IPD inflation, where they rise from 15 to 45% be-

tween QO and Q4. The Sc proportions are relatively high for the shortest predictions of RGNP and CBI which are very sensitive to errors in the jump-off
estimates; elsewhere they average 2-5% only.
The Durbin—Watson (DW) statistics listed in Table 5, column 7, suggest
that the residual disturbances froe the regressions of actual on

—32—

values for GNP, RGNP, and CEDG are essentially free of first—order serial cor-

relations when 5% significance points are used. On the other hand, the DW
tests for IPO and UR

indicate

strongly the presence of positively autocorre—

lated residuals, and most of the results for CEI point with less force in the

same direction.
The well—known property of positively autocorrelated residuals is to bias
values (while leaving the OLS regression

downward the SER and upward the

estimators unbiased and consistent). The loss of efficiency—--underestimation
of sampling variances of the regression coefficients-—may in some cases invalidate the results of our tests, which motivates the next step in this analysis.

Putoregressive Errors and GLS Estimates
Table 6 presents estimates of the parameters in linear regression models
with autoregressive errors of the general form

(12)

At =a+bPt4-ut
g
J

=

where

— i1

is a normally and independently distributed error term and j

equals 1, 2, and 3 for Qi, Q2, and Q3,

respectively.22

22The procedure used is UT0REG, see SAS/ETS User's Guide, 1980 edition,
pp. 8.1—8.7. AUTOREG first estimates the OLS regressions, computes the auto—
correlations of the resulting residuals, and uses the Yule—Walker equations to
estimate the p's. Then the variables from the original data are transformed
by the autoregressive model and new estimates of the regression parameters
(here a and b) are obtained by an OLS regression using the transformed
data. The procedure thus yields generalized least squares (GLS) estimates.
It is not applicable to data with missing values, hence the exclusion of Q4
from Table 6.

For GNP, none of the estimates of the autoregressive parameters p. are
significant, confirming the absence of serial correlation among the residuals

from the OLS regressions. Not surprisingly, then, all the statistics in Table
6, lines 1—3, resemble closely their counterparts in Table 5, lines 2_4.23 The
GLS and OLS estimates also show no significant differences for the forecasts of
RGNP in 22 and and 93

and those of CEDG in Q1-Q3 (all cases in which there is

no clear evidence of serially correlated u's).
There is no doubt about the presence of first—order autocorrelations in
the error terms of the OLS regressions for inflation and inventory investment,
and here the GLS estimation results in large reductions of the test statistics.

The F ratios for IPD in Table 6 are much smaller than their counterparts in
Table 5 but still significant at the 10% level.
Finally, there is no visible improvement in the cases of RGNP-Q1 and EJR—
93,

where the F

and t

ratios in Table 6 are indeed larger than the corre-

sponding entries in Table 5. It should be noted that the high values of

and 2 indicate the presence of a second—order autoregressive process in
the

error

terms of the OLS regressions for the unemployment rate in Q2 and 93.

IV. Testing for Autocorrelation in Forecast Errors
Framework of .nalysis and Results for Individual Forecasts
The actual values employed in the previous section include all the noncon—

ceptual (prebenchmark) revisions in the data. These revisions presumably bring

the data closer to the "true' values that one would like to have predicted.

But ft is important to

recognize that such data, and hence the estimates

23Output from the initial OLS part of AUTOREG is identical with the
output of the TSP program that was used to generate the corresponding
estimates in Table 5 at least up to four decimal places.

derived from them are all ex post in nature. The residual errors from our
regressions could not have been known to the forecasters on the current basis.
The requirement that such errors be free of serial correlation is therefore not

a

straightforward test of rationality in the sense of

efficient use of contem—

poraneous information.24

The following tests allow for this problem by

using series of

errors meas-

ured as actual differences between past predictions and realizations, the

latter
the

being based exclusively on data

that were available to participants in

successive surveys. The underlying argument is that the forecasters could

and should have used this information so as to exploit and thereby eliminate as

systematic elements in it. However, it must be noted that keeping trackof the
many successive revisions in complex data, particularly the quarterly national
income and product accounts, is not a small or low—cost operation in which
forecasters can

be

expected to engage routinely. The analysis that follows

required creation of a comprehensive computer file of successive vintages of

data covered.25

The aitocorrelation functions (13) are computed for the errors in forecasts of those individuals who participated in more than 12 consecutive

these data, it seemed best to set k = 6

Table 7 shows that the averages of the calculated

valies for the

forecasts of GNP, RGNP, and CEDG decline systematically and strongly with the
increase in the predictive horizon (column 2). 'The corresponding standard
deviations show the same tendency hut remain large in relative terms (column

3). For IPD, LJR, and CBI, the mean values of Q are generally high and there
is rio evidence of any regular dependence of the distributions of the Q values
on the distance to the target quarter.
The critical 10 percent level is widely used in practice as a cutoff for

the Q test, and on this criterion most of the error series in most of the
covered categories would pass the joint hypothesis that all of the examined

26For example, the errors of the QO forecasts will not be known until a
quarter later, hence they are not yet available to the forecasts for Qi, Q2,
and Q3, which are all made at the same time as those for QO. The lack of current knowledge, then, impedes the elimination of significant autocorrelations
for k where k j. This argument applies here specifically to
for

Q1, Q2, and Q3; 2 for Q2 and Q3; and 23 for Q3.

autocorrelation coefficients are zero. The tests for RGNP and CEDG are the
most favorable in this regard (see columns 4—6 and the summary in Table 7).
However, two—thirds of the series for IPD and half of those for CHI have
statistics that are significant at the 10% level. The frequencies of autocor—
related errors are also large for the short forecasts of GNP and the long

forecasts of UR. Thus many forecasters appear to have failed to treat their
own past errors efficiently as data to learn from, for one reason or another
(inconsistent or deficient information, models, and judgments, surprisingly
large and frequent disturbances).

it should be noted that these chi—square tests are neither strong nor

direct.27 An additional test is performed by inspecting all individual
coefficients to see how many of them fall outside of the range of two standard

deviations from zero. The results, listed in the last column of Table 7, agree
generally well with our earlier conclusions.
Evidence from the Group Mean Forecasts
Table 8 presents sample estimates of the autocorrelation functions (eq. 13)

for the errors in the ASA—NBER group mean forecasts. If the error series, each
of which contains 42 observations, were white noise, the standard deviation of

would be approximately 0.154. Of the 108 entries in columns 1—6 of the
table, 82 are smaller than 0.154 in absolute value; 22 fall between 0.154 and
0.301; and only four exceed 0.301, that is, are outside the range of

s.d.

from the mean zero. Inflation forecasts account for eight of the observations
in the second and all four observations in the third group.

27For example, a value of Q below the 10% level indicates a probability
of less than 90 percent that the hypothesis that the errors are not white
noise
true. For more detail and examples, see Pindyck and Rubtnfeld, 1981,
pp. 549—550.

clear that autocorrelations of higher order among the errors of these composite
forecast series deserve much attention, but it certainly cannot be assumed that

all or even most of them are zero.28

V. Summary and

Conclusions

4ain Results

1. The hypothesis that the regressions of actual on predicted values have
zero intercepts and unitary slopes is rejected at the 5% significance level for

362 of the 2,350 forecast series examined (15.4%). Nearly

half

of these

rejections refer to the inflation (IPD) forecasts, where they account for 44.3%

of the regressions. The combined result for the otehr five variables is 187
rejections, or 9.6% of the 1,955 trials. I conclude that these weak tests of
rationality are quite unfavorable to expectations of inflation, while showing
other forecasts generally in much better light.

28In an earlier study based on ex post errors in the group mean forecasts
and using as many as twelve autocorrelation lags, some of the k coefficients
for k of 8, 9, and 10 quarters were found to be large and significant (see
Zarnowitz, 1982b, Table 9 and text). However, one would expect the autocorro—
lations to he on the whole lower for the errors that are knowable ex ante than
for the ex post errors, and the evidence we have tends to he
consistent with

that expectation.

—44.-

attitudes of the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research (ISR).
These questions have dealt mainly with the direction, not the size, of the

expected price changes and they were altered repeatedly over the period, so
that here the creation of a group forecast series requires a rather elaborate

ex post procedure of quantitifying qualitative responses. Some of the studies
find that the unbiasedness hypothesis cannot be rejected for the ISR data,
others merely that it is "not so decisively rejected" as the inflation fore-.

casts by economists and business executives.29

The regressions of actual on predicted inflation have also been found to
produce serially correlated residuals, which some of the studies interpret as

another departure from rationality. But the correctness of this view depends
on the (generally unexamined) extent to which the calculated regression error
terms constitute information knowable at the time of the forecast.

Tests for the joint null hypothesis of unbiasedness based on both OLS and
GLS regression estimates are applied in McNees, 1978, to IPD, RGNP, and UR
forecasts from three well-known econometric service bureaus, Chase, DRI, and

Wharton. The periods covered are short, 51/2 or 6 years beginning in 1970:2,
so the power of these tests is low, and the results are in part difficult to

rationalize. For the rnultiperiod forecasts of inflation, the F statistics are
generally significant but much higher for the GLS than the OLS estimates. For
real growth, the situation is reversed and the null hypothesis is consistently

29For a comprehensive d1SCUSSLOn of rationality tests with applications to
the ISR data, see Huizinga, 1980; also Juster, 1979; Curtin, 1982; and Gramlich,
as quoted. Business forecasts of price changes for goods and services sold and
capital goods purchased come from the plant and equipment surveys of the Bureau
of Economic Analysis, U. S. Department of Commerce; they have been examined by
deLeeuw and McKelvey, 1981, and fail to pass the F test for unbiasedness
decisively in 1970—80 as noted by Gramlich. Papadia, 1982, has applied the
• tests for aggregate results from consumer surveys conducted three times a year
since 1973 or 1974 in seven EEC countries; he finds that the hypothesis of
unbiasedness can be rejected in about half of the cases.

accepted for predictions over more than one quarter when GLS is used. The
results for UR are quite mixed, with indications of bias in the predictions of
cimulative change over the four—quarter span hut not in the one—quartar ahead
forecas t.s.

The first half of the 1970's was clearly among the most trying times for

the forecasters generally (see Zarnowitz, 1979). But this is not to say that
the forecast period somehow explains or excuses the observed failures of the

forecasts to avoid bias and inefficiency. 7fter all, it is precisely in times
of highly variable inflation and real growth rates that the incentives to use
data and predict efficiently are especially high. i4oreover, as suggested by
the present study, much of the variation among the forecasts is attributable to
differences between the sources, models, variables, and horizons involved; it
simply cannot be explained by differences in the periods covered.
