Why Do Countries Matter So Much for Corporate Governance?

ABSTRACT
This paper develops and tests a model of how country characteristics, such as legal protections for
minority investors, and the level of economic and financial development, influence firms' costs and
benefits in implementing measures to improve their own governance and transparency. The model
focuses on an entrepreneur who needs to raise funds to finance the firm's investment opportunities
and who decides whether or not to invest in better firm-level governance mechanisms to reduce
agency costs. We show that, for a given level of country investor protection, the incentives to adopt
better governance mechanisms at the firm level increase with a country's financial and economic
development. When economic and financial development is poor, the incentives to improve firmlevel governance are low because outside finance is expensive and the adoption of better governance
mechanisms is expensive. Using firm-level data on international corporate governance and
transparency ratings for a large sample of firms from around the world, we find evidence consistent
with this prediction. Specifically, we show that (1) almost all of the variation in governance ratings
across firms in less developed countries is attributable to country characteristics rather than firm
characteristics typically used to explain governance choices, (2) firm characteristics explain more
of the variation in governance ratings in more developed countries, and (3) access to global capital
markets sharpens firm incentives for better governance, but decreases the importance of homecountry legal protections of minority investors.

1. Introduction
Corporate governance deals with the mechanisms that ensure that investors in corporations
get a return on their investments (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Corporate governance varies
widely across countries and across firms. Better governance enables firms to access capital
markets on better terms, which is valuable for firms intending to raise funds. We would, therefore,
expect firms that plan to access capital markets – especially those with valuable growth
opportunities that cannot be financed internally – to adopt mechanisms that commit them to better
governance.
With the availability of data on corporate governance and disclosure practices of individual
companies around the world, provided first by the Center for International Financial Analysis and
Research (CIFAR) and, more recently, by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA) and Standard
and Poor’s (S&P) among others, several studies have investigated whether governance and
transparency scores are related to firm characteristics, such as investment opportunities, external
financing needs, asset size, or ownership structure, and to the efficiency of the legal regime in
protecting minority shareholder interests (Durnev and Kim, 2004; Francis, Khurana, and Pereira,
2003; Klapper and Love, 2003; Krishnamurty, Sevic, and Sevic, 2003). In general, they find
supporting evidence that the quality of governance practices is positively related to growth
opportunities, the concentration of ownership, the need for external financing, and the protection
of investor rights. However, until now, the importance of other country characteristics, such as
the financial and economic development of the country in which a company is domiciled, and
how that importance is affected by financial globalization, has not been investigated. This is
surprising since a number of studies show that other country characteristics besides measures of
investor

protection

have

a

significant

impact

2

on

country-level

measures

of

governance.1 In this paper, we find that firm characteristics, such as investment opportunities,
asset size, ownership, and cash holdings, explain almost none of the variation in CLSA scores.
Though firm-specific variables are more successful in explaining variation in S&P scores, their
explanatory power is dwarfed by the explanatory power of country characteristics.
Why then do countries matter so much for corporate governance? Countries matter because
they influence the costs that firms incur to bond themselves to good governance and the benefits
they receive from doing so.2 Better governance reduces a firm’s cost of funds only to the extent
that investors expect the firm to be governed well after the funds have been raised. It is, therefore,
important for the firm to find ways to commit itself credibly to higher quality governance.
However, mechanisms to do so may be unavailable or prohibitively expensive in countries with
poor investor protection and poor economic development. For instance, credible external
verification of a firm’s income disclosures may not be available because insufficient economic
development means that the necessary infrastructure for such verification is not available (see
Ball, 2001; Black, 2001). Consequently, a firm can have potentially valuable growth
opportunities, yet it takes no steps to have good governance because the tools required are too
expensive or not even available in its country. Perhaps the most important benefit to a firm from
having good governance is that it facilitates access to capital markets. But, this benefit is
worthless if a firm is located in a country with poor financial development. Because of this poor
development, the firm finds it expensive to raise funds, so that it chooses to raise a smaller
amount of funds and, hence, benefits less from better governance. As a result, firms with good
1

Bushman and Smith (2003) show that political characteristics are important for some types of disclosure.
Dyck and Zingales (2003) show that a high level of diffusion of the press is negatively related to benefits of
control. Finally, Stulz and Williamson (2003) and Hope (2003) find that proxies for cultural heritage and
religion are related to disclosure.
2
Our focus is on why firms in different countries have different governance quality when measured by
governance indices rather than on why governance systems differ across countries. We take the governance
system as exogenously given. It affect firms’ corporate governance decisions. There is a large literature that
contrasts governance systems across countries (see Allen and Gale, 2000). Some of that literature has
focused on development as a determinant of the financial system (see, for instance, John and Kedia (2003,
2004), who show theoretically that financial development and the quality of monitoring technologies of a
country affect the choice of governance mechanisms).

growth opportunities may have poor governance because they are in a country where financial
development and investor protection are poor. In other words, it is not worth it for the firm to take
steps to bond itself to better governance.
If a country is poorly developed and protects investors poorly, it will be difficult for firms to
find ways to commit to good governance and the rights of minority shareholders will be mostly
determined by the characteristics of the country. Therefore, we expect country characteristics to
play an overwhelming role as a determinant of governance in poorly developed countries. At the
same time, we would expect that financial globalization should reduce the importance of the
country determinants of governance and increase firm-level incentives for good governance in
two ways. First, firms that have access to foreign capital markets and financial institutions are
less dependent on the development of their country. As a result, firms from poorly developed
countries find it easier to obtain capital and, therefore, have greater incentives to adopt good
governance. Second, financial globalization enables firms to “borrow” the investor protection of
countries where protection is high. For instance, firms can list their shares for trading in the U.S.
by initiating an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program. A number of researchers have
argued that this action subjects or “bonds” the firms to U.S. securities laws (see Coffee, 1999,
2002; Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2004; Doidge, 2004; Reese and Weisbach, 2002; and Stulz,
1999). Though there are limits to the extent to which securities laws can be enforced on foreign
firms (see Black, 2001; Licht, 2003; Siegel, 2004), there may well be no substitute mechanisms
for firms from some countries to credibly bond themselves to good governance (see Ball, 2001,
and Perino, 2003).
If it were costless for firms to adopt good governance mechanisms, regardless of the
standards in the home country, then all firms would do so when they access capital markets for
the first time (unless, of course, the firm’s owners value control and discretion for non-pecuniary
reasons). Hence, even though countries would protect investor rights differently, there would be
no differences across countries in the degree to which investors are expropriated by controlling

4

shareholders. Therefore, differences in the costs and benefits from implementing good
governance mechanisms must be taken into account to explain why their adoption differs across
countries. We construct a model where countries differ not only in how they protect investors but
also in the cost of accessing capital markets and in the cost of implementing firm-level
governance mechanisms. This model enables us to analyze the determinants of governance in a
richer setting than previous models. If it is costlier to implement good firm-level governance and
to raise funds in countries with low development, firms in such countries can find the benefit
from good firm-level governance to be too small to justify the cost. Since investor protection is
generally poor in countries with low development, firm-level governance may be infeasible
precisely when it is needed most.
In our empirical work, we test the model’s predictions using the CLSA corporate governance
ratings and the S&P transparency and disclosure ratings. These ratings measure both firm-level
governance attributes adopted by firms and attributes imposed on firms through legislation and
regulation. We show that almost 39% of the variance for CLSA ratings and 73% of the variance
for the S&P scores can be explained by country-level dummy variables. Adding firm-specific
variables does not increase the explained variation for developing countries, so these variables
explain none of the variation in governance for these countries. The same firm-specific variables
explain roughly 8% of the variation in transparency scores for developed countries, so that
governance is better explained by firm characteristics in these countries. Our preferred
interpretation of the results is that countries matter more than firm characteristics. Of course, it is
not the only possible explanation since our various specifications do not explain all of the crosssectional variation in ratings. We discuss alternate interpretations and explain why we believe that
the results are consistent with our preferred interpretation.
In this paper, we use a broader sample of firms for the S&P ratings than that used in earlier
papers. As a result, we are able to estimate regressions separately for developed and developing
countries, which is not possible for CLSA since almost all countries included in that sample are

5

countries with GNP per capita below the median of the countries in the S&P sample. We find that
firm-specific variables are more informative about firm-level governance for firms from more
developed countries, which is consistent with the key prediction of our model. In particular, firm
characteristics are not significant in explaining the S&P ratings in the countries with low
development, but they are significant in countries with high development. Though splitting the
sample according to economic development identifies a significant difference in how firm
characteristics are correlated with governance, the same result does not obtain when we split the
sample according to a measure of investor protection. For instance, the investor-protection
variable used by Durnev and Kim (2004) is constructed in such a way that some countries with a
low value for that variable are extremely prosperous. These are countries where the anti-director
index of La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) has an extremely low value.
Interestingly, in these countries, firm characteristics do matter for governance.
We then investigate whether financial globalization enables firms to partly escape the country
determinants of governance and thereby sharpens the incentives for firms with growth
opportunities to have good governance. In support of our hypothesis, firm characteristics are
jointly significant for firms with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ traded (“Level
2 or 3”) ADR programs from low development countries, but they are not for purely local firms.
Further, country-level investor protection is not a significant determinant of corporate governance
for global firms in developed countries. Less supportive of our hypothesis is the result that adding
firm characteristics to a regression that controls for country effects through dummy variables does
not increase the adjusted R-squared differently for global firms than for non-global firms.
There is a related but distinct literature on the impact of globalization on governance. We
distinguish between investor protection from the state and investor protection chosen by the firm
to improve on the investor protection granted by the state, which we call “firm-level governance.”
In this paper, we focus on firm-level governance. The literature demonstrates that globalization
has an impact on the investor protection granted by the state. For instance, as shown by

6

Smarzynska and Wei (2000) and Bonaglia, de Macedo, and Bussolo (2001), countries that are
more open have less corruption, so that governance and openness are related.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we examine the choice of firm-level governance
mechanisms in a model in which the cost of implementing these mechanisms and the cost of
access to capital markets depend on the country in which a firm is located. In Section 3, we
present our sample of firms and governance ratings. We demonstrate the paramount importance
of country-specific factors and the limited importance of firm-specific factors as explanatory
variables for the corporate governance ratings in Section 4. We also show that firm-specific
factors are more important in more developed countries. In Section 5, we provide evidence that
globalization makes the governance of firms less dependent on country-specific characteristics
and more dependent on firm-specific characteristics. We conclude in Section 6.

2. A model of choice of governance attributes by firms and financial globalization
La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) show that most firms outside the U.S. are
controlled by large shareholders. Large shareholders can extract private benefits from control of
the corporation. A number of recent papers model the extraction of private benefits from the firm
by controlling shareholders (Johnson, Boone, Breach, and Friedman, 2000; Lombardo and
Pagano, 2001; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 2002; Durnev and Kim, 2004;
Shleifer and Wolfenzon, 2002; and Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2004). These models assume
either that the extraction of private benefits is costly to the firm, or that it is costly to the
controlling shareholder. Regardless of the approach taken, they establish that controlling
shareholders consume fewer private benefits in countries where the cost of extracting private
benefits is higher.
The deadweight costs associated with the extraction of private benefits increase the cost of
outside funds for the controlling shareholders. As a result, controlling shareholders for which
access to capital markets is important have incentives to find ways to commit to expropriate
7

fewer private benefits. The literature has shown that by increasing their ownership of cash flow
rights, controlling shareholders make the extraction of private benefits more costly because they
pay for more of these private benefits out of the shares they own. As the extraction of private
benefits becomes more costly, it becomes optimal for controlling shareholders to consume fewer
such benefits. Firms can also make extraction of private benefits more costly through better
governance. For instance, by increasing the firm’s transparency, controlling shareholders make it
easier for outsiders to measure their consumption of private benefits and to take actions to reduce
it. In this paper, we allow for a role for corporate governance.
We assume that there is a cost to improving governance. For instance, greater transparency
could increase political pressures on the firm and lead to expropriation from the state (see Leuz
and Oberholzer-Gee, 2003); having independent directors could be time-consuming for
management and controlling shareholders and might reduce their discretion over the firm’s
investment policy. There is considerable skepticism in the literature that credible mechanisms,
whereby the controlling shareholders commit to consume fewer private benefits, can even be
adopted in countries with the worst protection of minority shareholders. In other words, in these
countries, the cost of such mechanisms might be prohibitive. 3 The reward to a controlling
shareholder from committing to better governance is that he reduces the deadweight costs
associated with the consumption of private benefits when he raises funds in public markets. It is
generally assumed in the literature that these deadweight costs increase with the amount of funds
raised. Consequently, the reward to better governance for the controlling shareholder is small if
the extent to which he can access the capital markets is limited because of poor financial
development and if the costs from committing to less expropriation are high.
Like Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2002), we consider the problem of an entrepreneur who has to
raise funds to finance an investment opportunity. This entrepreneur has control of the firm, so that
he is the controlling shareholder. We assume that he controls the firm regardless of the fraction of
3

See Glaeser, Johnson, and Shleifer (2001).

8

cash flow rights he owns. The key difference between our model and theirs is that we allow the
firm to improve the investor protection that applies to its shareholders through better governance
at a cost. We, therefore, focus our presentation on the implications of that difference. We consider
an entrepreneur with wealth W. This entrepreneur has an investment opportunity available. An
investment of capital K will return aKα, the firm’s cash flow before expropriation, where 0 < α <
1 and where a > 0, after which the firm will pay a liquidating dividend. The diminishing-returnsto-scale production function is required to insure that the model has a solution when investor
protection is such that it is optimal for the entrepreneur to expropriate nothing. The entrepreneur
has to decide the scale of the project. If K > W, the entrepreneur must raise external funds.
The entrepreneur extracts private benefits after having raised funds and after the cash flow is
realized. Consequently, when the entrepreneur raises funds, investors form expectations about the
proportion of the firm’s cash flows that he will expropriate, f. In this model, the entrepreneur pays
a cost for expropriating shareholders on personal account; in other words, the cost is not
subtracted from the firm’s cash flows. The cost could represent the expected value of the
punishment imposed on the controlling shareholder if he is caught expropriating minority
shareholders, as in Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2002), or it could correspond to expenses that the
entrepreneur incurs for setting up mechanisms through which to extract private benefits. It is
assumed to be a convex function of f, bf 2, where b can be a positive constant or a function, and it
increases linearly with the firm’s investor protection and with the firm’s cash flows. This cost is
given by:

0.5bf 2 aK α ( p + q)
The cost of extracting private benefits increases with both firm-level governance and with the
investor protection granted by the state. The country’s investor protection is equal to p, where a
higher value of p means greater investor protection. The investor protection that applies to

9

investors in the firm is equal to p + q, where q is the investor protection under the control of the
firm.
It seems reasonable to assume that the cost of increasing investor protection at the firm-level
is not sensitive to firm size but increases with the amount of protection acquired. We assume that
the marginal cost of firm-level governance is increasing in the quality of firm-level governance,
so that we choose the functional form for the cost of firm-level governance to be mq2, where m is
a positive constant. To take into account differences in financial development across countries,
we assume that it costs n(K – W) to raise K – W, where n corresponds to a proportional cost of
raising capital. An improvement in financial development corresponds to a decrease in n, where n
is a constant between 0 and 1. Though existing models assume that q = 0, Shleifer and Wolfenzon
(2002) have a differential cost of funds between a closed economy and an open economy.4 In our
model, the payments n(K – W) and mq2 reduce the wealth of the entrepreneur dollar-for-dollar
whether these amounts are paid by him out of his own pocket or through the firm. It simplifies the
analysis, but does not change anything of substance, if we assume that n(K – W) and mq2 are paid
by the entrepreneur out of the liquidating dividend paid to him by the firm. Further, we assume
until stated otherwise that b is a constant.
The model has no risk, so that shares have to return the risk-free rate. We assume an interest
rate of zero for simplicity and minority shareholders have unlimited opportunities to earn that rate
of interest on other investments. Therefore, the minority shareholders acquire a fraction (1 – k) of
cash flow rights only if their expected dividend, equal to (1 – k)(1 – f)aKα, is at least equal to their
initial investment of K – W (this is the minority shareholders’ participation constraint). Since the
entrepreneur will not give money away to the minority shareholders, it must be that the
participation constraint of minority shareholders is binding:

(1 − k )(1 − f )aK α = K − W

(1)

4

The exception is Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004), where firms can choose to have an ADR program
which increases investor protection. There is no implementation cost to them, so m = 0. However, the firm
does not have that choice when it is set up.

10

In this model, the entrepreneur wants to maximize the total cash flows of the firm net of the
cost of extracting private benefits and of the dividend to be paid to minority shareholders:

S = aK α − n( K − W ) − mq 2 − 0.5bf 2 aK α ( p + q ) − ( K − W )

(2)

Equation (2) assumes that the participation constraint of minority shareholders is binding since
that is the case we focus on. The entrepreneur maximizes (2) by choosing three variables: K, q,
and f. In maximizing (2), the entrepreneur has to satisfy two constraints. First, he will only invest
if S is positive (the entrepreneur’s participation constraint). Second, since f is chosen after funds
have been raised from shareholders, it has to be consistent with maximization of the
entrepreneur’s welfare at the time that it is chosen (the entrepreneur’s incentive compatibility
constraint).
In a world of perfect markets, there are no transaction and contracting costs, so n = m = 0. In
such a world, the entrepreneur would choose contracts that constrain him to select f = 0. If it is
costless for the firm to choose mechanisms that constrain the entrepreneur from expropriating
minority shareholders, the entrepreneur has nothing to gain by not using these mechanisms since,
ultimately, only the entrepreneur pays the deadweight costs of expropriation. If the cost of
committing to a lower level of expropriation is convex and increasing in the level of commitment,
as it is in our model, it will never be optimal for the entrepreneur to commit to no expropriation.
After the entrepreneur has chosen q and K, shares are sold to outside investors for an amount
equal to K – W. The entrepreneur then owns a fraction k of cash flow rights, given by 1 – (K –
W)/(1 – f)aKα, where the denominator of the second term is the firm’s cash flow after
expropriation, which depends on f. After raising funds, the entrepreneur chooses how much to
expropriate by maximizing the following expression with respect to f and subject to the constraint
that f has to be nonnegative and cannot exceed one:

k (1 − f )aK α − 0.5bf 2 aK α ( p + q ) + faK α

11

(3)

The first term of the expression corresponds to the dividends received by the entrepreneur. The
second term is the entrepreneur’s cost of extraction of private benefits. Finally, the third term
represents the private benefits extracted by the entrepreneur. The solution for f when the
participation constraint of minority shareholders is binding is:

f =

1− k
b( p + q )

(4)

For given k, the fraction of cash flow expropriated falls as the level of investor protection
provided by the state, p, increases, as in earlier models. In contrast to earlier models, the
entrepreneur gets to choose the level of investor protection provided by the firm, q, and he
extracts private benefits at a lower rate when q is higher. Further, f and k are negatively related, so
that an entrepreneur with a larger stake in the firm expropriates less.
Using the participation constraint of minority shareholders, equation (4) can be written as:

 K −W 
1
f =
α 
 (1 − f )aK  b( p + q )

(5)

Rewriting this equation, we get a quadratic equation in f. The solution for f has to be such that
f = 0 if it is infinitely costly to expropriate shareholders. With this requirement, there is only one
possible solution for f:
0.5

f = 0 otherwise

(6)

When the entrepreneur chooses q and K, he also picks f, so that f can be written as f (K,q). For a
given level of K, f falls with q and with the productivity of physical capital.
When investors invest in the firm, they want to receive back their investment since the
interest rate is zero. The investment opportunity must be good enough given f and the level of
investor protection sufficiently high to guarantee this outcome. This means that, as in Shleifer and
Wolfenzon (2002), there will be investment opportunities for which the entrepreneur will not be

12

able to raise funds. If m is low, the firm can improve cheaply on its country’s investor protection,
so that some firms, that would not go public if they had to rely on the country’s investor
protection alone, will choose to do so after spending to improve the firm’s investor protection
through better governance. In our model, the cost to a firm of improving its governance does not
depend on its size. Consequently, firms that raise a small amount of outside equity – namely,
those with poor growth opportunities – will not gain from improving their governance because
the cost of doing so will be amortized over fewer dollars raised. We therefore expect larger firms
to have better governance; further, firms have better governance when m is low and when they
have good investment opportunities. A high n reduces the incentives of firms to improve on
corporate governance because it reduces the amount of funds raised. If m is high enough, firms do
not adopt firm-level governance mechanisms that improve on the investor protection granted by
the state. In contrast, if m is zero, then all firms have the same level of investor protection and
there is no expropriation. Except for Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004), the literature has
effectively assumed that m is infinite.
Substituting (6) into (1) and using the minority shareholders’ participation constraint, the
controlling shareholder maximizes:

S = aK α − n( K − W ) − mq 2 − 0.5bf ( K , q) 2 aK α ( p + q) − ( K − W )

(7)

The nonlinearity of this expression in K and q makes it impossible to obtain closed-form
solutions for K and q when b is fixed. However, our analysis leads to the following result:

Proposition 1. If m = 0, all firms that raise external funds choose a value of q high
enough so that f = 0, and the protection of investors by the state is not relevant. As m
becomes large, q becomes very small, and the protection of investors depends almost
exclusively on the protection granted by the state, p. As p becomes large and m > 0, q
becomes very small because firm-level governance mechanisms become redundant but

13

are costly. Finally, for n large enough, q = 0 since the firm does not expect to raise
external capital.

The important point of this proposition is that a firm’s choice of governance mechanisms depends
critically on the cost of implementing these mechanisms and on the cost of raising funds. These
costs are determined partly by a country’s investor protection but also by the country’s economic
and financial development. It, therefore, necessarily follows that the choice of governance
mechanisms depends on country characteristics other than investor protection. If investor
protection is high enough, no expropriation takes place and the adoption of firm-level governance
mechanisms is not optimal. If development is too low, there is no point to the adoption of such
mechanisms because firms cannot raise a sufficient amount of funds to make good governance
pay. Proposition 1 implies the existence of a threshold level of economic development below
which firms’ incentives for good governance are trivially small and a threshold level of investor
protection by the state such that, if a country reaches that level, there is little gain for firms to try
to improve on that level of investor protection on their own account.
We can obtain additional results using the first-order conditions for K and q. These first-order
conditions are, respectively, for K and q:

aα K α −1 = 1 + n + [bf ( K , q ) f K aK α + 0.5bf ( K , q) 2 aα K α −1 ]( p + q)

(8a)

2mq = −bf q f ( K , q )aK α ( p + q ) − 0.5bf ( K , q ) 2 aK α

(8b)

where fK is the partial derivative of f (K,q) with respect to K and is positive and fq is the partial
derivative of f with respect to q, which we already know to be negative. The left-hand side of
equation (8a) is the marginal revenue from investing an additional dollar in production. The righthand side is the marginal cost of the additional dollar raised for the entrepreneur. In perfect
financial markets, the cost would be $1. With imperfect investor protection and financial markets,
the additional terms on the right-hand side of the equation are positive, so that the cost of capital

14

is higher than what it would be in perfect markets. As a result, the amount of capital invested is
lower than that in perfect markets. In equation (8b), the left-hand side is the marginal cost of
better governance, while the right-hand side is the marginal benefit.
We can use equation (8b) to study the comparative statics of q treating K as a parameter. In
this case, q increases with K and a, but falls as m and p increase. The intuition for these results is
as follows. As K and a increase, cash flow increases. For a constant f, the total amount of
expropriation increases and expropriation becomes more costly for the entrepreneur. He partly
offsets this increase in the cost of expropriation by increasing q. As m increases, it becomes more
costly for the entrepreneur to acquire better governance and he therefore acquires less of it.
Finally, p and q are substitutes. An increase in p decreases the marginal benefit from better firmlevel investor protection and the entrepreneur decreases the amount of firm-level investor
protection he acquires. Equation (8b) does not depend on n directly. Though we can derive
comparative statics using equation (8b) in a straightforward way, we have to use a linear
approximation of (8a) in q and K to obtain results. Using the linear approximation, equation (8a)
implies that an increase in n decreases K. It therefore follows from equations (8a) and (8b) that an
increase in n leads to a decrease in investor protection through its impact on q. With this analysis,
the entrepreneur purchases more investor protection if the investment opportunity is more
valuable (higher cash flow before expropriation), if the cost of purchasing investor protection is
lower, if financial development is higher, and if investor protection guaranteed by the state is
lower.
A closed-form solution for S can be obtained for the case where b is equal to B(1 – k), where
B is a constant. The literature has assumed that the cost of expropriation depends on p but not on
firm characteristics other than cash flow. The assumption that b is equal to B(1 – k) implies that
the overall cost of expropriation for the controlling shareholder falls linearly with his ownership
stake in the firm. The assumption that the cost of expropriation falls as k increases does not seem
unreasonable. Suppose that the controlling shareholder owns 99.99% of the firm. Presumably, if

15

he has some money and he is caught expropriating, he can always buy out the shareholders who
own 0.01%. In contrast, if the controlling shareholder owns 40% of the firm and gets caught,
many more individuals will be affected and pressure on politicians to punish the controlling
shareholder is likely to be much higher. So, it is reasonable to think that the political system is
likely to punish more severely the controlling shareholder who owns 40% of the shares than the
one who owns 99.99%. A controlling shareholder who owns 40% of the shares and expropriates
10% of the cash flow of the company is also more likely to get caught than one who owns
99.99% and who expropriates the same fraction of the cash flows because the shareholders who
get expropriated lose a much larger dollar amount in the former case than in the latter.
With this assumption, we can replace b in equation (3) with B(1 – k), so that f now equals
1/B(p + q) and no longer depends on k. The value of the firm is (1 – f) times the firm’s cash flow
before expropriation:

 B( p + q) − 1 α
V =
 aK
 B( p + q) 

(9)

It then follows that k is equal to:

k=

( B( p + q ) − 1)aK α − B( p + q )( K − W )
( B ( p + q ) − 1)aK α

(10)

Replacing f by 1/B(p + q) and b by B(1 – k) in equation (7), where k is defined by equation (10),
we obtain a new expression for S:

 1 − 2 B( p + q) 

 2( B( p + q) − 1) 

S = aK α − n( K − W ) − mq 2 + ( K − W ) 

(11)

The entrepreneur maximizes S by choosing q and K. In this case, if the entrepreneur raises
funds, he chooses K to be given by:

16



α a(2 B( p + q) − 2)
K =

 (2 B( p + q ) − 2)n + 2 B( p + q ) − 1 

1−α

(12)

There are four important comparative statics for K in equation (12):
1) An increase in a increases K. An increase in a means that the investment opportunity
of the entrepreneur is better, so that the marginal product of capital increases and he
invests more.
2) An increase in n decreases K. If n is high, as in poorly developed financial markets, it
is more expensive to raise funds, so that the entrepreneur raises a smaller amount of
funds and invests less.
3) An increase in investor protection from the firm, q, is associated with an increase in K
because expropriation falls.
4) An increase in investor protection from the state, p, is associated with an increase in K
since the entrepreneur expropriates less.

In equation (12), K depends on q. We can substitute equation (12) in the first-order condition
for q. This yields a polynomial in q. The comparative statics are straightforward to evaluate when
S is a concave function of q, which has to be the case for an interior solution for q to exist.
Consequently, we obtain the following result:

Proposition 2. Provided that there is an interior solution for q and the entrepreneur raises
outside equity, a lower q is chosen, or in other words, the firm adopts fewer restraints on
the expropriation of investors, as:
P1. The cost of adopting these restraints, m, increases;
P2. The protection of investor rights through the state, p, increases;

17

P3. The cost of accessing capital markets, n, increases;
P4. The investment opportunities of the firm, a, worsen.

Note that Proposition 2 has the same results as those obtained earlier when evaluating the
first-order conditions (8a) and (8b) and using a linear approximation in the comparative static
analysis. The intuition for the results is the same as the one given then.
If we view Ω = p + q as the measure of investor protection that takes into account the
protection granted by the state, p, and the additional protection granted by the firm, q, Ω increases
with p, falls with m, increases with a, and falls with n. The impact of an increase in p on Ω is less
if m is low because p and q are closer substitutes.
Our model provides a richer and, we believe, more realistic analysis of the determinants of
corporate governance at the firm level. With this model, bad institutions and low levels of
economic and financial development limit the incentives of firms to improve corporate
governance on their own. Firms sell shares to the public in countries that differ strongly in the
degree of protection of investor rights and in the level of economic development. Though existing
models focus on the protection of investor rights, the extent to which firms improve corporate
governance depends critically on the development of capital markets. To see this, suppose that
capital markets differ across countries in the extent to which they can absorb equity issues. In
other words, firms in a country with poorly developed markets are constrained in issuing equity
while firms in countries with well-developed markets are not. In our model, this is equivalent to
making n a step function, so that, beyond a given level of capital raising activity, n is large
enough to prevent more capital raising activity. Among constrained firms, the benefit of
improving governance is limited since doing so does not enable them to raise more funds.
Suppose now, however, that a constrained firm gains access to global markets. In this case, it

18

becomes more valuable for the firm to improve governance because it can raise more funds as a
result of doing so.
We have considered a firm at inception. We assumed that the exogenous variables are given
and are non-stochastic. Since the solutions for q and K depend non-linearly on the exogenous
variables, making these variables stochastic would complicate the problem considerably.
Suppose, however, that a firm has chosen q and K, has sold equity, and unexpectedly faces a
change in one of the exogenous variables. In this case, any improvement in firm-level governance
has an additional cost, which is that it creates a wealth transfer from the controlling shareholder to
the other investors in the firm. For constant α, the firm will not move to the level of firm-level
governance it would have chosen at its inception with that level of the exogenous variable.
Therefore, if a unexpectedly increases, so that it would be optimal to expand production, improve
firm-level governance, and raise more funds, the firm will do some of that if m and n are not too
high. But the extent to which it changes firm-level governance will be limited by the
redistribution cost. More generally, we have the following result:

Proposition 3. Provided that m and n are not too large, firm-level governance improves
following an unexpected decrease in p, an unexpected decrease in n, an unexpected
decrease in m, and an unexpected increase in a keeping α constant.

With this result, we expect globalization to reduce n by opening up new capital markets for
firms and creating more competition in the financial intermediation industry. It should also reduce
m by enabling firms to access new contracting technologies and by expanding the range of
financial services accessible to firms. Hence, from this perspective, we would expect financial
globalization to lead to an increase in q for firms that would benefit from financial globalization.

3. Data
We want to explain firm-level choices of corporate governance. For that purpose, we use the
Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA) and the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) corporate
governance and transparency ratings. The CLSA ratings cover emerging countries and newlyemerged countries. The S&P ratings cover both developed and emerging economies. Both ratings
evaluate many objective and some subjective indicators of firm governance practices, including
categories related to managerial incentives, timely and accurate disclosures, board independence,
board accountability, enforcement and management accountability, minority shareholder
protection and social responsibility. While the S&P ratings leave relatively little room for
subjectivity compared to the CLSA rating, subjectivity is also limited in the CLSA rating.
Our sample construction begins with the list of firms included in the two ratings systems. The
CLSA survey was conducted in 2001 and it rates the corporate governance practices of 495 firms
from 25 countries.5 This survey has been used in a number of recent papers (for instance, Chen,
Chen, and Wei, 2003; Palepu, Khanna, and Kogan, 2002; Durnev and Kim, 2004; Klapper and
Love, 2003; and Krishnamurty, Sevic, and Sevic, 2003). The main criterion for including firms in
the CLSA survey is firm size and investor interest. The CLSA corporate governance rating is
based on a questionnaire given to financial analysts who responded with “Yes” or “No” answers
to 57 questions related to seven categories: management discipline, transparency, independence,
accountability, responsibility, fairness, and social responsibility. A composite governance rating
is computed by giving an equal weight of 15% to the first six categories and a weight of 10% to
social responsibility. Percentage scores on the composite governance ratings range from 13.9 to
93.5. We do not include financial firms both because they are often subject to regulations and
laws that other firms are not and because financial ratios have a different meaning for them. After
removing financial firms, there are 376 firms in the CLSA sample.

See Amar Gill, 2001, Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, Corporate Governance in Emerging Markets:
Saints and Sinners, Who's Got Religion? Khanna, Kogan, and Palepu (2002) provide an evaluation of the
quality of the CLSA data set.

20

In addition to the CLSA survey, we use transparency and disclosure ratings provided by
Standard and Poor’s.6 The Standard and Poor’s ratings have also been used in recent research
(Khanna, Palepu, and Srinivasan, 2003; Durnev and Kim, 2004). The sample provided to us by
Standard and Poor’s in April 2003 covers 901 firms from 40 countries. S&P compiles the ratings
by examining firms’ annual reports and standard regulatory filings for disclosure of 98 items,
divided into three sections: financial transparency and information disclosure (35 items), board
and management structure and process (35 items), and ownership structure and investor relations
(28 items). S&P uses a binary scoring system in which one point is awarded if a particular item is
disclosed. The scores are added and converted to a percentage score, with scores ranging from
15.22 to 88.78. After removing financial firms, there are 711 firms from 39 countries.
Table 1 describes the sample constructed from the two surveys. It is immediately apparent
that S&P covers many more countries than CLSA. Further, the number of firms covered within a
country differs sharply across countries. In some countries, like Argentina for CLSA and New
Zealand for S&P, only one firm is covered. We, therefore, check if all of our results reported
below differ if we include all countries covered by a survey or if we include only countries for
which at least five firms are rated. We find that including only countries for which five firms are
rated makes little difference. It is also clear that there is substantial variation in ratings within
countries as well as across countries. For CLSA, the lowest-rated country is Indonesia with an
average score of 37.06, with scores ranging from 13.90 to 64.90, and the highest-rated country is
South Africa with an average score of 68.38, with scores ranging from 45.00 to 82.60. For S&P,
the lowest-rated country is Colombia (one firm with a score of 19.15) and the highest-rated is
Finland (average score of 75.70). We also give information in the table on the number of firms in
each sample that have a Level 2 or 3 ADR program. Firms with Level 2 or 3 ADRs are firms
listed either on the NYSE/AMEX or on NASDAQ. Level 3 ADR firms have also raised equity in

extensive discussion of the properties of the S&P ratings.

21

the U.S.7 To determine if a firm is listed on a U.S. exchange, we use information obtained from
the Bank of New York, Citibank, the NYSE, and NASDAQ. Listing dates are verified using
Lexis-Nexis searches and by examining 20-Fs filed with the SEC and firm’s annual reports.
To test our hypotheses, we require data on firm and country characteristics. Firm-level data
for sales growth, total assets, ownership, cash holdings, and SIC (Standard Industrial
Classification) codes are from Thomson Financial’s Worldscope database. Sales growth is
measured as the two-year geometric average of annual inflation-adjusted growth in sales from
1998-2000. Sales growth is winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the impact of
outliers. Total assets, for the year 2000, are measured in millions of U.S. dollars. Ownership is the
data item reported as “Closely-held shares” for the year 2000. Worldscope defines closely-held
shares as shares held by insiders, which include senior corporate officers and directors, and their
immediate families, shares held in trusts, shares held by another corporation (except shares held
in a fiduciary capacity by financial institutions), shares held by pension/benefit plans, and shares
held by individuals who hold five percent or more of shares outstanding. In Japan, closely-held
shares represent the holdings of the ten largest shareholders. For firms with more than one class
of shares, closely-held shares for each class are added together. The ownership measure is far
from perfect since it relies on information disclosed by firms and this disclosure is often
voluntary and unmonitored. Cash holdings correspond to liquid assets held by firms and are
normalized by total assets.
Sales growth is a widely used proxy for growth opportunities (see, for instance, La Porta,
Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 2002). The difficulty with sales growth is that it is
affected by a country’s institutions and business conditions. As an alternative measure of growth
opportunities that does not suffer from that problem, we also use a measure of dependence on
external finance (Rajan and Zingales, 1998) defined as capital expenditures minus cash flows
from operations divided by capital expenditures. This latter variable for these non-U.S. firms is
7

See Table 1 of Foerster and Karolyi (1999) for more details on types of ADR listings.

22

computed using data on capital expenditures and cash flows for firms from the same industry in
the U.S. The motivation for this approach is that, assuming that growth opportunities of firms in
the same industry have a significant common component across countries, the level of external
financing of U.S. firms is the level that firms in other countries would have if they were not
constrained by the poor development of the country in which they are located. Francis, Khurana,
and Pereira (2003) use this measure to explain CIFAR disclosure scores and find that the 19911993 scores are positively related to the original Rajan and Zingales (1998) measure. We do not
use the original measure because the CLSA and S&P scores are for the early 2000s and the
original Rajan and Zingales (1998) estimates are for the 1980s. We match U.S. and non-U.S.
firms by industry at the three-digit SIC code level. Data for this measure is obtained for all U.S.
firms included in S&P’s Compustat database from 1995-2000. For each firm, the use of external
finance is summed from 1995-2000 and it is divided by the firm’s total capital expenditures from
1995 to 2000. At the three-digit SIC code level, we take the industry median. Sample firms with
the same three-digit SIC are assigned the industry median value.
Finally, we use a number of country-level variables in our analysis. The indices of antidirector rights, rule of law, and risk of expropriation are measures of shareholder rights,
enforcement, and property rights obtained from La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny
(LLSV, 1998). These variables are not available for China, Hungary, Poland, or Russia in the
LLSV study. Values for anti-director rights and rule of law for these countries are taken from
Pistor, Raiser, and Gelfer (2000). However, the index of the risk of expropriation is not available
in their study. We follow Durnev and Kim (2004) and define “Legal” as the product of antidirector and rule of law. Stock market capitalization divided by GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is
from Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2001) and Gross National Product (GNP) per capita is
from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database.
The surveys create two selection biases. The first bias is related to country coverage. Lessdeveloped countries and those in which financial and legal institutions are especially poor will not

23

be represented in the survey because they will not have firms in which the survey-sponsoring
organizations would have any interest. In these countries, firms will not have been able to
overcome country characteristics to draw interest from the survey-sponsoring organizations. This
bias leads us to understate the potential importance of country characteristics.
The second bias is related to company coverage within countries. Only a subset of firms is
rated in each country. To investigate this bias, we collected data on almost 15,000 non-financial
firms available on Worldscope that are in countries covered by the surveys. We then estimated
logit regression models to predict which firms have a CLSA rating and which firms have an S&P
rating. In the logit regressions, the dependent variable takes a value of one if a firm is in the
CLSA or S&P samples and the explanatory variables are the firm characteristics that we
subsequently use to explain the ratings in our empirical work. The results are presented in the
Appendix. It is interesting to note the similarities and differences in the firm coverage for the two
samples. In both logit regressions, firm size is significant with a positive coefficient. However,
inside ownership has a positive and significant coefficient in the CLSA rating regression and, by
contrast, a negative and significant coefficient in the S&P rating regression. Finally, the ratio of
cash holdings to total assets has a positive significant coefficient in the S&P rating regression and
firm sales growth has a positive and significant coefficient in the CLSA regression. The
explanatory power of these two models differs dramatically. Firm characteristics explain
proportionally much less of the selection process by CLSA (pseudo R2 of 13.15%) than of the
selection process by S&P (pseudo R2 of 44.51%). It is clear from this that larger firms are more
likely to have a rating. Our theory shows that larger firms may have more incentives to adopt
good governance. If that is the case, our study may understate the importance of firm
characteristics because the firms in the CLSA and S&P sample are more homogeneous than the
population of firms.

24

4. How important are country and firm characteristics for governance ratings?
In this section, we evaluate the importance of country and firm characteristics in explaining
firm-level governance choices. We first regress the governance ratings on firm characteristics.
The governance ratings combine investor protection granted by the state and investor protection
chosen by firms beyond the requirements of the state. Using the notation of the model, the
governance ratings are proxies for p + q. Our theory is about q. We assume that the part of the
rating corresponding to investor protection granted by the state is uniform across firms, so that it
does not depend on firm characteristics. If we find that the rating does depend on firm
characteristics, we assume it is because these characteristics influence the firm’s choice of firmlevel governance.
The analysis of Section 2 predicts that firms with a greater demand for external finance are
firms that will adopt more constraining governance practices. We, therefore, add sales growth to
the regression since it is a measure of investment opportunities that has been frequently used in
the literature. Existing papers show that sales growth is significant in explaining the CLSA
ratings in regressions that control for firm characteristics and investor protection (Durnev and
Kim, 2004; Klapper and Love, 2003). In addition, we include the Rajan and Zingales measure of
dependence on external finance as an alternative measure of growth opportunities.
We also use firm size as a firm characteristic. Our model assumes that the cost of good
governance is a fixed cost but the benefit is amortized over all of a firm’s security issues. We,
therefore, expect that large firms are more likely to adopt such practices. However, it is also
possible that large firms face a greater cost of transparency. This could arise because large firms
may benefit more from connections to the political authorities than other firms, which may lead
them to seek less transparency to hide these benefits, or because they may be more likely to be
expropriated by the state (see Zimmerman, 1983).
Ownership by the controlling shareholders affects the choice of governance practices at the
firm level. There is a subtle distinction, however, between the impact of ownership on the firm’s
25

level of expropriation of minority shareholders and on the governance practices adopted by the
firm. In existing models, greater concentration of ownership leads to less expropriation because
the controlling shareholder expropriates more from himself as his stake increases, so that the
payoff from expropriation falls. This result holds even if the controlling shareholder does not take
actions at the firm level to reduce his ability to expropriate shareholders, so that it has nothing to
do with the firm or the governance mechanisms of the firm. Our model is focused on the choice
of governance mechanisms by the firm. As the controlling shareholder owns more shares, we
would expect him to invest less in firm-level governance mechanisms if those are costly because
his incentives to expropriate are lower. This makes it difficult to make predictions about how
ownership and governance scores are related. To the extent that CLSA partly measures the extent
of expropriation, ownership could be positively related to the score. It seems less likely that the
S&P scores measure expropriation and more likely that they reflect the adoption of firm-specific
governance mechanisms. We would, therefore, expect a negative relation between S&P scores
and ownership.
Finally, we employ a variable that computes the ratio of cash holdings to total assets. We
would expect firms with more cash to be less likely to access the capital markets. Consequently,
we would expect a negative relation between cash holdings and governance. However, firms that
have just accessed the capital markets may also have higher cash holdings, and these firms should
also have better governance ratings. Further, cash holdings may also proxy for growth
opportunities, in which case we would also expect them to be positively associated with
governance.
Panel a of Table 2 reports the regression estimates for the CLSA ratings. Model (1) shows the
regression of governance ratings on firm characteristics. Two firm characteristics, sales growth
and the cash-to-assets ratio, are significant and both with a positive coefficient. In all
specifications, we report an F-statistic for a test of the joint significance of all firm and/or country
variables. In Table 2, these F-statistics for firm-level variables are always significant at the 1%

26

level. The adjusted R2 from an OLS regression is 4.24%. The t-statistics and F-statistics are
reported from a regression that takes into account the potential clustering of the error terms within
countries.8 In the next specification (2), we investigate the role of country characteristics. We use
country variables used in the literature before, namely the “Legal” variable used by Durnev and
Kim (2004), the log of GNP per capita, and the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP. We
see that these country variables explain much more of the variation in ratings than firm-specific
characteristics. Legal and GNP per capita are extremely highly correlated, but Legal has a
significant positive coefficient while the other two country characteristics are insignificant. In the
next specification, we regress the ratings on both sets of country characteristics and firm-specific
characteristics. The adjusted R2 increases and the F-statistics indicate that both firm and country
characteristics are both jointly significant. All the variables that were significant in models (1)
and (2) remain significant.
In model (4), we estimate a statistical upper-bound on the importance of country-specific
characteristics by regressing the governance ratings on country dummy variables. We see that the
adjusted R2 of that regression is about two and a half times the adjusted R2 of model (2). This
indicates that variables that researchers have focused on capture only a fraction of the country
characteristics that can potentially influence governance scores. Comparing model (4) to model
(1), we see that the adjusted R2 of the country dummy regression is nine times that of the
regression with firm-specific variables. Consequently, the country characteristics dominate firm
characteristics in explaining the variation in firm governance ratings. In model (5), we estimate
(1) but with country dummies. The improvement in adjusted R2 obtained by adding firm-specific
variables to (5) is trivial. Further, sales growth is no longer significant. In other words, part of the
8

A model using country random effects would also correct for within-country correlation. However,
Hausman tests indicate that the assumptions of the model are not met and that the random effects estimator
is not valid. Therefore, we use OLS regressions with clustered robust standard errors to account for within
country correlation of the error terms – observations within a country are not treated as independent, but
observations across countries are. The clustered standard errors are similar to heteroscedasticity-consistent
standard errors (White, 1980) except that the weights are sums over each country (cluster). See Rogers
(1993) and Williams (2000) for further details.

27

success of sales growth seems to be explained by its correlation with country characteristics. The
only firm-specific variable that is significant is the cash-to-assets ratio, with a coefficient of 11.51
and a t-statistic of 2.15.
We turn next to the S&P governance ratings. The results are reported in Panel b of Table 2. It
is immediately striking that firm characteristics explain much more of the variation in the S&P
ratings than they do of the variation in the CLSA ratings. Model (1) regresses the S&P ratings on
firm-specific characteristics. The adjusted R2 is 22.49%, which is more than five times the
adjusted R2 of the same regression for the CLSA rating. Surprisingly, sales growth is not
significant but the measure of dependence on external finance is and with a positive coefficient.
As in Panel a, the cash-to-assets ratio has a positive and significant coefficient. Further, firm size
is also significant. In the regression with country characteristics, Legal is not significant but the
log of GNP per capita is. The adjusted R2 is roughly twice the adjusted R2 for the comparable
regression in Panel a. Model (3) adds the set of firm characteristics to model (2). The only
significant variables in that regression are the measure of dependence on external finance and
firm size. None of the country characteristics are significant, though the F-statistic associated
with the joint test that they equal zero is rejected (F-statistic of 4.60). As in Panel a, country
characteristics capture much less of the variation in governance ratings than country dummy
variables. We find in model (4) that the R2 using country dummy variables is 73% – more than
twice the R2 using country characteristics. Finally, when we combine firm characteristics with
country dummies in model (5), the adjusted R2 increases by a relatively small amount. Again,
only the dependence on external finance and firm size are significant.
It follows from the regressions in Table 2 that firm-specific characteristics have very little
explanatory power for the CLSA ratings and only some explanatory power for the S&P ratings.
Irrespective of the rating system, country characteristics explain more of the variation in ratings
than firm characteristics. The greater importance of country characteristics is most obvious when

28

we use country dummy variables. The country characteristics used in the literature capture only a
fraction of the variation in ratings due to country effects.
Our model predicts that firm characteristics matter more as development increases, up to a
point. We next investigate whether firm characteristics explain more of the variation in the ratings
for developed countries relative to less developed countries. A comparison of developed and less
developed countries is more meaningful for the S&P ratings. We therefore restrict our analysis to
these ratings. Table 3 presents the results.
Panel a of Table 3 splits the sample of the countries for which S&P ratings are available into
highly developed and less developed countries. We do this by splitting the countries into
countries with above-median GDP per capita, the highly developed countries, and below-median
GDP per capita, the less developed countries. The results are striking. First, when we regress the
ratings on firm characteristics, the adjusted R2 is 15.54% for the highly developed countries and
2.19% for the less developed countries. None of the firm characteristics are significant in
explaining the ratings of the less developed countries. The F-statistic of 13.40 is significant for
the highly developed countries, but not for the less developed countries (F-statistic of 0.81). In the
highly developed countries, the rating increases with dependence on external finance, falls with
ownership concentration, and increases with firm size as predicted by our model. Country
dummies explain 51.72% of the variation in ratings for the highly developed countries and
48.12% for the less developed countries. Adding the firm characteristics to the regression with
only country dummies increases the adjusted R2 from 51.72% to 59.81% for highly developed
countries and decreases from 48.12% to 48.00% for the other countries. The F-statistic of the
joint test of the firm-level variables is significant for the highly developed countries (F-statistic of
7.25) and insignificant for the less-developed countries (F-statistic of 1.60) This finding confirms
that firm characteristics are not useful to understand governance ratings in countries with low
economic development and are more useful to understand these ratings in countries with high
economic development.

29

As discussed in the previous section, the governance ratings measure governance mandated
by the state and how a firm goes beyond the requirements of the state. While the ratings measure
p + q, we would like to isolate q, the firm-level governance. In Panel b of Table 3, we assume that
p is proxied by the lowest firm score in a country. In other words, we assume that firms with
higher scores achieved these scores because of firm-level governance. We then introduce a new
dependent variable, which is based on a difference of scores among firms within a country and
which we define as (Firm score - Country minimum)/(100 - Country minimum). Multiplied by
100, this new dependent variable takes values from 0 to 100 like the S&P score itself. It is useful
to think of this new variable as the firm-level governance score. It will depend on country
characteristics, since the benefit from improving governance at the firm level depends on country
characteristics. When we regress the firm-level governance difference score on firm
characteristics, we find that these characteristics explain much more of the variation of the score
in developed countries than in less developed countries. However, country dummies explain more
of the variation of the difference score than firm characteristics irrespective of the level of
development. Finally, we also see that adding firm-level characteristics to the regression with
country dummy variables increases R2 much more for more developed countries than for the
other countries. The F-statistics for the significance of firm characteristics are always significant
for highly developed countries (14.82 in model (1), 20.18 in model (3), and 9.63 in model (5)),
but only marginally so in model (8) and not at all in models (6) and (10) for less developed
countries.
In Table 4, we split the S&P sample using the legal index in which high (low) investorprotection countries are those with Legal scores above (below) the median. The firm-specific
variables are jointly significant relative to country factors and even country dummies for not only
firms in high investor-protection countries but also those in low investor-protection countries.
The results do not draw the same sharp distinction as with GNP per capita in Table 3. One issue is
that, whereas GNP per capita works well at separating the sample of countries into two very

30

distinct groups of countries, the same cannot be said for the Legal variable. GNP per capita and
Legal have a correlation of 0.52. However, Legal takes low values for countries that have a low
anti-director index. For instance, Argentina and Malaysia have an above-median Legal index in
contrast to the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, but Argentina and Malaysia have a
below-median GNP per capita, in contrast to these European countries.
In our regression analysis, we focus on an index of the legal system (Legal), a measure of
economic development (GNP per capita), and a measure of financial development (Stock market
cap per GDP) as the country-specific explanatory variables. One might argue that other country
variables should affect firm governance. Most importantly, the extent to which property rights are
enforced is important. Recent research (see Acemoglu and Johnson, 2003) shows that the respect
of property rights is an important determinant of economic growth. In the model of Section 2,
poor respect of property rights would make it less valuable to invest in governance since
controlling shareholders who are more likely to be expropriated by the state gain less from
investing in corporate governance. However, respect of property rights is strongly correlated with
GNP per capita, so that our specifications might already account for the effect of this propertyrights variable. Nevertheless, we re-estimated our regressions with country characteristics with an
additional variable that captures respect of property rights. This variable is the risk of
expropriation index used by LLSV (1998). This index takes values from one through 10, where a
value of one indicates the highest risk of expropriation. Using this variable restricts our sample
size because it is not available for China or any of the former Eastern bloc countries. For the
regressions in Table 2 that have both country and firm characteristics, we find that the coefficient
on the expropriation index is not significant in the regression for the CLSA ratings, but it is
positive and highly significant in the regression for the S&P ratings. For the S&P ratings,
governance is inversely related to the expropriation index, so that countries with a higher risk of
expropriation have worse governance as we would expect. Consequently, the risk of
expropriation from the state is an important country characteristic. However, taking that

31

characteristic into account changes none of our basic inferences, although it increases the
proportion of the cross-sectional variation in governance ratings that can be explained by country
characteristics.
We have found evidence that is supportive of our hypotheses. At the same time, however,
there are important limitations to our approach. One such limitation is that we risk
underestimating the role of firm characteristics by virtue of our regression analysis. We know we
fully account for country characteristics whose impact is unrelated to firm characteristics through
the dummy variables, yet it could be that what we do not explain is simply related to firm
characteristics we do not observe. If this is the case for the S&P ratings, this would likely not
overturn our conclusions because country characteristics alone explain 73% of the variation in the
ratings. Since the country dummy variables explain only 38% of the variation of the CLSA
ratings, it is possible that firm characteristics we are omitting from the analysis somehow explain
more of the dispersion in the ratings than country dummy variables themselves. Part of the
problem here could be mechanical, however. The CLSA rating countries have much less variation
in country characteristics than those for the S&P ratings because there are simply fewer countries
represented in that sample. If we had a rating for just one country after all, it would not be
surprising that all of the variation in those ratings were found to be explained by firm
characteristics. This is precisely why we have focused more on the S&P ratings.
We have restricted our focus on those firm characteristics that have been used most often in
the literature. We investigated whether other characteristics used would help explain the ratings
better and have not had success. To address the concern about omitted firm characteristics, we
collected Worldscope data on ten additional firm characteristics (profitability, turnover, and
leverage measures) and incorporated them into the existing regression specifications, not
worrying about multicollinearity since the focus is on overall explanatory power. By doing this,
we increase the adjusted R2 of model (1) in Table 3 from 17.74% to 21.74%, but the adjusted R2
of model (6) increases only from 1.74% to 2.77%, so that for less-developed countries, firm

32

characteristics have trivial explanatory power even when we use the largest specification possible.
We estimated these regressions using three-year averages for firm characteristics, but the results
were similar. Since the S&P ratings are determined by objective criteria, it cannot be that the
analysts who prepared the ratings used information about firms that was not available to investors
in general.
So, what would help explain more of the variation in the ratings? Two explanations are
consistent with noise being the explanation. First, it could be that there is simply random
variation in governance ratings. Suppose there are governance attributes that are cheap to adopt
but also have little impact. Some firms might adopt them, others not. Such attributes would be
economically unimportant, but they would drive down the R2 of our regressions. Second, there
could be systematic and idiosyncratic mistakes in the ratings.
Could there be more at work in these ratings than noise? The limitations of our database
suggest that it ought to be so. With the rating, we do not know when a firm adopted a particular
provision. It might have done so in response to a change in some firm characteristic or the market
environment, but since then this change may have disappeared. Governance provisions are sticky,
so that even though firm characteristics changed, the provision might have remained in effect.
Unfortunately, there is nothing that we can do to deal with that issue. However, it suggests that
the time-series path of firm characteristics likely matters. Further, a firm might have adopted
governance provisions in response to specific attributes that we (and other researchers) have not
observed.

5. Does financial globalization reduce the importance of country characteristics?
Our model predicts that country characteristics should be less important for firms that access
the global markets. To examine this issue, we re-estimate the regressions of Table 3 that use the
S&P ratings, but now we split each subsample further into two groups, namely firms with a Level
2 or 3 ADR (which we call “global firms”) and other firms (“non-global firms”). We expect from
33

our theory that firm characteristics should be more relevant in explaining the S&P rating for firms
in highly developed countries and for global firms in less developed countries. We also expect
that country characteristics should be less relevant for these firms. Panel a of Table 5 shows
estimates for the regressions for firms in highly developed countries. For global firms, the Fstatistic for the joint test that firm characteristics are irrelevant always rejects the null (3.24 for
model (3) and 8.86 for model (5)). For non-global firms, the F-statistic for firm characteristics is
insignificant in the regression specification that has no other variables but firm characteristics.
However, when we add country characteristics or just country dummies, firm characteristics
become significant explanatory variables (F-statistic of 4.18 in model (8) and 3.10 in model (10)).
Two results are not supportive of our model, however. Country characteristics are significant for
global firms as well as for non-global firms and explain more of the cross-sectional variation in
governance ratings for global firms; firm characteristics increase the adjusted R-squared when
added to country dummy variables as much for non-global firms as they do for global firms.
In panel b, we turn to firms in less developed countries. The F-statistic for firm characteristics
is always significant for global firms (2.53 in model (3) and 3.73 in model (5)). At the same time,
however, adding firm characteristics to the country dummy variables does not improve the overall
explanatory power of the regression, as the adjusted R2 declines from 0.4352 to 0.4301. When we
consider non-global firms, the F-statistic for firm characteristics is always insignificant (1.13 in
model (8) and 0.72 in model (10)). We also split the sample of CLSA firms in less developed
countries into global and non-global firms and these results are presented in panel c. We have
proportionally fewer “global” firms that have Level 2 or 3 ADRs in the CLSA sample.
Nevertheless, we find that when controlling for the country characteristics used in the literature,
firm characteristics are insignificant for non-global firms and significant for global firms. The
result has to be treated with caution, though, because it does not hold when country
characteristics are controlled for with dummy variables.

34

Our theory also implies that home-country investor protection should be less important for
global firms. The evidence supportive of this prediction is limited for the S&P sample. For firms
from highly developed countries, we find that Legal is significant for firms that are not global, but
it is not for global firms. For less developed countries, Legal is negative and significant both for
global firms and non-global firms for the S&P sample. It is insignificant for global firms for the
CLSA sample and positive and significant for the non-global firms in that sample.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we distinguish between the investor protection granted by the state and investor
protection adopted by the firm. We show that the extent to which firms choose to improve upon
the investor protection granted by the state depends on the costs and benefits of doing so. In
countries with weak development, it is costly to improve investor protection because the
institutional infrastructure is lacking and good governance has political costs. Further, in such
countries, the benefit from improving governance is weaker because capital markets lack depth.
However, financial globalization reduces the importance of country characteristics, thereby
increasing the incentives for good governance.
Using the CLSA corporate governance ratings and the S&P transparency and disclosure
ratings, we find that a large fraction of the variation in these ratings that can be explained is
attributable to country characteristics. Firm characteristics explain more of the cross-sectional
variation in corporate governance in more developed countries and country characteristics matter
less for firms that have access to global markets. A possible explanation for these results is that
the ratings are better at evaluating firm-level governance in more developed countries or for more
global firms. This would be more surprising for the S&P ratings than for the CLSA ratings
because the CLSA ratings have more of a subjective element. It could also be that firm
characteristics are measured more accurately in more developed countries. Finally, though we use
firm characteristics that the literature has believed to be associated with governance, it might be
35

that omitted firm characteristics or past values of firm characteristics play a more significant role
in explaining the ratings. Nevertheless, we believe that the evidence presented here is consistent
with the view that, while the investor protection granted by the state is an important determinant
of corporate governance, so are the levels of economic and financial development as well as the
openness of a country.

Table 2. The importance of country vs. firm characteristics.
The dependent variable in each regression is either the CLSA corporate governance rating (Panel a) or the
S&P transparency and disclosure rating (Panel b). Firm-level data is from Worldscope. Sales growth is
inflation adjusted two-year sales growth from 1998 – 2000 (winsorized at 1% and 99% tails). Ownership,
Total assets (US$ millions) and Cash/Assets are for 2000. Data for Dependence on external finance,
computed as capital expenditures minus cash flow from operations divided by capital expenditures, is from
Computstat from 1995-2000. Legal is Anti-director * Rule of law, which are from LLSV (1998). Log of
GNP per capita (U$) is for 2000 and is from the World Bank WDI Database. Stock market capitalization to
GDP is from Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2001). The standard errors are computed assuming
observations are independent across countries, but not within countries. t-statistics are in parentheses. The
F-statistic tests the hypothesis that the firm-level variables (country) are jointly equal to zero. *, **, and ***
indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 5. The importance of country vs. firm characteristics: global vs. non-global firms.
The dependent variable in each regression is the S&P transparency and disclosure rating (panels a and b) or CLSA corporate governance rating (panel c). Results
for the S&P sample split on economic development and on global vs. non-global are in panels a and b. Countries are in the high (low) economic development
group if log of GNP per capita is above (below) the median. Firms are classified as global if they have a Level 2 or 3 ADR as of December 31, 2000. In panel c,
firms from high development countries using the cutoff from the S&P sample are excluded. Firm-level data is from Worldscope. Sales growth is inflation
adjusted two-year sales growth from 1998 – 2000 (winsorized at 1% and 99% tails). Ownership, Total assets (US$ millions) and Cash/Assets are for 2000. Data
for Dependence on external finance, computed as capital expenditures minus cash flow from operations divided by capital expenditures, is from Computstat from
1995-2000. Legal is Anti-director * Rule of law, which are from LLSV (1998). Log of GNP per capita (U$) is for 2000 and is from the World Bank WDI
Database. Stock market capitalization to GDP is from Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2001). The standard errors are computed assuming observations are
independent across countries, but not within countries. t-statistics are in parentheses. The F-statistic tests the hypothesis that the firm-level variables (country) are
jointly equal to zero. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Panel a. CLSA sample.

Appendix
The dependent variable in each logit equals one if a firm is in included the CLSA sample (Panel a) or the S&P sample (Panel b) and is zero otherwise. The nonsample firms include all non-financial firms available on Worldscope that are in countries covered by the surveys. Sales growth is inflation adjusted two-year
sales growth from 1998 – 2000 (winsorized at 1% and 99% tails). Ownership, Total assets (US$ millions) and Cash/Assets are for 2000. Data for Dependence on
external finance, computed as capital expenditures minus cash flow from operations divided by capital expenditures, is from Computstat from 1995-2000 The
standard errors are computed assuming observations are independent across countries, but not within countries. t-statistics are in parentheses. *, **, and ***
indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
