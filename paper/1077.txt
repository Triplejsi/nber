Money, Real Interest Rates, and Output:
A Reinterpretation of Postwar U.S. Data

ABSTRACT

This paper reexamines both monthly and quarterly U.S. postwar data
to investigate if the observed comovements between money, real interest

rates, prices and output are compatible with the money——real interest——output
link suggested by existing monetary theories of output, which include
both Keynesian and equilibrium models.
The major empirical findings are these;

1) In both monthly and quarterly data, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the ex ante real rate is exogenous, or Granger—causally
prior in the context of a four—variable system which contains
money, prices, nominal interest rates and industrial production.

2) In quarterly data, there is significantly more information contained in either the levels of expected inflation or the innovation
of this variable for predicting future output, given current and
lagged output, than in any other variable examined (money, actual

inflation, nominal interest rates, or ex ante real rates). The
effect of an inflation innovation on future output is unambiguously
n eo 4

t

The first result casts strong doubt on the empirical importance of
existing monetary theories of output, which imply that money should have

a causal role on the ex ante real rates. The second result would appear
incompatible with most demand driven models of output.

In light of these results, we propose an alternative structural model
which can account for the major dynamic interactions among the variables.
This model has two central features: i) output is unaffected by money supply;
and ii) the money supply process is motivated by short—run price stability.

Money, Real Interest Rates, and Output:
A Reinterpretation of Postwar U.S. Data

Does money matter?

This paper reexamines the time

series evidence that changes in money supply have been an important factor in generating postwar U.S. business cycles. Specifi-

cally, we investigate whether the observed comovements between
money, real interest rates, prices, and output are compatible with

existing monetary theories of income determination, which include
both traditional Keynesian analysis as well as the newer informa—

the key variables

can be best explained as arising from an economic structure in
which changes in money supply on the order of those which have
been historically observed do not affect output.

Thus, we con-

clude that monetary instability has not played an important role
in generating fluctuations.

The paper focuses on the money—real interest rate—output

link suggested by monetary theories of output. In both Keynesian
theory and the equilibrium models money affects

current activity

by altering perceptions of interteirxporal terms of trade.

The

"liquidity preference" theory posits that the link
between money and interest rates is direct and causal; the nominal
interest rate changes are changes in the real rate relevant for a
Keynesian

firm's\investment decision and hence output.

In the newer equi—

libriuni theories, the connection between money, perceived real

In the theories of

Lucas (1972) and Barro (1978, 1980), fluctuations are portrayed as
stemming

from the

response of labor supply to perceived temporary

abnormal rates of return. A key assumption of the newer theories

is that there are barriers to information flows and agents use
observed nominal price signals as imperfect summaries from the
rest

of the world. These theories imply that monetary phenomena

may effect perceptions of the real rate only to the extent that

such disturbances are not directly perceived as such, but are
confused with real changes.
The empirical relationship between money, nominal interest rates, and output has recently been studied by Sims (1979,

Sims con-

cludes (p. 253) "some of the observed comovements of industrial
production and money stock are attributed to common responses to

surprise changes in the interest rate." Although the magnitudes
and timing of the response differ among the several samples stud—

—3—
led, the relationship appears in both prewar and postwar U.S. data
and postwar French, U.K., and German data.

From the standpoint of most monetary theories of output,

these empirical results are anomalous since the nominal interest
rate is a poor prow for the theoretically meaningful ex ante real
rate of interest. As Fama (1975) has shown, a substantial part of

the movement in short—term interest rates, at least over the
postwar U.S. experience, can be attributed to changes in expected
inflation.

In this paper, we attempt to reexamine the empirical
relationship between money, interest rates, and output in postwar

U.S. quarterly and monthly data, emphasizing the distinction
between movements in expected (ex ante) real interest rate movements and movements in expected inflation rates. We look at both
unrestricted and restricted vector autoregressions in an effort to

find evidence of the channels through which money, inflation, and
nominal interest rates affect output.

The paper is organized as follows:

In Section I we

review the basic results of Sims' four variable vector autoregres-

sions on postwar monthly U.S. data.

In Section II we construct

proxies for the ex ante real rate which allow us to separate the

effects of changes in the expected real rate from changes in
expected inflation. In this section, we use a two—stage procedure

which first estimates expected prices, and then uses these esti-

mates as data in a vector autoregression to distinguish the effects of expected inflation and real rates on output. We cannot

unambiguously attribute the effects of nominal interest rate

_14_
innovations documented in the first section to either expected
inflation innovations alone or to real rate innovations alone.
However, there is strong evidence to suggest that upward innova-

tions in expected inflation have a depressing effect on future
output which is not readily explained by demnd driven models of
output. These systems also suggest that the real rate appears to
be largely exogenous.

In light of these descriptive statistical results, we go
on in Section III to test a number of specific hypotheses concern—
irig money, real rates, and output which are suggested by particu-

lar structural models. We first examine the influence of output,

money, and prices on the ex ante real short rate. Specifically,
we test whether past money, prices, and income have any additional
predictive content for current expected real rates given past real
rates.

We cannot reject the hypothesis that the real rate is

exogenous. Although money is useful for predicting nominal rates,

it does not appear to influence future real rates. This finding

casts strong doubt on the money, real interest link implied by
either Keynesian IS—LM analysis and the informatiorially based
equilibrium models.

Because the real rate is unobserved, the

hypothesis that the real rate is exogenous to money and prices
takes the form of nonlinear cross—equation restriction on a vector

autoregressive system which is estimated by a maximum likelihood
method. We then test a number of hypotheses concerning the rela-

tionship between interest rates and output.

These tests are

designed to pass on the validity of alternative theories of the
transmission mechanism between financial variables and real van—

—5—

ables.

In particular, we are interested in reexamining the evi-

dence that changes in money supply have real effects on output.

Our most robust finding of Section III is that expected

inflation has more explanation for output than does the level of
the expected real interest rates.

This finding is difficult to

interpret in the context of both IS—LM analysis and most inter—
temporal versions of the equilibrium models. In light of this, in

Section IV we construct an alternative structural model which is
consistent with the data. The model has the central features that

the money supply process is governed by the desire for short run

price stability; and changes in money supply do not affect out-

put. A test of this model is implemented. Although the results
are not definitive, we find the model to be surprisingly consistent with the data. The fifth section is the conclusion.

I. Review of Earlier Work

Using a iltivariate, linear time series model, Sims
(1979, 1980) showed that nominal interest innovations explain a
substantial fraction of variance in industrial production. Furthermore, the inclusion of interest rates decreases significantly

the fraction of variance in industrial production attributed to
innovations in the money supply.

Table I shows the decomposition of variance of industrial production in both a three variable (industrial production,
IF; money stock, !fl.; and consumer prices less shelter, cPi) and a

four variable (plus end—of—month nominal interest rate on Treasury

bills with one month to mturity,..! BILLS1) vector autoregression
at various time horizons. In both systems the data is in logs and

is

rnonthi,y for the period 19b9:1 to 1981:12. Twelve lags of each

variable were estimated.

In the three variable system, the test of the hypothesis
that all twelve lags of money have zero coefficients in the output

equation may be rejected at the 1 percent level (the F—test has a

marginal significance level of .oo), but this is not true in the
four variable system (marginal significance of .018).

As can be

seen in Table I, the dominance of interest rate innovations over

money innovations becomes stronger as the time horizon for predicting output lengthens.

This accords with Sims' finding that

the response of output to interest rate innovations is essentially
flat for about six months, followed by a smooth decline reaching a
minimum of about 18 months later.

to 1981:8.

For this comparison only six lags of each variable

were included.

This further restriction is motivated by the

desire to perform hypothesis tests described in the next section

in which long lag lengths are coniputationally unwieldy.

In a

likelihood ratio test the hypothesis of six lags versus 12 lags is

not rejected (marginal significance .06).

The six lag system

indicates that the interest rate output relationship is stable
over time.

In Figure 1, the moving average response of each of

the four variables to an innovation in nominal interest rates is
presented for each period.

In Figure II, the response of indus-

trial production to an innovation in each of the four variables is

shown. In both periods, output declines in response to interest
rate innovations.

This response is much quicker in the more

recent period; there is no discerriable lag and the response is
strongest at the 12.-month horizon. In the earlier period, a six—

month lag is evident and the maximuri impact is at the 21k—month
horizon.

In both periods, interest rate innovations are followed

by a decrease in nominal balances.

klthough a standard test of structural stability of
coefficients is overwhelmingly rejected (Chi—Square test with 96
degrees of freedom =

180.92, marginal significance <

the

qualitative properties of the impulse responses look remarkably
similar.

This similarity should give pause to those who argue

that the preponderance of "supply shocks" in the more recent
period has radically altered the dynamic

Interest Rates arid Output——Real or Nominal?

Most n.croeconomic theories suggest that real interest

rates, not nominal rates, should play an important role in the
determination of future output.

Thus, if most variations in

nominal interest rates reflect changes in anticipated inflation,

then the response of output to innovations in nominal interest
rates documented in the previous section is surprising.

In this

section we attempt to formulate proxies for the ex ante real rate

to get a better idea of whether the nominal interest rate innova-

tions isolated in the preceding section represent innovations in
the real rate, or innovations in expected inflation.
The first proxy for the expected real rate is an out—of—

sample forecast derived by projecting the log of prices at each
point in time on a constant and three lags of data using a con-.

stant coefficient Kalman filter technique.

This procedure is

equivalent to reestimating an OLS regression each period.1!i The

is presented in

By subtracting the expected inflation from BILLS1,

the one—month nominal interest rate, we generate an ex ante one—
month real rate, r, which is presented in Figure IV.

Movements of the one—month ex ante real rate which we
have constructed are to a large extent dominated by the movements

in expected inflation, which are subtracted from the more stable
nominal rate.

One possible concern with this measure is that if

real rates with longer turity are more important for economic
decisions than short rates, and if inflation expectations over

longer horizons are less volatile, then a measure of the real rate

over a longer maturity might explain more of the variation in
output than one with a shorter maturity.

In order to test this hypothesis and to see whether the

results we found were sensitive to our measure of the real rate,

we have experimented with several other measures including a
quarterly real rate, a six—month real rate, and a one—month ex
post real rate..V

Although the longer naturity real rates are

much smoother than the short rates, the qualitative properties of

the response functions and decompositions of variance were not
affected by the different definitions.

In fact, we found that

innovations in the one—month real rate, despite the fact that they

are approximately 50 percent larger than innovations in the six—
month

rate, actually explained more of

the forecast variance of

output.

Our monthly ex ante real rate series were employed in
several four variable, autoregressive systems using six lags and a

constant term in each equation. The major difficulty in inter-

preting these systems arises from the strong contemporaneous
correlation between innovations in expected inflation and innova-

tions in the expected real rate. Table II reports the variance—
covariance matrix of the innovations arising from systems which
include industrial production, money, nominal rates, and expected
inflation or real rates. These matrices are singular, of course.

As can be seen in Table II, there is a strongly negative

correlation between innovations in expected inflation and innovations in the real rate (—.93 for the one—month rate). Also strik-

ing is the fact that the variance of both expected inflation
innovations and real rate innovations in these systems is four to

— 11 —

six

times larger than that of nominal rate innovations. Appar-

ently, most of the innovations to expected inflation are nega—
tiveJ.y correlated with innovations to real rates so as to leave
the nominal rate largely unaltered. It is interesting to note the

strong positive correlations among expected inflation, Ml, and
nominal rate innovations.-.J

The positive correlation between

money and nominal rate innovations suggests that demand shocks

have dominated the unexpected niovemens in money.

The strong

positive correlation between nominal rates and expected inflation
implies that a given movement in nominal rates is much more likely

to reflect changes in expected inflation than changes in the real

rate. For example, based on the correlations in Table II, in the

quarterly system a 1 percent innovation in the nominal rate is

most likey to reflect an increase of .86 percent in expeted
inflation and an increase of only .i1 percent in expected real
rates.

The high negative correlation between real rate innovations and expected inflation innovations implies that, unlike the

system examined in Section I, the qualitative properties of the
moving

average

response graphs and the decomposition of variance

might be expected to depend on the particular orthogonalization
chosen. This is confirmed in Table III, which reports the variance decomposition of output in three alternative systems which
all lead to equivalent predictions of future values.

The linearity of the vector autoregression system and

the identity, real rate

nominal rate — expected inflation,

implies that given one of these variables, the predictive content

for output is identical whichever of the other two variables is
included.

Thus, in the first vector autoregression examined in

Table III, the third column is orthogonalized innovations in
expected inflation and the fourth column can be interpreted alter-

natively as orthogonalized innovations in either nominal rates or
real rates.

— 13 —

As we saw in the earlier systems, a high proportion of

the varaince in industrial production is explained by innovations
in interest rates.

In the system shown here, over 60 percent of

the variance of industrial production at a four—year horizon is
explained by orthogonalized innovations in any two of the variables, nominal rates, real rates, and expected inflation. Using
our other measures of the real rate, this proportion varied from
39.4

percent

for the six—month rate to 64.8

percent

for the quar-

terly system using a bill rate with three months to maturity.

As can be seen in Table III, the proportion of this
variance explained by orthogonalized innovations in expected
inflation or real rates varies considerably with the ordering
chosen. This sensitivity is to be expected given the high corre-

lation between the two. Nonetheless, it is possible to detect a

pattern which suggests that expected inflation may be the more
important factor. Comparing the first system in Table III with

the third system, it can be seen that of the 6i.i

percent

of

variance explained, mich more is attributed to expected inflation
innovations when they are third in the ordering than to real rate

innovations when they are third. Shown below is the breakdown of
this variance for each of the four systems we looked at.

In every case expected inflation innovations, when third
in the ordering, explain more than real rate innovations when they

are third.

It is interesting to notice also that at the longer

maturity rates much less of the total variance being explained by

the combination is explained by either when it appears first.
This aspect of the results suggests that nominal interest rate

innovations alone contain much of the information useful for
predicting output. Expected inflation contains a large amount of
high frequency variation, which when subtracted from the nominal
rate, can reduce the information content of that series.

A clue toward understanding the industrial production
response can be found in the moving average response graph (Figure

which shows that there is a qualitatively different response to

output arising from a real rate innovation than from an expected
inflation innovation. Figure (Va) shows that when it is third in

the ordering, an expected inflation innovation has an immediate
and

unambiguous negative effect on output. Figure (Vb) shows that

when real rates are third they exert a positive response throughout, and

a nominal interest rate innovation (equivalently expected

*Sjgnjficance is used here in a Bayesian sense to refer to the
integral, given a noninforinative prior, of the posterior distribu-

tion of the response function less than zero, or greater than
zero, whichever is less.

Up to this point we have considered responses of indus-

trial production in systems which include an inflation expectations or real rate variable generated out—of—sample, but which do

not include actual inflation rates.

In these systems, we have

displayed the response to the orthogonalized innovations in the
included variables. Another approach we consider is to estimate

an unrestricted vector autoregression on the original observed
variables, industrial production, money inflation and interest
rates, and then to measure the expected inflation and implied real

rate implicit in the system.

It is then possible to construct

responses of industrial production to orthogonalized innovations

in expected inflation or real rates even though these variables
are not entered directly as observable in the system.

We follow the same technique applied earlier of generat-

ing, in turn, responses to expected inflation and real rate info—

— i8 —

vations when they are third in the orthogonalization ordering.
These shocks are defined as linear combinations of the observable

innovations where the weights are obtained from the coefficients
in the inflation equation.

The qualitative properties of these

responses, shown in Figure VII, are similar to those generated
directly from out—of—sample expectations.IJ Again, when we decom-

pose the nominal rate symmetricalJ.y into expected inflation and

expected real rates, the data suggest that it is the expected
inflation component which leads to the negative response of industrial production.

Another interesting observation in these systems is that

the real rates we looked at are largely exogenous. The real rate

responds mostly to itself, dampening very quickly.

At the 48—

month horizon, 68 percent of its own variance is explained by its

own innovations for the one—month out—of—sample ex ante rate and

90 percent for the one—month ex post case. The percent of vari-

ance explained by own Innovations is 56 percent for the one—
quarter rate and 62 percent for the six—month rate.

Response

functions of the real rate are shown in Figure IX.

Not only did the real rate fail

output appeared to respond to expected inflation more than to the

In this section, we will examine these results more

carefully, testing specific restrictions on the reduced form which
reflect on the validity of various economic theories.

A.

IS THE REAL RATE EXOGENOUS?
We

begin by testing a restriction, suggested by our

Section II results, which we feel is incompatible with theories
that emphasize a role for the real rate of interest in transmitting monetary disturbances to the real economy. In particular, we

test the restriction that past money, prices, and income have no
additional predictive content for current real rates, given past
real rates. That is, we test the hypothesis that the real rate is
exogenous, or Granger causally prior, in the content of this four
variable system.

Because the ex ante real rate is unobservable, testing

this hypothesis requires an auxiliary hypothesis of how agents
forecast future prices. We will assume that agents' expectations
are rational, which in the context of our information set and in
the absence of any further restrictions, identifies price expecta-

tions with the projection of future prices on current and lagged
endogenous variables.

As is often the case, the imposition of the rational

expectations hypothesis here leads to complicated, nonlinear
cross—equation restrictions.

While the imposition of these re-

strictions is costly in terms of computations, we find that it
generates test statistics which have greater power to differentiate among hypotheses than other approaches such as Faina (1975),

Fania (1982), Nelson and Schwert (1977) and Garbade and Wachtel
(1978).

Interpretation of causal orderings as indicative of
behavioral or structural relationships is a complicated and subtle

— 20

—

issue (see Sims (1972, 1975)). Nevertheless, we would expect that
IS—LM models would, in general, reject exogeneity of the real
rate.

Thus, we believe the failure to reject would raise ques-

tions about the validity of such models. We believe the test also
bears on the empirical validity of the informationally constrained

equilibrium models, even though our measure of the expected real
rate ignores the limitations on current period information which
are essential ingredients of these models. While in both cases we
can imagine versions of the model which would fool us into accep-

tance of the hypothesis that the real rate is exogenous, we find
these special cases implausible.

The compatibility of this hypothesis with the IS—LM
model, the Lucas—Barro model, and the Grossman—Weiss model will
each be considered in turn.

The IS—LM Model

A central

feature of Keynesian IS—LM analysis is the

idea that changes in the demand or supply of nominal balances can

change the real interest rate.

Keynesian theory achieves this

connection by invoking sluggish nominal price adjustments in
nonfinancial markets, particuarly the labor market.

implication of this theory is that, unless 8, the

interest elasticity of investment demand were infinite, monetary
policy can affect output only to the extent it affects the ex ante
real rate.

Under what auxiliary hypothesis can this model be compatible with the finding that

E(rt+iJrt_5,s>O) =

E(rt+iIrt_5,M.,Pt5,Yt,s>O)

? (4)

One possibility is that, over the observed sample, it

was the deliberate objective of Fed policy to set expected real
rates in such a way that the tio hypothesis are observationally
equivalent. This iight arise, for example, if the policy objec-

tive were to minimize the variance of output, E(Y_y) , by set-

ting r

(y—c). If

followed a univariate autoregressive

— 22 —

process, then so would rt. Although we cannot reject this possibility a priori, it is unlikely that desired interest rate targets

could be expressed in terms of any single factor, let alone the
past history of interest rates. It certainly appears as if policy

has aimed for both price and output stability. Since prices and
output exhibit some independent variation, it is implausible to
take the finding that the real rate is exogenous as indicative of
a particular policy reaction function.

Another possibility which could explain the lack of any

influence from past money, prices, and output on current ex ante
real rates is that the IS curve is horizontal. This would be true
1' the interest sensitivity of demand, were infinite, so that
variations in money supply or demand affected only output without

a measurable impact on interest rates. This possibility is both

system and is easily rejected by

highly implausible in a monthly

subsequent findings.

Still a third possibility, less easily dismissable, is
that over the sample period most
were passive responses to

variations in money supply, nit,

money demand shocks.

Under this

hypothesis, there would be no added explanatory power from past
money to future real rates.

This hypothesis requires either no

deliberate attempt on behalf of the Fed for controlling real
rates, except insofar as interest rate targets depend only on
lagged values, or that policy—induced interest rate variations
have been sufficiently small compared with exogenous money demand

shifts so that our procedure cannot distinguish this variation
from variation due to sample errors.

— 23 —

A fourth possibility which could give rise to a spurious
finding of exogeneity concerns the role of omitted variables.
Suppose the true reduced form for ex ante real rates is given by

(7)

While it is certainly possible that hj's will be zero,

even though the vj's are nonzero, this is highly unlikely as it
requires an extreme coincidence between the v's, w's, and a's.

These possibilities, while being neither mutually exclusive

nor exhaustive seem sufficiently implausible to us that

failure to reject the hypothesis that the real rate is exogenous
casts strong doubt on the Keynesian notion that monetary policy
has affected output through changes in the real rate of interest.

The

Lucas—Barro del

The model presented in Lucas (1972) and modified by
Barro

(1976, 1980) emphasizes the effects of unperceived monetary

injections on labor supply by altering perceptions of real rates
of return.

By positing barriers on current period information

flows, these models draw a sharp distinction between expectations

—2

-

based on complete current period information and the expectations
held by a representative trader.

Nevertheless, the hypothesis

that the real rate (based on complete current information) is
exogenous would seem incompatible wiht most intertemporal versions
of these models.

The original versions of these models assumed all random
disturbances to be serially uncorrelated, and all information lags

to be at most a single period. These features, while inessential,
imply that both concepts of the real rate would be serially inde-

pendent. Thus, in this limited sense, the models are compatible

with the finding that the real rate is exogenous.

However, if

these models are appended to be consistent with the fact that
there are substantial serial correlations in most macroeconomic
time series, then it is difficult to reconcile the models.

To see this, imagine that the ex ante real rate, conditioned on aggregate information, is given by

— E[nltlinformation as of t—l] is the unexpected

component of money and

is a stochastic vector of real factors

which affect real rates (e.g., productivity, thrift, government
expenditures).

Exogeneity of the real rate in the context of a

system which includes a measure of real production requires either

that the measure is uncorrelated with components of t or that the

are all zero. Theories which place an emphasis on a confusion
between unperceived monetary injections and persistent real fac-

tors affecting the ex ante real rate would generally predict a

— 25 —

systematic response of the real rate to changes in real production. A failure to reject exogeneity of the real rate thus raises

questions about the empirical importance of this channel for
monetary disturbances to have real effects.

The Grossman—Weiss Model
This

model also assumes incomplete information so that

the expected real rate based on complete current period information differs from the expectations held by a representative

ante real rate based on
complete current period information to be equal to rt = (1—a)
trader.

The model determines the ex

E[Ct+i_Ctlavailable
preferences and

=

information at tJ where a is a parameter of

(log)

per capita consumption.

As in the Lucas—Barro model, the compatibility of this
theory with an exogenous real rate depends crucially on the nature

of the exogenous stochastic disturbances. In the original version

of the model, it was assumed that both monetary and real distur-

bances were serially independent, which resulted in serially
independent consumption. In this case, the ex ante real rate is a

first order moving average process and the real rate is exogenous.

However, if the model is modified to be consistent with

serially correlated consumption, then the real rate will not
appear to be exogenous. As in the models which emphasize unperceived money, when there are both real and monetary factors which
determine the real rate, and these factors have lagged effects, we
would not expect the real rate to be exogenous.

The three theories we have examined have in common that

the real rate of interest plays a crucial role in the generation

— 26 —

of

business cycles, and that (except under special circumstances)

its behavior is a function of lagged real and monetary disturbances. Any model with these two

characteristics

would appear to

be challenged by the finding that in a system with real and monetary variables, the real rate of interest is exogenous.

B. WHAT

CAUSES OUTPUT?

A central issue of most business cycle theories is the
transmission mechanism between changes in the supply or demand for

money and the level of economic activity. The importance of money

for

predicting output was demonstrated by Sims in 1972 in a 'oi—

variate system and was generally accepted as evidence of real
effects of purely monetary phenomena. Explaining this relationship has occupied a central role of recent theoretical developments. Modern theories share with Keynesian theory the idea that
monetary phenomena affects real variables by altering perceptions

of ex ante real rates.

In light of the results in Section II in

which real rates appear significantly less useful for predicting

output than nominal interest rates and real rates themselves
appear to be exogenous, we are led to question the usefulness of

both Keynesian and equilibrium theories for explaining the observed correlations between nominal and real variables.

We first confirm Sim's finding that industrial produc-

tion is not exogenous in a four variable vector autoregression
with nominal rates, money, and prices.

We then go on to test

whether the observed effects from nominal quantities can be explained through lags of the real rate alone. Given our Section II
results, we would expect this hypothesis to be rejected.

— 27 —

Our next set of hypotheses are not implications of any

completely articulated theory, but are designed to examine the
descriptive results presented in the previous section.

In par-

ticular, we wish to investigate the channels, if any, through
which monetary disturbances affect output.

We first test whether all lagged financial effects can
be filtered through lagged levels of nominal interest rates. Even

if this is true, however, it does not eliminate an indirect role
for money.

If lagged money helps to predict nominal interest

rates, then it helps in predicting future output as well.

In

order to examine this issue, we test whether output and nominal
rates are block exogenous.

Given the identity between nominal rates, real rates and

expected inflation, we also find it interesting to test the hypothesis that all financial effects on output are filtered through

lags of expected inflation. By comparing the results of tests of

the above hypotheses, we can measure the relative explanatory

power for output of each of the components of nominal rates.
Finally, we test directly whether the decomposition of nominal
rates significantly helps explain output.
In examining the importance of monetary disturbances, we

are led to another set of possible restrictions on the system

which would eliminate a role for nney in predicting output.
these hypotheses are that lags of nominal rate or expected infla-

tion innovations are sufficient to capture all lagged financial
effects.

Since innovations are, by construction, orthogonal to

all past variables, these are tests of block exogeneity of output

— 28 —

and nominal interest rate or expected inflation innovations in the
context of the four variable autoregressive systems.

C. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Our tests will be based on the standard likelihood ratio

statistic, and in interpreting our results we will present marginal significance levels based on asymptotic distributions giving

the probability, under the null hypothesis, of observing test
statistics of the given mgnitude. We do riot, however, interpret
these significance levels literally. Two problems, in particular,

bias the significance levels.

First, given the large number of

restrictions we are testing, there is ample reason to question the

validity of the asymptotic distribution approximation for samples

of the size we have. Direct calculation of those distributions,
while possible through numerical simulations, would be prohibitively expensive. Second, our test procedures are being applied
to the same data set which suggested the hypotheses to us in the

first place. Because of these problems, we put little weight on
the absolute levels of the test statistics.

Rather, we wish to

compare the relative fit of different restrictions.

We find the

classical hypothesis testing framework, with a fixed unrestricted
vector autoregression as the alternative, a useful device through

which we can investigate specific questions by looking at the
degree to which various hypotheses are consistent with the data.

In this context, we interpret the calculation of a significance
level of a likelihood ratio statistic as a natural way to correct

the relative fits of different restrictions for differences in
degrees of freedom.

rt, is a function of only

where Rt is the observed nominal interest rate and t11ti is the

expression for the nominal interest rate:

(II)

This equation imposes testable restrictions across the
autoregressive representation for Rt, 11t' and the other variables,

Z., in the information set individuals use in projecting future

The restrictions on a vector autoregression implied by-

(9)

are generated by using (114) to replace all expected inflation

terms in (ii) with projections on observables, collecting terms
with Rt on the left—hand side, and then projecting both sides on
information available at time t—1.

The resulting equation is a

projection of Rt on information available at time t-l which

in,

(15)

Because there are L lags in each of the projections of
the observed variables, lags of the real rate become functions of

observations more than L periods earlier than the current period.

Thus, the reduced form projection for R tmist include rn—i

more lags than each of the other equations. This requires us to
impose (9) as a restriction on a vector autoregressive system with

L+m—l lags on all variables in the R projection and L lags of all
variables in the other projections.

— 31 —

Equations similar to (15) express each of the coeff i—
cients in the R projection as a function of the other coefficients. Given the introduction of the rrrfl new free parameters, b1

and cr, these equations impose K*(L+m_1)_m nonlinear restrictions on the parameters of the vector autoregression.
In tests concerned with what causes movements in output,

we consider four types of explanatory variables, observable quantities, unobservable quantities, and innovations in each.

Tests

with observable quantities are easiest to implement. The likeli-

hood ratio of one equation with linear restrictions relative to
the corresponding equation in an unrestricted vector autoregres-

sion is equivalent to the likelihood ratio test of the entire
system with and without the equation so restricted.

This result

is shown by Doan (1980) using results in Revankar (1971). These

results do not apply, however, when the alternative system has
different numbers of lags in different equations.

Tests using unobservable quantities, expected inflation

or real rates, are implemented in a manner similar to that described above for testing exogeneity of the real rate. Substitution of projections on observables for these quantities leads to
nonlinear restrictions across equations.

The tests which utilize lagged innovations as explana—
tory variables follow essentially the same estimation procedure as

for those with unobservable quantities.

Innovations in nominal

interest rates, for example, are defined by

Rt = Rt_ E[RtIYt 5,Rt ,Mt s

(16)

— 32

The expectation is determined by the autoregressive representation
for R, and the R's can be substituted out in a manner similar to
that in the earlier tests.

all of the systems with nonlinear constraints initial

In implementing our tests we found it difficult on a
priori grounds to choose a particular interest rate to focus on.
Theories generally do not differentiate between rates at different

maturities, but certain trade—offs clearly exist. Longer maturities are probably more relevant signals for investment decisions
and in the case of real rates will be more robust to timing errors

in the measurement of prices. Short rates, however, are likely to

be more responsive to monetary disturbances and less subject to
time aggregation problems.

It will also be easier to forecast

inflation rates over shorter time horizons, although those fore-

casts will include more short—run variation than forecasts over
longer horizons. Our reaction here is similar to our response in
Section II; we present all of the results for two different interest rate maturities.

The first set of data is monthly observations from 18:i
to 81:8 on Ml, end of month rates on Treasury bills with one month

to maturity, industrial production and the consumer price index

months to maturity, industrial production and the consumer price
index less shelter.

We

find that the hypothesis that the real rate is exoge-

nous cannot be rejected in either the monthly or quarterly system. This finding accords with our interpretation of the Section

II results. In both systems, the real rate appears as an exogenous Markov process (see Table viii).
It is revealing to compare the response of the real rate

to innovations in each of the four variables in both the unre-

system and the first restricted system (Figures X and
XI). These graphs show that no qualitative distortions are introstricted

duced by

the restriction that the real rate is exogenous.

The

unrestricted system permits arbitrary patterns of feedback from

the variables to the real interest rate.

The restriction of

exogeneity requires that the effects of these variables can be
filtered through their contemporaneous correlations with the real
rate alone.

The strongest contemporaneous correlations with real
rate innovations are the positive associations with nominal rate
innovations, and negative association with inflation innovations.

Notice that since both inflation and the real rate have
persistent components, the strong negative contemporaneous corre-

lation between real rates and innovations in inflation is enough
to explain the negative correlation between inflation levels and
future real rates observed by Summers (1980) and
Our

interpretation

(1980).

of this phenomenon differs, however, from that

of Summers who argues that money illusion is "the most plausible
explanation for the nonresponse of interest rates to inflation."

there

is no feedback from prices and money to real interest rates,

we conclude that short—run changes in both real rates and infla-

tion can be attributed to the same, as yet unidentified, random
factor.

The results of our hypothesis tests investigating the
transmission mechanism between money and output raise a number of
puzzling questions.

Overall, the results are less clear—cut,

leaving room for differing interpretations.

For example, the

results from the monthly system differ from those of the quarterly
system.

In our discussion, we attempt to focus on those results

which are least equivocal and to point out where uncertainty
remain s.

We first confirm that output is not exogenous in the
context of these four variable au€oregressions. While the rejection of output exogeneity is unambiguous in the quarterly system,
it

is sensitive to lag length in the monthly system.

In the

monthly system with six lags, we can reject output exogeneity at
the conventional 5 percent significance level. However, our other
hypothesis

are not restrictions of these vector autoregressions.

Our restrictions
themselves

involve projections on unobservables which are

projections on lagged observables. Thus, for example,

when six lags of the unobservable real rate are included, the
reduced form will contain 11 lags of the observables. Our most

general alternative for each hypothesis in the context of the
monthly system contains 12 lags in the output equation and six

lags in the other equations, and the quaterly system contains
eight lags in the output equation and four lags in the other equa—

tions.
tems.

All

hypotheses

—

involve restrictions on these two sys—

In the monthly system, none of our hypotheses, including

output exogeneity, can be rejected relative to this alternative.
Nevertheless, the significance level can be interpreted as a way
of ranking these alternative hypotheses.

The hypothesis that the effects from nominal quantities

to output can be filtered through lags of the real rate does not

appear to fit the data well.

By comparison, lagged values of

expected inflation have far more explanatory power for output than

does the real rate in both the monthly and quarterly system.
However, somewhat puzzling is the finding that nominal rates and

money do better than either of these variables for predicting
output in the monthly system, but noticeably worse in the quarterly system.

This anomalous result is confirmed by. testing the

hypothesis that for the purpose of predicting future output is
useful to decompose the nominal interest into its expected inflation and expected real rate components. Consistent with the above

findings the decomposition helps only in the quarterly system. A
likelihood ratio test of the restriction that coefficients on real

rates and expected inflation are the same in the output equation,

that is that only nominal rates matter, has a marginal significance level of .4178 in the monthly system and .0093 in the quarterly system.

Although we find that nominal interest rates are sufficient for predicting output in a monthly system, we can reject the

hypothesis that output and nominal rates are block exogenous in a
four—variable

system.

This arises because money and prices have

— 4l

predictive

—

content for nominal interest rates.

Thus, we cannot

conclude from these tests alone that money has no predictive
content for output past a one—period forecast horizon.

The next

hypothesis is designed to assess the importance of money for
predicting output at any forecast horizon. Specifically, we test
whether three lags of nominal interest rate innovations are suffi-

cient to capture all lagged effects. Since nominal interest rate

innovations are, by construction, orthogonal to all past variables, this is a test of block—exogeneity of output and nominal

interest rate innovations in a four—variable system.

In the

monthly system, this restriction fits surprisingly well, and the

predictive content of six lags of the innovation of the nominal
rate is virtually identical to that of six lagged levels. In the

quarterly system, the innovations have more predictive content

than the levels, although not as much as expected inflation
levels.

IV.

A Possible Explanation

A central result of this paper is that there is information in the level of nominal rates for predicting future output

which is not contained in the history of past output or past and
future expected real rates. We suspect that this statistical link
between expected inflation and output arises because agents in the

economy have some information about the level of future output,
not directly observable to the econometric investigator, which is

first reflected in nominal quantities.

To see how this could

arise, consider the following structural model in which output is
independent of the money supply process.

The crucial feature is that there is some information in

This model shows most simpy that nominal interest rate innovations or expecte4 inflatLon innovations will be correlated with

when Z, is not observed directly. This occurs despite the lack of
structural teedbaclc from past, current, or future money and prices

This modification shows how monetary innovations could
be positive'y associated with "Z" innovations and thus be useful
for predicting real output in a bivariate system in a way which is
consistent with the block exogeneity of income and either nomi.nal

rate innovations or expected inflation innovations in the context

of a larger system. A "Phillips Curvet' relationship——a positive
correlation between ex post inflation and lagged output growth——
could arise from this system if 62 is positive, meaning the money
growth rate rises with unexpected output shocks.

This model suggests an empirical test of the hypothesis

that the inflation—output link is spurious because inflation is
proving for other information relevant to predicting future output. If this view is correct, we would expect that innovations in

expected inflation (i.e., that component of expected inflation
which was unforecastable in earlier periods) would be more useful

for predicting output than the level of expected inflation. This
may be seen by comparing the reduced form equations (25) and
(26).

The primary component of expected inflation is doubtless

the growth in nominal money, which is largely predictable on the
basis of lagged information. However, the structural model shows
that it is only that component of expected inflation not related

— 45 —

to

expected money growth which is useful for predicting future

output. Expected inflation innovations are purged of lagged money

growth and thus more highly correlated with "Z" innovations, and
thus, more useful for predicting output changes.

This test can distinguish between the aforementioned
model, which inflation—output link is spurious from the competing

hypothesis that there are numerous structural institutional fea-

tures of the American econoimj which imply perfectly foreseen
inflation can have real and depressing output affects. Among the
leading exairrples cited in support of this view are the nonindexa—

tion of the tax system, the nonindexation of some administered
prices, the effects of nominal interest rate ceilings, and the
distortionary effects of taxation of liquidity services. If this
structuralist interpretation is valid, we would expect the effects
of inflation on output is independent of the sources of the infla-

tion. In particular, we would expect the level of expected inflation, which includes that corntonent of inflation related to money

growth, to be more useful for predicting output than expected
inflation innovations, which are orthogonal to past money growth.
The test results designed to pass on the validity of the

view that the inflation—output link is spurious are ambiguous. In

the monthly system, innovations to inflation have virtually the
same predictive content for output as do the levels of expected

inflation, although neither is as powerful
innovations of nominal rates alone.

movement of output than do any of the other specifications we

tried.

We interpret these ambiguous results to
consistent with our story. If it

the

is the innovations which contain

useful information, most of that information can be filtered

from lagged levels, and thus we would expect to see approximately
equal explanatory power.

In fact, if we have truncated the true

lag distribution on innovations, we might expect to see some
improvement through the use of the same number of lagged levels
which would incorporate some of that lost information.

On the

other hand, if there were indeed some structural links between
levels of expected inflation and output, then virtually no infor-

mation would be found in recent innovations in expected inflation
and one would expect to see very much poorer fit using them.

The effects of an innovation in expected inflation on
the time paths of the observable variables and the responses of

industrial production can be seen in Figures XII and XIII. An
expected inflation innovation is defined to be a weighted sum of
unit standard deviation shocks to the observable variables, where
the weights are given by the regression coefficients on the first
lag

a projection of one—period ahead inflation on lagged values

of these variables.

expected inflation has an immediate and persistent negative effect

on both output and money.

V. Conclusion

This paper has examined the empirical support for a
number of hypotheses about the money—interest—output link.

tural models was formulated.

This class might be considered

not include those models which explicitly posit barriers to

information flows, some of our results bear on their empirical
validity.

The first set of tests sought to identify the determi-

nants of the real interest rate.

Specifically, we could not

reject the hypothesis that this variable is governed only ty its

own past history, with no separate influence coming from money,
output, nominal rates, or prices. Although this hypothesis is not

an implication of any particular alternative to the Keynesian
theory, it is incompatible with models of this sort, except for

some very restrictive and economically uninteresting special
cases.

Taken literally, our results imply that monetary policy

has not discernably affected the real rate, although it has caus-

ally influenced nominal interest rates. Our results also show a

strongly negative correlation between expected real rates and
inflation innovations.

Since both inflation and expected real

rates have some persistent component, this can explain the well—

documented negative correlation between the level of current
period inflation and real rates, even in the absence of any structural link between past inflation and future real rates.

— I8

—

Our second set of tests found that it is not possible to
filter the observed influence of money and nominal interest rates

on output through expected real rates. This result casts doubt on

the Keynesian transmission mechanism between money and output. A
central new result of this paper is that there is information in
the level of expected inflation for predicting future output which

is not contained in the history of past output or past and future

expected real interest rates. wo explanations for the apparent

predictive content of expected inflation on output have been
advanced. The structuralist interpretation focuses on nonneutral—

ities of various (nonoptimal) institutional nominal rigidities,

but leaves unanswered the causes of changes in inflation.

The

other hypothesis argues that output is structurally exogenous to

money and prices, but that new information is first reflected in

expected inflation and interest rates. We find that data to be
surprisingly consistent with this latter hypothesis.

(1980b), page 17, to correct for degrees of freedom. The results

of the test were affected little by varying the sample break
between 1966 and 1973.

We interpret this test statistic with extreme skepti—
cism, however, because of its low observation—to—parameter ratio

theory on which it is

based.

To judge the applicability of this

distribution theory to our test, we created artifical data by
simulating the system with fixed coefficients (and normally distributed errors with covariances) equal to those estimated using
the entire sample. That is, we generated data under conditions in
which the null hypothesis is known

to

be true. Under these condi-

tions our test procedures led to statistics which rejected the
null hypothesis eight times out of ten at the .01 significance
level.

One of the ten statistics was 185.8, larger than the

180.92 we observed on the actual data.

-JThe expected inflation projections use data beginning
in 1948:1. The first projection is made in 1955:1 and projections
are made each period through the end of 1981. The projections are

made

out—of—sample in order to better measure the expectations of

agents who do not benefit from the hindsight afforded by in—sample

projections.
vector

We take these expectations as data and then fit a

autoregressive representation. We follow this procedure in

order to avoid the prescient expectations which are embodied in
the in—sample projections of a vector autoregression fit directly
to the observable data. For equations such as ours with many free
parameters, the forecast errors generated by in—sample fit may be
substantially smaller

than

out—of—sample errors.

-JThe quarterly real rate is based on the IF, CPI, and
Ml observations for the third month of each quarter. The nominal

rate is the end—of—quarter value for Treasury bills with three
months to maturity, BILLS3. Inflation expectation projections are

generated in the same manner as described previously except only
two lags of the quarterly data were used.

— 51 —

The six.-month real rate is based on monthly

data

and the

same projection equations except that the one—month nominal rate

is replaced with a six—month to maturity Treasury bill rate,
BILLS6.

The chain

rule

of forecasting is then used to project

inflation expectations six months forward.

The ex post one—month real rate is the nominal rate,
BILLS1, minus the actual inflation at annualized rates from the
current to the next month.

JWe should caution the reader that the innovations
discussed in this section are defined relative to the four variables in the vector autoregression. In particular, these innovations are based on projections on lagged expected inflation, (or

equivalently real rates) but not on lagged actual inflation.
Asymptotically this does not matter since if the coefficients are

fixed and known,

then

for given initial conditions the observa-

tions on expected inflation and other variables are sufficient to
determine the actual inflation rates.

..L"We view the similarity of these results with the
earlier results as evidence that the use of in—sample expectations
is not likely to be misleading, and we continue with this approach

in the next section. The unrestricted vector autoregressions used

here are described fully

in

the next section as Alternative C for

monthly data and Alternative B for quarterly data.
