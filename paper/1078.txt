Deficits, Crowding out and Inflation: The Simple Analytics

Abstract

The paper studies the relationship between public sector financial
deficits, crowding-out of public sector capital formation and inflation in

a number of small, classical macroeconomic models. This amounts to
reworking some of the government budget constraint literature by including

capacity constraints, flexible prices and rational expectations. After
considering some simple "money only' and "money—capital" models, most of
the paper is devoted to the analysis of a continuous time representation of

the "money—bonds-.capitaP model of Sargent and Wallace. It is noted that
the conventionally measured deficit is likely to be a poor indicator both
of the "eventual monetization" implied by the fiscal stance and of the long—

run financial crowding-Out pressure it represents. A better measure would
be the inflation-and-real-growth-corrected, cyclically adjusted ("permanent")
government currect account deficit as a proportion of national income.
It is also suggested that the Sargent—Wallace "paradox" variable velocity model ,

INTRODUCTION

This paper investigates the relationship between monetary growth,

government deficits and crowding out. Public sector deficits, if not quite
the root of all evil, are nevertheless frowned upon, condemned and combated
by finance ministers, central bankers and heads of international financial

institutions. The case against government deficits can be briefly stated as
follows:

Deficits must be financed by borrowing or "high-powered" domestic credit

expansion. In a closed economy or an open economy with a freely floating
exchange rate, "high-powered" domestic credit expansion equals the rate of
change of the monetary base.

If deficits are financed by printing money,

this will fuel inflation. If they are financed by borrowing this will put
upward pressure on interest rates, leading to "crowding out" of interest-

sensitive spending. Even at given interest rates "crowding out" could cccur,
with government bonds displacing claims to private capital in private
portfol ios.

Like most conventional wisdom in economics, the account of the money
growth -

deficit

-

crowding out nexus just given is a (potentially

dangerous) half—truth. The correct relationships are fortunately quite
easily derived. They involve no more than a "dusting off" of the government
budget constraint literature with allowance for real growth, inflation,

public sector capital formation, and cyclical deviations of actual from
trend output (Blinder and Solow (1973), Buiter (l977a, b), (1979), Tobin
and Buiter (1976, 1980).)

The paper analyses the implications of government deficits in a number

-2—

of familiar macroeconomic models. Three limitations, to be remedied in
future research, stand out. First, only closed economies are modelled.
Second, "money" is identified throughout with the monetary base. Private
money is not considered. Third, only full employment models are considered.
Even with these restrictions, a number of important issues can be dealt with.
The plan of the paper is as followsY7 Section 2 considers models without

public sector interest-bearing debt. After analysing a model in which money
is the only asset, two models with money and real capital are studied.

Section 3 considers models with money, real capital and public sector

interest-bearing debt. This whole section is organised around the seminal
paper of Sargent and Wallace (1981) in which rational expectations met the

government budget constraint. It is noted in Section (3a) that it is
necessary to correct the conventionally measured deficit for changes in the
real value of government interest-bearing debt due to inflation to obtain a
proper measure both of the "crowding out pressure" and of the eventual

monetisation implied by the fiscal stance. In Section (3b) the SargentWallace "paradox" that lower monetary growth now may mean higher future
inflation and even, with velocity endogenous, higher inflation now is

analysed. It is argued that a counter-paradox" - lower monetary growth now
leading to lower inflation now and in the future - can also occur when

velocity is endogenous. A diagrammatic description of this phenomenon is

provided. In Section (3c) it is shown that the exogenous real interest rate
of the Sargent-Wallace model can be endogenised without changing its

qualitative conclusions in the case when velocity is constant. Public sector
capital formation is introduced in Section (3d). It is argued that (with
proper allowance for any difference between the appropriated rate of return
on public sector capital and the government's cost of borrowing) it is the
government's current account deficit that matters for future inflation and

for crowding out of total (private plus public) capital formation. Finally,
in Section (3e) we consider cyclical variations in the deficit without
(necessarily) viewing departures of actual from trend output as due to
Keynesian fluctuations in effective demand.

The conclusion is that the deficit measure that should be the focus of
concern is the inflation-and-real-growth—corrected, cyclically adjusted
government current account deficit.

I have shown elsewhere that this

measure can differ quite strikingly from the conventionally measured
government deficit (Buiter (1981, 1982c)).

DEFICITS, INFLATION AND CROWDING OUT IN CLOSED ECONOMIES
WITHOUT GOVERNMENT BONDS

(2a) Models with neither government bonds nor private capital

Consider the world's simplest economy. The income velocity of
circulation of money, V, is constant as is the rate of growth n of real

output, Y. G denotes public spending onoods and services and T taxes net
of transfers. The price level, P, is perfectly flexible. Money, M, is the
only government liability and the only private sector asset.

At each moment, the rate of inflation equals the proportional rate of growth

of the nominal money stock minus the rate of growth of output. We define

g GY1 and T = TY1.

The proportional rate of growth of the nominal money

stock can be expressed as the product of the velocity of circulation and

the public sector deficit as a proportion of GNP. With velocity constant,
an increase in the deficit relative to GNP raises inflation. The deficit,

as a proportion of GNP, consistent with any rate of inflation t

A convenient starting point for the analysis of the relationship between

sectors and monetary growth is the model of Sargent and Wallace (l981),* of
which the Continuous time analogue is given in equations 31—40.

Output, employment and the real value of the stock of bonds plus the capital
stock grow at the same proportional rate, n.

The real interest rate is fixed.

The model exhibits one-for-one crowding out of private capital formation by
changes in the real stock of government bonds, at a given real interest rate.

The intuition behind (44) is clear.

Government spending has to be financed

either by explicit taxes, by borrowing or by printing money.

To the extent that

borrowing increases the real stock of per-capita government bonds held by private
agents,it increases the future real per—capita deficit (if the real interest rate
exceeds the natural rate of growth).

If there is a finite upper bound on the

stock of real per—capita bonds that the private sector will hold, (or the public

sector is willing to owe)then once that upper bound is reached, further deficits
have to be financed by money creation.

The point to note is that only nominal

bond issues in excess of the rate of inflation plus the natural rate of growth
times the outstanding stock of bonds (B stock of bonds.

means that/there is per-capita "crowding in"
From equation (29) it can be seen that real

bonds (changes in the real stock of bonds) "crowd out" real capital (real
capital formation) on a one-for-one basis.

The total rate of accumulation of

capital—cum-real bonds is exogenously given and grows at the natural rate n.
Crowding out takes place not through changes in the real interest rate, which
is constant by assumption, but by channelling private savings into public debt
rather than private capital at a given real interest rate.

Deficits are a source of concern to policy makers because (a) to the
extent that they are not monetised they are feared to cause crowding out and
(b) to the extent they are monetised they are feared to cause inflation.

To

investigate whether deficits cause crowding out we consider the behaviour of
the real stock of government interest-bearing debt (or the real per-capita
stock of government interest-bearing debt) for a given path of exhaustive
spending G(t) and taxes net of transfers T(t) and for a given path of monetary
growth.

This corresponds to the behaviour of the Sargent-Wallace model for
To determine what the monetary growth rate implied by the fiscal

stance is, we look at the behaviour of monetary growth for given paths of G(t)
and T(t) and for a given value of the real stock of government debt or the real
stock of government debt per-capita.

This corresponds to the behaviour of the

Sargent-Wallace model for t t.
In the Sargent—Wallace model changes in -- crowd out private capital one—
for-one.

This extreme form of crowding out will not hold in many more plausible

-25-

models.

It seems safe to say, however, that in any model not exhibiting

non-Ricardian debt neutrality, the change in the real (or real per—capita)

stock of public sector interest-bearing debt will be the proximate determinant
and the best single indicator of the change in the degree of aggregate or per
capita crowding out pressure that the government is bringing to bear on the
economy.

Ii

The degree of aggregate or per-capita crowding out depends on the amount of money

-25-

financing that is permitted.

A useful benchmark is e.g. a monetary growth

rate consistent (in the long run) with zero inflation:

0 =

n.

Given any rule

for monetary growth, the aggregate and per-capita crowding out implied by the
fiscal stance can be found from (45a) and (45b).

The per capita crowding out

equation (45b) is the proper one for the evaluation of the very long run or
steady state implications of the fiscal sta,pce for crowding out since in the

steady state

must be constant.

In (45b), the conventionally measured deficit

is corrected not only for the effects of inflation and real growth on the
outstanding real per—capita stock of bonds (and on the demand for bonds
by private agents) but also for any monetisation permitted by the authorities.

It is obvious that in any given period in which the conventionally measured
deficit is large because of a high current rate of inflation and high nominal

interest rates, the inflation-and—growth-corrected deficit may well be
significantly smaller: the deficit is a monetary phenomenon; its elimination
requires a monetary, not a fiscal ,

correction.

Similar conclusions can be drawn as regards the implications of the fiscal
stance and the conventionally measured deficit for monetary growth in the long
run.

Equations (46a) and (46b) show what the spending and tax programmes imply

for monetary growth if bond financing is conducted in such a way as to neither
raise nor reduce the crowding out pressure (aggregate or per-capita) exercised
by the government.

The real (per-capita) stock of bonds that the authorities (39) aim to keep
constant need not be the historically inherited one.
stock to be achieved at some future date.

It could be a target

The deficit measure relevant for

eventual monetisation is the conventionally measured deficit corrected for the
effect of inflation on the real value of the outstanding stock of bonds and
(in the case of (46b)) for the effect of real growth.

Current high inflation

may make the current deficit (and the current deficit-GNP ratio) high because

-27—

of its effect on nominal interest rates.

If the inflation—corrected deficit

is nevertheless negative, this means that, if the authorities were to stick to

their spending and taxation programmes (as a proportion of GNP) and if they
were to keep the degree of aggregate crowding out (--)

constant,

they would

henceforth have a negative rate of monetary growth and therefore, in due course,
a negative rate of inflation.

In other words, an inflation-and-growth-

corrected budget surplus means that, whatever the current conventionally
measured deficit may be (i.e. regardless of the current inflation premium in

nominal interest rates), a negative rate of monetary growth would result if
the government simply froze its spending and taxation programme as a proportion
of GNP and used bond-financing to keep the bond-(trend)GNP ratio constant.

it is also clear that even if the temporary

reduction in money growth is followed by a rate of monetary growth that is
higher than the initial rate, the impact effect on the price level and the
rate of inflation may well be negative.

this outcome.

(3d) Public Sector Capital Formation
If public sector expenditure on goods and services is not merely of the
hole-in-the-ground public consumption variety, the monetary implications of
the deficit can only be accurately assessed by making a correction for net
public sector capital formation.

Let

the private sector capital stock and rG the real rate of return on public
sector capital.

(3e) Cyclical corrections

identify such cycles in the level of economic activity with "Keynesian"
deviations of actual from full employment output.

For present purposes they

might as well represent serially correlated movements in the "natural1' or full

employment level of output.

Quite separate issues arise when past, current

and prospective future fiscal and monetary policy actions themselves contribute

to endogenous cyclical movements in the level of economic activity. E.g. the
issues raised by Blinder and Solow (1973), concerning the appropriate
"multiplier" weights to be attached to the various fiscal instruments, are not
germane to the point made here.

To get a proper picture of

long-run crowding out pressure (69') should be evaluated at V =

The

implications

of the fiscal stance for inflation in the long-run are similarly

obtained by evaluating (70') at V = V.

"Cyclical corrections" are therefore

merely a convenient procedure for estimating the trend or permanent deficit.
If departures from trend output are not of a regular cyclical nature and if

upward and downward deviations from trend do not tend to balance each other
out, the convenient short-hand measure of the permanent deficit obtained by
evaluating the deficit at Y(t) =

V(t)

will be inappropriate.

Explicit

estimates of the future expected paths of the deficit will have to be made
instead.
