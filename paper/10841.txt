Dividend Taxes and Corporate Behavior: Evidence from the 2003 Dividend Tax Cut
Raj Chetty and Emmanuel Saez
NBER Working Paper No. 10841
October 2004
JEL No. H3, G3
ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the effects of dividend taxation on corporate behavior using the large tax cut on
individual dividend income enacted in 2003. Using data spanning 1980 to 2004-Q2, we document
a sharp and widespread surge in dividend payments following the tax cut, along several dimensions.
First, an unprecedented number of firms initiated regular dividend payments after the reform. As a
result, the number of publicly traded firms paying dividends, after having declined continuously for
more than two decades, began to increase precisely in 2003. Second, many firms that were already
paying dividends prior to the reform raised regular dividend payments significantly. Third, special
dividends also rose. All of these effects are robust to introducing controls for profits and other firm
characteristics. Additional evidence for specific groups of firms suggests that the tax cut induced
increases in total payout rather than substitution between dividends and repurchases. The tax
response was confined to firms with lower levels of forecasted growth, consistent with an
improvement in capital allocation efficiency. The response to the tax cut was strongest in firms with
strong principals whose tax incentives changed (presence of large taxable institutional owners or
independent directors with large share holdings), and in firms where agents had stronger incentives
to respond (large executive ownership and low levels of executive stock-options outstanding). These
findings show that principal-agent issues play a central role in corporate responses to taxation.

Introduction

The taxation of dividend income has generated much interest and controversy both in the public economics literature and among tax policy makers, largely because it creates a particularly
stark version of the equity-eﬃciency tradeoﬀ. Dividend income, and especially taxable dividend income, accrues very disproportionately to wealthy individuals.1 Hence, taxing dividends
seems desirable for redistributive reasons. However, taxing dividend income may also generate
large eﬃciency costs. Dividend taxes reduce the net return to investors, potentially reducing
savings and the capital stock in the economy. In addition, taxing dividend income at the individual level could induce firms to reduce their tax burdens by retaining earnings rather than
distributing dividends. If agency problems lead to ineﬃcient investment of retained earnings
(as suggested by e.g., Jensen 1986, Scharfstein and Stein 2000, LaPorta et al., 2000), dividend
taxation could reduce the eﬃciency of capital allocation in addition to distorting the amount
of investment.2 In view of this tradeoﬀ, it is important to know firms’ behavioral responses
to taxation to evaluate optimal dividend taxation. Despite extensive research, the eﬀects of
taxation on dividend policies and corporate behavior more generally remain disputed, largely
because of the lack of a sharp tax experiment, and therefore of a fully convincing research
design (see Auerbach (2003) and Allen and Michaely (2003) for recent surveys).
The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 in the United States (hereafter,
the “2003 tax reform”) provides a unique opportunity to understand the eﬀects of dividend
taxation on corporate behavior. One of the key provisions of the reform was to introduce
favorable treatment for individual dividend income whereby dividends are taxed at a rate of
15% instead of facing the regular progressive individual income tax schedule with a top rate of
35%.3 This tax change eﬀectively gave to dividend income the same favorable tax treatment
1

Individual Income Tax Statistics for year 2000 (U.S. Treasury Department, 2003) show that about two
thirds of taxable dividends are earned by the top 10% income taxpayers. More than half of American families
now hold stock through pension or college funds but returns on those assets are exempted from income taxes
and hence not aﬀected by the 2003 tax reform.
2
Indeed, Corporate America has traditionally lobbied for corporate tax reductions but not dividend tax
reductions, suggesting that managers of large corporations might prefer to retain earnings rather than distribute
dividends.
3
More precisely, taxpayers in the bottom two income tax brackets (facing a regular marginal tax rate of 10%
or 15%) face a new dividend tax rate of only 5%, while taxpayers in the top four brackets (facing marginal tax
rates of 25, 28, 33, or 35%) face a new dividend tax rate is 15%. Taxpayers on the Alternative Minimum Tax
schedule (flat rate of 28%) benefit as well from the reduced 15% tax rate on their dividend income.

as realized capital gains income.4

The tax reform was oﬃcially signed into law at the end

of May 2003, but was first proposed by the Bush administration on January 7, 2003.5 The
tax cut on dividend income was made retroactive to the beginning of 2003. Therefore, during
the first two quarters of 2003, corporations knew that dividends would face lower taxes with
substantial probability. Starting in June 2003, this became certain. The tax cut is scheduled
to expire by 2009, but the actual duration is contingent on political developments.6
This paper uses the 2003 dividend tax cut to estimate the eﬀect of dividend taxes on dividend payments by publicly traded corporations. The leading example for both the incentive
and distributional consequences of the tax cut is Microsoft, the company with the largest
accumulated cash holdings in the U.S. Microsoft initiated regular dividend payments for the
first time in 2003. In July 2004, Microsoft announced an additional special one-time dividend
payment of $32 billion to be paid in December 2004, an amount that far exceeds any dividend
payment previously made by a single U.S. corporation. The tax-savings associated with these
payments will clearly benefit wealthy taxpayers disproportionately, starting with Bill Gates
the richest person in the United States, but they might also aﬀect the investment decisions
of Microsoft and other companies. The goal of this paper is to examine whether Microsoft’s
behavior is an anomaly or whether it is representative of a broader shift in payout policies
associated with the tax cut. We investigate this issue using data on dividend payments by
publicly traded corporations, currently available up to the second quarter of 2004 from the
Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP).
We find that the level of total regular dividends has surged by approximately 20% since
the beginning of 2003, the point at which the lower tax rate was first proposed and ultimately
retroactively applied. We need to surmount two important econometric challenges in order
to identify a causal link between this change and the tax reform. First, dividend payments
are extremely concentrated. The top 20 payers account for more than half of total dividends
4
Individual dividend income earned through tax favored instruments such as IRAs, 401(k)s and other pension
and college funds was not aﬀected by the tax change. Dividend income earned by government agencies, nonprofit
organizations, and corporations was not aﬀected either.
5
Auerbach and Hassett (2004) discuss the timing of the tax reform legislative process in detail. They find
that the reduction of dividend taxation was not discussed seriously before the end of December 2002. It was
not mentioned in the Bush 2000 campaign platform either, suggesting that there was no anticipation that such
a tax change would take place before the very end of 2002.
6
If President Bush wins again in 2004, the tax cut might well be made permanent. If Senator Kerry wins,
as Congress is predicted to almost certainly remain Republican, gridlock and no further change is the most
plausible outcome.

paid out by publicly traded firms.

Consequently, the level of total (or mean) dividends is

driven by a few big payers, making it diﬃcult to make statistically robust inferences about
the eﬀects of the tax change without analyzing other moments of the distribution that are less
sensitive to outliers.

Second, the size and composition of our sample of firms listed on the

NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ exchanges fluctuates heavily in the years preceding the tax reform.
As a result, deliberate changes in dividend behavior are confounded with changes in sample
composition due to entry and exit.7 In view of these problems, we control for composition
eﬀects by analyzing the properties of entrants and leavers, focusing on within-firm changes in
dividend payments. We also divide our analysis of the response to the tax reform into three
margins that are more robust to outliers than means: (1) the extensive margin (initiations and
terminations of regular dividend payments); (2) the intensive margin (frequency of increases
or decreases in payment amounts by firms already paying); and (3) special payments (one time
distributions). Our main findings are as follows.
First, we find an unprecedented large surge in dividend initiations exactly in the quarters
following enactment of the reform. This constitutes strong evidence that this change in behavior was tax driven. As a result and as the frequency of dividend terminations fell slightly
after the tax cut, the fraction of traded companies paying dividends, which had declined continuously over the last two decades (see Fama and French 2001), has increased significantly
from a low of 20% in 2002Q4 to almost 25% in 2004Q2. Second, dividend paying firms were
significantly more likely to increase their regular dividend payments after the reform. Third,
we find that the number of special (i.e., one time, non-recurring) dividend payments also increased following the 2003 tax reform but the eﬀects on special dividend amounts are driven
by a handful of large payers.

All of these results are robust to controlling for a variety of

potential confounding factors such as levels and lags of profits, assets, cash holdings, industry,
and firm age.8 In addition, we provide robustness checks of the causality of the tax cut by
showing that there is no change in dividend initiations for U.S. corporations whose largest
shareholder is a non-taxable institution such as a pension fund, or for Canadian corporations.
By aggregating the changes in amounts along the extensive and intensive margins, we obtain
7

These two econometric issues explain the sharp diﬀerences between our results and the recent studies of
the 2003 tax cut by Blouin, Raedy, and Shackelford (2004) and Julio and Ikenberry (2004), which we discuss
in detail below.
8
Importantly, we find no pre-reform decline in dividends, suggesting that the reform was indeed unanticipated
and that our estimates are not biased by intertemporal substitution (re-timing) of dividend payments.

3

a relatively precise estimate of the change in total regular dividends due to the tax cut of
$5 billion per quarter (20%).

This implies an elasticity of regular dividend payments with

respect to the marginal tax rate on dividend income of -0.5.
Having established a link between the tax cut and dividend payments, we explore the
mechanism of the tax response by analyzing the heterogeneity of the eﬀect across firms. We
find that the dividend response was concentrated among firms with strong incentives for agents
to increase dividend payments or with powerful principals whose incentives to demand dividend
income changed significantly with the reform. Firms where top executives held more shares
and fewer unexercised stock-options were much more likely to initiate dividend payments,
revealing the importance of top executives’ self-interests in determining corporate responses
to taxation.9 In addition, firms with high taxable institutional ownership or large independent
shareholders on the board of directors were also more likely to raise dividends, especially when
top executives have weak incentives to do so.

These findings indicate that agency issues

should be a central element in the analysis of optimal corporate tax policy, and call for a
tighter connection between traditional tax eﬃciency analysis in public economics and the
agency theory of the firm in corporate finance.
The heterogeneity of the tax response also provides suggestive evidence of an improvement
in capital allocation toward firms with better investment opportunities. Dividend initiations
and increases were confined to firms with moderate forecasted earnings growth. In contrast,
firms with high expected growth in earnings did not respond to the tax cut at all. Of course,
capital allocation could only have improved if total payout rose after the tax cut; if the surge
in dividend payments simply substituted for share repurchases, no net reallocation would
have occurred.

We therefore explore the degree of substitution between share repurchases

and additional dividend payouts.

Unfortunately, the volatility of share repurchases in the

aggregate makes it diﬃcult to determine whether substitution occurred in the full sample of
firms. If we restrict attention to groups of firms where the tax response was strongest — e.g.,
those with high executive share ownership and high institutional ownership — we are able to
show that the fraction of firms using either share repurchases or dividends to pay out earnings
rose sharply after the reform. In addition, for those companies who initiated dividends after

These findings do not necessarily imply that managers are hurting shareholders by manipulating corporate
decisions. It is possible that managers contracts were written so that the management’s self-interest is aligned
with shareholders’ interests.

the reform, total payout (dividends plus share repurchases) increased significantly. Hence, the
tax reform does indeed appear to have induced an increase in total payout rather than simply
a “relabelling” of repurchases as dividends.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some background
on payout policies and previous work. Section 3 describes the data and defines the variables
of interest. Section 4 describes our methodology and presents the main results on the change
in dividend payments induced by the tax reform. Section 5 examines the heterogeneity of
the response, and section 6 investigates whether new dividend payments crowded out share
repurchases. Section 7 oﬀers concluding remarks.

Background on Payout Policies and Existing Literature

2.1

Payout Policies

Corporations distribute profits to shareholders in two main forms: dividends and share repurchases. In a world without taxes and with perfect information, share repurchases and
dividends are equivalent. Under U.S. tax law, because realized capital gains have traditionally
been taxed more lightly than dividend income, share repurchases were a more tax eﬃcient way
of distributing profits. Share repurchases started becoming more common in the early 1980s
following a SEC ruling in 1982 which clarified the rules under which corporations could legally
make share repurchases without being subject to dividend taxation (Grullon and Michaely,
2002). However, despite the rise in share repurchases, dividends have remained an important
conduit for distributing profits.10 The reason why dividends have not been entirely replaced by
share repurchases has been termed the “dividend puzzle,” and a number of theories and explanations have been proposed to explain this phenomenon (see Michaely and Allen, 2003). The
2003 tax reform almost eliminated the tax disadvantage of dividends relative to repurchases.
There are two broad categories of dividend payments: regular dividends and special dividends. Regular dividends are periodic and recurrent (in general quarterly but sometimes
annual, semi-annual, or more rarely monthly). As noted by Fama and French (2001), the fraction of publicly traded firms making these regular dividend payments is fairly low (less than
10

Over the last decade, total dividend payouts are about the same size as total share repurchases for publicly
traded U.S. corporations (see Michaely and Allen, 2003) and Section 6 below. Grullon and Michaely (2002)
argue that share repurchases have, to some extent, crowded out dividend payments.

25%) in the recent past. It is fairly common for firms to increase regular dividend payments
— 11% of firms initiated or raised dividends in the average quarter. Decreases are much rarer
(less than 2% per quarter), consistent with DeAngelo and DeAngelo’s (1990) finding that only
severely distressed firms lower or terminate dividend payments. Regular dividends are thus
extremely persistent over time.11 Hence, an initiation of a regular payment (as by Microsoft
in 2003) is a strong signal that the firm intends to maintain a dividend payment of equal or
greater value permanently.
In contrast to regular dividends, special dividends are one-time, non-recurring events. Special payments are made by very few firms (0.8% of our sample). Special dividends are also
generally of minor importance in terms of amounts relative to regular dividends, accounting
for less than 2.5% of total dividends on average.

2.2

Previous Work

Most of the early work on the eﬀects of taxation on dividend payments used time series analysis
rather than focusing on a single tax reform. The evidence from this literature is controversial,
and is typically divided into the “old view” and the “new view.”12
The old view, implicit in Feldstein (1970), says that dividend taxes reduce the net return
on investment and hence reduce the supply of investment. Therefore, when taxes on dividends
are cut, individuals are more willing to save and invest their money in stocks, spurring business
investment, profits, and dividend distributions in the long run. Poterba and Summers (1985),
using time series evidence from the United Kingdom found that, consistent with the old view,
dividend payments and investment were higher when the tax rate on dividends was lower.
More recently, Poterba (2004) uses U.S. time series data from 1929 to 2002 and finds a negative
association between dividend payments and the dividend tax rates relative to taxes on capital
gains. His point estimates imply that the 2003 tax reform should increase dividend payments
by 20% in the long run, but that the adjustment process will be very slow, with only a quarter
of the long-run eﬀect taking place within three years.13
11

Section 3 gives formal definitions of initiations and terminations.
A large related literature studies the eﬀects of taxes on other corporate behaviors such as investment
(Cummins et al. 1994, Desai and Goolsbee, 2004), capital structure (Gordon and Lee, 2001), and organizational
form choices (Gordon and MacKie-Mason, 1990, Goolsbee, 1998, 2004).
13
Our estimates also point toward a 20% increase in dividend payments but the response we document
happens much faster than the one predicted by Poterba’s estimates.
12

6

In contrast, the new view on dividend taxation, implicit among critics of the 2003 tax
reform, assumes that marginal investments are entirely financed by retained earnings rather
than new share issues (Auerbach (1979), King (1977), and Bradford (1981)).

Under this

assumption, the tax on dividends should not aﬀect the investment decisions of firms, and
profits and dividend payments therefore should not change either.14 In this case, the dividend
tax cut is irrelevant for corporate decisions and simply benefits individual investors by reducing
their tax burden. Using U.S. data from 1981 to 1998, Auerbach and Hassett (2003), show that
consistent with the new view, dividend payments are sensitive to changes in investment at
the firm level, suggesting that retained earnings are indeed the marginal source of investment
funds. Auerbach (2001) critically reviews the time series empirical literature and concludes
that the evidence for a large dividend payout response to dividend taxation is at best mixed.
In light of the diﬃculties with time series analysis, another strand of the literature has
attempted to use the variation in tax rates induced by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA-86)
to study these issues, but has also found mixed results. TRA-86 cut the top income tax rate
from 50% to 28% while increasing the tax rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%.

Bolster

and Janjigian (1991) find no discernible eﬀect of TRA-86 on aggregate dividend payments
by publicly traded firms. However, in an innovative study, Perez-Gonzalez (2003) showed
that there was a small response of dividend payments among a subsample of firms with large
individual shareholders, which is masked in the aggregate. Our analysis shows that TRA-86
generated a short-term spurt of special dividend payments concentrated among a very small
number of firms but, in contrast to the 2003 tax reform, had no discernible eﬀect on regular
dividend payments.15 Consistent with Perez-Gonzalez’s (2003) evidence for TRA-86, we also
find that the response to the 2003 tax reform is larger for companies with large shareholders
on the board of directors or among top executives.
Finally, a few very recent studies have also investigated the eﬀect of the 2003 tax reform on
dividend policies.16 We discuss how our study diﬀers, complements, or disagrees with these
14

However, as pointed out by Auerbach and Hassett (2003), if the tax reform not only changes dividend
income taxation but also interest income taxation (as in the Tax Reform Act of 1986) or if the tax reform is
not permanent but temporary (as might be the case with the 2003 tax reform), then even under the new view
dividend payments may change following a dividend tax change.
15
We discuss reasons why TRA-86 may have had diﬀerent eﬀects than the 2003 reform in section 4.
16
With the exception of Blouin et. al (2004), these studies were completed at roughly the same time as our
own study, and were brought to our attention after we circulated our preliminary results in Chetty and Saez
(2004).

7

concurrent studies in this subsection as well as in the context of our results in section 4.
First, Blouin, Raedy, and Shackelford (2004) examined dividend payments in the three
months immediately after the tax reform was passed (May 23 to August 22, 2003).

They

compared dividend payments in this post-reform period with dividends in the same period in
2002 (May 23 to Aug. 22, 2002) and the three month period immediately preceding enactment
of the reform. Blouin et. al. concluded that virtually all the increase in dividend payments
after the tax reform was due solely to 17 firms who paid special dividends, and found no
statistically significant changes in regular dividend amounts. Their results diﬀer from our
results for a number of reasons. First, they choose their sample by selecting all firms alive
from 2001-Q4 to 2003-Q3 that paid dividends in the three months after enactment. This
sample selection is based on the endogenous post-reform dividend choice and is likely to bias
their results. Second, they focus on the level of dividends payments (and then separate regular
and special dividends), rather than other moments of the distribution. As emphasized above,
analyzing the eﬀect of the tax cut on regular dividend levels is a diﬃcult statistical problem
because of the large outliers that drive the means.17 Indeed, when analyzing our data at
a monthly level, we find that the surge in the frequency of regular dividend initiations and
increases began precisely in the post-reform period studied by Blouin et. al. Third, they do
not look back at the historical data before 2002.

Again, since aggregate regular dividends

are a noisy time series, it is diﬃcult to assess the magnitude of the response induced by the
tax change without making further historical comparisons.

Finally, three more quarters of

post-reform data have become available since their study. The additional data show that the
rapid growth in regular dividend payments that began during the period examined by Blouin
et. al. has continued in subsequent quarters.
Second, Julio and Ikenberry (2004) extend the influential time series analysis of Fama and
French (2001) up to the first quarter of 2004. They show that the secular downward trend
in the fraction of listed firms paying dividends makes a reversal starting in late 2000. Julio
and Ikenberry argue that the Bush dividend tax cut cannot explain the reversal, as it starts
well before tax reform occurred. They propose various explanations for the pre-tax rebound,
including corporate accounting scandals and the maturity of technology firms. In contrast,
17

Blouin et al. also find similar results for dividends per share, but this is not an economically relevant
normalization as the number of shares in public corporations is to a very large extent arbitrary.

8

we show that the reversal in 2000 in the fraction of publicly traded firms paying dividends is
entirely due to changes in the composition of the sample due to the de-listing of many young
technology firms during the stock market crash of 2000-2001. These firms generally did not
pay dividends, mechanically raising the fraction of payers. When controlling explicitly for
these entry and exit eﬀects, we find that the reversal in the secular decline in the number of
payers takes place exactly in 2003. This result is not surprising in light of our finding that
initiations surge only in 2003 while terminations remain stable.18
Finally, Nam, Wang, and Zhang (2004) show that executive ownership is correlated with
dividend increases in 2003 but that there was no such relation in previous years. Their results
are consistent with our findings about the importance of principal-agent issues in determining
the tax response. However, Nam et. al. limit their analysis to executive share and stock-option
ownership compiled from Execucomp data for about 1,500 firms every year since 1992, and only
to firms already paying dividends.19 In this paper, we focus on the dividend initiation margin,
along which the tax response was by far the most striking. We also consider heterogeneity
along other dimensions, such as large shareholders (individual and institutional, taxable versus
non-taxable). We also collect executive share and stock-option ownership for a much larger
set of firms from proxy statements in order to obtain estimates for the full sample of publicly
traded firms.

These additional data also allow us to provide results on interaction eﬀects

between executive share ownership and the strength of principals that are not evident in the
selected sample of firms listed in ExecuComp.

Data

We use quarterly data from the CRSP, which reports dividend, stock price, and share information for all companies listed on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stock exchanges. The
data we use span 1980-Q1 to 2004-Q2, the last quarter for which data are currently available.
Following Fama and French (2001) and Auerbach and Hassett (2003), we exclude all foreign
firms and all firms whose most recent industry classification is in utilities (SIC codes between
4900 and 4949) or the financial sector (SIC code between 6000 and 6999) because these com18

Consistent with our results, Julio and Ikenberry (2004) also find that there was a surge in dividend initiations
only in 2003 and not at the time of the 2000 reversal.
19
More recently, Brown, Liang, Weisbenner (in progress, no draft yet available) have also noticed that executive ownership is related to dividend initiations and dividend increases after the tax reform.

panies are regulated and often have legal distribution requirements. Their dividend payments
may therefore be determined by law rather than by shareholder decisions.20 The sample of
firms that satisfy the preceding criteria constitute our “core sample.”
The number of firms in the core sample in each quarter varies between less than 4,000 in the
early 1980s and about 6,000 in the late 1990s (see Appendix Table A1 in and Figure 6, Panel
B for a graphical depiction). There are large variations in the number of listed firms because
of waves of new lists during some periods (in general during economic booms) and waves of
de-listing in some other periods (in general during recessions and stock market crashes). The
large variation over time in the number of firms in the core sample raises important issues in
the empirical analysis. As we show below, it is often useful for comparability to keep the same
number of firms in each quarter. To obtain the largest possible constant-size sample of firms,
we focus on a sample of the top 3,807 firms ranked by market capitalization in each quarter,
which we term the “constant number of firms” sample.21
For our regression and heterogeneity analysis, we merge our CRSP sample with the Compustat database, losing some firms because not all firms listed in CRSP are covered by Compustat. Compustat data were available only up to 2004-Q1 when this study was completed.
The left half of Table 1 gives summary statistics for the core and the constant number of firms
samples between 1981-Q3 and 2004-Q1.22 All dollar amounts in this and subsequent tables
and graphs are in real 2004 dollars (deflated using the Consumer Price Index). We also merge
our data with various other databases that contain other covariates of interest. The I/B/E/S
database gives analysts’ earnings forecasts for approximately 60% of the companies in our
sample. Execucomp provides detailed executive compensation, stock and stock-option ownership for approximately one-third of the firms in our sample every year since 1992. Thompson
Financial database provides detailed institutional ownership information for most of the firms
in our sample. Dlugosz, Fahlenbrach, Gompers, and Metrick (2004) provide information on
large shareholders (individuals or entities who hold more than 5% of shares), collected from
proxy statements, for about 1,500 firms for the period 1996-2001. Because Execucomp and the
Dlugosz, et. al. database cover only about a third of the CRSP-Compustat firms, we augment
20

We also examined utilities and financial firms separately and our results for those firms are available upon
request.
21
3,807 is the total number of firms which meet our selection criteria in 2004-Q2, the last quarter available.
For all previous quarters, the CRSP data always contains at least 3,807 firms.
22
Lagged data requirements for our subsequent analysis force us to begin with 1981-Q3.

10

these data sources for our principal-agent heterogeneity analysis by collecting some variables
directly from SEC proxy statements for an additional 347 firms, as described in Section 5.
We define regular dividends as monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual taxable dividends in the CRSP data. We also reclassify “other frequency” taxable dividends as regular
dividend payments when those other-frequency payments are followed by regular payments of
similar magnitude.23 Some forms of liquidation can generate non-taxable dividend events that
we ignore in this study. We define all other taxable dividends besides regular distributions as
“special” dividends. More precisely, we define special dividends as the sum of special, one-time,
unspecified and other frequency dividends (those which were not followed by regular payments
of similar magnitude) in the CRSP data. Virtually all payments in our broader definition of
special dividends are accounted for by CRSP’s “special dividend” category.
We define a firm as initiating regular dividend payments in quarter t if it pays positive
regular dividends in quarter t and did not pay dividends in the previous four quarters. We
define a firm as terminating regular dividend payments in quarter t if it paid regular dividends
previously and stops paying from quarter t on. In practice, our definitions are slightly more
complex to accommodate the case of annual and semi-annual payers as well as the issue of
censoring (for terminations only) at the end of the sample. The exact definitions are presented
in appendix.

Eﬀect of the Tax Cut on Dividend Payments

Our empirical analysis is organized as follows.

The first subsection examines the change

in aggregate dividend amounts following the 2003 tax change and demonstrates the need to
examine other moments of the dividend distribution to make reliable inferences about the
eﬀects of the tax reform. Subsections 2-4 provide such an analysis along three margins: (1) the
extensive margin (initiations and terminations of regular dividend payments); (2) the intensive
margin (increases or decreases in payment amounts by firms already paying); and (3) special
dividends. Subsection 5 shows that dividing the analysis into these margins allows a fairly
precise assessment of the contribution of each of the three margins to total dividend amounts,
and reports an elasticity of dividend payments with respect to the dividend tax rate using this

This other-frequency dividends are extremely rare and thus our results are not sensitive to the way we treat
them.

method. Finally, we discuss robustness checks of the causality of the tax cut in subsection 6.

4.1

Aggregate Dividends

Figure 1 plots aggregate regular dividends for the core sample between 1981-Q3 and 2004-Q2
in real 2004 dollars (using the CPI deflator).

Total regular dividends rose from $25 billion

in 2002 to a peak of almost $30 billion at the end of 2003. Note that most of the increase
takes place in the last two quarters of 2003 after the tax cut was signed into law in July,
2003. These are the largest increases during the sample period. If the post-2003 increases in
aggregate dividends are due exclusively to the tax cut, these values suggest that the reform
raised regular aggregate dividends by about 20% in the six quarters after the reform relative
to the level in 2002-Q4 . Unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to determine whether this surge in
aggregate dividends is tax-driven simply by examining changes in mean dividend amounts
paid by publicly traded firms. The econometric problem can be easily illustrated using data
in the years around the tax reform with regressions of the following form:
totdivi,t = α + βref dumi,t + γXi,t + εi,t

(1)

The dependent variable is total dividends paid by firm i in quarter t. The regressor of interest
is the reform dummy: ref dumi,t = 0 in the four quarters before discussion of the reform
(2002-Q1 to 2002-Q4), while ref dumi,t = 1 in the four quarters after enactment (2002-Q1 to
2002-Q4).24

b = 1.58 (s.e. = 0.23).25 In
Without controls (no Xs), the OLS estimate of β

b = 0.62 (s.e. = 0.62), and
contrast, introducing a linear control for after tax earnings gives β
b = −0.06 (s.e. = 0.3).
an additional control for assets changes the estimate to β

This fragility of the estimate of the tax response arises from the extreme concentration of

dividend payments. Figure 1, which also plots regular dividend amounts paid by the top 20
payers in each quarter, shows that the dividends from the top 20 payers account for half of all
dividends paid by all firms in our core sample. The fact that this concentration is the source
b becomes evident when we change the dependent variable in (1) to
of the imprecision in β

dividend yield (total dividends divided by mktcap). In the dividend yield regressions, which

For simplicity, we ignore all other quarters in this exercise. However, inclusion of the full data from 1980-Q1
to 2004-Q2 along with appropriate controls for year trends does not change our conclusions: the point estimates
of β remain statistically insignificant and fragile as soon as controls are introduced.

are simply re-weighted versions of 1) with less weight on large firms, we obtain very stable
estimates of the β coeﬃcient that are statistically significant at the 1% level, irrespective of
controls. Intuitively, mean dividends are driven in large part by very few top payers, creating
a small sample problem that makes statistical inference about the level of aggregate dividends
diﬃcult. In view of this problem, we must turn to other moments of the dividend distribution
to obtain more credible evidence on whether the 2003 tax reform changed corporate payout
behavior.

4.2

Extensive Margin

One straightforward way of reducing the influence of very large payers is to examine a firm’s
decision to initiate or terminate dividend payments rather than looking at the amounts paid.
We first examine changes in initiations and terminations, and then discuss implications for the
overall fraction of dividend payers.
4.2.1

Initiations and Terminations

Figure 2 plots the fraction of initiations and terminations of dividend payments in the constant
number of firms sample.

It is clear that the frequency of initiations rose when the reform

was proposed (2003-Q1) and surged very sharply after it was enacted. Strikingly, the number
of initiations in the three quarters following enactment (2003-Q3, 2003-Q4, and 2004-Q1) are
the three highest among the 80 quarters we consider (see Appendix Table A2 for the full
time series of initiations and other variables of interest). Importantly, there is no sign of a
decline in initiations prior to the reform, suggesting that the sharp surge in initiations reflects
real behavioral responses to an unanticipated change rather than a timing eﬀect due to firms
that were delaying initiations in anticipation of the tax reform.

Meanwhile, the number of

terminations remained very low and, if anything, fell slightly after the reform.
The initiations were widespread across industries and sizes of firms. Table 2 lists the
post-reform initiating firms among the largest 100 firms in our sample (ranked by market
capitalization in 2004-Q2). It shows that large initiators were not concentrated in a single
sector and that the dividend yields in the first year were not trivial, although lower than for
established payers among the top 100.
Table 3 summarizes the magnitude of the eﬀect by comparing dividend initiations during

13

a short window around the reform-period. The pre-reform period is taken as the six quarters
before the reform 2001-Q3 to 2002-Q4 and the post-reform period includes the six post reform
quarters, 2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2.

The first row of Table 3 shows that the average number of

initiations surged from 4.3 per quarter in the pre-reform period to 29 after the reform. The
diﬀerence is highly statistically significant (t-statistic over 10). Of course, the conclusion that
this change was entirely due to the tax reform is predicated on the assumption that no other
unobservable determinant of dividend payments changed contemporaneously.

To examine

the validity of this assumption, we evaluate the robustness of our results to the inclusion of
a rich set of control variables identified as determinants of dividend policy by Lintner (1956)
and summarized more recently in Brav, Graham, Harvey, and Michaely (2002). We run the
following semi-parametric regression specification for initiations:

Initi,t =

T
X
s=1

β s · 1(t = s) + µa ai,t +

8
X
s=0

µs Xi,t−s +

8
X

s
υSs SICi,t
+ εi,t

(2)

s=0

where Initi,t is an initiation dummy which takes value 1 if firm i initiates dividend payments
in quarter t and zero otherwise, 1(t = s) are a full set of quarter dummies. The additional
firm-level covariates are: (1) total current assets, ai,t ; (2) the level and eight lags of quarterly
profits/assets, market capitalization/assets, and cash holdings/assets, (vector Xi,t ); and (3)
s that indicate whether the first digit of firm i’s SIC
First-digit SIC industry dummies, SICi,t

code is s in 2004.
Figure 3 shows that the surge in initiations is extremely robust to adding these controls by
plotting the {β s } coeﬃcients from the regression along with the mean estimates of initiation
rates displayed in Figure 2.26

In addition, the fourth column of Table 3 shows that adding

controls does aﬀect the estimate of the change in dividend initiations between the six-quarter
pre and post reform periods.

The estimates reported in this column are from a regression

specification equivalent to (2) except that the quarter dummies are replaced with a single
post-reform dummy.

Therefore, the surge in initiations cannot be explained by changes in

firms’ balance sheets or investment prospects in the post-reform period.27 We also examine
26

The regression estimates end in 2004-Q1 because Compustat data are not yet available for 2004-Q2.
The results are also robust to trends in mergers and acquisitions that could lead to changes in dividend
policy. Among all initiators in the post reform period, only one firm acquired another company just before
initiating dividends. In addition, controlling for forecasted growth prospects using I/B/E/S data on analysts’
forecasts has no eﬀect on the results.
27

14

whether the innovative “catering theory” of dividend initiations recently proposed by Baker
and Wurgler (2004a,b) may explain our results.

We find that their leading measure of the

markets’ preference for the dividends — the dividend premium, which is defined as the log
diﬀerence in market to book ratios for dividend payers and non-payers — does not predict the
recent surge.28 These results confirm that observable trends are not responsible for the recent
surge in dividend initiations; we defer discussion of bias from unobservable trends to section
4.6.
To contrast our results with Blouin et al. (2004), who found no evidence of increases
along the regular dividend margin, we examine the data at a monthly frequency in the months
around the passage of the reform. Figure 4 plots the number of initiations per month between
2001 and 2004. It is clear that the surge in initiations occurred shortly after the reform was
enacted, during the three month period examined by Blouin et. al.

Hence, although the

addition of three more quarters of data has made the increase in regular dividend payments
after the tax cut clearer, the primary reason that our conclusions diﬀer from those of Blouin
et. al. is the diﬀerence in methodology. Changes in regular dividend amounts are diﬃcult to
detect because of the extreme values problem, but changes in the number of payers are much
easier to see.
4.2.2

Fraction of Payers

We expect the surge in initiations in the post reform period accompanied with no increase in
terminations to lead to an increase in the fraction of firms paying dividends. This is confirmed
in Figure 5 which plots the fraction of dividend payers in the constant number of firms sample
between 1981-Q3 and 2004-Q2.

As discussed in Fama and French (2001), the fraction of

dividend payers has declined steadily over the past two decades, from more than 40% in the
early 1980s to less than 20% in 2000.29 The decline in the fraction of payers stops precisely
28
This is because the dividend premium fell sharply during the dot-com boom and rose back to its original
level during the subsequent dot-com bust. We verify that this temporary fluctuation does not predict the
surge in initiations a year later by regressing the initiation rate on the dividend premium and finding that the
residuals from this regression spike up sharply after the tax reform. Note that we cannot directly include the
dividend premium in the semi-parametric specification in (2) because there is no within-quarter variation in
the dividend premium.
29
DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Skinner (2003) emphasize that while the number of payers among publicly traded
firms has fallen, dividends are not “disappearing” because total aggregate dividends have actually risen (as
shown in Figure 1). This is because the distribution of dividend payments is more concentrated now than it
was in 1980.

15

until the last quarter of 2002, at which point the fraction of payers begins to rise. Figure 5 also
plots the tax preference parameter computed by Poterba (2004), which equals the net return
to investors from a dollar paid in dividends instead of capital gains.30 The largest change in
the tax preference parameter during the sample period occurs at the end of 2003, after which
dividend payments become start to become more common.
As mentioned in Section 2.2, a recent study by Julio and Ikenberry (2004) argues that the
reversal in the fraction of firms paying dividends takes place in late 2000 rather than in 2003,
and hence cannot be attributed to the tax reform. It is therefore critical to understand the
diﬀerence between their findings and ours. We start by reviewing Julio and Ikenberry’s (2004)
evidence. Figure 6, Panel A displays the fraction of regular dividend payers in the core CRSP
sample and for the top 1,000 firms (ranked by market capitalization in each quarter). Indeed,
in these two samples, the reversal takes place in 2001-Q1 and 2000-Q2 respectively.
Figure 6, Panel B displays the time series of the total number of firms as well as the total
number of regular dividend payers in the core CRSP sample. The total number of dividend
payers starts to increase (after a secular decline) only in 2003-Q1, exactly when the tax reform
takes place, and accelerates after enactment. However, the number of firms in the core sample
falls precipitously starting in 2000-Q4 (from 5,306 in 2000-Q3 down to 3,807 in 2004-Q4),
exactly at the time the early reversal takes place for the full sample on Panel A. Only 2% of
the 2,000 firms which exit the core CRSP sample from 2000-Q4 to 2004-Q4 are dividend payers.
Thus, what drives the pre-2003 reversal for the full sample is a fall in the denominator (total
number of firms) and not an increase in the numerator (number of payers). Therefore, this
early reversal cannot be attributed to active behavioral changes in corporate payout policy.
In the case of the top 1,000 firms, the denominator is fixed, and hence the preceding story
clearly cannot explain the early reversal eﬀect for this sample. Figure 7 explores compositional
changes among the top 1,000 firms. It plots, for each quarter, the number of entrants into
the top 1000 which are regular dividend payers and the number of leavers which were regular
dividend payers. The graph shows that there are more dividend payers which leave the top
1,000 group in 1998 and 1999 than dividend payers which enter the sample. In 2000-2002 the
30

Formally, the tax parameter is defined as the dollar weighted average (across individual and institutional
investors) of (1 − τ div )/(1 − τ cg ) where τ div is the marginal tax rate on dividend income and τ cg is the marginal
tax rate on capital gains.

16

situation is reversed: more dividend payers enter the sample than dividend payers leave.31
Through these composition eﬀects, the number of dividend payers among the top 1,000 falls
quickly in 1998 and 1999 and then recovers in 2000-2002, explaining the Julio-Ikenberry reversal
eﬀect for the top 1000 depicted on Figure 6, Panel A.
Figure 8, Panel A makes this point more formally. The first curve depicts the number of
payers among the top 1,000. The “cumulative net payers listed” curve depicts the cumulative
diﬀerence (from 1982-Q1) between the number of regular dividend payers who entered the top
1,000 firms and the number of regular dividend payers who left the top 1,000 firms.32 This
curve captures the change in the number of dividend payers due to changes in the composition
of the top 1,000 firms sample over time.

As described above, the cumulative net payers

listed falls in 1998 and 1999 and then rebounds in 2000-2002. The third “deliberate payers”
curve is simply the diﬀerence between the first two curves.

This series reflects the number

of “deliberate” payers because movements in this series only come from active changes in
dividend policy by firms, given that entry and exits eﬀects have been netted out. The number
of deliberate payers declines slowly until 2002-Q4 and starts increasing exactly in 2003-Q1, at
the time the reform takes place. The number of deliberate payers rises by 10% from 2002-Q4
to 2004-Q2.
Figure 8, Panel B graphs the number of deliberate payers for two other samples of interest:
the core sample (all firms in the CRSP which meet our criteria) and the constant number of
firms sample (the top 3,807 firms in each quarter ranked by market capitalization). For both
of these samples as well, once we control for composition eﬀects, the number of payers starts
to increase in 2003-Q1, when the reform takes place, and the increase accelerates sharply in
2003-Q3, after enactment of the reform. The increase in the fraction of deliberate payers after
the reform is also around 10-12% for these groups.
These results show that the early reversal findings of Julio-Ikenberry are fully explained
by composition eﬀects. Once these eﬀects are controlled for, the reversal takes place exactly
31

Examining the characteristics of the entrants and leavers, we find that the spike in dividend leavers is due to
the surge in the stock prices in 1998 and 1999 of new technology firms that never paid dividends, which entered
the top 1,000 and displaced older, more traditional firms (many of which paid dividends). Symmetrically, the
spike in entrants is due to technology stock market crash in 2000-2002 during which new technology firms
(predominantly less than 3 years old and with SIC 7370) are displaced by the original, older firms.
32
This graph is equal to the integral of the diﬀerence between the two graphs (dividend payers entering and
dividend payers leaving) depicted on Figure 7.

17

after the 2003 reform is implemented, implying that deliberate changes in corporate payout
behavior began only after the tax reform.33 Notably, for our constant number of firms sample
(the top 3,807 firms in each quarter), composition eﬀects cancel out and the timing and size of
the surge in the number of payers and deliberate payers are almost identical.34 This justifies
our focus on this group as a simple but valid way to control for entry and exit eﬀects.

4.3

Intensive Margin

Given the extreme values problem that plagues the analysis of levels, we begin our study of the
intensive margin by examining the eﬀect of the tax cut on the probability that a firm increases
or decreases dividend payments by more than 20% in nominal terms.35 In order to avoid
double counting, initiations (terminations) are not counted as dividend increases (decreases).
The appendix gives the exact definition of increases and decreases we use.
Figure 9, Panel A, plots the fraction of firms in the constant number of firms sample that
increased or decreased dividends by 20% or more along the intensive margin. There is a sharp
surge in the number of firms which increase dividends when the tax cut is enacted in 2003-Q3.
The number of these large intensive margin increases jumped from 19 in the pre-reform period
(2001-Q3 to 2002-Q4) to 50 per quarter in the post-reform period (2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2), as
shown in Table 3. Analysis of the data at a monthly frequency (not reported) shows that the
pattern of dividend increases coincides very closely with the pattern of dividend initiations.
In particular, it began in the three month period immediately after the reform examined by
Blouin et. al., and remains strong through the end of the sample period.

Meanwhile, the

frequency of dividend decreases remained small and essentially unchanged after the tax cut.
Figure 9, Panel B shows that controlling for observable variables from Compustat does not
modify our conclusion that this increase was tax-driven. The coeﬃcients plotted in this Figure
33
An alternative way of purging composition bias is to control for firm fixed eﬀects. Reassuringly, this
method also yields similar results (the increase in the fraction of payers coincides precisely with the reform).
We focus on the “deliberate payers” approach here primarily because it is much more parsimonious, giving a
simple illustration of why sample composition bias leads to a pre-tax reversal.
34
This can be seen formally in appendix Table A2 which displays the key quarterly series for the constant
number of firms sample, including the number of dividend payers among entrants and leavers.
35
Other cutoﬀs, such as 0%, 10%, or 50% also yield similar results. We focus on the 20% here cutoﬀ because
these changes are both relatively frequent and suﬃciently large that they are likely to signal a substantial
shift in a corporation’s distribution policy. Note that Julio and Ikenberry (2004) argue that the number of
0% increases started to rise in 2002, but this conclusion is fully driven by the functional form of their data
smoothing algorithm. Semi-parametric analysis shows that the surge in increases begins only after the reform
was enacted.

18

are obtained by running a regression analogous to (2) with an intensive increase dummy as
the dependent variable It should be noted, however, that the evidence of a tax eﬀect on the
intensive margin is weaker than that for initiations because there were periods in the 1980s
where the fraction of firms increasing dividend payments was higher than in the post-reform
period. Table 3 shows that the change pre-post reform of intensive increases is also robust to
adding controls.
Figure 10 gives a more complete view of the changes in dividend behavior on the intensive
margin by displaying various percentiles of the dividend distribution among the top 3,807 firms
(including the zeros).

The level of each percentile has been normalized to one in 1998-Q1.

There is clear evidence of a sharp increase in dividends for all percentiles below the percentile
99.5. The noise in the 99.5 percentile is so large that it is impossible to determine whether the
changes after the reform are anything more than a random fluctuation. But the 99.5 percentile
is very important for amounts, given the concentration of dividend payments: About half of
all dividends are paid out by the top 0.5% dividend payers (the top 19 payers in our constant
number of firms sample). The fact that the amounts are driven to a significant extent by a few
big payers whose aggregate dividend payments fluctuate sharply over time explains why it is so
diﬃcult to obtain reliable estimates of the eﬀect of taxes on mean levels. It also underscores
the importance of examining other, more stable moments of the dividend distribution.

4.4

Special Dividends

We now turn to special, one-time dividend distributions.
of special dividends paid out.

Figure 1 plots the total amounts

Special dividend amounts increased after enactment of the

2003 reform but there are other periods (such as the late 1980s) when special dividends were
substantially higher. Indeed, TRA-86 does appear to have generated a temporary surge in the
total amount of special dividends in the late 1980s much larger (and concentrated among very
few firms) than after the 2003 tax reform.36 Figure 11 plots the fraction of special dividend
36
It is striking that TRA-86, a permanent tax change, created only a short-term response along the special
margin, while the 2003 tax change, whose duration remains somewhat uncertain, has generated substantial
increases in regular dividends that are likely to be long-term. Candidate explanations for the diﬀerent responses
include: (1) TRA-86 changed the tax rate on interest and dividend income simultaneously, perhaps inducing
broader shifts in capital structure toward debt that necessitated large one-time distributions but made increased
regular dividends undesirable; (2) Average cash holdings were unusually high before the 2003 reform relative
to prior years, giving firms the resources necessary to raise dividends; (3) Highly publicized cases of corporate
mismanagement such as Enron may have raised the signal value of dividends, giving firms a strong reason to
raise dividends as soon as the cost of doing so was lowered. Further research is required to determine which of

19

payers in the constant number of firms sample. There is a clear surge in the fraction of special
payers immediately after the reform, and this change is robust to the inclusion of controls as
above. As shown in Table 3, an average of 18 firms per quarter paid special dividends after
the reform, significantly greater than the average of 7 in the six quarters before. However,
there are an average of 40 special dividend payments per quarter in the entire sample between
1981 and 2003. Hence, while the frequency of special payments rose after the reform relative
to the recent past, it does not exceed the level of special payments in earlier periods such as
the late 1980s and early 1990s.

4.5

Changes in Amounts and Elasticity Estimates

How much did each of the three margins discussed above contribute to the surge in aggregate
dividends? To obtain a statistically precise answer to this question, we focus on deliberate
changes in dividend amounts along each margin in the constant number of firms sample, and
exclude firms who acquired another company in the previous quarter in order to avoid imputing
dividend increases to the acquisition of a dividend paying company.
Figure 12A depicts the amounts (in real 2004 dollars) of regular dividends initiated in each
quarter from 1990-Q1 to 2004-Q2.37 The amounts raised from dividend initiations surged
sharply after the reform, from $13 million per quarter in the pre-reform period to an average
of $205 million per quarter after the reform (see Table 3). Strikingly, the 6 largest initiation
amounts since 1990 take place exactly in the last 6 post reform quarters. This diﬀerence is
highly significant and robust to introducing the rich set of controls used in (2), as shown in
Table 3. Note that there is no dip in the amount of dividends from initiations prior to the
reform, suggesting that our estimates are unlikely to be biased by re-timing eﬀects.
Figure 12A also depicts the change in regular intensive dividends for firms previously paying
regular dividends. The change is estimated as the current payment less the previous regular
payment (initiations and terminations are excluded).

If the firm did not exist in the prior

period, or drops out of the sample, the change is defined as 0. Defining changes in this way is
analogous to controlling for sample composition, because the change in the level of dividends
due to entry and exit eﬀects is ignored. The series of aggregate changes along the intensive
these explanations is most relevant.
37
Annual dividends are divided by four and semi-annual dividends divided by two in order to normalize
changes at the quarterly level.

20

margin also displays a sharp increase in levels in the 6 quarters following the reform: 4 of the 5
largest intensive increases took place in the 6 post reform quarters. Table 3 shows that intensive
changes surged from $130 million per quarter on average before the reform to $740 million
after. As with the extensive margin, the change does not reflect intertemporal substitution of
dividend payments, since the series is flat in the years preceding the reform. The intensive
margin change is also statistically significant and robust to introducing controls.38

It follows

that once entry, exit and merging eﬀects are controlled for, we can obtain relatively precise
estimates of the changes in the growth rate of dividend amounts along both the intensive and
extensive margin.39
Panel B depicts the cumulated (from 1990-Q1) amounts of regular dividend initiations
(integral of the initiation graph in Panel A) and the amounts of special dividends on the
left scale.

Cumulated amounts (from 1990-Q1) of regular dividend intensive changes are

shown on the right scale (integral of the change in intensive margin dividends in Panel A).
This figure shows that the extensive margin has contributed about $1.2 billion to aggregate
quarterly dividends since the reform.40 Total cumulated dividends from the intensive margin
also surged sharply between 2002-Q4 and 2004-Q2. The graph displays a clear break in the
slope in the pre and post reform periods (the quarterly slopes are given by the levels in Panel
A). This figure and Table 3 show that by 2004-Q2, six quarters after the reform, $3.6 billion
in dividends have been raised from the intensive margin (subtracting out the trend in the
previous years).
Finally, special dividend payments are on average $0.6 billion per quarter higher in the
post-reform quarters relative to the six pre-reform quarters (see Table 3).

However, this

increase is driven by a very small set of firms, as noted by Blouin et. al. (2004). More than
80% of the increase is accounted for by eight payers who made special dividend payments in
excess of $100 million in one of the quarters after the reform was enacted.41 Hence, if regular
38
The t-statistic for the intensive change is substantially lower than for the initiation amount, because dividend
changes along the intensive margin are much more concentrated than along the extensive margin.
39
It is important to distinguish changes in levels from changes in the growth rate. As noted above, we cannot
directly obtain reliable estimates of the change in the level of dividends induced by the reform. However, as
Figure 12 shows, the eﬀect of the tax reform on the growth rate of dividends is clear once compositional biases
are eliminated. The importance of detrending the data is intuitive given that corporations take time to adjust
their dividend policies after the change in tax regime.
40
Microsoft, the largest initiator, accounted for about 20% of the total eﬀect but the rest of initiations are
not extremely concentrated, explaining the precision on the estimate in Table 3.
41
More than 30% of the increase is driven by telecommunications giant Southwestern Bell Corporation, which

21

dividend payments remain as persistent as they have historically, special dividend payments
are likely to be a short-term fluctuation in the time series relative to the change in regular
dividend amounts induced by the 2003 tax reform.42
The changes along the extensive and intensive margins add up to a total regular dividends
increase of $4.8 billion on average by 2004-Q2 (relative to the pre-reform trend). Starting
from a base of approximately $25 billion in 2002-Q4, total regular dividends have therefore
risen by roughly 20% for our sample of non-financial, non-utility publicly traded firms. Note
that the short-run increase in total dividends exceeds 20% because of the surge in special,
one-time distributions. According to calculations by Poterba (2004), the average tax rate on
dividends (including both taxable and non-taxable dividends distributed directly or indirectly
to individuals) fell from 29% to 17%, a 40% reduction. Therefore, the implied elasticity of
regular dividend amounts with respect to the dividend tax rate is roughly -0.5 as of 2004-Q2,
only one and a half years after the reform.43 This elasticity implies that the tax revenue from
dividend taxation that was lost because of the tax cut is only 50% of the revenue loss assuming
no behavioral response.44
It is interesting to note that the response to the tax change is far more rapid than that
predicted by “old view” time series estimates, which imply a slow adjustment process (Poterba
2004). Since firms have chosen to increase regular (rather than special) dividend payments,
which historically are rarely cut and extremely persistent, this sharp change is likely to reflect
a long-term shift in payout policies that may grow even larger over time as the adjustment
process continues.

4.6

Robustness Checks

Our identification strategy relies on the assumption that no other event apart from the tax cut
generated a surge in dividend payments exactly in 2003. One possible alternative story is the
exposition of several corporate scandals in 2001-2003.

These scandals originated primarily

made two special dividend payments of approximately $335 million each in 2003-Q3 and 2003-Q4.
42
Of course, the $32 billion special dividend from Microsoft in 2004-Q4 will clearly create a short-lived blip
of unprecedented magnitude in the special dividend series.
43
Of course, the long-run response could be even larger, given that the adjustment process may not be
complete.
44
However, it is possible that the increase of dividends paid out reduces other forms of taxable income such
as realized capital gains from share repurchases. It is critical to assess the eﬀect of the tax change on total tax
revenue (and not only revenue from taxing dividends) in order to assess the deadweight burden of taxation (see
Gordon, Kalambokidis, and Slemrod, 2003 and Saez, 2004 for a recent exposition of this point).

22

from serious accounting fraud among well known corporations such as Xerox, Enron, and
WorldCom, and may have created distrust among shareholders about management of large
U.S. corporations in general.

Shareholders may have therefore pressured management to

increase dividends even in the absence of the tax cut. The timing of the surge in initiations
suggests that the corporate scandals were not responsible for the surge in dividends because
they were first publicized much before 2003-Q2.45 Nonetheless, we conduct three additional
empirical tests to rule out this and other alternative stories about changes in unobservables.
First, and most important, we exploit the fact that only dividend income distributed to
individuals through non-tax-favored accounts was aﬀected by the reform. For instance, dividend income earned through pension funds was not aﬀected by the tax change. Consequently,
if the tax cut was responsible for the surge in aggregate dividends, we would not expect to see a
response among firms who are controlled by such non-aﬀected entities. To test this hypothesis,
we first isolate a subset of institutional investors that are definitely not aﬀected by the reform
— pension funds, insurance companies, nonprofit organizations, non financial corporations, and
government agencies — in the Thomson financial institutional ownership database.46 We then
divide the sample of firms that are alive in our core sample in all quarters between 1998-Q1
and 2004-Q2 into two groups.47 The “control” group consists of firm-quarter pairs where the
largest institutional owner is a non-aﬀected entity.48 The “treatment” group includes all other
firm-quarter pairs.
Table 4 reports the annual initiation rates among nonpayers in these two groups of firms in
the pre-reform period (1998-Q1 to 2002-Q4) and the post-reform period (2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2).
The initiation rate was very similar for both groups before the reform. However, the initiation
45
Enron’s scandal appeared in October 2001, WorldCom’s in March 2002, and Tyco’s in May 2002. While it
is unlikely that these scandals were solely reponsible for the surge in dividends, it is possible that they magnified
the extent of the response to the tax cut.
46
Most large institutional shareholders (e.g., Fidelity) are partly aﬀected by the reform, because they manage
funds on behalf of taxable individuals as well as non-taxable clients such as individual retirement accounts,
pensions, and nonprofits.
47
Details about the definition of this sample and more general breakdowns by size of institutional ownership
are given in section 5.2 below.
48
Previous papers such as Perez-Gonzalez (2003) and Blouin et. al. (2004) have used companies owned
by large institutional shareholders as control groups, without distinguishing non-taxable and partly taxable
institutions as we do here. We find that only 15% of institutional owners (dollar weighted) are fully nontaxable. This point is particularly important because our analysis in Section 5 shows that firms with larger
institutional ownership are much more responsive to the reform, implying that many institutions behave in the
interests of their individual taxable clients. Therefore, raw institutional ownership is clearly not a valid proxy
for nontaxable status when analyzing the eﬀects of taxes on corporate behavior.

23

rate surged by a factor of 5 after the reform for the treatment group, while remaining virtually
constant for the control group. As a result, the post-reform initiation rates are significantly
diﬀerent across the two groups, and the diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimate of the causal eﬀect
of the tax cut is also highly statistically significant.

These estimates are fully robust to

a regression with controls for assets, market capitalization, profits, and industry codes, and
interactions of these controls with a tax reform dummy, as in equation (3) below (with a tstatistic of 4 for the diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences).

In addition, the results cannot be explained

away by changing tax clienteles of shareholders: if we form the treatment and control groups
using institutional ownership data from one or two quarters prior to the current quarter, the
results remain very similar.49 The lack of change in the payout behavior of firms controlled
by non-aﬀected entities during the reform strongly suggests that the recent surge in dividend
payments was entirely tax-driven, since there is no other obvious reason that dividend payout
patterns should have diverged across these two groups at exactly the time of the reform.
Second, we use Compustat data for Canadian corporations to perform a placebo test.
Canadian corporations are not aﬀected by the tax cut unless they are owned by U.S. individuals. Although U.S. ownership of Canadian corporations is not trivial, it is likely to be
small relative to U.S. ownership of U.S. corporations.50 Figure 13 plots the fraction of U.S.
and Canadian firms initiating dividends in each quarter from 1994-Q1 to 2004-Q1. In sharp
contrast to the United States, Canadian firms do not display a surge in dividend initiations
around the 2003 reform. Therefore, if unobservable shocks such as corporate scandals aﬀected
corporate behavior in Canada as in the U.S., the evidence from Figure 13 suggests that the
surge in dividends in the U.S. was indeed tax driven.
Finally, we also examine the press releases of the firms that initiated dividends after the
reform was enacted and find that more than a quarter of the firms explicitly cite the tax cut as
one of their motives for initiating dividends in their first announcement. This figure is likely
49
Changing clienteles could potentially pose a problem because taxable institutional holders might start to
purchase more shares of companies that initiated dividends after the reform because of the lower tax rate. In
this case, we might find a diﬀerence in the initiations rates across our treatment and control groups even if
corporate behavior was unchanged by the tax cut. The fact that pre-initiation institutional ownership predicts
initiation rates in the same way rules out this hypothesis.
50
Moreover, as we show in section 5 below, the tax response in the U.S. is confined primarily to firms with
high executive share ownership, whose personal tax incentives changed because of the reform. Since Canadian
corporations are unlikely to have top executives who are U.S. residents, we would not expect to see a tax
response among these firms even if they have many diﬀuse U.S. based shareholders.

24

to greatly understate the actual number of tax-motivated dividend changes because firms have
strong incentives to avoid attributing their dividend decision to the tax cut, instead claiming
that they are raising dividends given signs of strong future earnings.51

5

Which Firms Responded to the Tax Change?

In this section, we document two important forms of heterogeneity in the dividend response
that shed light on the mechanism of the tax response.

First, we show that the response

is heavily influenced by agents’ incentives and powerful principals’ interests.

On the agent

side, firms with high executive share ownership and low executive stock-options holding were
most likely to initiate dividend payments.

On the principal side, firms with large share

ownership among independent directors and high taxable institutional ownership responded
more strongly to the tax cut. When neither the high level agents nor principals have strong
incentives to push for a dividend policy change, the response to the tax cut is virtually zero.
Hence, existing “old view” and “new view” models of corporate taxation in the public finance
literature appear to miss a central determinant of the behavioral response to taxation by
abstracting from agency problems.
Second, we provide some suggestive evidence about the eﬃciency eﬀects of the tax cut.
Of course, the fact that the tax cut caused a sharp surge in dividend payments does not itself
imply that the eﬃciency of capital allocation was improved. The ideal way to estimate the
eﬃciency eﬀects of the tax cut would be to directly identify its eﬀects on investment and
profits.

Unfortunately, this approach is infeasible because both investment and profits are

very volatile, making it diﬃcult to detect whether changes in behavior along those margins
are associated with the tax cut. We provide indirect evidence of the improvement in capital
allocation by showing that firms with high forecasted earnings growth did not respond to the
tax cut. This suggests that funds might have been channelled away from lower growth firms
toward those with better investment opportunities through external capital markets.
In addition to these cuts, we also briefly discuss heterogeneity along a large set of other
dimensions, such as profits, assets, cash holdings, age, and debt levels.
51

Interestingly, 13% of nonpaying companies surveyed in Brav et al. (2004) said that they would initiate
dividend payments following the tax cut, a number consistent with our finding that up to 2004-Q2, about 10%
of nonpaying firms have initiated dividends.

25

5.1

Self-interested agents: Executive share and stock-option ownership

A large literature in corporate finance has focused on the tension between principals’ (shareholders) objectives and agents’ (executives) interests. One hypothesis that has received substantial attention is that high degrees of pay-for-performance sensitivity, e.g. from large executive stock and options holdings, can have significant eﬀects on executives’ decisions about
corporate policy.

In this subsection, we analyze the impact of executive share and options

holdings on the payout response to the tax cut.
We test for such an association without imposing strong functional form assumptions on
the data, since the relevant eﬀects could be non-linear, and outliers could be very influential.
We use a semi-parametric strategy for classifying firms into quintiles based on executive share
and option ownership, and compare the size of the dividend response across the quintiles. As
in the preceding analysis of the overall dividend response, we must be careful to address biases
that arise from changing sample composition during the dot-com boom and bust. Therefore,
in this and all subsequent heterogeneity analyzes, we restrict attention to the set of 2,551 firms
in the core sample that are alive between 1998-Q1 and 2004-Q2.52
Our primary data source for the share ownership and options data is ExecuComp. The
shortcoming of ExecuComp data is that it covers only about one-third of the companies listed
in CRSP, and these companies are not a random subsample of the CRSP firms. In particular,
ExecuComp tends to cover only larger firms, which have a higher propensity to pay dividends
and diﬀer from uncovered firms along many other dimensions (e.g. large shareholder ownership) as well. To improve the precision of our estimates and obtain results that apply to
the full universe of publicly traded firms, we expanded our data on share ownership by handcollecting data for an additional 347 firms from SEC proxy filings. The 347 firms include all
the firms that initiated dividends, which are of greatest interest for the present study, as well
as an additional 147 firms that constitute a 10% random sample of the non-Execucomp firms
that did not initiate dividends within our 1998-2004Q2 sample frame.

Sampling probabil-

ity weights are used to account for the under-representation of non-Execucomp non-initiating
firms. The construction of the random sample is described in detail in the appendix.
52
We chose a relatively long pre-reform time frame (1998-2003) in order to make the total number of dividend
initiations in the pre-reform period similar to that in the post-reform period. We focus primarily on heterogeneity
in dividend initiations here. Results for dividend increases are generally quite similar.

26

We begin by analyzing the relationship between executive shareownership and dividend
initiations. An executive who holds a large stake in his company experiences a large change
in his personal tax burden from a dividend payment, since a considerable fraction of the total
dividend payout would accrue to the executive himself.53 At the other extreme, the personal
tax incentives of an executive who owns no shares are unchanged by the 2003 reform.

To

analyze whether the personal tax burden of executives has an impact on the tax response of
corporations, we classify firms into five quintiles of executive share ownership as follows. We
first identify the largest shareholder among the company’s executives in a given year. We then
define a stable set of quintiles using the average fraction of shares held by the largest executive
shareholder during our sample frame if the firm does not initiate dividends during this period,
and using share ownership as the time of initiation if the firm does initiate dividends. This
procedure ensures that firms do not move across quintiles over time. The advantage of having a
stable set of firms in each quintile is that it eliminates the bias that can arise if the distribution
of executive share ownership changes in a manner that is correlated with dividend behavior.
Figure 14A shows the frequency of initiations among non-payers across the five quintiles
of executive share ownership in the pre- and post-reform periods. The pre-reform period is
defined as 1998-Q1 to 2002-Q4 and the post-reform period is 2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2. Initiations
surged much more sharply in firms where at least one executive owned a substantial fraction
of the company’s shares.54 The post-reform annual initiation rate among firms in the highest
quintile of executive share ownership is 9.5%, in contrast with 3.5% in the lowest quintile. The
diﬀerence between the change in the initiation rate in the fifth quintile and the first quintile is
statistically significant with a p-value of 0.03 (see Appendix Table A3 for means and standard
errors for each quintile, as well as the diﬀerence between the change in initiation rates between
the first and fifth quintiles). The pattern for dividend increases (not reported) is also quite
similar.55
53
It can be diﬃcult for top executives in publicly traded firms to obtain cash by selling shares because share
sales must be publicly reported and are likely to be interpreted as a negative signal by the market. Previous
studies have found mixed results on the correlation between large executive ownership and dividend payments.
Rozeﬀ (1982) found no correlation, but a recent study by Fenn and Liang (2001) found a positive correlation.
Those studies, however, do not use tax changes to identify this link.
54
Both the dollar amount of shares held by the largest executive shareholder and the fraction of shares held
are positively associated with the size of the tax response. The share holdings of all other executives besides
the largest executive shareholder are unrelated to the tax response.
55
In independent work, Nam, Wang, and Zhang (2004) and Brown, Liang, and Weisbenner (in progress),
have also identified a relationship between executive ownership and dividend increases after the tax cut using

27

In order to control for other covariates that may also influence the dividend response to
the tax cut, we run a regression analogous to (2), linearly interacting each of the covariates
and the five quintile dummies of interest with a tax reform dummy, dT .56

(3)

T =0 j=1

Here T = 0 denotes the pre-reform period and T = 1 denotes the post-reform period.
The set of covariates X consists of the following variables, which are averaged over the 19982004Q2 sample frame: assets, cash/assets, debt/assets, profits/assets, mktcap/assets, percent
of shares held by institutions, largest executive unexercisable option holding as a percentage
of total shares outstanding, and largest executive exercisable option holding as a percentage of
total shares outstanding. In this regression, the {β 1,j }5j=1 coeﬃcients reveal the heterogeneity
in the dividend response along the executive share ownership margin, conditioning on the
possible heterogeneity of responses along all the other observable margins.

The estimates

of the {β 1,j }5j=1 coeﬃcients are reported in Appendix Table A4, along with the p-values and
diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence estimates of the change in initiation rates between the first and fifth
quintiles. The pattern and statistical significance of the regression coeﬃcients is essentially
unaﬀected by the inclusion of covariates, suggesting that executive share ownership is indeed
causally associated with the dividend response to the tax cut.
Next, we examine the eﬀect of unexercisable stock-options holdings by top executives on
the tax response. Lambert, Lanen, and Larker (1989) noted that executives with large options
holdings are hurt by dividend payments, because the strike prices of their options are typically
not adjusted for dividends.57 By paying money out of the firm and thereby reducing the
price of the shares outstanding, executives make their unexercised options less valuable. To
examine whether these incentives matter for the tax response, we follow the same methodology
ExecuComp data. Our hand-collected data permits a more precise characterization of the non-linear eﬀect
of executive share ownership on the tax response, and allows us to analyze the interaction between agent and
principal incentives, as discussed in section 5.3.
56
Less parametric regressions with quintile dummies for all the covariates generally yield the same pattern
of coeﬃcients; however, the large number of coeﬃcients causes the standard errors to rise relative to our more
parsimonious linear specification for controls.
57
More recently, Fenn and Liang (2001) and Weisbenner (2000) have shown that there is a negative relation
between the number of stock options owned by management and dividend payments and a positive relation
between options and share repurchases. This suggests that firms where top executives own many stock options
are substituting dividends for share repurchases. Those studies, however, do not use tax changes to identify
those links.

28

as above and classify firms into five quintiles based on the unexercisable options holdings (as
a fraction of total shares outstanding) of the executive who owns the largest number of such
options.
Figure 14B shows that firms where one or more executives had a large unexercisable option
holding were significantly less likely to respond to the tax cut.

The annual initiation rate

was 8.4% among firms whose executives were in the lowest quintile of options holdings, in
contrast with 4% in the highest quintile. These diﬀerences are statistically significant with
a p-value of 0.03 (Table A3).

The pattern of the initiation rates is also robust to controls

based on a regression specification analogous to (3) that substitutes maximum executive share
ownership for unexercisable options ownership in the set of controls X (Table A4). Consistent
with the hypothesis that it is mainly unexercised option holdings that make dividend payments
unattractive, we find a much weaker and less robust relationship between executives’ exercisable
options holdings and the tax response (see Tables A3 and A4).
Table 5a illustrates the interaction between executive incentives through share and option
holdings by cross-tabulating the post-reform initiation rate by thirds of share ownership and
unexercisable options ownership. The importance of executive incentives is striking. Only
1.6% of the firms in the lowest third of share ownership and highest third of option ownership
initiated dividends in the six quarters after the reform.

In contrast, 11.4% of the firms

at the other extreme — highest third of share ownership and lowest third of options — have
initiated dividend payments since that point. Despite the fact that the variation in share
and options holdings is purely cross-sectional, it is diﬃcult to formulate a non-agency story
that would explain the share ownership, unexercisable options, and exercisable options results
simultaneously. In short, there is strong evidence that executives behave in a self-interested
(although not necessarily ineﬃcient) manner when making decisions about corporate payout
policy for their shareholders.58
58
While the evidence of self-interested behavior is consistent with the view that corporations cannot be
expected to maximize shareholder value, it does not necessarily imply that there is an ineﬃciency that ought to
be corrected. Since executives’ compensation and decision power is contracted upon with shareholders ex-ante,
it is conceivable that such self-serving behavior emerges as the eﬃcient ex-post outcome of an optimal contract
that is well understood by all parties.

29

5.2

Powerful principals: Institutional shareholders and directors

We now turn to the other side of the principal-agent relationship, and examine the eﬀect of
having powerful principals on the response to the tax cut. An extensive literature in corporate
finance has found an association between the presence of large individual and institutional
shareholders and the degree to which firms behave in value-maximizing fashion (see Shleifer
and Vishny (1997) for a review). To analyze the impact of these variables on the dividend
response, we quantify the power of principals in two ways: the percent of shares controlled
by institutions (e.g. mutual funds, trusts, banks, etc.) and whether there is at least one
independent (non-oﬃcer) director with large share holdings (over 5% of shares).
We obtain data on institutional ownership from Thompson Financial’s Institutional Ownership database, which covers nearly 90% of the firms in our sample. Our primary data source
for the number of large shareholders is a dataset compiled by Dlugosz et. al. (2004) which
corrects a series of mistakes in Compact-Disclosure data on large shareholders compiled from
firms’ SEC filings. Since this dataset covers only the firms tracked by the Investor Responsibility Research Center (roughly the 1,500 largest companies in the U.S.), we augment this
dataset by hand-collecting information from proxy statements for an additional set of firms.
We follow the same methodology as for the executive share ownership data, collecting data
for all the firms that initiated dividend payments and a 10% random sample of non-IRRC,
non-initiating firms.

With appropriate sampling probability weights, these additional data

allow us to obtain estimates for the full universe of publicly traded firms in CRSP.
We begin by analyzing the impact of institutional ownership on the tax response. We
classify firms into five quintiles based on the average fraction of shares held by institutions
over the sample frame. Figure 15A shows that among firms previously not paying dividends,
those with higher institutional ownership are much more likely to begin paying after the
reform.

The statistical significance and robustness of this conclusion to the usual set of

controls (excluding institutional share ownership) used in (3) are again confirmed in Tables
A3 and A4.

Consistent with our results on taxable and non-taxable institutional holdings

reported in section 4.6, there is no association between the fraction shares held by non-taxable
institutions and the magnitude of the tax response (not reported). Only the fraction held by
partially or fully taxable institutional owners matters. These findings suggest that partially

30

taxable institutional owners increase their demand for dividends from the corporations in
which they invest after the tax reform, and that corporations respond to these demands,
perhaps because many institutions play an active role in influencing corporate boards.

In

addition, the fact that only taxable institutions induce a response is consistent with related
studies in the corporate finance literature (reviewed in Shleifer and Vishny, 1997) showing that
powerful principals are themselves self-interested, potentially acting at the expense of more
diﬀuse minority shareholders who are less influential.
We now turn to the analysis of the impact of large-shareholding independent directors on
the tax response. We classify firms into two categories: those who never had an independent
large-shareholding director during the sample period, and those with at least one such director.
We also cut the data into two groups by institutional ownership (below or above the sample
median). Figure 15B shows that for firms with low institutional ownership, the presence of
a large-shareholding independent director significantly increases the probability of initiating
dividends.
controls.

Table A3 shows that the director eﬀect is significant at the 5% level without
Table A4 shows that the magnitude of the director eﬀect is larger with controls,

but the standard errors rise and make the diﬀerence marginally significant (p-value = 0.097).
In contrast with these results, for firms with high institutional ownership, the presence of
an independent director has no eﬀect (right side of Figure 15B). Hence, quite intuitively,
powerful principals appear to substitute for each other: the presence of one powerful principal
with strong incentives to demand dividends reduces the marginal impact of other powerful
principals with similar interests.
Unlike directors and institutions, large “outside” (non-director) individual shareholders,
have no eﬀect on the response to the tax cut, along either the extensive or intensive margins
(see Tables A3 and A4). The most likely reason for this is that dividend policy is set exclusively
by the board of directors and is not typically voted upon by shareholders. Hence, large external
individual shareholders may have less direct influence over the short-run payout decisions of
corporations.
Table 5b illustrates the interaction between executive incentives and the power of principals.
It cross-tabulates three groups ranked by top executive share ownership by three groups ranked
by total institutional ownership.

This table shows that executive incentives and powerful

principals are also to some extent substitutes: Firms with neither executive incentives nor
31

powerful principals hardly respond to the tax change, while firms with one of the two elements
are 6-10 times more likely to initiate dividends in response to the tax cut.

These findings

show that principal-agent issues play a first-order role in determining behavioral responses to
taxation, and should be included explicitly in models of optimal dividend taxation.

5.3

Capital allocation eﬃciency: Forecasted earnings growth

We now examine whether there is evidence of an eﬃciency improvement in capital allocation
associated with the 2003 tax reform. To do so, we test for an association between forecasted
growth prospects and the dividend response to the tax cut.

We define forecasted growth

prospects using I/B/E/S data on analysts’ earnings forecasts as follows. We first compute the
expected change in earnings per share as the mean earnings per share forecast for a two year
forecast period minus the actual earnings per share in the current year.

We then multiply

this figure by the total number of shares outstanding and divide by total assets to arrive at a
normalized measure of earnings growth per dollar of assets.59 Finally, we define five quintiles
of earnings growth over the sample of firm-quarter pairs where the firm was not previously a
dividend payer (and is therefore a candidate to initiate dividend payments).
Figure 16 shows the frequency of initiations among non-payers across the five quintiles
of forecasted earnings growth in the pre- and post-reform periods.

The eﬀect of forecasted

growth appears to be slightly non-linear, consistent with the hypothesis that firms that have
less need for cash respond more to the tax cut. Some of the firms in quintile 1 are in distress,
as their earnings are expected to fall sharply, so they respond less on average than those in
quintile 2, who have more moderate earnings forecasts. Firms with the best growth prospects
(quintile 5) responded very little to the tax cut. As shown in Table A3, the diﬀerence between
the fifth quintile and second quintile is highly statistically significant. The general pattern of
these estimates is robust to the inclusion of our standard set of covariates, as shown in Table
A4, although the magnitudes of the diﬀerences are slightly attenuated and the standard errors
are somewhat larger.60
59

We obtain similar results when defining earnings growth as a simple percentage change in EPS; the advantage of normalizing by assets is that it permits us to include the many firms that have negative forecasted or
current EPS.
60
The fact that the inclusion of controls slightly weakens the eﬀect of earnings growth on initiation rates is
not surprising in view of the fact that many of our controls are highly correlated with future earnings growth
(e.g. mktcap/assets, profits/assets).

32

These results provide suggestive evidence that the dividend tax cut made the capital market
reshuﬄe funds out of lower growth firms.61

A large set of studies have argued that free

cash flow within such firms is not always put toward value-maximizing ventures because of
principal-agent problems (see e.g., Jensen 1986, Rajan, Servaes, and Zingales 2000, Scharfstein
and Stein 2000). Since the reduction in dividend taxes reduced executives’ incentives to hoard
earnings, the funds released from these lower-growth firms might have been redirected through
the external capital market toward other ventures with equal or greater expected value.62
These findings are a first step toward understanding the welfare implications of dividend
taxation. If the dividend tax cut had not induced payouts from lower-growth firms, it would
be hard to imagine that it yielded real gains in economic eﬃciency. The results therefore call
for further research on investment behavior to quantify the welfare benefits of the tax cut, as
we discuss in the conclusion.

5.4

Other Dimensions

We have also examined the heterogeneity of the tax response along several other dimensions,
following a quintile-classification and regression methodology analogous to that above. Some
of these results are summarized in Appendix Tables A3 and A4. Unsurprisingly, we find that
the tax response was stronger among firms that are in healthy, stable financial condition, i.e.,
those with higher levels of profits and assets and lower levels of debt. More interestingly, cash
holdings are unrelated to the dividend response. This contradicts the “new view” prediction
that firms with high levels of cash holdings, who presumably finance investment out of retained
earnings, should not have changed payout policies after the tax cut.

6

Substitution with Share Repurchases

As noted in Section 2.1, it is possible for companies to leave total payout unchanged while
raising dividends by reducing their share repurchases. If the tax cut simply induced firms to
substitute share repurchases by dividends without raising total payout, it would be unlikely
that the tax cut had large eﬃciency benefits because the total amount of capital recirculation
61

We show in section 6 that the dividend response appears to reflect an increase in total payout, not just
substitution between share repurchases and dividends.
62
We cannot directly document this transfer because cash holdings fluctuate tremendously over time, making
it impossible to determine whether the high growth firms obtained more funds after the reform.

33

would remain unchanged. It is therefore very important to understand the degree to which
share repurchases were crowded out by increased dividend payments.
Unfortunately, this exercise is again very diﬃcult because of the volatility of share repurchases over time.

Figure 17 illustrates the problem.

Panel A depicts aggregate share

repurchases (along with aggregate regular dividend payments) by firms in the core sample
which have share repurchase information from Compustat from 1984-Q1 to 2004-Q1 (the most
recent quarter for which Compustat data are available).

The figure shows that share re-

purchases have exceeded dividend payments since 1997, and that they vary much more from
quarter to quarter than dividends.

This greater time variability makes it much harder to

estimate the eﬀects of the 2003 reform on share repurchases.63 The figure shows that share
repurchases have increased substantially over the last 3 quarters but, in view of the historical
record, it is clearly possible that share repurchases could have increased even more absent the
tax change. Hence, it is impossible to draw any reliable conclusions about the eﬀect of the
reform on total payout (total dividends + total repurchases) in the aggregate sample.
Panel B of Figure 17 shows that looking at other moments of the total payout distribution in
the full sample does not make the statistical inference problem any easier. Panel B displays the
total number of firms which repurchase more than 0.1% of their shares (along with the number
of firms paying regular dividends) in the core sample. The number of firms repurchasing shares
is also very noisy over time, making it impossible to infer the eﬀect of the tax cut on the total
number of firms paying out in some form (either dividends or repurchases).
In order to make progress on the substitution question, we therefore focus on narrower
samples where the noise in repurchases is small relative to the change in dividend behavior.
From Section 5, one such sample is the set of firms with large executive share ownership,
which experiences a very large surge in dividend initiations. Panel A of Figure 18 displays the
fraction of regular dividend payers, the fraction repurchasing at least 0.1% of their shares, and
the fraction of firms paying out in some form (either paying regular dividends or repurchasing
at least 0.1% of their shares) from 2000-Q1 to 2004-Q1 for the sample of firms where a top
executive owns at least 20% of the shares, which represents 12% of our sample. The fraction
paying dividends in this group jumped from around 25% before the reform to over 35% by 200463

Controlling for observable variables or removing the largest share repurchasers does not smooth the time
series of share repurchases.

Q1. Interestingly, the increase in the fraction of firms paying out (either through dividends or
share repurchases) is quite similar in magnitude, from around 45% before the reform to almost
55% by 2004-Q1. The fraction of firms repurchasing shares is fairly stable over the period
and falls modestly from 25% to 21% from 2002-Q3 to 2004-Q1. This graph suggests fairly
convincingly that firms with large executive ownership did not simply substitute dividend
payments for share repurchases after the reform, implying that the tax cut had real eﬀects on
total payout.
Unfortunately, the series of amounts paid out in the form of repurchases is too noisy to
allow us to obtain a more precise estimate of the degree of substitution in amounts even for the
high response group in Panel A. Panel B therefore directly examines the sample of firms that
initiated dividends after the 2003 tax reform. It shows the amounts of dividends and share
repurchases of this subset of firms from 2000-Q1 to 2004-Q1.64

Unsurprisingly, the amount

of dividends is virtually zero before the reform and increases smoothly to almost $1 billion by
2004-Q1. The figure also shows that, for this group, the amounts of share repurchases actually
increased as well during the last 3 quarters, confirming that firms initiating dividends after the
reform are not reducing their share repurchase levels relative to the pre-reform level in order
to pay dividends. Furthermore, about 35% of the firms which initiated dividends after the
reform never repurchased shares in 2002. In addition, among the firms initiating dividends
after the reform, the fraction of firms repurchasing at least 0.1% of their shares fell only from
39% in the 2002 quarters on average to about 35% in 2004-Q1.
It should be noted that while the results from Panel B show that firms did not simply
“relabel” repurchases as dividends after the reform, they do not necessarily rule out more
general forms of substitution. This is because the selection of this group is endogenous (being
based on the choice of initiating dividends). It is conceivable that absent the reform, the firms
that initiated dividends would have repurchased more shares instead.

Conclusion

Aggregate quarterly dividend payments from publicly traded corporations surged by around
$5 billion, or 20%, during the six quarters following the 2003 tax reform. Unfortunately,
the time series of the level of dividend amounts is too noisy to immediately conclude that
64

The figure excludes the largest initiating firm, Microsoft, in order to obtain smoother time series.

35

this sharp increase was a systematic change associated with the dividend tax cut rather than
a random event.

However, the time series of dividend amounts masks several systematic,

detectable changes in dividend behavior following the tax cut.

The tax reform induced a

large, widespread set of firms to initiate regular dividend payments or raise the payments they
were already making, across all percentiles of the dividend distribution.

The sharp rise in

regular dividend payments along both intensive and extensive margins, both in frequencies
and amounts, is unprecedented in the record of publicly traded U.S. corporations in the last
three decades, and oﬀers perhaps the clearest evidence thus far in the literature that tax policy
does matter for dividend payments by large corporations.65
There is considerable heterogeneity in the dividend response, which sheds light on the
mechanism through which dividend taxation aﬀects corporate behavior.

Firms with high

executive share ownership and low executive stock-options holding were most likely to initiate
dividend payments after the tax cut.

Firms with large shareholding independent directors

and high taxable institutional ownership also responded more strongly to the tax cut, while
firms controlled by nontaxable institutions (who tax incentives were unchanged by the reform)
did not respond. Corporations that had neither strong agent incentives (low share and high
options ownership) nor large principals to induce a dividend policy change were virtually unresponsive to the tax reform. These findings show that the tax incentives of key players —
powerful agents and large shareholding principals — are a first-order determinant of corporate
responses to taxation. In this sense, existing “old view” and “new view” models of corporate
taxation in the public finance literature appear to miss an important element of the behavioral
response to taxation by abstracting from agency problems. Developing a theory of dividend
taxation that explicitly incorporates a principal-agent relationship could allow for a more precise assessment of the eﬃciency costs of dividend taxation and the optimal design of corporate
and individual income tax policy.
The heterogeneity of the tax response also yields suggestive evidence about the eﬃciency
eﬀects of the tax cut.

The tax response was concentrated among low or moderate-growth

firms; firms with high forecasted earnings growth did not change payout policies in response to
the tax cut. Moreover, the surge in dividend payments does not appear to have been a pure
65

Since regular dividends are generally cut only in times of severe distress, it is likely that the sharp increases
in dividends signal a long-term change in payout behavior.

36

substitution for share repurchases. This suggests that funds may have been channelled away
from lower growth firms toward those with better investment opportunities through external
capital markets, potentially improving welfare.
Of course, in order to quantify the welfare consequences of the tax reform, it would be most
interesting to analyze the eﬀect of the reform on investment behavior directly. Unfortunately,
this does not appear to be feasible because the time series of investment is extremely volatile
and of much larger magnitude than dividend payments.

As a result, it is impossible to

estimate the eﬀects of the tax reform on any moment of the investment distribution of publicly
traded corporations with reasonable confidence intervals using the flexible, semi-parametric
methods employed above.

A promising avenue for future research is to study closely held

corporations and compare subchapter C firms (which face the corporate income tax on profits)
to subchapter S firms (which do not face the corporate tax and are unaﬀected by the 2003
reform).

As the universe of such firms is much larger, and S-corporations oﬀer a natural

control group, estimation of other behavioral responses such as investment and debt policy
might be possible.66
The sharp variations induced by the 2003 tax cut also oﬀer the opportunity to revisit other
important questions in corporate taxation beyond those addressed in this paper. One issue
of particular relevance for distinguishing agency and signalling theories of dividends is the
market response to dividend announcements. Bernheim and Wantz (1995) show formally and
empirically that if dividends serve a signalling purpose, the market premium for increasing
or initiating dividends will be larger when the tax rate is higher.

Bernheim and Wantz’s

empirical findings have been subsequently challenged by Bernhardt, Robertson, and Farrow
(1994) and Grullon and Michaely (2001), who found using diﬀerent methods and data that
higher tax rates were actually associated with lower dividend announcement premiums. Much
of the dispute in this literature stems from the lack of sharp, credible variation in tax rates and
dividend behavior. In future work, we plan to examine whether the premium for announcing
dividends fell after the 2003 tax cut.
66

In contrast to publicly traded corporations, closely held corporations are not required to publicly report their
accounting balance sheets and dividend payments. Therefore, such a project would require using non-public
corporate tax return data, available through the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.

Appendix
• Definition of Initiations and Terminations
We define a firm as initiating dividend payments in quarter t if it pays positive regular
dividends in quarter t and did not pay dividends in the previous four quarters (t−1, t−2, t−3,
and t − 4). If the firm pays annual dividends in quarter t (or paid such an annual dividend
in quarter t − 5 or t − 6), we require in addition that the firm did not pay any dividends in
quarters t − 5 and t − 6 as well. We impose this condition to accommodate cases where annual
dividend payers change the quarter in which they distribute their annual dividend payments,
which can create 5 or 6 consecutive quarters with no payments but with no materially relevant
interruption in regular dividend payments.
We define a firm as terminating regular dividend payments in quarter t if it pays positive
regular dividends in quarter t− 1 and does not pay dividends in the next four quarters (t, t +1,
t + 2, and t + 3).67 Because our data is censored after quarter 2004-Q2, we do not observe the
full vector of future dividend payments for observations from 2003-Q2 to 2004-Q2. To describe
how we handle these cases, let T denote the last quarter available in the data (2004-Q1). In
those cases where t ≥ 2003-Q2, we define a firm as terminating regular dividends if one of the
following three conditions hold: (1) the firm was a quarterly payer in quarter t − 1 and paid
dividends in all quarters t − 2, t − 3, t − 4, but does not pay in quarters t to T ; (2) the firm was
a semi-annual payer in quarter t − 1, but does not pay for at least two consecutive quarters
starting in t; or (3) the firm was an annual payer in quarter t − 1, but does not pay for at least
four consecutive quarters starting in t. This definition of termination is the closest prediction
we can obtain of actual terminations that would be observed if the data were not censored.
• Definition of Intensive Increases and Decreases
We define a firm as increasing its regular dividend payment on the intensive margin by
20% in quarter t if two conditions are met: (1) the firm is not initiating payments in quarter
t by the definition given above; (2) regular dividends in quarter t exceed regular dividends in
quarter t − 1 and quarter t − 4 by at least 20%.68 The definition for decreasing dividends by
67
In the case of annual payers in quarter t − 1 (or quarters t + 4 or t + 5), we impose in addition that the
firm does not pay any dividends in quarters t + 4 and t + 5 as well, for the same reason as above.
68
The requirement that dividends in quarter t exceed dividends in quarter t − 4 ensures that annual or
semi-annual payers are not artificially classified as increasers every time they make a dividend payment.

38

20% on the intensive margin is analogous. Note that terminations are not counted as decreases
to avoid double counting, given their inclusion in the extensive analysis. Every firm is assigned
a value of 0 for both the increase and decrease dummy variables in their first four quarters
in the sample, since there is inadequate historical information to apply our definition in these
cases. Firms not paying or initiating dividends in period t are always assigned a value of 0
for both dummy variables.
• Supplementary data collected from SEC proxy filings
We collected data on executive stock and option ownership following the definitions in Execucomp and large blockholder ownership (>5%) following the definitions in Dlugosz, Fahlenbrach, Gompers, and Metrick (2004) for 347 additional firms not covered in these datasets.
These firms included 200 firms that initiated dividends between 1998-Q1 and 2004-Q2, for
whom we collected proxy data in the year of initiation. The remaining 147 firms are a random sample of the non-initiating firms not covered by one of Execucomp or Dlugosz et. al.
We obtained this sample by randomly drawing the name of 10% of the firms (163 firms) in this
subset, along with a random date between 1998-Q1 and 2004-Q2 for which we collected proxy
data. In constructing the random sample of dates, we required that fifty percent of the dates
were chosen in the post-reform period (after 2003-Q1) given the importance of precision in the
post-reform period. We were unable to obtain proxy statements for 16 of the 163 firms in our
random sample, giving us an ultimate random sample size of 147. The under-representation
of firms in the non-Execucomp, non-Dlugosz, non-initiating group is corrected for in our heterogeneity analysis by probability weighting these observations by the sampling probability,
so that they receive more weight in all computations.

defined as monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual taxable dividends. Regular dividends also include
other and unknown frequency taxable dividends that are followed by regular payments (see text). Special dividends are defined as special and all remaining other and unknown frequency taxable dividends
listed in CRSP. The solid vertical line (separating quarters 2003-Q2 and 2003-Q3) denotes the time
at which the 2003 tax reform was enacted (end of May 2003). The dashed vertical line (separating
quarters 2002-Q4 and 2003-Q1) denotes the time at which the lower tax rate on dividend income was
proposed and started (retrospectively) to apply.

Top 3807 firms

In Panel A, the sample consists, in each quarter, of the top 1,000 firms (ranked by market capitalization in each quarter) in the CRSP database which are non financial, non utility, and non foreign in
their last quarter. The first curve depicts the number of the top 1,000 firms paying regular dividends.
The second depicts, the cumulative diﬀerence (from 1982-Q1) between the number of regular dividend
payers who entered the top 1,000 firms and the number of regular dividend payers who left the top 1,000
firms. The third curve is the diﬀerence between the first two, and captures the number of “deliberate”
payers among the top 1,000 firms controlling for entry and exit eﬀects.
Panel B plots the third (deliberate payers) curve in Panel A for the core sample (all non utility,
non financial, non foreign CRSP firms) and the constant number of firms sample (top 3,807 firms in
each quarter ranked by market capitalization). These two graphs capture the evolution of the number
of dividend payers firms controlling for entry and exits eﬀects in these two samples.

Panel A depicts the fraction of firms increasing and decreasing regular dividend payments by more
than 20% in a given quarter in the constant number of firms sample. An increase in dividend payments
by 20% in quarter t occurs when the firm (1) does not initiate dividend payments in quarter t, (2)
pays dividends in quarter t larger in real terms by 20% than dividends paid in quarters t − 1 and t − 4.
Decreases in dividends payments are defined in an analogous way. (see text for further details).
Panel B depicts the fraction of firms increasing dividend payments in the core sample without
controls (as in Panel A), and the corresponding curve controlling for covariates. In the case with
controls, the sample is the set of firms that satisfy the additional requirement that assets, post-tax
profits, market to book ratios, and cash from Compustat are available. The regression residuals curve
reports the quarter dummy coeﬃcients of an OLS regression of the >20% increase dummy on a full set
of quarter dummies, dummies for first digit industry code, assets, and levels and eight quarterly lags
of after-tax profits/assets, marketcap/assets, and cash/assets (see specification (2) in text).

In both panels, the sample consists of all firms present in CRSP in each quarter from 1998-Q1 to

quarters (t − 1, t − 2, t − 3, t − 4) are discarded from the sample (to focus only on firms not paying
dividends previously).
Panel A depicts the percentage of firms initiating dividends at an annualized rate pre-reform (from
1998-Q1 to 2002-Q4) and post-reform (from 2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2) by quintiles of executive ownership.
Executive ownership is defined by the share of the company owned by the executive with the largest
share ownership. Executive share ownership is obtained from Execucomp data or directly collected
from SEC proxy filings, as described in the appendix. The horizontal axis shows, for each quintile, the
percentage range of shares owned by the largest executive owner.
Panel B depicts the percentage of firms initiating dividends (as in Panel A) by analogous quintiles of
executive option holding. Executive option holding is defined by the fraction of shares of the company
owned in the form of unexercisable stock-options (options which have been granted but are not yet
vested and hence cannot yet be exercised) by the executive who has the largest unexercisable options
holdings.

For both panels, the sample is the same as in Figure 14. Panel A depicts the percentage of firms
initiating dividends at an annualized rate pre-reform (from 1998-Q1 to 2002-Q4) and post-reform (from
2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2) by quintiles of institutional share ownership. Institutional share ownership (from
the Thomson financial database) is defined as the fraction of the firm owned by institutions such as
mutual funds. The horizontal axis depicts, for each quintile, the percentage range of institutional share
ownership.
Panel B breaks down the initiation rates by institutional ownership and large-shareholding independent directors. The “low inst” category consists of all firms with below-median institutional
shareholding during sample period, and the “high inst” category consists of the rest. The “No Dir”
category contains firms that do not have a large-shareholding independent director on their board; the
“Has Dir” category contains the rest of the firms. The figure shows pre- and post-reform initiation
rates for the four categories of firms across these two dimensions. Large-shareholding independent
directors are defined as individuals on the board of directors who own at least 5% of the company and
who are not oﬃcers. Data on large shareholders is obtained from the Dlugosz, Fahlenbrach, Gompers,
and Metrick (2004) database and also supplemented by data from SEC proxy statements as described
in the appendix.

growth. The sample is the same as in Figures 14. Expected earnings growth is defined using I/B/E/S
data on analysts’ earnings forecasts as follows. We first compute the expected change in earnings per
share as the mean earnings per share forecast for a two year forecast period minus the actual earnings
per share in the current year. We then multiply this figure by the total number of shares outstanding
and divide by total assets to arrive at a normalized measure of earnings growth per dollar of assets.
The five quintiles of earnings growth are defined over the sample of firm-quarter pairs (therefore, the
quintiles are not constant overtime). The horizontal axis depicts, for each quintile, the percentage range
of earnings growth forecast.

For regular dividends, the sample consists of all firm-quarters in the CRSP database which are non
financial, non utility, and non foreign in their last quarter (core sample). For share repurchases, the
sample is same as above but with the additional requirement that the firm appears in the quarterly
compustat database and that the compustat variable share repurchase (item data93 in quarterly file:
purchases of common and preferred stock) exists.
Panel B depicts the total number of firms making regular dividend payments and total number of
firms repurchasing at least 0.1% of their shares from 1984-Q1 to 2004-Q2. The sample is the same as
in Panel A.

Panel A depicts the fraction of regular dividend payers and the fractions of firms either paying
regular dividends or repurchasing at least 0.1% of their shares for each quarter from 1998-Q1 to 2004Q1. The sample consists of all firms in the core sample that are alive in all quarters from 1998-Q1 to
2004-Q1 and have one or more top executives who own at least 20% of their company’s shares.
Panel B depicts the amount of regular dividends paid and the amount of share repurchases for the
set of firms in the core sample who initiate regular dividend payments after the 2003 reform (between
2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2), and which have Compustat data on share repurchases. Microsoft is excluded
from the sample in order to obtain smoother series that are not driven by an outlier.

This table reports the average value pre-reform (6 quarters from 2001-Q3 to 2002-Q4) and post-reform (from
2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2), as well as the change post-pre reform (with no controls and with controls) for a number of
variables of interest. The change with controls is obtained from an OLS regression including assets, levels and
eight lags of profits/assets, cash/assets, mktcap/assets, and SIC dummies, as in specification (2) in the text.
Standard errors are reported in parenthesis below the estimates. The sample is the top 3,807 firms in CRSP (ranked by
market capitalization) in each quarter (excluding utilities, financial, and foreign). The number of regular dividend initiations
is defined as firms starting to pay regular dividends after not having paid for 4 quarters (6 quarters if annual payer).
The number of regular dividend increases is defined as those firms increasing regular dividend payments by at least 20%
in nominal terms in quarter t (relative to the previous dividend payment). Dividend initiations are not counted as intensive
increases or decreases. Change in regular dividends due to initiations defined as the dividend amount (normalized to
quarterly) for regular dividend initiators. Change in regular dividends due to intensive margin defined as the change in
dividend amount (normalized to quarter and relative to previous regular dividend payment) for firms paying dividends.

Notes: Data sample consists all CRSP firms which are non financial, non utilities, and non foreign in their last quarter. For share repurchase variables, the firms must also have share repurchase information in COMPUSTAT (data93)
Col. (2) is the tax preference parameter from Poterba (2004). It is defined as the average of (1-tdiv)/(1-tcg) where tdiv is marginal tax rate on dividend income and tcg is the marginal tax rate on capital gains.
Col. (3) is the Consumer Price Index (base 1 in 2004-Q1). All amounts are expressed in real 2004-Q1 dollars. Col. (4) is the total amount of regular dividends. Col. (5) is the total amount of special dividends.
Col. (6) is the total amount of share repurchases computed with data93 item in the COMPUSTAT quarterly data (purchases of common and preferred stock). Col. (7) is market capitalization (in $bn).
Col. (8) is the number of firms, col. (9) is the number of regular dividend payers, col. (10) is the number of special dividend payers.
Col. (11) is the number of regular dividend initiations defined as starting to pay regular dividends after not having paid for 4 quarters (6 quarters if annual payer).
Col. (12) is the number of regular dividend terminations defined as stopping regular dividends payments (see text for details).
Col. (13) (resp. (14)) are the number of intensive reg. div, increases (resp. decreases) by at least 20% in real terms in quarter t (relative to quarters t-1 and t-4). Dividend initiations are not counted as intensive increases or decreases.
Col. (15) is the number of firms repurchasing at least 0.1% of their shares in the quarter.
Col. (16) is the number of firms which enter the core sample and are paying regular dividends. Col. (17) is the number of firms leaving the core sample and which were regular dividend payers.
Col. (18) is the cumulated difference between columns (16) and (17). Column (19) is col. (9) minus col. (18): it captures the number of payers controlling for entry and exit effects.
Col. (20) is the amounts of regular dividend initiations defined as starting to pay regular dividends after not having paid for 4 quarters (6 quarters if annual payer).
Col. (21) is the intensive change in regular dividend payments relative to previous payment (in $Mn) for firms present in the data and paying dividends currently and in previous quarter (initiations and terminations excluded).
The solid line marks the time at which the tax reform was enacted (end of May 2003) and the dashed line the time at which the tax reform was retrospectively applied (January 1st, 2003)

Notes: Data sample consists top 3,807 CRSP firms (ranked by market capitalization) which are non financial, non utilities, and non foreign in their last quarter.
Col. (2) is the tax preference parameter from Poterba (2004). It is defined as the average of (1-tdiv)/(1-tcg) where tdiv is marginal tax rate on dividend income and tcg is the marginal tax rate on capital gains.
Col. (3) is the Consumer Price Index (base 1 in 2004-Q1). All amounts are expressed in real 2004-Q1 dollars. Col. (4) is the total amount of regular dividends. Col. (5) is the total amount of special dividends.
Col. (6) is the total amount of share repurchases computed with data93 item in the COMPUSTAT quarterly data (purchases of common and preferred stock). Col. (7) is market capitalization (in $bn).
Col. (8) is the number of firms, col. (9) is the number of regular dividend payers, col. (10) is the number of special dividend payers.
Col. (11) is the number of regular dividend initiations defined as starting to pay regular dividends after not having paid for 4 quarters (6 quarters if annual payer).
Col. (12) is the number of regular dividend terminations defined as stopping regular dividends payments (see text for details).
Col. (13) (resp. (14)) are the number of intensive reg. div, increases (resp. decreases) by at least 20% in real terms in quarter t (relative to quarters t-1 and t-4). Dividend initiations are not counted as intensive increases or decreases.
Col. (15) is the number of firms repurchasing at least 0.1% of their shares in the quarter.
Col. (16) is the number of firms which enter the core sample and are paying regular dividends. Col. (17) is the number of firms leaving the core sample and which were regular dividend payers.
Col. (18) is the cumulated difference between columns (16) and (17). Column (19) is col. (9) minus col. (18): it captures the number of payers controlling for entry and exit effects.
Col. (20) is the amounts of regular dividend initiations defined as starting to pay regular dividends after not having paid for 4 quarters (6 quarters if annual payer).
Col. (21) is the intensive change in regular dividend payments relative to previous payment (in $Mn) for firms present in the data and paying dividends currently and in previous quarter (initiations and terminations excluded).
The solid line marks the time at which the tax reform was enacted (end of May 2003) and the dashed line the time at which the tax reform was retrospectively applied (January 1st, 2003)

NOTE-See Figures 14-16 and text for description of sample and quintile construction procedure. Pre-reform period
is 2001-Q3 to 2002-Q4; post-reform is 2003-Q1 to 2004-Q2. Standard errors clustered by firm reported in parens.
Diffs-in-diffs column reports pre-post change in initiation rate in q5 minus corresponding change in q1, with
p-values for F-test in square brackets. For earnings growth, diffs-in-diffs column compares q5 and q2. For indep.
directors, q1 contains all firms with no large-shareholding indep directors and q5 contains all other firms.

NOTE-Table reports annualized initiation rates by quinitle pre- and post-reform conditonal on observables,
using regression specifications as in equation (3) in the text, with key variable of interest excluded from linear
control set. Standard errors clustered by firm reported in parentheses. Diffs-in-diffs column reports pre-post
change in initiation rate in q5 minus corresponding change in q1, with p-values for F-test in square brackets.
For earnings growth, diffs-in-diffs column compares q5 and q2. See Table A3 for additional details.
