Quantitative Goals for Monetary Policy

NBER Working Paper No. 10846
October 2004
JEL No. E52
ABSTRACT
We study empirically the macroeconomic effects of an explicit de jure quantitative goal for monetary
policy. Quantitative goals take three forms: exchange rates, money growth rates, and inflation
targets. We analyze the effects on inflation of both having a quantitative target, and of hitting a
declared target; we also consider effects on output volatility. Our empirical work uses an annual data
set covering 42 countries between 1960 and 2000, and takes account of other determinants of
inflation (such as fiscal policy, the business cycle, and openness to international trade), and the
endogeneity of the monetary policy regime. We find that both having and hitting quantitative targets
for monetary policy is systematically and robustly associated with lower inflation. The exact form
of the monetary target matters somewhat, but is less important than having some quantitative target.
Successfully achieving a quantitative monetary goal is also associated with less volatile output.

1. Introduction and Motivation
The economics profession has gradually moved to the view that transparency in monetary
(and other) policies is desirable. For instance, the IMF believes that transparent policies are both
more effective and enhance accountability. Accordingly, the Fund encourages countries “… to
state clearly the role, responsibility and objectives of the central bank. The objectives of the
central bank should be clearly defined, publicly disclosed and written into law.”1 But while the
theoretical advantages of transparency have been much analyzed, there is less in the way of
empirical support. One objective of this paper is to help fill that gap.
We find that in practice, countries with transparent targets for monetary policy achieve
lower inflation. We identify “transparent” targets for monetary policy with “quantitative”
targets. Quantitative targets are easily measured, allowing the monetary authority’s successes (or
lack thereof) to be determined mechanistically. That is, quantitative targets are transparent since
they can be assessed without (much) debatable personal judgment.
In practice, central banks have used three types of quantitative monetary targets (with
varying degrees of success): exchange rates, money growth rates, and inflation targets. A
number of economists in the past have analyzed the effects of one of these regimes. For
instance, there is a large and growing literature on countries with inflation targets. There is an
even larger literature which compares the merits of fixed and floating exchange rate regimes.
Rather than focusing on any one of these targets, we use all three. In part this is because we are
interested in estimating the effect of transparency in monetary policy, and transparency can take
different forms. Indeed, when we compare the inflationary effects of different quantitative
targets for monetary policy (exchange rate/money growth/inflation), we find differences, but
they are small compared to the presence of any transparent target.

Still, we combine together different types of targets for monetary policy for a more
important reason, which is best explained with an example. Fixed exchange rates are welldefined monetary policies, and are often compared with floating exchange rate regimes. But a
float is not a well-defined monetary policy! Similarly, central banks that do not target inflation
have to do something else. By using data for all quantitative monetary regimes, we can
reasonably compare the merits of having a transparent monetary policy to the alternative, which
we consider to be “opaque monetary objective(s).”
In section 2, we review the extensive literature of relevance; our methodology and data
set are presented afterwards. The core of our paper is in section 4 which presents our results for
inflation, along with sensitivity analysis. We then analyze the effects of quantitative targets on
the short run/business cycle volatility of output. A brief conclusion closes.

2. Literature Review
Our work is related to a number of other classic problems in economics. One is the
choice of monetary instrument. Different instruments have different degrees of transparency (as
well as other attributes); accordingly, the question of whether central banks should use the
exchange rate, the money growth rate, or something else has been addressed by many scholars.2
Most of this literature is concerned with exchange rate regimes. There is an enormous literature
that compares the attributes of fixed and floating exchange rate regimes, both theoretically and
empirically. Still, to repeat a standard but important criticism of this area, a fixed exchange rate
is a well-defined monetary policy, but a floating exchange rate regime is not. If the monetary
authorities are not pegging the exchange rate, they must be doing something else. Because of the
recent increase in the adoption of inflation targets, we have seen a shift in the literature towards
2

See e.g., Atkeson and Kehoe (2001) NBER WP 8681.

2

the study of inflation targeting regimes. Another related literature is that of the optimal degree of
transparency in monetary policy.3
There is also a literature that has focused on the role of domestic institutions in the
conduct of monetary policy, most of which is centred on the effects of independence of central
banks, and/or, more recently, on inflation targets. Although these areas of the literature are
ultimately addressing the same issue (how monetary policy regimes affect macroeconomic
outcomes), it is fair to say that, to a large extent, they have been developed separately. We now
review some of the key papers in each of these strands of literature, summarizing their main
insights.

Exchange Rate Regimes
The macroeconomic effect of the exchange rate regime is still an open question, one that
is associated with many controversies in both the international and monetary economics
literatures. There is a broad literature that deals with the theoretical analysis on the costs and
benefits of different exchange rate arrangements and there is a consensus on the main factors that
shape these costs and benefits. However, there are still many disagreements on the relative
empirical importance of these factors. As a result, when it comes to the best monetary policy
regime for a given country, most of the predictions are inconclusive as they depend on a variety
of assumptions that can only be validated empirically. Relative to the theoretical literature, there
have been fewer papers that have taken these assumptions to a test or that, more generally, have
empirically estimated the implications of monetary policy regimes.
One of the first papers to provide a comprehensive empirical study of the effects of
different exchange rate regimes on macroeconomic outcomes is Baxter and Stockman (1989).
3

See e.g., Faust and Svensson (2002), and Cukierman and Meltzer (1986).

3

Using a cross-section of countries with different exchange rate regime, they looked at the
association between the exchange rate regime and variables such as output, consumption, trade
flows, government consumption and the real exchange rate. Their conclusion was that the
exchange rate regime did not matter for most of the macroeconomic variables, with the exception
of the real exchange rate (that was more volatile under flexible exchange rate systems).
Most of the studies that have followed Baxter and Stockman (1989) have had a narrower
focus; they look mainly into the consequences on inflation and output volatility. Recent studies
by Ghosh et al. (1997, 2002) and Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003) provide detailed
analyses of the effects of exchange rate regimes on inflation. The approach is to look initially at
the marginal effect of the exchange rate regime, after controlling for the effect of money growth.
The hypothesis is that the exchange rate regime has a direct effect on the relationship between
money and inflation, beyond any potential indirect effect through the conduct of monetary policy
(i.e. on money growth rates). There is evidence that inflation is lower under fixed rate regimes.4
Both Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003) and Ghosh et al. (1997) also study the
effects on business cycle volatility and growth. Regarding business cycle volatility, their results
are consistent: fixed exchange rate regimes are associated to greater output volatility. Regarding
growth effects, the papers reach different conclusions. While Ghosh et al. (1997) do not find
strong evidence in any direction Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003) conclude that growth is
higher for floaters.

Domestic Institutions

4

In the case of Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003) there is also a test of the indirect effect of the regime on
inflation via money growth. Money growth is regressed on GDP growth (lagged), money growth lagged, openness,
budget balance, a set of regional dummies and the exchange rate dummies. Once again long pegs are the only cases
where there seems to be a significant negative effect on inflation, in this case through lower money growth.

4

Even for countries where the discussion on exchange rate regimes is not important (in
most cases because of the adoption of floating exchange rates), there has been an active recent
debate on optimal monetary policy. The two key issues are typically whether the central bank
should have instrument-independence, and whether it should have an explicit inflation target.
Regarding the independence of central banks, the literature has focused on the observed
negative correlation between inflation and central bank independence as documented in Alesina
and Summers (1993), Cukierman (1992) or Grilli et al. (1991).
The other main features of monetary policy that have been studied in this literature are
the effects of explicit targets and transparency. Initially the analysis was centred on money
targets, but as countries moved away from these targets into inflation ones, the focus of the
literature has moved accordingly. Because of the lack of a large number of observations, the
literature tends to be descriptive, based on case studies rather than cross-country regressions.
Mishkin (1999) and the books by Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin and Posen (1999) and Loayza and
Soto (2002) present good surveys and case studies of money and inflation targeting. Overall the
evidence is mixed. While there is evidence that inflation targets have helped countries reduce
their inflation rates (Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2002), others argue that this effect is the
result of factors other than the monetary regime (Ball and Sheridan (2003)).

Regimes
In all the literature reviewed above, two issues appear repeatedly: the characterization of
monetary policy regimes (especially when it comes to exchange rate regimes) and the problem of
endogeneity.

5

Classification of regimes: words or actions? When it comes to the classification of
exchange rate regimes, there are two possible approaches. The first is to look at the officially
declared de jure regime. The problem with this approach is that we often observe in practice that
countries sometimes peg their exchange rate without a clear de jure commitment (or intervene
frequently despite having declared a floating exchange rate, the “fear of floating” as defined by
Calvo and Reinhart, 2000). As an alternative one can look at actions and classify regimes but
looking at the actual behaviour of exchange rates (or the target set by monetary policy), i.e. the
de facto regime. This is the approach of Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) and Levy Yeyati, Eduardo
and Federico Sturzenegger (2003). Their results show that looking at a de facto classification
might provide very different results. The distinction between words and actions also matters for
other monetary policy targets such as money and inflation targets. For example, there is plenty
of evidence that central banks that declared themselves to be money targetters were not behaving
as such (see, for example, Bernanke and Mihov (1997) for the case of the Bundesbank).
Rather than attempt to resolve this issue on a conceptual level, we simply look at both the
de facto regime and whether or not it is actually hit in practice.
Dealing with endogeneity. The interpretation of the existence of a correlation between
inflation (or output volatility) and the exchange rate regime is problematic because of
endogeneity. Is inflation lower because of the fixed exchange rate regime? Or are countries with
low inflation (or more distaste of inflation) more likely to adopt fixed exchange rate regimes?
The literature has dealt with the issue of endogeneity by using a set of instrumental variables
based on either economic or political arguments.5 Levy-Yeyati, Sturzenegger and Reggio (2002)
or von Hagen and Jizhong Zhou (2004) provide a comprehensive study of the endogeneity of
5

A separate but related issue is the need to control for variables other than the monetary policy regime in the
determination of inflation. Romer (1993) or Lane (1997) are examples of papers that have studied how the
determinants of the incentives of governments to inflate their economies.

6

exchange rate regimes. Frieden, Ghezzi and Stein (2000), within the context of Latin America,
use a similar framework. Alesina and Wagner (2003) provide an analysis of how institutions
affect decisions by countries to abandon fixed exchange rate regimes and to dissemble why such
regimes are in place.
The arguments about what determines the choice of an exchange rate regime are based on
theories that highlight the economic costs and benefits of the regimes, as well as the political
institutional environment in which different regimes might be preferable. The economic
variables are related to the optimum currency area debate. What makes a country a better
candidate to adopt the currency of a different country? Openness, size, geographical
concentration of country’s trade, the type of shocks (volatility of terms of trade, volatility of
other nominal versus real shocks), financial dollarization all matter to assess these costs and
benefits and have been used as instrumental variables in the literature.
The political arguments are more institutional, and concern the benefits of committing to
a certain monetary policy. From a theoretical point of view, fragmentation of power (measured
by e.g., the fraction of seats in congress held by government, years in office, or a Herfindahl
index of political parties) or political instability shape the benefits and costs of commitment
when it comes to monetary policy or the exchange rate regime. There is evidence that these
variables matter (Frieden, Ghezzi and Stein (2000) or Edwards (1996)).
The issue of endogeneity has rarely been studied in the case of money or inflation targets.
One of the few exceptions is Gerlach (1999) in the context of inflation targets. His results show
that the adoption of inflation targets is more likely with low degree of central bank
independence, less openness, countries that export a low number of goods and among members
of the EU.

3. Methodology
3.a Benchmark model
Our benchmark model is the following:
Πit = β1DJTargetit + β2Successit
+ γ1Openit + γ2Budgetit + γ3BusCycleit + γ4GDPpcit + γ5 GDPit + εit

where i denotes a country, t denotes a year, and
•

Π denotes the annual inflation rate in percentage points

•

DJTargett is a dummy variable that is one if the country had a quantitative monetary policy
target during period t, and zero otherwise,

•

γi is a set of nuisance coefficients,

•

Success is a dummy variable that is one if the country hit its de jure quantitative target during
t, and zero otherwise,

•

Open is trade (exports plus imports) as a percentage of GDP,

•

Budget is the government budget surplus (+) or deficit (-), as a percentage of GDP,

•

BusCycle is the difference between real GDP growth and average GDP growth, measured in
percentage points,

•

GDPpc is the natural logarithm of real GDP per capita,

•

GDP is the natural logarithm of real GDP, and

•

ε is a well-behaved residual term for all other inflation determinants.
The coefficients of interest to us are β1 and β2. The first coefficient is of greatest interest;

it represents the effect of having a formally declared de jure quantitative monetary target on
inflations, ceteris paribus. Of slightly less interest to us is β2 which shows the effect on inflation
of successfully hitting a quantitative monetary target.

8

The other regressors control for “nuisance” factors that affect inflation and might be
correlated with the monetary policy regime, but are not of direct interest to us. Romer (1993)
argues that more open economies have lower inflation because the costs of monetary expansion
are high when the country has high trade-to-GDP ratio. More open economies might also opt for
a fixed exchange rate relative to their trading partners as argued by the literature on the optimal
currency areas. This argument prompts us to include Open as a regressor. The budget balance
(Budget) can affect inflation by imposing requirements for money-financed deficits or through
aggregate demand. At the same time the success in hitting a monetary target can be affected by
fiscal policy outcomes. We also include the state of the business cycle (BusCycle) as a measure
of aggregate demand pressures on the price level and as a covariate which might be correlated
with the success of the monetary regime. GDP per capita (GDPpc) enters the regression to
account for the fact that rich countries have more sophisticated financial sectors, which implies
higher opposition to inflation (as in Posen, 1995) and lower optimal inflation tax because of
better developed standard tax instruments. Posen’s argument also suggests that rich countries
have low incentives to adopt an explicit target given that there is already pressure to achieve low
inflation. Finally, the level of GDP is included to account for the market size. Since market size
can affect productivity as in the models of Romer (1986) or Lucas (1988), a larger country may
have lower inflation ceteris paribus. On the correlation between country size and explicit
targets, one might argue that larger countries are less likely to adopt an exchange rate target.
Our benchmark regression is similar to those used by Levi-Yeyati and Sturzenegger
(2003), and Ghosh et al. (2002). The theoretical motivation for their econometric specification
is quite similar to ours, except that these studies focus only on the exchange rate regime.
Campillo and Miron (1996) provide also a cross-sectional investigation of determinants of

9

inflation and the regressors are almost identical to the ones we use, but they do not include any
variable that captures the nature of the monetary regime.
We estimate the model with least squares, and use robust standard errors. Still, we are
cognizant of a number of potential econometric pitfalls associated with this strategy (e.g.,
simultaneity). Accordingly, we do perform extensive sensitivity analysis to take into account a
variety of different issues.

3.b Data Description
A data appendix describes in detail the sources and the list of variables used in our
empirical analysis. Our annual data set spans 1960 through 2000, and includes all countries with
1960 GDP per capita of at least $1000 dollars in the Penn World Table database for which
comprehensive data are available. There is significant variation in monetary policy practices both
over time and across countries in the data set. Exchange rate pegs are more common in the
1960s, money targets disappear from many countries during the 1980s, inflation targeting only
appears in the 90s. For most of our analysis we use annual frequency (given that we are not
interested in high-frequency properties of the data), but we provide sensitivity analysis by
replicating our results using five-year averages.
We use two variables to characterize the monetary policy regime: whether or not there
was an announced de jure target and whether or not the target was hit de facto. Our approach is
complementary to that of the previous literature. As mentioned in our literature review, previous
papers have struggled with the issue of “words versus actions”. Central banks often claim to
have adopted strict monetary policy targets, whether they are monetary aggregates, exchange
rates, or inflation targets. In many cases these claims are not validated by their actions or the

10

data. Some obvious examples of this behavior include: countries that intervene on foreign
exchange markets extensively despite having a floating exchange rate policy; missed targets for
monetary aggregates; and missed inflation targets. Our strategy is to capture with our de jure
classification of monetary regimes the stated announcements of central banks, and then also to
look separately at whether or not the target was hit in practice.
Establishing a de jure classification for exchange rate and inflation targets is not
conceptually complicated, though there is much debatable minutiae.6 In the case of targets for
monetary aggregates, there are several cases where a judgment call needs to be made; many
central banks use monetary aggregates as reference indicators for their monetary policy without
formally targeting money growth. We try not to take this logic too far, because we are still
interested in words (not actions) for our de jure classification. For example, the Bundesbank is
classified as having a target for money even though we know that in practice the commitment to
the target was weaker than the Buba’s words.
There is one complication that we have to address before we proceed with the estimation
of our benchmark model. Sometimes countries change their monetary regimes in mid-year. This
presents a problem for our estimation because for the year when there is a change we will use
data for the dependent variable and the controls that correspond to two regimes at the same time.
Had we known the exact date of the regime change, we could remove that year. Unfortunately
we do not have this information for a good number of observations.7 In our benchmark results
we proceed conservatively and delete adjacent years with different regimes (so that each regime
shift entails two dropped observations).

6

Our classification is consistent with several recent papers.
When we know the date of a regime shift, we follow the convention of dating it to the year when it was first in
place for at least six months.

7

11

Our de facto classification of monetary policy regimes provides a measure of whether or
not the announced targets were met. In the case of the exchange rate targets we make use of the
Reinhardt and Rogoff classification that characterizes exchange rate regimes by their actions (not
their words). In the case of inflation and money targets we simply compare the outcome
(inflation or money growth) with the announced range for the target. Still, we face several
difficulties in making this comparison. First, targets are sometimes expressed as a single
number, while for others a range is provided. When an explicit range is provided we simply
assess whether or not the outcome is within the range. If there is no band around the announced
target, we either consider the target as a maximum (by establishing a range from 0 to the
announced value) or we build a range around the target. We consider the value as a maximum
when the central bank is clearly trying to bring inflation down and establishes a series of
decreasing targets for the years ahead. We add a range to the target when this is consistent with
previous or future behavior of that central bank. For example, there are also instances where
central banks switch from an explicit range to a single point. In those cases we add a band of
around the announced target of the same size as the band that was in place in previous years.8
The second difficulty associated with determining whether or not a target was hit is
measuring the outcome. Money and inflation targets are established for a specific measure of
inflation or a monetary aggregate. In some cases, the information about the precise measure
being used is unavailable. In others, we know the variable used, but have not been able to find
the data. As a result, we are missing some observations. In the case of inflation, we use the CPI

8

In the very few cases where we cannot find information or a historical reference to establish a band, we use the
convention of adding one percentage points to each side of the target. Details are provided in the data appendix.

12

as our measure of the price index. In the case of monetary aggregates, we normally use
information on both target and outcome that originate from the same source.9

4. Empirics
4.a Benchmark Results
OLS estimation of our model results in the benchmark estimates presented in Table 1.
The coefficient of greatest interest to us is β1, the effect on inflation of a country’s having a
quantitative target for monetary policy of any type (whether an inflation target, a money growth
target, or an exchange rate target). The effect is both economically and statistically significant;
the existence of a de jure target is estimated to lower annual inflation by about sixteen
percentage points, with a t-statistic greater than five in absolute value (and hence different from
zero at all conventional significance levels). This effect is enhanced if the quantitative target is
actually hit. A monetary target that is successfully achieved reduces inflation by another five
percentage points, a result that is again highly statistically and economically significant.
Our basic framework is perturbed in three ways in Table 1. First, we drop the dummy
variable for successful implementation of a quantitative monetary target. Second and
symmetrically, we also drop the dummy representing the existence of a quantitative target. Each
of the coefficients remains economically and statistically significant if the other is set to zero.
Finally, we drop all the conditioning variables (that is, we set γ1=γ2=…=γ5=0).
At first blush it seems that countries with transparent (quantitative) de jure monetary
targets experience lower inflation. Actually hitting the target lowers inflation further. While the
preliminary findings are positive, caveats certainly exist. For one thing, the model fits the data

9

If this is not the case and the information on the specific monetary target being used is not available, then we leave
the observation as missing.

13

poorly. While many of the auxiliary regressors are correctly signed (more open economies have
lower inflation; tight fiscal policy lowers inflation; richer economies have lower inflation), some
are not (observations with higher-than-average growth display lower inflation). Furthermore, a
number of potentially important omitted variables and econometric complications come to mind
quickly. Accordingly, we now engage in sensitivity analysis.

4.b Sensitivity Analysis
Table 2 checks the sensitivity of the results with respect to the precise sample used for
estimation. First we drop observations before 1975. Next we drop all observations where the
(country x year) observation is for a country with real GDP per capita below $5,000. Next we
drop outlier observations.10 Our last two changes are to add in Argentina and Brazil, two high
inflation countries, and then to drop all high inflation countries, defined as a country which
experienced inflation exceeding 100% annually at any point in our sample (Chile, Israel, Mexico,
Turkey and Uruguay). It is striking that our key coefficient of interest – β1 – remains
economically large and statistically significant in all of these perturbations. (The size of the
effect of course varies with the sample; excluding high-inflation countries reduces considerably
the potential and actual influence of a quantitative monetary target.) Further, β2 is also
significantly negative (in both the economic and statistical senses) in all cases except when
Argentina and Brazil are included in the sample.
In Table 3 we check the robustness of our results with respect to unobserved country- and
time-specific factors. We do this by adding successively: a) country-specific intercepts; b) yearspecific intercepts; and c) country- and year-specific intercepts simultaneously. The last column

10

The latter are defined as observations with a residual estimated to lie more than 1.5 standard deviations from the
mean of zero.

14

of the table adds dynamics to the perturbation with both sets of fixed effects by modeling the
error term as an AR(1) disturbance rather than serially uncorrelated. Again, our key coefficient
remains negative and significant throughout (though adding country effects eliminates the
significance of the effect of achieving a monetary target).
Table 4 explores whether the three types of quantitative monetary policy targets –
inflation, money growth, and exchange rate – have similar effects on inflation. When the three
different regimes are allowed to take on different coefficients, the inflation targeting regime
seems to have more of a dampening effect on inflation than the (similar) effects of either
exchange rate or money growth targets. The differences between the three targets are significant
at conventional confidence level. The effect of a successfully-hit monetary target on inflation
also varies by the type of target; surprisingly, the effect of successfully hitting an inflation target
has a positive coefficient. A closer inspection of the data reveals that several countries have
indeed missed the target by having inflation that is below the target range. For example, Sweden
in the 1990s had a range between 1% and 3% inflation, but in four years inflation was below 1%.
Table 5 shows that the effects of political instability on inflation are of negligible
importance. Neither revolutions nor coups (the variables used by Campillo and Miron, 1996)
much affects inflation.
Table 6 uses instrumental variables estimation to account for possible simultaneity in the
equation. We are particularly concerned with the possibility that high inflation induces the
authorities to introduce or use quantitative targets. There is also the possibility that a low
inflation environment may encourage the authorities to lock in stability with a transparent
monetary policy.

15

As instrumental variables for both our de jure monetary dummy, and the dummy variable
for de facto success in hitting this target, we use three political variables and two variables
capturing social characteristics. They are: a) political constraints (used by Henisz, (2000)); b) a
dummy for (country x year) observations with a presidential electoral system (taken from
Persson-Tabellini (2001)); c) a comparable dummy for observations with majoritarian electoral
systems (again taken from Persson-Tabellini, (2001)) d) the percentage of males over 25 years
old with completed primary education; and e) the percentage of males over 25 years with
completed secondary education. We use these variables for a number of reasons. The presence
of political constraints in the country reveals an overall preference for rules. In addition,
countries with more political constraints have more disciplined fiscal policy. With more
discipline on the fiscal side it is more likely that that a monetary regime is sustainable. A
somewhat different argument is that if political constraints restrict fiscal policy, then society
might prefer to leave monetary policy unconstrained and assign to it a bigger role in smoothing
business cycle fluctuations. The nature of the political system (presidential vs. parliamentary)
affects regime choice in a similar way. Presidential regimes are often characterized by better
separation of powers than parliamentary ones, because the president cannot be subjected to a noconfidence vote by the parliament (except under rare circumstances of impeachment). The
executive in a parliamentary system, on the other hand, can be more easily removed. The
separation of powers in a presidential system again makes fiscal policy rather constrained, which
boosts the case for having flexible monetary policy. The electoral system matters because
countries with majoritarian systems are associated with stronger governments relative to those
with proportional representation. Proportional systems often lead to the need for coalitions to
form a government; Levy-Yeyati, Sturzenegger and Reggio (2002) argue coalition governments

16

are more prone to be influenced by special interests. To avoid a situation where special interests
affect monetary policy, the society might opt for a regime with an explicit target. Hence
majoritarian systems should be linked with a more flexible regime. Finally the two education
variables are used since more educated societies may insist on having institutions for low
inflation, while education has no direct effect on inflation.
We provide four different perturbations of our IV results: benchmark; with country-fixed
effects; with year intercepts; and with both. The standard errors for the coefficients of interest
are considerably higher, indicating that the first-stage regressions do not fit well. That is, our
instrumental variables do not work particularly well. This is even more obvious from the
dramatic increase in the size of the effects; the IV estimates of β1 are approximately three times
the magnitude of the OLS estimates. Once we control for unobserved country fixed effects, the
coefficient on monetary success in hitting a quantitative target becomes positive and significant.
It is difficult to provide a reasonable interpretation of this reversal. The effect of de jure regime
on inflation is, however, consistently negative and highly significant. The final four columns add
as instrumental variables lags of de jure and de facto regimes. These instruments help with
addressing issues of omitted variables (e.g. a beneficial supply shock that leads to lower inflation
and also helps the central bank hit the target). The results are highly significant and consistent
with the findings of our benchmark model.
Our final set of experiments moves away from the annual domain to consider data
averaged over mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive five-year intervals between 1960 and
1999 (1960-64, 1965-69, and so forth). These are contained in Table 7, which tabulates our key
coefficients estimated twelve different ways. For convenience, the auxiliary regressors
(openness, the budget deficit, and so forth) are included in the regressions but not explicitly

tabulated. The benchmark equation is presented in the top row. The other eleven perturbations
we consider include: a) dropping observations before 1975; b) dropping all (time period x
country) observations with real GDP per capita below $5,000; c) dropping all controls (i.e.,
setting γ1=γ2=…=γ5=0); d) adding Argentina and Brazil; e) dropping our five high inflation
countries (Chile, Israel, Mexico, Turkey and Uruguay); f) adding country intercepts; g) adding
time-period effects; h) adding both country- and time-period fixed effects; i) adding an AR(1)
residual to the country- and time-period intercepts; j) using IV on the benchmark equation; and
k) using IV with country and time-period intercepts. Our key coefficient, β1, remains negative,
economically large and statistically significant except when we exclude our high inflation
countries and when we estimate the model by IV with time and country effects. Also when we
include AR(1) errors into panel estimation the significance drops to about 10% level. This is
grounds for some caution, but not perhaps too much. Smoothing the data and excluding
countries that have ever experienced high inflation may simply reduce the variation in inflation
too much to allow the effects of a quantitative target to be detectable.
4.c Output Volatility
Our benchmark model for the volatility regression is analogous to that for inflation:

σit = β1DJTargetit + β2Successit + γ1Openit + γ2Budgetit + γ3GDPpcit + γ4 GDPit + εit

where i denotes a country, t denotes a 5-year period, and
•

σ denotes output volatility (defined carefully below), and

•

other variables are as defined above.

18

For output volatility, we initially use the five-year average absolute deviation of output
growth from mean growth (calculated from annual data). That is, we first compute the countryspecific mean growth rate using the entire span of annual data, denoted ∆GDPi ≡ (1 / T )Σ t GDPit ,
then compute our regressand as σ it ≡ (1 / 5)Σ τ | GDPit − ∆GDPi | for non-overlapping, mutually
exclusive five-year periods, where GDP denotes the natural logarithm of GDP.
We start directly with five-year averages in order to provide a better estimate of business
cycle volatility. The coefficients of interest again are β1 and β2. The benchmark results for the
volatility equation are reported in Table 8. From the first column we conclude, that the
coefficients on both de jure and de facto regimes are not statistically significant at the 5% level
of significance. This implies that having an explicit target does not affect output volatility – that
is, average absolute deviation of output growth from its mean. If the target is successfully
achieved, however, then the volatility is reduced by about half of a percentage point. This result
should not be over-interpreted as it is significant only at the 10% level.
The rest of Table 8 reports several sensitivity checks. In column 2 we drop the dummy
for “Success in achieving the target” and in column 3 we drop the de jure variable. In both cases
the estimates of the regime remain insignificant. Adding a lag of our volatility measure does not
change the main conclusion that explicit targets do not affect significantly volatility of output.
In Table 9 we explore the sensitivity of these results in several dimensions. We start by
including Argentina and Brazil in column (1) and by removing all of the high inflators in column
(2). Again, hitting the target has a negative effect on volatility but statistically this result is
significant at the 10% level at best. Adding unobserved time effects increases the significance of
the success variable, but overall we find that there is little evidence to support any claim on the
effect of policy regimes on output volatility.

19

Table 10 dis-aggregates the effects of monetary regimes on output volatility into those
due to inflation, money growth, and exchange rate targets. There are no significant results that
one can interpret here. Table 11 pursues instrumental variable estimation so as to account for
endogeneity. When we use our political and education variables as instrumental variables, and
also when we add lagged regimes, the effects of de jure and de facto regimes remain statistically
insignificant, which could be again a signal that these are poor instruments or that volatility is
indeed unrelated to the monetary policy regime. Finally, in Table 12 we provide analogues to
OLS and IV estimation of our default model, but measuring output volatility in three different
ways: a) the average absolute value of the deviation of real GDP from HP-filtered real GDP (in
logs), b) the average absolute value of deviation of output growth from a ten-year average
growth rate, or c) the standard deviation of output growth computed over (mutually exclusive)
decades of annual data.11 The estimates of having a de jure quantitative monetary target are
insignificant, but the estimates for successfully hitting this target are typically but not
overwhelmingly statistically significant.
The conclusion from the volatility regressions is that, at a minimum, having an explicit
monetary target does not increase the volatility of the economy. On the contrary, our evidence
suggests that the coefficients on successfully hitting a target are negatively and significantly (in
the economic sense) associated with lower volatility. Under several perturbations of our model
these coefficients are statistically significant at the 10% level.

5. Conclusions
In this paper we investigate the effect of quantitative targets for monetary policy on
inflation and business cycle volatility. We combine data for three types of targets for monetary
11

We use a smoothing parameter of λ=100.

policy (exchange rate targets, money growth targets, and inflation targets), so as to be able to
compare the effects of both having and hitting transparent objectives for monetary policy against
the alternative of having unclear or qualitative goals. Using a panel of macroeconomic data
covering over forty years of annual data and countries, we find that having a quantitative de jure
target for the monetary authority tends to lower inflation and smooth business cycles; hitting that
target de facto has further positive effects. These effects are economically large, typically
statistically significant and reasonably insensitive to perturbations in our econometric
methodology.
During the past decade, there has been much emphasis placed on the importance of
transparent goals for monetary authorities; the current consensus is that central banks should
independently pursue well-defined goals in a transparent fashion. Our results lead us to conclude
that this emphasis seems justified.

Appendix: Growth
We briefly turn in passing to the effects of the monetary policy regime on economic
growth. This question has been an issue of heated debate. The most recent evidence on the issue
comes from the paper of Levi-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003) who document that in a large set
of countries a fixed exchange rate regime leads to lower economic growth. To address this
question in our data set we use as a benchmark model following specification:

∆yit = β1DJTargetit + β2Successit
+ γ1Openit + γ2GovSpendit-1 + γ3GDPpcit-1 + γ4 PopGRit-1 + γ4 Secondaryit-1+ εit
where i denotes a country, t denotes a five-year period, and t-1 denotes the average over the
previous (non-overlapping) five-year period. The other variables are:
•

∆y denotes the five-year average growth rate of country i calculated from annual data

•

DJTargett is a dummy variable that is one if the country had a quantitative monetary policy
target during period t, and zero otherwise,

•

γi is a set of nuisance coefficients,

•

Success is a dummy variable that is one if the country hit its de jure quantitative target during
t, and zero otherwise,

•

Open is trade (exports plus imports) as a percentage of GDP,

•

GovSpend is government spending as a percentage of GDP,

•

GDPpc is the natural logarithm of real GDP per capita from the previous five-year period,

•

PopGR is the growth rate of population

•

Secondary is the percentage of males over 25 years old with completed secondary degree of
education

•

ε is a well-behaved residual term for all other growth determinants.

32

The specification of the controls in the growth regression is standard. The initial GDP
per capita is expected to have a negative sign under the conditional convergence hypothesis,
openness should enter with a positive sign as more open economies are expected to grow faster
(Frankel and Romer, 1999), higher government spending will slow down economic growth,
which implies a negative sign for γ2; population growth can be positively correlated with real
growth and negatively with the growth rate of real GDP per capita; and, education is expected to
be positively correlated with output growth. We have decided to use again five-year averages
because most of the theories cited above refer to long-term growth rates and the five-year
average seems to be the shortest period for which one can reasonably argue that the variables
capture long-term growth rates.
Table A1 starts with the benchmark results in the first column. The first coefficient of
interest, which captures the effect of an explicit target on growth, is insignificant statistically and
it implies that the economic impact of an explicit target is negligible. The success in
implementing the target is negative, but again insignificant. Although the fit of the regression is
relatively good with an R2 of 50%, it seems that neither having, not hitting the target affects
economic growth in our sample of countries.
In Table A2, we report some standard robustness checks. In general we do not find much
evidence to support a claim that monetary targets affect growth positively or negatively. Only
when time effects are included in the regression, there is some evidence that having a target is
significant the 5% level.
Overall we find some evidence that the having an explicit target leads to faster economic
growth, but we quickly point out that this evidence is quite fragile and most of the time
insignificant at conventional levels.

Appendix: Classification of Monetary Policy Regimes
Data on exchange rate regimes comes from Reinhart and Rogoff (2004). The de jure
classification (downloaded from Carmen Reinhart’s web site) is based on the official IMF
classification. We label all observations as having an exchange rate target with the exception of
those in the category freely floating. As a de facto classification we use their natural
classification (see the appendix of their paper and additional materials available at Carmen
Reinhart’s web site for detailed analysis of each of the countries in our sample).
The data on inflation and money targets comes from different sources. We will refer to several
references below. For recent years, web sites of the corresponding central bank have also been
used as confirmation. In some cases, there were disagreements about the sources on the starting
year. Our main references are Cottarelli and Gianoni (1997) (CG) for all regimes and Mishkin
and Schmidt-Hebbel (2002) (MS) for inflation targets. In addition, for developed countries, we
also use Agenor (2002). Other general references for inflation and money targets are Sterne
(2002), Siklos (1999) and Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin and Posen (1999).

Inflation targets
When it comes to the classification of inflation targets, there are very few cases of disagreement
on the years were inflation targets were present. There are some minor disagreements on the
exact month were the policy was started (and in those cases we make a judgement call). Same is
true for the ranges set for the inflation target that we use to assess whether the target was hit or
not. The biggest complication is to define a range when a single point is used as a target. In some
cases we take the single number as maximum and set a range for 0% to that number. We do this
when there is clear evidence that the central bank is trying to reduce inflation. In some other
cases we set a band around this central point. We look for a historical reference within the same
central bank to establish the size of the band (for example, a band set in previous years or in the
years that follow). In the absence of any historical reference, we use +/– 1%.

Money Targets
The classification of money targeters is a much more difficult one. The reason is that there are a
large number of central banks that use money aggregates as references but cannot be properly
considered as having a target for money (for the same reason that most central banks use
inflation forecasts but we have not included them as targeting inflation). At the same time, we do
not want to be too strict because we want to base our classification as much as possible on the
words they use and not on their actions given that we will be checking later whether they met
their targets or not. What we have done is to collect as much information as possible on each of
the central banks and make a judgement call on whether or not the central bank had a target for a
monetary aggregate that was meaningful.

Spain dropped money targets in 1994 and adopted inflation targets in 1995 (“a new framework based on inflation
targeting was announced in January 1995”). After 1999, Spain becomes part of EMU so policies are ECB policies.
