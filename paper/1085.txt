Length of Service and the Operation
of Internal Labor Markets

ABSTRACT

This paper presents a suxmnary of the evidence which has recently

been

collected concerning the role of length of service in the operation

of internal labor markets. It argues

that these data are inconsistent

with the human capital model of the experience_earnings and experience—

layoff relationships. The paper concludes by asserting that if we are
ever to fully understand the role of service, new data are needed.

Everyone knows that employees with more years of service at a company

normally receive higher pay than comparable employees who have spent less time

with the same firm.' Within the economics profession, the conventional wisdom
of the 1960s and 1970s has been that the observed higher relative earnings of
employees with longer service reflect greater accumulation of human capital

through on—the—job training and thus higher relative productivity.2 There
are, however, numerous other plausible explanations for the higher relative
earnings of employees with longer service in which relative productivity plays

a much less significant role. For instance, Jacob Mincer recognized the
possibility that the positive association between job tenure and earnings
might only "reflect the prevalence of institutional arrangements such as

seniority provisions in employment practices." He then implicitly describes
one approach to testing the human capital belief: "Such practices, however,
do not contradict the productivity—augmenting hypothesis, unless it can be
shown that growth of earnings under seniority provisions is largely
independent of productivity growth."3
Although the test required to establish empirically that the human
capital explanation of the company service—earnings profile is superior to
alternaUve .iodels in which other factors determine earnings growth seems
straightforward,

there is no evidence demonstrating that tenure—earnings

differentials can

in fact be explained by tenure—productivity differentials.

As a result, important beliefs about earnings differentials and related
labor market phenomena have been held without any apparent empirical foundation.

2

Our work on the operation of enterprise internal labor markets has

produced very strong evidence that at least the within—grade or within—job
fraction of the observed return to years of company service (40 to 80 percent
of the total return to company service in the settings for which we have seen
data) cannot be explained on the basis of an underlying relationship between

service and productivity. Furthermore, we have collected survey data which
imply that years of service play a significant role in promotion decisions for
a very large fraction of our country's workforce; for those employees, the
cross—grade or cross—job earnings differential associated with service must
also be considered at least in part a return to service per se.

It would thus

appear that junior workers are typically paid less, and senior workers more,

than the value of their marginal product. One might expect this sort of
deferred compensation scheme to be accompanied by constraints on firms'

ability to cheat workers out of the return promised for the "second half" of

their work lives; we hae gathered evidence that senior employees at most U.S.
firms do in fact enjoy substantial protection against being involuntarily

terminated. Our results raise the intriguing question of why senior workers
receive higher earnings than their junior peers, even though they are no more
productive.

The remainder of this paper discusses how the facts just stated were
discovered and the necessity for the collection of additional facts if we are
to hold empirically—based beliefs about why service per se plays such an
important role in private sector U.S. enterprises.

3

The Facts on Service—Earnings Differentials
Within Grades or Jobs

To determine whether service—earnings differentials can be explained by
service—productivity differentials, it is necessary to search for measures of

individuals' relative contributions to their firms. We looked first at the
computerized personnel files for exempt (roughly, managerial and professional)
employees of four major U.S. corporations; each file had information on

individuals' job performance, company service, and earnings. At three of
these companies the performance ratings were done by the employee's immediate
supervisor; at the fourth, in addition to the immediate supervisor's rating,
there was a ranking of each employee relative to others in an appropriate
comparison group. Later, }Ialasz gained access to a comparable data set for a
sample of nonexempt salaried employees.4
Under all of the companies' evaluation procedures, supervisors are
instructed to base their rating or ranking on how well an individual, in the
year of evaluation, is carrying out the responsibilities of his or her job.
Thus, a performance review should reflect an employee's current level of
performance relative to the level of performance deemed normal for someone in

his or her position. It follows that the relative contributions of employees
can be assessed from their performance ratings only if the employees hold
similar jobs.

For compensation purposes, most companies assess the relative importance
and difficulty of their myriad exempt and nonexempt salaried positions and

group them into grade levels. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that within
a grade level, a higher performance rating implies higher productivity. It is
for this reason that we, and }Lalasz, were forced to look within grades in

4

doing our analysis of the determinants of service—earnings differentials.

Fortunately, however, the portion of the total return to years of service
occurring within grade was between 40 and 50 percent of the total differential
for our four samples of white, male, exempt employees and 50 percent for
Halasz's sample of nonexempt salaried employees.

The key finding of these analyses was that none of the substantial,
within—grade, service—earnings differentials could be explained by a within—

grade, service—performance differential. Contrary to what would be expected
under the on—the—job training model, while greater service moved employees
toward the upper tail of the earnings distribution for their grade level, it

did not move them toward the upper tail of the relevant performance

distribution. Once employees are assigned to grades, the salary advantage
that accrues with company service appears to be automatic, and hence,

independent of productivity.

This result has been challenged on two grounds. First, it has been
charged that the estimated service—performance differential is biased downward
since a negative partial correlation between years of service and unobserved
quality was induced by the necessity of looking only within grade levels.
(This bias would be brought about by a promotion system under which merit at

least sometimes prevails over seniority, so that longer service within grade

implies more times passed over for promotions.) Second, it has been claimed
that performance ratings, even for samples of white males, are not valid
indicators of relative productivity.

There likely is a negative within—grade correlation between service and
ability (largest in absolute value for exempt employees and smallest in

5

absolute value for unionized hourly workers), so that the estimated within—

grade effect of service on performance is probably biased downward. It must
be remembered, however, that the estimated within—grade effect of service on

earnings is biased downward in the same way. The goal of the analyses of
employees' positions in the relevant performance and salary distributions was
not to derive consistent estimates of the effect of service on either

performance or salary. Rather, they were intended to yield an answer to the
question: Can performance explain the substantial within—grade earnings
advantage enjoyed by longer—service salaried employees at the firms we have

studied? Our answer of 'no" does not depend on the consistency of the
estimate of the impact of service on performance or on earnings. All that the
response depends on is that the difference between these two estimated service
effects (which have been made comparable through the construction of the

performance and earnings categories used in the models estimated) be a
consistent estimate of ihe difference between the two "true" service effects.
We know of no reason why it should not be.
In our previously cited articles on the issue at hand, we go to great

lengths to address the most likely criticisms of subjective performance

ratings. In light of what we have been able to learn from our review of the
relevant personnel literature, from the case studies we have done, and from
various analyses with company personnel data, we feel very comfortable
assuming that performance ratings are good indicators of employees' relative

productivity in the year of evaluation. The diverse evidence we have seen
seems to support strongly the interpretation that we have given to our results

6

concerning the ability of rated performance to explain the within—grade return
to years of service.

Further support for our conclusion regarding within—grade service—
earnings differentials can be derived from a recent econometric case study
done by Yanker in which an "objective" productivity measure is used to conduct

an analysis like those just discussed.5

Yanker examined

productivity and earnings data for approximately 400 blue collar employees at

a unionized manufacturing plant. The productivity measure used was equal to
the time a worker took to do his or her job divided by the standard time for

performing the job. The study found that none of the within—job service—
earnings differential (80 percent of the total service—earnings differential)
could be explained on the basis of more senior workers having higher
productivity.

An appendix to this paper summarizes the studies just mentioned, plus
twenty—one other studies relating some index of productive value to tenure or
age in various settings.

These analyses examined employees within disparate

occupations: production workers (in the wooden household furniture, footwear,
and apparel industries); scientists; engineers; teachers; mail sorters; and

office workers. Fourteen of these additional studies used objective measures
of productive value including: furniture, shoes, or apparel produced;
publications; patents; students' standardized test scores; mail sorted; pages

typed; items filed; or cards punched. This research provides support for the
proposition that, beyond a typically short orientation period, those who have
greater than average service typically perform no better or less well than

those with similar assignments who have less than average service. When

7

considered together with

the

evidence from various sources that wages have a

strong positive relationship with tenure within occupational group, these
investigations strongly imply that more (less) senior employees are generally
paid uiore (less) than the value of their marginal product. Extant evidence on

service—productivity differentials seems to have the same implication about
the role of productivity in explaining within—grade or within—job service—
earnings differentials whether the index of relative productive value is based
on an •'objective" measure or on a subjective" performance rating.

The Facts on the Role of Service per se
in Promotion Decisions
To determine whether the 20 to 60 percent of the monetary return to years
of company service that occurs across grades can be explained in terms of a
service—productivity differential, it is necessary to understand the role of

service independent of productivity in promotion decisions. To take a step in
this direction, we surveyed a randomly selected sample of 1,025 Standard and

Poor's companies about, among other things, the conditions under which a
junior employee would be promoted ahead of a senior coworkers who was not as

good a performer.6 The question asked was:
In actual practice, are junior employees prornted
instead of more senior employees who want the job?
(

) Yes,

(

) Yes,

(

)

if it is believed that the junior employee will do better than
the senior employee on the next job or on later jobs.
if it is believed that the junior employee viii do significantly
better than the senior employee on the next job or on later jobs.

No, never.

8

The responses to this query are summarized in Table 1.

They indicate that T6

percent of private sector, nonagricultural, nonconstruction, unionized

hourly

employees work in settings where senior employees are favored substantially

vhen promotion decisions are made; for nonunion hourly employees, the
comparable estimate is 56 percent; for non—exempt salaried employees, 50
percent; and for exempt salaried employees, 48

percent.

Overall, we estimate

that perhaps 60 percent of our country's private sector, nonagriculcural,
rionconstruction employees work in settings where senior employees are favored

substantially in the promotion process.7 Hence, for this large part of the
U.S. workforce, it appears that the piece of the total monetary return to

seniority that can be linked to senior employees who have been promoted to
better—paying jobs than are held by otherwise comparable junior employees is
to a significant extent a reward to seniority per se, rather than simply a

reward for higher productivity. Moreover, it should be noted that the 60
percent figure estimates the fraction of the private sector, nonagricultural,

nonconstruction workforce employed where senior employees seem to be favored
substantially in promotion choices; the percentage working where senior

employees are favored at all is likely to be much greater. This is because in
many settings senior employees can be expected to have a significantly higher
probability of being promoted than their junior colleagues when the
comparisons are limited to those with the same productivity.

Hence, it appears that only just over a third of private sector
nonagricultural, nonconstructjon employment in the United States is found in
aettings where the sole monetary return to seniority per se is

the

substantial

premium that occurs within grade level or job category; the other nearly two—thirds

appears to be found where the earnings advantage associated with seniority
independent of productivity occurs both as a result of the assignments given
to employees and as a result of the way they are paid for doing a given task.

The Facts on the Role of Service per se
in Termination Decisions
We would expect that the compensation scheme found at most U.S.
workplaces would go hand—in--hand with a provision designed to protect workers

from being cheated Out of the return promised for the "second half" of their

work lives. To determine the extent to which protection of this nature
conditioned firms' decision making about which employees to terminate when
some could not be retained, we also asked the folloving question of our
randomly selected samp:'.e of firms:8

In

the event of a workforce reduction, are senior employees
permanently laid off in place of junior employees?
(

)

(

)

()

Yes, if it is believed that the junior employee will be
worth more on net to the company than the senior
employee.
Yes, if it is believed that the junior employee will be
worth significantly more on net to the company than the
senior employee.
No, never.

The expression "worth more on net" was used to mean "worth more consider-

ing both performance and earnings, today and in the future." The "signifi
cantly more on net' and the "no, never" responses are thus consistent with the
statement that the firm can be expected to incur significant short—run costs
to protect its senior workers' earnings claims.
The answers from the survey respondents who had witnessed involuntary

terminations are summarized in Table 2. They indicate that approximatelY 85

work in settings where senior employees do in fact enjoy substantially greater
protection against job loss than junior employees doing similar work.9
Importantly, there appear to be substantial differences between union and

nonunion settings in this regard. Rules protecting senior workers against
being permanently laid off before their junior coworkers appear to be both more
prevalent and stronger under trade unions. For hourly employees, almost 100
percent of the responses pertaining to groups covered by collective bargaining
implied that seniority in and of itself receives substantial weight in
termination decisions, while only 85 percent of the responses pertaining to

noncovered groups indicated that this is the case. As for "strength," while
84 percent of our survey responses that pertained to unionized hourly

employees indicated that a senior worker would never be involuntarily
terminated before a junior worker, the same was true for only 42 percent of
the responses pertaining to nonunion hourly employees.

The Facts to Be Collected
An explanation of why senior workers doing a given job ifl

U.S. corpora

tions receive higher salaries than their junior, but no less valuable,

coworkers remains to be documented. At present, there are a number of
theories that might be considered consistent with our findings. One group of
potertial explanations revolves around the notion that employers and employees
may enter Into Implicit contracts that provide that earnings be deferred
toward the end of the worklife. Firms may offer such contracts: (1) to deter

quits or behavior that would lead to discharge;10 (2) to discourage workers
with high propensities to quit from seeking employment with the firm;11

(3)

to

13

improve morale by giving employees regular raises,

and (4) to insure

relatively risk—averse employees against slow earnings growth that might

otherwise be associated with slow productivity

growth.12 A second type of

explanation might be that such contracts avoid the unpleasantness felt by a
supervisor who has to fire or reduce the relative salary of a long—time

subordinate. A third issue that deserves mention is that societal beliefs ——

for

example, the idea that elders should be respected

—— may condition

employeest beliefs concerning "just" relative compensation.
Unfortunately, at this point, all of these theories suffer the same
deficiency as the human capital theory about the service—earnings profile:

absence of an empirical basis. More facts concerning enterprise internal
labor markets must be forthcoming if we are to do more than guess about why
service independent of productivity is rewarded so highly in the pricing and

allocation of labor. We must remember that statements with no factual basis
are conjectures, no matter how empirical they may sound. Empiricism requires
data.

the fractions of private sector, nonagricultural, nonconstruction employment
in each of these same three groups. The employment figures were derived from
the May 1978 Current Population Survey (CPS): union members paid by the hour,
17 percent; nonmembers paid by the hour, 43 percent; and nonhourly employees,
40 percent, of which 8 percent were union and 92 percent were nonunion. There
was no way to distinguish noriexempt and exempt salaried employment on the CPS.

Methodology and Conclusions

Subject Group
and Study

Recently—hired first
line supervisors at
a manufacturing
plant (Brown [1982]).

Performance ratings for approximately 200 persons hired over a
six year period were used in the analysis. Other factors the
same, years in supervisory position had a positive effect on
rated performance. However, the mean amount of company service
among those in the sample was only three years.

Exempt employees at
a large manufacturing
firm (Medoff and
Abraham [1981]).

Data on salary, performance rating assigned by supervisor, job
grade level and individual characteristics for approximately
8,000 white male employees at a large company were taken from
that company's computerized personnel file. Approximately
40 percent of the higher earnings associated with seniority
took the form of higher earnings within grade level. While
additional company service beyond the mean amount increased
the probability of being towards the top of the within-gradelevel salary distribution, it decreased the probability of being
towards the top of the within—grade—level performance distribution. In addition, analysis of longitudinal data on pay and
performance revealed that, for those staying in the same job
grade level over time, relative within—grade—level salary rose
but relative within—grade—level rated performance fell.

Production and warehouse employees at a
nonunion manufacturing plant (Halasz
[1980]).

Salary, performance rating, job grade level and infornation on
individual characteristics were taken from approximately 300
non—exempt employees' personnel records. For these employees,
approximately 50 percent of the return to seniority took the
form of higher earnings within grade level. Additional
company service beyond the mean amount increased the probability of being towards the top of the within—grade—level
salary distribution but decreased the probability of being
towards the top of the within—grade—level performance distribution.

Exempt employees at
two large manufacturing firms (Medoff
and Abraham [1980]).

Cross—sectional results virtually identical to those reported
in Medoff and Abraham (1981) were obtained with data for
several thousand white male employees at each of two large
manufacturing firms.

Methodology and Conclusions

Blue collar
employees at a
unionized
manufacturing plant
(Yanker [1980]).

Data on hourly rate of pay, productivity, job grade level and
individual characteristics for approximately 400 workers were
taken from their personnel records. The productivity measure
was equal to the time the worker took to do his/her job divided
by the standard time for performing the job. Approximately
80 percent of the earnings return to seniority occurred within
job grade level; none of this within—grade--level return could
be explained on the basis of more senior workers having higher
productivity.

Scientists
(Cole [19781).

Cross—sectional data for a random sample of U.S. scientists
in six disciplines showed a peak among those aged 40 to 44
both in mean number of papers published and in the importance
of published works as measured by number of citations. However, all differences in mean output between adjacent age
groups were very small. Longitudinal data for the cohort
of U.S. mathematicians who got their Ph.D.'s between 1947
and 1950 showed no relationship between time since receiving
Ph.D. and either number of publications or number of citations
to those publications.

Airline
managers
(Medoff [1977]).

Cross—sectional results very similar to those in Medoff and
Abraham (1981) were obtained using data for approximately
800 managers employed by an airline.

Sixth grade
teachers
(Summers and
Wolfe [1977]).

The change between third grade and sixth grade in individual
students' composite achievement score on the Iowa Test of
Basic Skills was used as a measure of educational output.
Sixth grade teachers' experience was measured in years, up to
11 years. A total of 627 usable observations were obtained.
Controlling for other factors, students whose third—grade
scores were above the norm benefited from additional sixth-grade teacher experience, but among those with third—grade
scores below the norm, additional teacher experience was
associated with smaller changes in test score.

Scientists and
engineers (Hall
and Mansfield

Performance data was collected for 290 researchers in 22
research and development organizations using questionnaires
which asked people to rate their own performance relative to
others in similar positions by placing themselves on a 7—point

scale ranging from "in top 5%" to "in the lower 25%". The same
questionnaire was readininistered to 90 of the researchers two
years later. Cross—sectional analyses of the two sets of
responses found self—rated performance to be uncorrelated with
seniority.
Inner—city third
grade teachers
(Murnane [1975]).

Progress made during third grade in math and in reading by each
of approximately 900 black students was measured using changes
in the students' standard scores on Metropolitan Achievement
Tests. Controlling for other factors, the biggest improvement
in students' test scores was observed for teachers with three
to four years of experience. Teachers with five or more years
of experience were found to be no more effective or less
effective than teachers with three or four years of experience.

Engineers in
technology—based
commercial
industries (Dalton
and Thompson [1971]).

Three measures of performance were collected for approximately
2,500 design and development engineers at six companies: (1)
performance ratings done by management; (2) management evalua—
tions of the complexity of engineers' assignments; and (3)
engineers' own assessments of what happens to the productivity
of those doing technical work as they age. Rated performance
was highest for those aged 31 to 35 and fell sharply thereafter. Those 26 to 30 performed the most complex tasks, with
older engineers doing much less complex work. The engineers
themselves said peak productivity for those doing technical
work occurred at age 38. However, salaries were substantially
higher for those in each successive age bracket through the
41 to 45 year-old group and were level beyond age 45.

students in a large California school system was used. Indi—
vidual students' third grade Stanford Achievement test scores
were used as a measure of educational output, Controlling
for students' first grade test scores and other relevant
factors, neither second grade teachers' experience nor third
grade teachers' experience was found to have any significant
effect on third grade test score.

Male production
managers (Tenopyr
[1969]).

Methodology and Conclusions

Data was collected on 113 male production managers in one division of a rocket engine development and manufacturing concern.
The study focused on how well various tests of leadership
potential predict managerial success, but included a correlation analysis of seniority versus performance. Two measures
(1) immediate supervisors were
of performance were used:
asked to check descriptive statements about each manager and
integral weights from 0 to 4 were applied in scoring the
checklists; and (2) the company's labor relations staff rated
the manager's handling of employee relations matters on a
7—interval scale. For the 86 subjects for whom both performance measures were available, seniority was not found to
be significantly correlated with either rating.

Research
scientists
(Eiduson [1966]).

Longitudinal data on average number of papers published per
year during each of two successive five—year periods was
collected for 40 research scientists ranging in age from their
30's to their 60's. Subjects' curriculum vitae were the source
of the publication information. Productivity was steady for
those aged 30 to 39 at the end of the first five—year period,
grew slightly for those aged 40 to 49, and fell off for those
aged 50 or greater.

Research
chemists
(Stewart and
Sparks [1966]).

Number of patent memoranda, number of patent applications and
number of patents issued were used as measures of productivity.
Altogether 962 man—years worth of data for 89 men in one
division of a large industrial scientific research organization were collected. Each of these 962 man—years was treated
was treated as a separate observation in a cross—sectional
analysis. All three patent variables were positively correlated with length of service; however, the positive association between patent activity and length of service was much
weaker beyond 10 years of service than prior to that cutoff.

Employees of
one multi—
department firm
(Svetik, Prien,
and Barnet [19661).

Supervisors were asked to complete a performance evaluation
of each of their subordinates, rating them on "overall
effectiveness," which was not explicitly defined. A signif i—
cant negative correlation was found between these ratings and
individual employees' length of service. The supervisors'
ratings were also negatively correlated with salary.

OF STUDIES PERTAINING TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF TENURE,
EXPERIENCE AND AGE TO PRODUCTIVITY
(continued)

Methodology and Conclusions

Production records covering an eight—week period for approxi—
mately 6,000 workers in twelve cities were analyzed. An index
of performance was computed for each worker by dividing his/her
production score by the average production score of all workers
aged 35 to 44 doing similar work in the same city. Those with
less than six months service had the lowest
average performance
index; beyond six months, length of service seemed to be unimportant.
Five measures of current performance were collected for a
cross—section of 1,311 scientists and engineers working in 11
research laboratories: (1) contribution to scientific knowl—
edge, as judged by colleagues; (2) overall usefulness to
laboratory, again as judged by colleagues; (3) published
papers; (4) patent applications; and (5) unpublished papers.
All the performance measures were for the five—year period
prior to the date of the study. For those in research laboratories, measured performance typically was highest among those
aged 35—44 as of the time of the study; for those in
development laboratories, the peak occurred among those 45 to 49.
Performance among those immediately beyond the peak age group
was sharply lower. A second peak in performance was evident
10 to 15 years beyond the first performance peak.

Data on physical volume of production per hour worked over an
observation period of 4 to 12 weeks was collected for approxi—
mately 6,000 workers in 5 federal agencies and 21 private
companies. An index of performance was computed for each
worker by taking the ratio of his/her output to the average
output of those aged 35 to 44 employed at the same firm
and doing comparable work. Among workers with 9 months or
more experience on the job, there was practically no difference in the mean value of the performance index
across age
groups, either within occupational groups or when an average
was taken across the occupational groups. A
large proportion
of those included in the sample were under incentive payment
schemes. However, the results looked very similar for those
under incentive and those under time payment plans.

Methodology and Conclusions

Technical employees
in a large research
and engineering
firm (Oberg [1960)).

Performance of approximately 900 technical employees in one
firm was estimated using cross—sectional data on individuals'
positions in the annual order—of—merit rankings of technical
employees. These rankings were done on a department by department
basis for salary administration purposes. The criterion used
in ranking was the workers' "present value to the company."
This criterion was not defined more precisely. Among those
doing research and development work, performance was highest
for those 30 to 35 and fell off gradually thereafter. Among
those doing engineering work, performance fell off for those
aged 32 through SO, then showed a second peak for those in
their 50's.

Retail sales
personnel
(Canadian
Department of
Labor [1959]).

The dollar volume of sales for clerks in two large department
stores were used to form performance ratings of 1 through 4,
depending on each individuals' quartile position in the dis—
tribution of dollar sales for his/her department. At one
store, mean rated performance was lower for those with less
than 3 years' service than for those in the longer service
groups, and weakly but positively related to service thereafter. At the second store, mean rated performance was lower
for those with less than 6 years' service than for those with
more service and again weakly but positively related to service
thereafter.

Production workers
in the wood
household furniture
industry and the
footwear industry
(Bureau of Labor
Statistics [1957]).

For approximately 5,100 workers in 15 footwear establishments
and 11 furniture establishments, output per worker—hour was
measured using average straight time hourly piecework earnings.
The production index used for comparison purposes was each
individual's average hourly earnings divided by the mean of
average hourly earnings for those of the same sex in the
35 to 44 age group doing the same job in the same plant. In
both industries and for both sexes, the mean value of the
production index was highest for those aged 25 to 34 and fell
beyond that age group.

Production workers
in the footwear
industry and the
clothing industry
(Bureau of Labor
Statistics (1956]).

Piecework earnings data for 933 workers in the footwear industry
and 1,284 workers in the clothing industry were studied. The
data were used to create a production index like that used in
Bureau of Labor Statistics (1957), The mean value of this pro—
duction index was stable for all age groups through age 54 and
approximately 10 percent lower for those aged 55 to 64.

Methodology and Conclusions

Outstanding people
in a variety of
professional
occupations
(Lehman [1953]).

The goal of this study was to identify the age by which numerous
individuals in various fields had done their best work or
achieved their highest average rate of productivity. In the
majority of occupations, it was found that the individuals'
best work had been done by age 40. However, it should be
emphasized that the study focused on selected outstanding
individuals rather than on a representative sampling of members
of any occupation.

Shopcraft railroad
employees (Mater

Relative speed of work for a cross—section of 701 employees of
one railroad was used as a measure of worker efficiency.
Holding age constant, efficiency appeared to peak at about
10 years of service and fall thereafter.

[1941]).

Employees of large
New England
manufacturing
companies

(Palmer and
Brownell [1939]).

Records on productivity of workers at six companies were
broken down into a comparison of productivity by age

groups for 172 textile weavers, 127 textile spinners and
147 workers in nonferrous metal manufacturing. The records
did not show any tendency for productivity to vary with age.

a5 summary includes all the studies we know of from which inferences can be drawn
concerning the relationship between individuals' age or experience and their productivity. For the sake of keeping the list of manageable size, we have excluded
studies which related mean group age or experience to group output. However, the
conclusions of the studies based on group data do not seem to differ much from the
conclusions of those based on individual data.
