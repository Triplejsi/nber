Price arid Inventory Adjustment

an Open-Economy Model of the Business Cycle

ABSTRACT
This paper devf lops an open-economy macroeconomic model which can

be used to interpret the observed fluctuations in output, inventories, prices,

and exchange rates in the medium-sized economies of the world. The model is
consistent with the major empirical regularities that have been discovered in
studies of business cycles as closed-economy phenomena arid in empirical studies

of prices and exchange rates. The empirical regularities are (i) changes in
the nominal money supply cause real output fluctuations, (ii) deviations of

output from a "natural rate" show persistence, (iii) exchange rates are more
volatile than nominal prices of goods, and (iv) depreciations of the currency
coincide with deteriorations of the terms of trade. A controversial aspect of
the model is that only unperceived money has real effects. The channel through

which these effects arise involves a misperception by rational maximizing firms
of the true demand that they will face after having set prices. The firms learn
about their environment from equilibrium asset prices, and the dynamics of the
model reflect the optimal response of inventory-holding firms rather than ad hoc
price dynamics.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an open—economy model which
can be used to interpret the observed fluctuations in output, inventories,

prices, and exchange rates.

We have constructed the model to be

consistent with the empirical regularities that characterize fluctuations
in these magnitudes discovered in studies of business and inventory cycles

and with the empirical regularities concerning prices and exchange rates
ciscovered in open—economy studies.

At the center of our model is the optimization problem of domestic

These two regularities are:

changes in the money supply result in real output fluctuations and

(ii) deviations of output from a "natural rate" of output show
persistence. Fully perceived monetary shocks have no real effects in our

model, but unperceived monetary shocks affect real variables in our
framework because price—setting firms

are unable to infer from asset

prices the exact values of monetary disturbances and demand disturbances.
because

the demand for money in our model depends on expenditure by

domestic residents,

a positive expenditure disturbance (for example) is

also a positive money demand disturbance.

In this structure either a

positive money supply disturbance or a negative expenditure disturbance
will elicit incipient excess supply in the money market. Since firms see

only the equilibrating asset price responses to such incipient excess
supply, there is a tendency for firms to misperceive a positive money
supply shock as a negative disturbance to real demand for the home good.

Firms are led to lower their relative prices below what would be optimal

It is the distinction

between unperceived money and unexpected money which separates the
monetary business cycle models of the Lucas (1973) — Barro (1976, 1980)

The more recent work of Barro and Hercowjtz (1980) and Boschen and

Grossman (1983) does attempt to disentangle these two types of shocks.

Both sets o± authors find evidence which

they interpret as being

unfavorable to the hypothesis that the monetary portion of the U.S.
business cycle is due entirely to unperceived money.

Interpreting the

evidence as these authors have done requires the imposition of some strong
exogeneity assumptions involving the money supply process and the behavior

of the U. S. Federal Ieserve Board as well as some additional arbitrary
restrictions involving lack of correlation among disturbances.

A more

precise consideration of these issues will be given below in the context
of our model.
The

major empirical regularities confronting theories of exchange

determination are the following closely related facts: (i) exchange

4

rates are more volatile than nominal goods prices in the sense that for

one period ahead, exchange rates are harder to predict than are goods
prices, and (ii) countries' exchange rates are negatively correlated with

their terms of trade, that is, a currency depreciation tends to coincide

with a deterioration in the terms of trade. In light of these facts, the
dominant model of exchange—rate determination has become the one developed
by Dornbusch (1976).

In the Dornbusch model, markets in goods are in disequilibrium with

prices increasing in response to excess demand, but asset tnarkets are

continually

in equilibrium.

In typical stochastic presentation of the

framework, such as Mussa (1982), the domestic price of the home good is
treated as a preoetermine variable, unresponsive to current disturbances.

Thus, a positive monetary shock increases real balances which requires a
decrease in the nominal interest rate to reequilibrate the money market.
The

fall in the nominal interest rate is accomplisned by an over

depreciation of the domestic currency accompanied by the expectation that

the currency will appreciate. The currency depreciation deteriorates the

The early

7

work on this type of model as a theory of the firm was done by Halt,
Moai.glianj, Muth and Simon (1960) and by L.ovell (1961) and was extended by

label (1972). More recently, Feldstein and Auerbach (1976) and Eichenbaum

(193) have implementea versions of the model to study inventory
aajustment at the firm and

industry level, while Blinder and Fischer

(192), Blinder (1982), Amihud and Mendej.son (1982), Haraf (1981), and
1runner, Cukierman and Meltzer (19b2) have worked with variations of the
framework at the macroeconomic level. These latter models are designed to

incorporate optimal price and inventory adjustment into rational
expectations, closed economy macro models. While our model differs from

each of the above in many details, two points stand out.

First, the

dimension of price aggregation is different across our work and •the other

models. Because the other models are constructed for hypothetical closed
economy analysis, the only relative prices which concern firms are those

arising in comparisons across firms producing the same product.

Second, our firms make price and output decisions

sequentially, whereas the other models have simultaneous price and output
decisions and often treat both variables as predetermined with respect to

current period information.

While our

decisions are slightly

more difficult to anlayze, our results are consistent with three empirical
regularities.

actual sales and forecasts of sales, indicating that production responds
to unanticipated demand as in our

framework.

Since Feldzteiri and Auerbach

are quite cautious about the quality of the sales forecast data used

to

establish the point, we are correspondingly reluctant to use their data as
the only support for our modeling strategy.

The second and third regularities have been documented by Barro
(1977, 197a).

They concern the positive response of real output to

monetary shocks and the lack of strong econometric evidence in support of
"price surprise" terms in estimated aggregate supply functions. Our model
produces a positive response of output to monetary shocks only when output

is allowed to respond to actual demand. When output must be determined by
the firm at the beginning of the period using its current information set,

positive monetary shocks would induce firms to lower output because firms

misperceive positive monetary shocks as decreases in real demand.

Our

sequential decision strategy produces a positive response of output to
positive monetary shocks because positive monetary shocks are associated
with unexpectedly high demand given the posted prices of firms derived in
the first stage optimization. The final feature of our model which should

be noted in this introduction concerns a difference across moels in
transmission of the real effects of monetary shocks.

Since firms in our

model have full knowledge of the prices charged by other firms, monetary
shocks do not have real effects because of a "price surprise" term in the

aggregate supply function, which is a common feature of open and closed
economy models of the business cycle.5

While price surprise terms are crucial to many recent models of
business cycles, it. is disturbing that such shocks have not played an
.mportant role in econometric macro models.

Indeed, Barro (1981, p. 71)

9

I

writes,

!t(.iven the relatively minor role played by price surprises in the

results of Sargent (1976) and Fair (1979) ...,

it

appears that monetary

influences on output involve channels that have yet to be isolated."
Although additional econometric work may show that price surprise terms
are the primary transmission mechanism of monetary shocks, the response of
output in our model is consistent with the current evidence.

Our investigation yields three principal results.

First, monetary

disturbances produce persistent real output effects. The impact effect is

due to price—setting agents' confusion concerning the true nature of
disturbances impinging on asset markets.

The persistence is due to the

effect of inventory movements on future production decisions.

Second, our

rnoael precicts that output variance will be higher under fixed exchange

rates than under floating rates unless the monetary authority announces
the extent of intervention required to maintain the fixed rate.

This

result, which is similar to one derived by Kimbrough (1d2), is due to the

fact that fixing the exchange rate removes it as an information source
firms may use to infer real disturbances. Unless that information source

is replaced by intervention announcements, the quality of firms' infor—
cnation is poorer with fixed rates than with floating rates, and firms will

have a tenoency to react to disturbances with output changes rather than
with price changes.

Third, the model matches the open—economy empirical

The Open Economy Macro Model

This section presents an open economy macro model based in part on

the decision problems of rational profit maximizing firms.

Our

presentation is in two parts. In the first part, we develop the equations
of

the

goods markets which consist of demands for and supplies of the

goods produced in the medium sized open' economy being examined.

The

result of this part is a set of optimal decision rules governing pricing,

inventory accumulation, and production.

At

beginning of the period, agents choose their asset portfolios for the
period, and firms choose their prices for the period. These decisions are

based on identical incomplete information concerning the state of the
economy. Later in the period, firms and agents discover the actual level
of demand facing the firms.

Given the prices posted at the beginning of

the period, firms respond to the actual quantities demanded by choosing
profit maximizing levels of production and inventory accumulation.

Before turning to the formal

solution

of the model, it is useful to

summarize informally the working of the model.

At the beginning of each

perioa prices are set, and the exchange rate and interest rate are
determined. However, agents do not know, at this stage, the actual values

of the disturbances v, w and z.

The agents see all prices, the

exchange rate, the current money number, and both the domestic and foreign

interest rates. From these data the agents form inferences concerning the
values of the disturbances.

It is the inferred value of w, Etwt, which

teeds into the pricing decision. After prices are set, the actual value
of the demand disturbance aria the other disturbances are revealed to the

agents.

The firms then choose optimal production and inventory

accumulation based on the actual quantity demanoed which is determined in
part by the prices set under partial inforatiori and in part by the demand

distrubance, w.

The Solution
In this section we will provice our model's reduced form solutions

for the level of output, imventories, the exchange rate, the average
relative price of the domestic good, and

the nominal price of the domestic

The first step required in obtaining a solution is to extract

information from the clearing of the asset markets and from the money

decisions at the beginning ot' the period in both price setting and in the
asset markets depend on their perceptions of these distrubances, they will

use the information in I to draw inferences about the disturbances. We

assume that Etvt, Etwt, and Etzt denote the linear least squares
projections of the respective disturbances onto the information set

To find the values of these linear least squares estimates we must

IV. The Dynamics of the Mode].

As the reduced—form equations (20) indicate, the beginning of period

inventory stock, Nti, the actual money supply from the previous period9

and the stochastic disturbances v, w, and z. are the state
variables of the system.

We assume that actual money is known with a one

period lag. Therefore, the lagged nominal money stock does not influence

the real sector of the mode]., and since the logarithm of the actual
nominal money supply is assumed to follow a random walk, the exchange rate

and domestic price change equiproportionality to known changes in rn1.
Consequently, ANm =

31

After the initial response to the monetary shock, the economy adjusts

over time back to its unconditional equilibrium unless new stochastic
disturbances alter its path. Inventories begin to accumulate since firms

produce output in excess of demand which firms constrain by raising the
relative price of their product above its

unconditional equilibrium value.

The exchange rate falls in period t+1 to facilitate the improvement in the

terms of trade.

As Figure id indicates, the exchange

rate is then

expected to depreciate over time to its unconditional equilibrium value
SF(ml).

Rather than approach its new steady state from above as in the

Dornbusch (1976) framework, the approach is from below.

Now consider the influence of a positive shock to real demand which

First, the currency appreciates to

Second, agents think

Consequently, the exchange rate falls to reflect the perceived decrease in

V. Consistency with Empirical Regularities

and this section discusses the consistency of the implications of our
model with

Two empirical papers, one by Barro and Hercowitz (19d0), hereafter
referrea

3—G,

address this issue. It is important to discuss the relationship between
the present structure of our model and the regressions used to test
hypotheses in b—H and b—G because the results of these

studies provide

34

some evidence against the hypothesis that unperceived money is the primary
channel through which nominal money affects real variables.

For clarity of presentation, the stochastic processes v,

and

were specified as being jointly orthogonal as well as being independently
and identically distributed.

It turns out that the predictions of our

mocel in the jointly orthogonal case are inconsistent with the evidence
presented in B—G and B—h.

In each case, though, significant covariance

between v and z in one case and

and w in the other is enough to

overturn the apparent inconsistencies between the model and the data.

The two empirical propositions of B—G and B—H are the following: (i)
the measurement error between actual money and reported money should have

a sinjficant effect on real output, and (ii) reported money, since it is

fully perceived, should have no real effort.

rejected

The first hypothesis is

in B—H with U.S. annual average data from 1950-.75 and

in B—u with U. S. quarterly average data i'or 1953—78 while the second
hypothesis is rejected in B—G.

The hypotheses are most easily discussed in terms of the reduced form

the restriction that v, w, and z are mutually orthogonal, though,
implies that the OLS estimates

estimate. A sufficient condition to bias the coefficient toward zero is a
negative covariance between v and z. In a more complicated framework
with a complete covariance matrix, presumably other combinations of
covarlances wou1 bias the OLS estimate

toward zero as well.

Now consider the second empirical hypothesis of B—U.

In OLS

regressions of output on perceived money, the OLS estimate should be zero,

but it is estimated to be significantly different from zero by 9—0. This
is inconsistent with the present version of the model because OLS

covariances between v and

The second empirical regularity that was mentioned in the
introduction was that the exchange rate and the relative price of the

to coincide.

VI. A Positive Aspect of Exchange—Rate Regime Choice

model regarding

The conditional

(31)

which captures the variability of output relative to the level planned by
firms at the beginning of the

period.17

Implicitly, the analysis so far has been based on the assumption of
freeiy floating exchange rates.

Discussion of unsterilized intervention

requires that we introduce high—powered money created by purchases of
domestic credit or international reserves and recognize that monetary
transactions balances are a multiple of high—powered money.

information carried by the exchange rate under floating rates, and if such

revealed,

the stochastic distribution of output will be

invariant to exchange—rate regime choice.

An apparently important restrictive aspect of our model is that our
demand disturbance, w, is uncorrejated with any foreign variable.

Less

restrictive would be an assumption that the disturbance to demand for

Thus, when these shocks disturb the

thereby affects the quantity of domestic output demanded. With domestic-

This is the crucial difference between our model and

VII. Concluding Remarks

Our macel was constructed to be consistent with the major empirical
reularitjes discovered in studies of business cycles and those discovered
in Studies of prices and

exchange rates. Unexpected monetary disturbances

are not neutral in our model because price setting agents do not observe

money directly. They see only indicators of the underlying disturbances,
and they tena to confuse positive (negative) monetary shocks with negative

In contrast, the dynamics in the Dornbusch.-type model are

rationalized in terms of slow and 'costly price adjustments.
5.

Price surprises typically enter aggregate supply either through the

information confusion channel of Lucas (1973) or through the incomplete
wage indexing channel of Qray (1976) and Fischer (1977). The Gray—Fischer
framework has been particularly amenable to open economy analysis such as

that of Flood and Marion (1982).

Marston (1982) surveys recent open

economy models that generate aggregate supply curves containing price
surprise terms generated via wage indexation.
6

This seems to be a popular method for introducing monetary induced

business cycles into models. The wage indexing models of Gray (1976) and
Fischer (1977) follow this pattern. An alternative method for introducing

monetary influences into business cycles is that of Lucas (1973) where

decisions are not importantly sequential but important information
channels are assumed

not

to exist.

8oth approaches assume some curcial

transactions costs prohibit otherwise profitable transactions, and thus
both are somewhat unsatisfactory.

It is notable that not all business cycle models depend on price
surprise terms.

In particular, the simple Keynesian model, popular in

undergraduate texts, postulates demand—determined output with all prices
known to agents.

Further, Urossman and Weiss (182) and McCallum (1982)

present moaels designed to avoid price surprise terms in aggregate supply.
