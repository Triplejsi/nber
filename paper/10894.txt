What Happens When We Randomly Assign Children to Families?
Bruce Sacerdote
NBER Working Paper No. 10894
November 2004
JEL No. J0, I2
ABSTRACT
I use a new data set of Korean-American adoptees who, as infants, were randomly assigned to
families in the U.S. I examine the treatment effects from being assigned to a high income family, a
high education family or a family with four or more children. I calculate the transmission of income,
education and health characteristics from adoptive parents to adoptees. I then compare these
coefficients of transmission to the analogous coefficients for biological children in the same families,
and to children raised by their biological parents in other data sets. Having a college educated mother
increases an adoptee's probability of graduating from college by 7 percentage points, but raises a
biological child's probability of graduating from college by 26 percentage points. In contrast,
transmission of drinking and smoking behavior from parents to children is as strong for adoptees as
for non-adoptees. For height, obesity, and income, transmission coefficients are significantly higher
for non-adoptees than for adoptees. In this sample, sibling gender composition does not appear to
affect adoptee outcomes nor does the mix of adoptee siblings versus biological siblings.

Introduction
Social scientists have long been interested in the effects of family and neighborhood

environment on children's outcomes and the transmission of parental characteristics to children. For
example, Black, Devereux and Salvanes [2003] show that exogenous shocks to mother's education
have small effects on children's educational attainment, while Currie and Moretti [2003] show that
mother's education has a causal link to children's health. In a well known experiment Katz. Kling
and Liebman [2001] and Ludwig, Duncan and Hirschfield [2001] look at the effects of moving to a
different neighborhood on children's educational outcomes, employment and involvement with
crime. And there are large literatures that deal with the effects of schools and neighborhoods on
children's test scores, educational attainment, income, and health (e.g. Evans Oates and Schwab
[1992], Case and Katz [1991], Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin [1998], Hoxby [2000]).

This paper uses adoption in infancy as a form of grand intervention in which children are
assigned a particular set of adoptive parents, thereby creating exogenous variation in the family,
neighborhood and school environment. The adoptees in the study are Korean-Americans placed by
Holt International Children's Services during 1970-1980. The adoptees are randomly assigned to
families, conditional on the family being certified by Holt to adopt.

Holt uses a queuing (first-

come first-served) policy to assign Korean adoptees to families. I examine the degree to which
child's income, educational and health outcomes are affected by the adoptive parents' inputs.1

I find that mother's and father's level of education has a modest impact on the adoptees'
educational attainment and income. For example, an additional year of mother's education raises
the adoptee's years of education by .07 years. This effect is highly statistically significant, but is

2

only 1/4 the size of the corresponding effect for non-adoptees (biological children) raised in the
same families. My estimated treatment effects for the adoptees are smaller than those found by
Björklund Lindahl and Plug [2004], Plug [2004] and Sacerdote [2002], and this difference may be
driven by the lack of selection of the Holt adoptees into families. Consistent with Case, Lin and
McLanahan [2000], the quality-quantity tradeoff experienced by adoptees is very large. Growing
up in a family of four or more children versus a smaller family reduces an adoptee's probability of
attending college by 8 percentage points.2

The experiment of being adopted into one family versus another is potentially a much larger
intervention than the experiments normally contemplated by social scientists. For example, the
Moving to Opportunity experiment (Katz, Kling and Liebman [2001] and Kling, Ludwig and Katz
[2004]) shifts the complier subjects neighborhoods and schools but generally leaves the family unit
intact. And for most MTO subjects the intervention begins in adolescence rather than in infancy as
in the case of adoption. Other experiments such as charter school lotteries (Cullen, Jacobs and
Levitt [2004], Rouse [1998]) or school redistricting (Nechyba and Vigdor [2003]), create exogenous
variation in the school attended by the child. without directly altering the neighborhood or family
influences. And some experiments shift the peer group without shifting the school or neighborhood
(Hoxby [2000], Angrist and Lang [2002], Sacerdote [2001], Zimmerman [2002], Foster [2003]).

Adoption into a high versus low SES (socio-economic status) family is in some respect the
maximum possible intervention since every aspect of the adoptee's life is different. This is both
good and bad for the interpretation and use of the estimates produced. On the positive side, I can

This might be a quality-quantity tradeoff or it might be something unmeasured about the large families of adoptees.
Black, Devereaux Salvanes [2004] which instruments for family size would support the second interpretation. In the
point estimates, the effect is stronger for adoptees than non-adoptees.

3

argue that I am measuring an upper bound of the possible effects from policies that seek to improve
child's education or income by altering the school, neighborhood or family environment. Under
strong assumptions, I can express my results as a percent of the variation in child outcomes that can
be attributed to variation in nurture within the sample.3 On the negative side, I can not sort out
causal pathways by which the parent's SES affects the children.

Adoptive parent's income,

education, neighborhood and school quality all co-vary in the known ways.

Slightly more than 2 percent of all children in the US live with an adoptive mother and
father.

Thus there are roughly 1.4 million adoptees under age 18 for whom adoption policy is

directly relevant.

A natural question is whether or not adoption studies and mine in particular are relevant for
understanding outcomes for non-adoptees. Even though these families are all pre-screened as being
eligible to adopt through Holt, there is still a large amount of variation in family income, parental
education, and in the outcomes for the children in the families. For example, 20 percent of the
adoptive fathers in my sample have completed 12 or fewer years of education. The adoptees in the
sample have educational attainment and family income that is only modestly higher than U.S.
averages. The mean years of education for the Holt adoptees is 14.75 years versus 14.11 for AsianAmericans in the NLSY and 13.57 for all other subjects in the NLSY.4 For the biological children
in my sample, I obtain transmission coefficients of education that are similar to those found for
children raised by their biological parents in the PSID, Wisconsin Longitudinal Data, and the
national registry data for Sweden and Finland.

3

The question of how much environment (nurture) affects outcomes must always be measured relative to the variation
in nurture in the data. For example, there is likely an enormous positive effect on family income from moving a child
from an orphanage in South Korea to a US family, but I can not measure this effect.

Author's calculations from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. I use the 1979 sample weights to
approximate US averages.

The adoptees in the sample have roughly .9 fewer years of education than the non-adoptees
in the same families. But there is still substantial overlap in the distribution of outcomes for
adoptees and non-adoptees. The fact that all of the adoptees are Korean American may influence
some of the findings and I address this point several times in discussing the results.

Is transmission of education, income and health fundamentally different for US adoptees
versus all other US children? This question is ultimately impossible to answer. But in trying to
apply lessons learned from adoption data to children in general, I am reassured by the fact that the
adoptees in the sample resemble the population of non-adoptive children both in their outcomes and
in their nurturing parents' background.

A Brief History of Holt and Korean-American Adoption and the Assignment Process
Harry and Bertha Holt pioneered international adoption in Seoul, Korea in 1955. The
Holts had built a fortune in lumber and farming in Oregon and were so moved by the plight of
Korean war orphans that they lobbied Congress for a special act to adopt eight of them. When they
returned home with their new children, they discovered that many other Americans also wished to
adopt from Korea.

Since 1955 over 100,000 Korean children have been adopted into US families, and the
agency which grew out of the Holt’s initial work, now called Holt International Children’s Services,
has been involved in 30 to 40 percent of these adoptions. Holt currently places about 300 Korean
adoptees per year, and hundreds more from China and from programs in Bulgaria, Ecuador,
Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, , Mongolia, Philippines, Romania, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The process of adopting through Holt's Korea program takes roughly 12-18 months from
initial application to bringing home the adoptee. The major steps include filing an application,
participating in the home study assessment, attending adoption education classes, passing the
criminal background check, being matched with an adoptee, the adoptee flying to the U.S., and
legally adopting the child in family court. This is an extensive and thorough process requiring
numerous meetings with adoption agency officials and numerous exchanges of documents. In part
due to US and South Korean law, adoptive parents must meet several criteria including a minimum
family income and must be married for three years or longer.

Holt Children's Services of Korea, a separate organization from Holt International
Children’s Services, is in charge of matching children with qualified adoptive parents and does this
in a way which randomizes children into families. Within the Korea program and conditional upon

6

being qualified to adopt, children are matched to families on a first come, first served basis.
Parents are not given the opportunity to specify gender or anything else about their future adoptee.
The one exception to this rule is that families with all boys or all girls are allowed to request a child
of the opposite gender. In practice, those who are eligible to request girls frequently do so. This
does not present a problem for this study since I condition on adoptee gender in every specification.
The only other opportunity parents have to specify a preference is to indicate that they would be
open to adopting a child with special needs or a disability. I exclude all such adoptions from the
sample.

Thus it is the timing of when applications are completed that creates the matching of parents
to children, rather than any matching of parent and child characteristics. I provide evidence below
that the child's weight in infancy and other pre-adoption characteristics are uncorrelated with
adoptive parent characteristics such as family income, parental education etc.

Relation to the Adoption Literature
I follow the empirical approach of recent papers in economics including Björklund, Lindahl
and Plug [2004], Sacerdote [2002], Das and Sjogren [2002], and Plug and Vijverberg [2003] in that
I regress child outcomes on parent inputs, treating the adoptive parents as randomly assigned. The
paper differs from the existing literature in several ways: First and most importantly the data set is
constructed explicitly so that I have true random assignment of children to families. Second, I have
a number of outcomes that were not available to me or other economists in prior studies, such as
drinking, smoking, asthma, obesity and selectivity of the college attended.

Third in addition to calculating straight transmission coefficients (from parents to children)
for income and education, I take a broad approach and examine the effects of family size, birth

7

order, parental age and family gender composition. This allows me to test for effects of family size
and sibling gender in a context where the number and gender of siblings is randomly assigned to the
child.

There is a large adoption literature outside of economics and it has focused mostly on
estimating the heritability of IQ, as in Scarr and Weinberg [1978, 1981], and personality traits as in
Loehlin, Horn, and Willerman [1985, 1987, 1994], and Plomin, Defries, and Fulker [1988, 1991,
1997]. I depart from this literature in two ways.

First I focus on income, education and health

outcomes rather than IQ and personality traits. Second, I use a simple experimental design (random
assignment to adoptive family) without imposing the structural models used in the behavioral
genetics literature.

A series of papers including Taubman [1988], Behrman and Taubman [1989] and Behrman,
Rosenzweig and Taubman [1994] use comparisons of identical and fraternal twins to identify the
nature and nurture components of educational attainment and obesity. These papers impose a
structural model on the data in order to derive explicit formulae for the variance and covariance of
outcomes for the two different types of twins and their offspring. The identification of nature
versus nurture components comes from the fact that identical twins share precisely the same genes
whereas fraternal twins do not, and from a series of assumptions regarding how much family
environment and DNA is shared between siblings, first cousins, second cousins etc. Goldberger
[1989] points out a number of limitations to this approach.
Empirical Framework and Interpretation of Transmission Coefficients
In the results below I regress the adoptee's outcomes on the parent's inputs. Alternatively I
compare mean outcomes for treatment groups of adoptees where I form treatment groups on
mother's education, or income or family size. I interpret these coefficients (and differences in
8

means) as reduced form treatment effects. Assignment to treatment group is random due to Holt's
adoption process. All of the adoptees comply with their assigned treatment group. Because of the
randomization, I can interpret my estimates as the causal effect of being assigned to a particular
type of family. However, within the treatment effect I cannot parse out the extent to which the
effect is working through specific inputs such as mother's education, family income or unobserved
factors such as school quality, neighborhood quality etc.

In addition to calculating a series of treatment effects, I also measure the transmission of
characteristics from parent to child in a case where there is no genetic connection between the
parent and child. As an accounting identity, we know that all effects of the parents on the children
take place through initial endowments (including genes), through environment (nurture) effects, and
through the interaction of the two.5 For the transmission of education from mothers to children we
might linearize the accounting identity in the following way:

(1) Child's years of education= α + β0*birth mother's educ + β1*adoptive or environmental
mother's educ + β2*birth mother's educ*adoptive mother's education + εi
The random assignment of adoptees to families ensures that birth mother's education is uncorrelated
with adoptive mother's education. Thus we can regress the adoptee's educational attainment on
adoptive mother's educational attainment and obtain an estimate of β1. Even though birth mother's
education and the interaction term are omitted variables, they are orthogonal to the adoptive
mother's education and therefore β1 is not biased by the omission of the first and third terms in (1).

5

As part of this interaction, initial endowments may themselves cause changes in environment as in Ridley [2003] and
Dickens and Flynn [2001].

9

For the non-adoptees, the birth mother is the environmental mother and so the two measures
of mother's education are perfectly correlated. Regressing the non-adoptees educational attainment
on mother's education and yields an estimate of (β0+β1+β2).

I compute the ratio of the adoptee and the non-adoptee coefficients which is β1/(β0+β1+β2).
This is an estimate of the percent of transmission of educational attainment that works through the
level effect of environmental mother's education. Ideally I would like to give this ratio a broader
interpretation, namely the percent of the child's education that is determined by nurture as opposed
to nature and infant health (initial endowments). To make this leap requires several very strong
assumptions. First I need to assume that there are no interaction effects between initial endowments
and family environment, i.e. β2=0.6

This seems like a dubious assumption on both theoretical and empirical grounds. We know
from previous studies including Sacerdote [2001] and Björklund et al [2004] that the transmission
coefficient for the non-adoptees (.26) is much higher than for the adoptees (.07). An assumption of
no interactions amounts to assuming that the large transmission coefficient for the non-adoptees
works almost exclusively through level effects of nature and infant health. This is in fact precisely
the assumption made by most behavioral genetics studies of heritability of IQ and other traits (e.g.
Loehlin, Horn and Willerman [1987]) and this assumption partially explains the high estimated
heritabilities found in the literature.

Second, I would need to make some assumptions about the 80 percent of the variation in
child's educational attainment that is not explained by the observed factors. If I further assume that
6

Once I allow interaction effects, then a nature nurture breakdown is non-sensical since the two factors work together
and perhaps are even endogenously determined. Again I emphasize that any nurture effects estimated are relative to the

10

this variation is either uncorrelated with the nature and nurture factors of interest in my
decomposition, or has the same nature/nurture breakdown as my observed factors, then I can claim
that my ratio β1/(β0+β1) is indeed the percent of educational attainment determined by family
environment.

Data Description
We collected data on adoptive parents and their children using Holt records and a mail in
survey.7 The survey asks questions on the children's health, education, and income. We also
collected basic demographic outcomes including marital status and number of children. Currently
we only have surveys from the parents, but we intend to survey as many of the children as possible
to validate the parents' responses.

The family background (parental input) variables include

parental income at the time of adoption, the education of the mother and father, drinking and
smoking behaviors of the mother and father and height and weight for each. We have income as
self reported on the surveys and we have income as reported in Holt records.

Parents were eligible for inclusion in the survey if they adopted a child through Holt's Korea
program during 1970-1980, making the children ages 23-33 in 2003 when the survey was run.
There were roughly 10,000 such families who met this criterion and we sent the survey to a random
sample of 3,500 of these families. Our cover letter promised respondents a check for $50 and this
was paid immediately upon receipt of a completed survey. We received back 1117 surveys for a
response rate of 32 percent.

variation within the sample. I don't want to rule out the possibility that huge nurture interventions (moving the child
from Korea to the US) have huge effects.
7
I say we because the effort required extensive work from Holt officers and employees and from a team of research
assistants at Dartmouth.

11

Appendix Table 1 shows that the non-response pattern is unrelated to any of the parental
characteristics that we have from the adoption files. I run an OLS regression of a dummy for
responding on parental income, parental education and the adoptee's height and weight at the time
of admission to Holt. The coefficients on the right hand side variables are all small and statistically
insignificant.

Appendix Table 2 performs a simple test of the random assignment of adoptees to families.
I regress pre-treatment variables for the adoptees on pre-treatment variables for the parents. Under
the null of randomization of adoptees to families, we should see no relationship between adoptee
and parent characteristics. The data are consistent with randomization. Mother's and father's
education and income are uncorrelated with the adoptee's height, and weight measured at the child's
first contact with Holt.

The survey collects outcomes for up to 5 children in the family. Fortunately, for the
purposes of sample size, most families had more than one child, and in many cases families had
more than one Holt adoptee from Korea. Table 2 shows a frequency tabulation of family sizes in
the sample. Of the roughly 1100 families, 323 have two children, 298 have 3 children, and 214
have four children. Only 60 families have a single child, and that child is of course a Holt adoptee.
Eighty five of our families have six or seven children, but unfortunately we only collected
information on 5 of the children in these large families.8

Table 2 shows the fraction adoptees and fraction girls by family size. In single child
families, where there is exactly one Holt adoptee, 78 percent of the adoptees are girls. In families of

8

We did ask the respondents to include their oldest adoptee through Holt. I failed to anticipate so many families of
more than 5 children.

12

two children, 80 percent of the children are adoptees and 63 percent are girls. In the larger families,
55-60 percent of the children are adoptees and about 55 percent are girls.

We have data for both adoptees and non-adoptees in the family. We collected information
on the non-adoptees (biological children of the parents) so that we could compare treatment effects
and transmission coefficients across the two groups. We use all children in the family to calculate
family size and to calculate gender ratios and percent adopted in each family. For the subsequent
analysis of adoptees, we keep only Korean adoptees through Holt. We drop the small number of
adoptees under 18 since it is very unlikely that their schooling is complete or that we have useful
income data for them. Seven percent of the final sample is under age 21, and in all of our
regressions we include a set of age dummies to allow for the fact that most of our outcomes
including income, educational attainment and marital status vary by age.

Table 1 shows mean outcomes at the child level (as opposed to the family level). Thirty
percent of the adoptees are male versus 61 percent of the biological children. The adoptive families
clearly have more than the U.S. population average of boys among their biological children, which
may indicates that some families might be adopting in part to diversify away from boys. The
adoptees are on average six years younger than the non-adoptees. The adoptees' average age at
arrival in the U.S. is 1.7 years, with 28 percent of the adoptees being over age 1 at arrival. Below I
test whether arrival age in this sample matters for outcomes and find no evidence that it does.

Forty eight percent of the adoptees have four years of college versus 65 percent for the nonadoptees. Conditional on graduating from a college for which we have U.S. News rankings and
data, the adoptees graduate from colleges with roughly similar SAT scores and acceptance rates as
the non-adoptees. The non-adoptees graduate from schools with a 75th percentile of SAT scores

13

that is 13 points higher than the schools of the adoptees. The survey measure of family income is
much higher for the non-adoptees than for the adoptees: $61,000 per year versus $42,000 per year.
But this huge difference narrows to $1,600 when I control for age, education, and gender.

The adoptees are less likely to be married, but this is partially an age effect. Thirty four
percent of the non-adoptees are classified as overweight (have a Body Mass Index >25) versus 24
percent of the adoptees. This could be correlated with the fact that the adoptees are all Korean and
most of the non-adoptees are white, though I do not offer any theory as to why obesity should vary
by race.

Twenty three percent of the adoptees smoke versus thirty two percent of the non-adoptees.
Reported smoking rates among the adoptive parents are incredibly low at 3 percent for the adoptive
mothers (when weighted at the child level not the family level). This could indicate that people
who want to adopt or who are approved to adopt are unlikely to be smokers, or that the parents have
learned to not admit to smoking in an adoption related survey.

Figure 1 shows the steep negative relationship between family size and the adoptees'
probability of graduating from college. Adoptees who are randomly assigned into a single child
family have about a 55 percent probability of college graduation versus a 35 percent graduation rate
for adoptees assigned into a seven child family. The negative slope is less steep for the nonadoptees. The negative effects of family size on education (and the difference in slopes) remain
quite strong even after I control for other family characteristics (see below), though Black
Devereaux Salvanes [2004] would suggest that much of the relationship is driven by unobservables
about the family.

14

Figure 2 shows how the adoptees and non-adoptees mean years of education vary with
mother's education. The relationship is clearly positive for both groups, but the slope is much less
steep for the adoptees than for the non-adoptees. In other words, the adoptees benefit much less
from additional years of mother's schooling than do the non-adoptees. At lower levels of mother's
education (moving the mother from 11 to 12 years completed), both groups benefit enormously
from additional years of mother's schooling.

But at 13 years of mother's education, the slope

flattens out for the adoptees.

This pattern of differing slopes for the two groups is more extreme when we look at income.
Figure 3 shows mean family income for the adoptees and non-adoptees at each level of parental
income. The adoptee's income appears to have almost no relationship to parental income.

Results
In Table 3, I show transmission coefficients from parents to children for a variety of
outcomes. In this table each coefficient is from a separate univariate regression in which I regress
the child's outcome on the same outcome for the mother or parents. Very similar results obtain
when I use the father's outcome instead of the mother's (not shown). More importantly very similar
results are obtained when I measure these transmission coefficients controlling for other parental
background information, and child age and gender. See, for example, Tables 4 and 5.

In the first row of Table 3, I regress the child's years of education on the mother's. For the
non-adoptees I find a coefficient of .30. The coefficient of transmission for the adoptees is a much
smaller but still highly statistically significant .07. Relative to Björklund et al, I find a slightly
larger coefficient for the non-adoptees and a smaller coefficient for the adoptees. In my sample,
roughly 23 percent of the transmission of educational attainment can be assigned to level effects of

15

environmental mother's education. In the Björklund et al's, this number is closer to 50 percent. One
possible explanation for the difference may be positive selection of adoptees into families in the
Swedish data. In fact when I run the same regression for non-Holt adoptees in the same families
(where there is no random assignment) I find a much higher transmission coefficient of .16 which is
close to the Björklund Lindahl Plug estimate.

Results using a dummy variable for graduation from college are similar to those using years
of education attainment. The transmission coefficient for the adoptees is .07 versus .26 for the nonadoptees. This indicates that 27 percent of the transmission coefficient for non-adoptees works
through level effects associated with the mother's college status.

Health outcomes show a very different pattern of transmission than do educational
outcomes. Unsurprisingly, parents transmit their height to their biological children much more
strongly than to their adoptive children. The relevant coefficients are .46 and .05. Interestingly,
body mass index is also transmitted much more strongly to non-adoptees than to adoptees.9 The
transmission coefficient for the non-adoptees is .24 versus .02 for the adoptees. This latter finding
could be interpreted in one of several ways. It may be that BMI and obesity have a huge genetic
component which accounts for the much stronger parent to non-adoptee correlation that we see. Or
it may be the interaction between having genes for obesity and having parents who eat a lot that
accounts for the strong transmission to non-adoptees.

A third related possibility is that because the Korean American adoptees do not necessarily
resemble the parents physically, the adoptees do not take cues from the parent's eating and weight in
setting their own eating and exercise habits. To investigate whether interactions between parent and

9

Vogler et. al. [1995] have the same finding in a sample that is mostly caucasian adoptees.

16

child race are relevant in determining these transmission coefficients, I ran the same regression for
240 non-Holt adoptees. I do not have race for these adoptees, but I do know birth country.
Interestingly, I find the same low transmission coefficient of BMI from parents to adoptees (a
statistically insignificant .02) when I look at the non-Holt adoptees. This evidence plus Vogler et al
[1995] suggest that the result is true for adoptees in general, and not just Korean adoptees.

Two final outcomes of interest are dummy variables for drinking and smoking.

The

coefficient of transmission for smoking is just as high for the adoptees as for the non-adoptees.
Unfortunately this is not measured with great precision because so few of the parents smoke. For
drinking, the coefficient for the adoptees is .21 which is 68 percent as large as the coefficient for the
non-adoptees of .31. Overall, it appears that the level effects of family environment are a much
bigger component of transmission for drinking and smoking than for years of education.10

In Appendix 3, I switch from looking at transmission coefficients for these outcomes to
looking at the r-squareds in regressions of child outcomes on all the observed family background
characteristics. Each cell in the table reports the r-squared from a regression of the outcome on
mother's and father's years of education, college status, smoking and drinking status, height, weight,
and obesity and overweight status. I also include as regressors family income and number of
children in the family.

For the non-adoptees, I can explain 19 percent of the variation in years of education using
the observables about the parents. For the adoptees, I can explain 5 percent of the variation, making
the ratio of adoptee r-squared to non-adoptee r-squared 28 percent. This is similar to ratio of
adoptee to non-adoptee transmission coefficients of 23 percent shown in Table 3. The r-squared

17

ratios for height, body mass index and smoking and drinking also show a similar pattern to that of
Table 3. The percentage of adoptees' variation in smoking that can be explained is 69 percent as
large as the percentage of non-adoptees variation in smoking.

In contrast a much smaller

percentage of variation in height and BMI can be explained for adoptees than for non-adoptees.

Figure 4 shows a scatterplot of the results in Tables 3. I graph the non-adoptee coefficient
against the adoptee coefficient for nine different outcomes. The 45 degree line represents outcomes
for which the two transmission coefficients are equal. Eight of the nine outcomes fall above the 45
degree line meaning that the non-adoptee coefficient is larger. The outcome closest to the 45 degree
line is drinking, indicating that for these outcomes, adoptees and non-adoptees are similar in the
degree to which they acquire their parent's habits. Obesity is also near the 45 degree line, but only 6
percent of children are classified as obese. BMI and overweight status have much more variation
and are significantly above the 45 degree line.

Table 3A shows how my transmission coefficients for adoptees and biological children
compare with coefficients found in other data sets by other authors. The first four rows of the table
are for four different samples of biological children. Coefficients of transmission of education to
biological children in the Holt sample are close to those Björklund et al find in the Swedish data, ie
.25-.30.

Transmission of education in the NLSY is significantly higher at .40.

My income

transmission coefficient of .16 is half of the .25-.30 found in the Swedish data and the PSID. The
lower income transmission in my sample is quite possibly driven by higher measurement error in
my income survey question.

10

Again, by "level effects" I mean the coefficient on environmental mother's outcome in equation (1), as opposed to the
coefficient on biological mother's outcome or the coefficient on the interaction term.

18

For the adoptees, I estimate transmission coefficients of education that are significantly
smaller than coefficients found in the NLSY (my calculations) and Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey
(Plug [2004]). I attribute much of this difference to the random assignment of adoptees in the Holt
sample.

In Table 3B I approach the transmission via nurture question in a slightly different way. I
ask how much children resemble their adoptive or biological siblings, as opposed to their parents. I
form pairs of biological siblings and pairs of adoptive siblings. I regress the younger child's
outcome on the older child's outcome. For education, I find very similar coefficients as those found
using parents: a coefficient of .09 for adoptive siblings and .29 for biological siblings.

The

connection in drinking behavior is equally strong between pairs of adoptive siblings and pairs of
biological siblings. The body mass index of two adoptive siblings is uncorrelated. The only
notable difference in results is with regard to income. Sibling's income has a coefficient of .16 for
adoptive pairs and .29 for biological pairs.

Table 4 proceeds to regressions of educational outcomes on parent characteristics. Each
column is a separate regression and I pool the data for adoptees and non-adoptees. The base
category is always the adoptees. For the parental characteristics I include interactions between
parental characteristics and a dummy for being a biological child of the parent. (The slope for the
non-adoptees is the sum of the baseline coefficient plus the interaction term.)

The regressions

include, but do not report, age dummies and a dummy for biological child.11

Column (1) uses years of education as the outcome. In the first two rows I repeat a key
result from Table 3, namely that the coefficient on mother's education is .07 for the adoptees and

19

.185 higher for the non-adoptees. Each additional child in the family reduces an adoptee's expected
years of education by .12 years and the effect is highly statistically significant. However, for nonadoptees, the slope on number of children is only -.023 instead of -.12. The difference between
these two coefficients is not statistically significant, though economically it is very significant. The
large difference in slopes is consisent with Case, I-Fen Lin and McLanahan's [2000] result that
adoptees in blended families experience more of a resource constraint.

The coefficient on number of siblings for the non-adoptees is significantly smaller than the
coefficient of -.28 for women in the PSID in Case and Butcher [1994] and the -.09 OLS coefficient
in the Norwegian data in Black et al [2004]. One explanation for the difference is that there are
more unobserved differences between small and large families in general than between the small
and large families in my sample. This seems possible given that my families have all been
approved to adopt by Holt.

Log of parental income is not statistically significant in predicting child's years of education,
which may be a statement about the measurement error in my parental income variable. The male
adoptees have significantly lower educational attainment than the female adoptees, with a
coefficient of -.57 years on the dummy for male. The gender effect for the non-adoptees is roughly
0 years, adding the -.57 baseline effect and .55 on the interaction of male and biological child.

Being the oldest child in the family raises an adoptee's educational attainment by .24 years
and this effect is statistically significant at the 10 percent level. Non-adoptees are helped even more
by being the oldest, but the difference in coefficients for the two groups is not statistically
significant. One might think that parental age would have a significant effect on the outcomes for
11

I suppress the latter to avoid confusion. The intercept for biological children is generally negative, but that's because

20

both groups of children, but I do not find evidence for this effect. For the adoptees the effect of
mother's age minus adoptee's age is -.001 and is statistically insignificant.

Column (2) shows that similar results obtain when I use father's education rather than
mother's.

When I include both father's and mother's education, both inputs matter and the

coefficients add up to roughly the coefficient on mother's education (results not shown).

Columns (3) and (4) show that controlling for other characteristics, mother's college status
has large effects on the probability that the adoptee graduates college and graduates from a US
News ranked college. Adoptees with a college educated mother are 9 percentage points more likely
to obtain a college degree themselves, relative to adoptees whose mothers do not have four years of
college. This is an 18 percent effect at the means. Adoptees with a college educated mother are
also 9 percentage points more likely to obtain a degree from a US News ranked college versus
adoptees whose mother does not have four years of college. This is a 26 percent effect at the
means.

Conditional on attending a US News listed college, mother's and father's education and
family income do not have a statistically significant effect on the selectivity of the college attended.
Doubling family income is associated with the adoptee attending a school that has SAT scores
(measured at the 75th percentile) that are 15 points higher. This is roughly .14 standard deviations
higher in the distribution of 75th SAT percentile across schools.

Column (6) switches the dependent variable to the log of the child's family income. Parental
income and mother's college status have virtually no effect on the adoptee's income. In contrast the

the slope on regressors like mother's education is so much steeper for the biological children.

21

transmission coefficient of income for the non-adoptees, controlling for other parental
characteristics is .18. As mentioned above, this is lower than results for than the .30 coefficient
typically found for a single year of earnings in the PSID (Solon [1999]) and the .29 I find in the
NLSY. The difference could be driven by the restriction of range among Holt families, or by higher
measurement error in my survey.

Table 5 examines treatment effects of parent characteristics on several health outcomes
including smoking, drinking, and obesity. The key results in Table 5 are similar to those from the
univariate regressions in Table 4. Adoptees experience a large treatment effect from their mother's
drinking and smoking behavior, but there is little influence of mother's body mass index on the
adoptee's BMI or obesity. In column (1), adoptive mother's drinking raises the adoptee's probability
of drinking by 19 percent. The effect for the non-adoptees is 26 percent and the difference between
the coefficients is not significant. Male adoptees are more likely to drink than female adoptees and
each additional year of mother's education raises the adoptee's probability of drinking by 1.1
percent.

The effects for smoking in column (2) show a somewhat similar pattern though the
coefficients are smaller and not statistically significant. Mother's smoking raises the adoptee's
probability of smoking by 11 percent, and the effect for the non-adoptees is not statistically
significantly different.

The effects for BMI and obesity are quite the opposite. Mother's BMI, overweight status
and obesity status have a huge effect for her biological children but very little effect for the
adoptees. If the mother is classified as overweight, the non-adoptees are 19 percent more likely to
be overweight whereas the non-adoptees are .2 percent more likely to be overweight.

22

Table 6 asks whether the mix of adoptees and non-adoptees in the family affects the
adoptees' outcomes. I form dummy variables for three separate categories of adoptees: 1) the child
is the only adoptee in the family, 2) the child is an adoptee in a family with multiple adoptees and
one or more biological children, and 3) the child is an adoptee in a family with multiple adoptees
and no biological children. The base category for the coefficients are the biological children and the
regressions include a separate intercept for biological children, age dummies, family size dummies,
mother's education, and family income. Both the point estimates and the standard errors indicate
that the outcomes for adoptees do not vary significantly with the mix of adoptees and non-adoptees.

Appendix Table 5 explores whether the estimated transmission coefficients differ by adoptee
gender.12 I limit the sample to the adoptees and add interaction terms to allow the male adoptees to
have a separate slope on mother's education, mother's college status, parental income, and mother's
body mass index. The outcomes considered are years of education, graduating from a US News
ranked college, drinking, smoking, and BMI. In no case do we find that the male and female
adoptees have coefficients that are statistically significantly different. However, the slopes are
estimated with enough imprecision that it in most cases it is also difficult to reject a sizeable
difference in slopes.

Appendix Table 6 asks whether the gender mix in the family affects the adoptee's outcomes.
Again I limit the sample to the adoptees. My right hand side variables of interest are the fraction of
girls in the family, whether any of the adoptee's siblings are girls and whether any of the adoptee's
siblings are boys. I try running the regressions separately for boys and girls. I do not find any
evidence of gender mix effects, but again the standard errors are large enough that I cannot say

23

much more than this. Finally in Appendix 7 and in a large series of specifications not reported, I
ask whether the child's age at adoption affects outcomes. The short answer is that I cannot find any
evidence that within this sample age at adoption matters for educational attainment, income, obesity
or drinking.13

Conclusion
In this paper, I examine a sample of Korean-American adoptees who in infancy were
randomly assigned to families.

Being assigned to a high education family has economically

meaningful treatment effects for these adoptees. Adoptees are 9 percent more likely to have four
years of college if their mothers do. Each additional year of mother's educational attainment raises
the adoptee's educational attainment by .07 years. But the effects for adoptees are modest when
compared to corresponding effects for non-adoptees. The transmission of educational attainment
and college status to adoptees is roughly 25 percent as large as the transmission of educational
attainment and college status to non-adoptees. Thus, for educational outcomes, the level effects of
parental education are quite important, but only about one quarter of the story.

Health outcomes show a very different pattern. Parents appear to transmit drinking and
smoking behavior to adoptees and non-adoptees at nearly the same rate. If a mother drinks, the
adoptee is 19 percent more likely to do so, and if the mother smokes, the adoptee is 11 percent more
likely to smoke. The transmission of drinking to non-adoptees is larger in the point estimate but not
statistically significantly different than transmission for the adoptees. Thus parents may be equally
good at transmitting certain health habits to their children, regardless of any genetic connection.

12

My interest here is in part due to the fact that many of the Moving to Opportunity effects differ greatly by youth's
gender Kling, Ludwig and Katz [2004].
13
It seems logical that it would matter, but there is no strong evidence of the effect in this sample.

24

For height and obesity, there is strong transmission from parents to their biological children
and almost no transmission of these outcomes to adoptees.

For example, the transmission

coefficient on body mass index is .02 for adoptees and .23 for non-adoptees. The results for body
mass index are suggestive of a big role for genes in determining obesity.

A model which

emphasizes the interaction between genes and environment is one plausible way to explain this.
Certain people may have a genetic predisposition towards obesity, and when they are put in a high
calorie and/or low exercise environment, they have high BMIs.

The random assignment of

adoptees to families means that children with obesity promoting genes are not disproportionately
likely to end up in an obesity promoting family environment.

The largest treatment effects for the adoptees are either caused by or strongly correlated with
the number of children in the family. Each additional child added to the family is associated with a
.12 year decrease in the adoptee's educational attainment and a 2.5 percent reduction in the
probability of attending college. These large effects from family size may imply that there is a
quality quantity tradeoff that is particularly steep for adoptees, relative to non-adoptees. Or, the
family size effects may be picking up important unobserved difference between large and small
adoptive families.

I also investigated the influences of family structure (number of adoptees versus nonadoptees) and gender composition on adoptee outcomes. I do not find any effects of family
structure on education, earnings or obesity.

Nor did I find effects from the gender mix in the

family or the age at adoption. However, all of these non-results are measured with imprecision.

Overall, this study yields several useful conclusions.

First, in a case with random

assignment of children to families, family size is still negatively correlated with education and

25

income. Second, there is a strong level effect of family environment on child education and
income. However transmission of education and income for adoptees is much less strong than for
non-adoptees. Hence, by definition, either initial endowments or the interaction between family
environment and initial endowments must be driving a large portion of the transmission of income
and education to children. Smoking and drinking habits are transmitted almost equally strongly to
adoptees and non-adoptees. Perhaps most interesting is the fact that parents do not transmit a
tendency for obesity to their adoptees.

Random assignment via adoption is a form of grand experiment that will not be reproduced
in policies designed to aid children in general. But for many policies, these data trace out an upper
bound for the effects that can be achieved via shifts in family income, or neighborhood quality, or
schools.

I hope that the treatment effects observed here will guide other social scientists in

understanding what determines child outcomes and the possible scope for policy intervention.

Transmission Coefficients From Parents To Children
I.e. Coefficient on Parent's Outcome When Child's Outcome is Dependent
Variable
Each coefficient is from a separate univariate regression of child's outcome on mother's outcome. I show separate
coefficients for the adoptees and the biological children in the same families. I obtain very similar results when I
include dummies for child age and gender and when I control for parental income and education (see next two tables for
these results).

Sibling "Transmission" Coefficients
Below I report coefficients from regressing child outcomes on older sibling's outcome. In column (2) I form all unique
pairs of biological siblings and regress the younger sibling's outcome on the older sibling's. I include dummies for age
and gender of each sibling in the pair. In column (1) I use all possible pairs of adoptive (non-biologically related)
siblings. These latter pairs can be formed from two adoptees in the family or from one adoptee and one non-adoptee.

Effects of Family Environment on Educational Outcomes and Income
Each column is a separate regression. I pool data for adoptees and biological children. Adoptees are always the base category.
Slopes for the biological children are obtained by adding the interaction term (e.g. bio*mother's education) to the relevant adoptee
coefficient (e.g. mother's education). Dependent variables are years of education, a dummy for having 4 or more years of college, the
75th percentiles of the SAT distribution and the log of child's family income. Regressions include (but suppress) age dummies and a
separate intercept for biological children.

Effects of Family Environment on Health Outcomes
Each column is a separate regression. I pool data for adoptees and biological children. Adoptees are always the base category.
Slopes for the biological children are obtained by adding the interaction term (e.g. bio*mother's education) to the relevant adoptee
coefficient (e.g. mother's education). Dependent variables are child's BMI and dummies for drinking, smoking, obese and
overweight. BMI is defined from self reported weight and height. Overweight is defined as a BMI >=25 and obese is having a BMI
> =30. Regressions include (but suppress) age dummies, a separate intercept for biological children, dummies for being the oldest
child, and controls for the age difference between the mother and child.

Appendix 7
Does Age at Adoption Affect Outcomes?
Here we compare the adoptees who are adopted at age < 1year to all other adoptees in the sample who are adopted at
age 1-5. Many other specifications of age at adoption were tried and all were equally unenlightening (i.e. yielded large
standard errors).
