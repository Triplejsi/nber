ABSTRACT
This paper asks the question: Can we see evidence of General Purpose Technologies in patent data?
Using data on three million US patents granted between 1967 and 1999, and their citations received
between 1975 and 2002, we construct a number of measures of GPTs, including generality, number
of citations, and patent class growth, for patents themselves and for the patents that cite the patents.
A selection of the top twenty patents in the tails of the distribution of several of these measures
yields a set of mostly ICT technologies, of which the most important are those underlying
transactions on the internet and object-oriented software. We conclude with a brief discussion of the
problems we encountered in developing our measures and suggestions for future work in this area.

Uncovering GPTs with Patent Data1

Introduction
In ‘The Computer and the Dynamo,’ Paul David makes a persuasive case for

considering the process by which the electric dynamo spread throughout the economy
during the turn of the last century and the process by which the use of information
technology (specifically, computing technology) is currently being spread throughout
different industries as similar manifestations of the diffusion of ‘General Purpose
Technologies,’ a term introduced into the economics literature by Bresnahan and
Trajtenberg (1995). All these authors, as well as Helpman and Trajtenberg (1998a,b),
emphasize the singular contribution to economic growth made by this type of
technology, because of its ability to transform the means and methods of production in a
wide variety of industries.
At the same time and using historical data, David (1989, 1990), Rosenberg
(1976), and others have argued that the diffusion of these technologies throughout the
economy may take decades rather than years because of coordination problems and the
need for complementary investments (both tangible and intangible) in using industries.
For this reason it may take some time for the benefits of the technologies to be manifest
in economic growth. On the theoretical side, Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995) have

studied the non-optimality of innovation and diffusion when a decentralized market
system is called upon to try to solve the coordination problem between technologyinnovating and technology-using industries. However there has been relatively little
empirical and econometric work that incorporates the insights of these various authors to
analyze specific technologies.
Our modest goal in this paper is to see what might be learned about the existence
and technological development of General Purpose Technologies (hereafter, GPTs)
through the examination of patent data, including the citations made to other patents.
Such measures would be useful both to help identify GPTs in their early stages of
development and also as proxies for the various rates of technical change called for in a
fully developed growth model such as that in Helpman and Trajtenberg (1998b). In
doing this exploration we are also motivated by the observation that not all technologies,
or indeed, R&D dollars are equal, but that economists too often ignore that fact,
primarily because of data limitations. As has been pointed out by others before us,
patenting measures have the potential to allow more detailed analysis of the ‘direction’
as well as the ‘rate’ of technical change.2
Although such an exploration might be made using data from a variety of
countries, our focus here is on the use of US patent data, where the citations have a welldefined meaning and also where they have been computerized since 1977, enabling us to
work with them relatively easily. Given the importance of the United States as a locus of
technical change in the late twentieth century, we do not feel that this limitation to US
patenting activity is a serious drawback for a preliminary investigation of this kind.
We begin with the definition (description) of GPTs offered by Helpman and
Trajtenberg (1998a):

3

Hall-Trajtenberg

1. They are extremely pervasive and used in many sectors of the economy.
Historical examples are the steam engine and the electric dynamo (the
engine of electrification). Contemporary examples are the semiconductor
and perhaps the internet.
2. Because they are pervasive and therefore important, they are subject to
continuous technical advance after they are first introduced, with
sustained performance improvements.
3. Effective use of these technologies requires complementary investment in
the using sectors; at the same time, the GPT enhances the productivity of
R&D in the downstream sector. It is these points that are emphasized by
David.
Using this definition, the contribution of the effort described here is to define
measures using patents and citations that quantify the insights of David and Trajtenberg
and their co-authors.
Our study is subject to a variety of limitations, however: first, it is based on
patent data, which provides imperfect coverage of innovative activity, as not all
innovations are patented or patentable.3 Second, it relies heavily on the US Patent Office
classification system for technology, treating each three-digit patent class as roughly
comparable in the ‘size’ of a technology. An examination of the classes suggests that
this is unlikely to be strictly true (for example, the chemistry of inorganic compounds is
a single class, whereas there are multiple optics classes). Making use of the subclasses to
refine the class measures would be a formidable task, because subclasses are spawned
within the three-digit class ‘ad libidum’ and may descend either from the main class or

2

Griliches (1990); Pavitt (1988).
In the United States environment, this statement is increasingly less true, although the converse, that not
all patent subject matter is innovative, may be becoming more true.

from another subclass. Thus some subclasses are more ‘important’ than others, but this
fact has to be uncovered by a tedious search of the text on the USPTO website. Rather
than attempting to construct our own classification system in this way, we chose to look
at measures based on the primary IPC class of the patent.4 Finally, because patent
citation data is only available in computerized form in 1975, and because severe
truncation due to the application-grant lag and the citation lag sets in by around 1995 our
period of study is necessarily fairly short and emphasizes the 1980s and 1990s.
However, truncation in the later years means that we are unable (yet) to fully explore the
implications of changes in information processing technology during the very recent
past.
Because of time and resource constraints, we have focused the large part of our
analysis on an extremely small subset of the nearly three million patents available to us,
the 780 most highly cited patents that were granted between 1967 and 1999. There is
considerable evidence that the value or importance distribution of patents is highly
skewed, with most patents being unimportant and a few being highly valuable.5 We
expect that one reason for this finding is that true GPT patents are concentrated among
the highly cited patents, so the current endeavour is centred on those patents, which
represent the extreme tail of a very skew distribution.
In order to understand how patent data might help us identify GPTs and explore
their development and diffusion, it is necessary first to understand something more about

4

As a general rule, the USPTO does not classify patents individually into IPC classes, but relies on a map
based on US classes and subclasses to determine them. This is not ideal, but does mean that they
incorporate some subclass information.
5

For recent evidence on this point, see Harhoff et al (1999) for the results of a survey of patent owners,
and Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2000) for results showing that the market value-citation relationship is
highly nonlinear, with firms owning highly cited patents subject to very large premia, as well as a graph
showing the frequency distribution of patent citations.

patent citations. This is the subject of the next section. We then discuss the GPT-related
measures we have constructed from the patent data, and show how our sample of highlycited patents differs in various dimensions from the population as a whole.

2

Patent citations6
A key data item in the patent document is ‘References Cited – US Patent

Documents’ (hereafter we refer to these just as ‘citations’). Patent citations serve an
important legal function, since they delimit the scope of the property rights awarded by
the patent. Thus, if patent B cites patent A, it implies that patent A represents a piece of
previously existing knowledge upon which patent B builds, and over which B cannot
have a claim. The applicant has a legal duty to disclose any knowledge of the ‘prior art,’
but the decision regarding which patents to cite ultimately rests with the patent
examiner, who is supposed to be an expert in the area and hence to be able to identify
relevant prior art that the applicant misses or conceals. The presumption is thus that
citations are informative of links between patented innovations. First, citations made
may constitute a ‘paper trail’ for spillovers, i.e. the fact that patent B cites patent A may
be indicative of knowledge flowing from A to B; second, citations received may be
telling of the ‘importance’ of the cited patent.7 The following quote provides support for
the latter presumption:
‘..the examiner searches the…patent file. His purpose is to identify any
prior disclosures of technology… which might be similar to the claimed
invention and limit the scope of patent protection...or which, generally, reveal

6

This description of the meaning of patent citations is drawn from Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2002).

7
See Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Fogarty (2000) for evidence from a survey of inventors on the role of citations
in both senses.

Hall-Trajtenberg

the state of the technology to which the invention is directed. If such documents
are found...they are “cited”... if a single document is cited in numerous patents,
the technology revealed in that document is apparently involved in many
developmental efforts. Thus, the number of times a patent document is cited
may be a measure of its technological significance.’ (OTAF, 1976, p. 167)
The aspect of citations that is important for the present effort is that they provide
a record of the link between the present invention and previous inventions. Thus they
can tell us both the extent to which a particular line of technology is being developed (if
they are made to patents in the same technology area) and whether a particular invention
is used in wide variety of applications (if they are made to patents in different
technology areas). In principle, given that we know which firm owns the relevant
patents, it is possible to ask these question both using the technology field, which is a
classification made by the US Patent Office,8 and using the industry in which the patent
falls, as indicated by the firm to which it is assigned.

3

Measures of GPTs
The definition of GPTs paraphrased in the introduction suggests that the

following characteristics apply to the patents associated with GPT innovations: 1) they
will have many citations from outside their particular technology area or perhaps from
industries outside the one in which the patented invention was made; 2) they will have
many citations within their technology area, and the citations will indicate a pattern of
cumulative innovation, or trace out a technology trajectory; 3) more speculatively, citing

8

The USPTO has developed over the years a highly elaborate classification system for the technologies to
which the patented inventions belong, consisting of about 400 main (three-digit) patent classes, and over
120,000 patent subclasses. This system is being updated continuously, reflecting the rapid changes in the
technologies themselves. Trajtenberg, Jaffe, and Hall have developed a higher-level classification, by
which the 400 classes are aggregated into 36 two-digit technological sub-categories, and these in turn are

7

Hall-Trajtenberg

October 2004

technologies will be subject to a burst of innovative activity as complementary goods are
developed; and 4) given the length of time it takes for a GPT to pervade the economy,
citation lags for patents in this area may be longer than average. In this section of the
paper we report on the construction of a number of proxies for these characteristics. We
use these proxies to identify patents that are in the extreme tail of the distribution of
patent characteristics, in an effort to identify some candidate GPTs. Nor surprisingly, we
find that looking at a single characteristics may be misleading, so in the later sections of
the paper we use a more multivariate approach to refine the analysis.
It is well known that the distribution of patent values and patent citations is very
skew with almost half of all patents receiving zero or one cite and less than 0.1 per cent
receiving more than 100 cites (see Hall et al 2005 for evidence on both points).
Observations (1) and (2) above also suggest that GPT patents are likely to be highly
cited. Therefore we began our investigation by focusing on highly cited patents. We
identified these patents by requiring that the number of citations the patent received be
greater than three times the number received by the patent in the 99th percentile of the
distribution. The results of this selection process are shown in Table 1. It yielded 780
patents granted between 1967 and 1999 that were ultimately granted, together with the
name and type of their assignee (owner), the three-digit patent classification, and similar
information on ALL the patents issued between 1975 and 2002 that cited this patent, for
a total of 159,822 citations. Table 1 also makes it clear how skew the citation
distribution is: our sample of 780 patents is about one out of 3700 patents, whereas the
160 thousand citations are one out of 100 citations (there are sixteen million citations in

further aggregated into six main categories: Chemical, Computers and Communications (C&C), Drugs
and Medical (D&M), Electrical and Electronics (E&E), Mechanical, and Others.

all). Thus our patents are 37 times more likely to be cited than predicted by the average
probability.
Table 1 about here
3.1

Generality
Observation (1) above suggests the use of a measure that is similar to the

Trajtenberg, Jaffe, and Henderson ‘Generality’ measure, which is defined in the
following way:
Generality ≡ Gi = 1 − ∑ ji sij2
n

where sij denotes the percentage of citations received by patent i that belong to patent
class j, out of ni patent classes (note that the sum is the Herfindahl concentration index).
Thus, if a patent is cited by subsequent patents that belong to a wide range of fields the
measure will be high, whereas if most citations are concentrated in a few fields it will be
low (close to zero).9
Point (2) suggests that even if Generality is relatively high, the absolute number
of citations should also be high, implying that there may still be a large number of
citations in the patent’s own technology class. It also suggests that ‘second-generation’
citations be examined. We implement this using two variables, the average number of
citations to the citing patents, and the average generality of the citing patent.
In actual measurement, the preceding two predictions interact in ways which
make our task a bit more complex. Like patents, citation counts are a discrete random
variable bounded below by zero. This means that fewer citations in total imply that
fewer classes will be observed to have citations than should be observed were the total

9

Note that Generality is not defined if a patent receives no citations, and is zero by construction when a
patent receives only one. We have omitted such patents in the tables and graphs shown in this paper. They
comprise about one quarter of all patents in our sample.

Hall-Trajtenberg

number of citations larger. That is, ni is biased downward by the fact that fractional
citations are not observed, and Generality will tend to be lower when there are fewer
citations. This is quite visible in the graph of average Generality over time shown in
Figure 1, where we show two different versions of Generality, one based on US patent
classes, and another based on the International Patent Classification, as assigned to these
patents by the USPTO. Note that the average of either Generality measures begins to
decline fairly steeply in 1993-95, at the same time as our measure of average citations
per patent turns down sharply due to the effects of lag truncation (see Figure 2). In this
case, this is a spurious rather than real decline in Generality, due to the fact that our
patent grant data ends in 2002, and therefore our application-dated data around 1999, so
that patents in the years after about 1994 have had less chance to receive citations.10
Figures 1 and 2 about here
Using a simple binomial model of the probability of observing a citation in a
given cell, Hall (2002) shows that an unbiased estimate of the generality of the ith patent
can be computed using the following correction:
Ni
G i =
Gi
Ni − 1

where Ni is the number of citations observed. Note that this measure is not defined when
Ni < 2 and will be fairly noisy when Ni is small. We have used this bias correction for
the first three generality measures described below.
The US patent classification system has grown over time in ways that make it not
ideal for the purpose we have in mind here. Generality measures essentially assume that

10

A typical citation lag distribution is shown in Figure 2. This curve was estimated from the observed data
using the methodology of Trajtenberg, Jaffe, and Henderson (1997). See Appendix D of Hall, Jaffe, and
Trajtenberg (2000) for details. From the graph it appears that over half the citations ever made are made in
the first six years since the cited patent’s application date.

10

Hall-Trajtenberg

all categories are equidistant from each other if they are to be compared, but this is not
the case for the US patent class system. Therefore, we explore the use of generality
measures based on five different classification systems:
1. US patent class (approximately 400 cells).
2. Hall-Jaffe-Trajtenberg technology subcategories (36 cells).
3. Main International Patent Class (approximately 1200 cells).
4. Industry classification based on Silverman’s IPC-SIC concordance (Silverman
2002) for industry of manufacture, aggregated to the Hall-Vopel (1997) level (37
cells).
5. Industry classification based on Silverman’s IPC-SIC concordance for industry
of use, aggregated to Hall-Vopel level (37 cells).
The rationales for these various choices are the following: First, in addition to using the
US patent classification system (measure 1), we also constructed generality based on the
more equal groupings of technologies constructed by Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2002)
from the patent classes (measure 2) and from the International Patent Classification
system main four-digit classes (measure 3), which is more detailed that the US patent
classification system.
Second, it could be argued that a GPT is not likely to manifest itself as a series of
citations by patents in different technology classes, but rather as citations by firms in
different industries. To consider this possibility, we would like to base a measure on the
shares of citations that come from firms in different industries at the roughly two and
one half-digit level. That is, our fourth measure is a Herfindahl for patent citation
dispersion across industries rather than across technologies. Based on the discussion of
GPT diffusion to using industries in the introduction, an industry-based measure would
seem to be intrinsically preferred for this exercise. There are basically two ways to

11

Hall-Trajtenberg

October 2004

construct such a measure: the first uses the industry of ownership of the patents based on
identification of the patent assignees and the second determines the industry for each
patent class/subclass from some type of industry-patent class concordance. The first
approach is difficult to implement in practice, given the number of patents that are
unassigned, and the number of assignees that are not identifiable, either because they are
small firms or because they are foreign firms for which we do not yet have a match to
other data sources.11
Therefore we used the SIC-technology class concordances of Silverman (2002)
to assign these patents and their citations to industries of manufacture and of use. Then
we collapsed the distribution of citations by SIC codes into a 37-element vector of
industries using the SIC-industry correspondence given in Appendix Table 1, and used
this vector to construct the generality measures 4 and 5. The computation of these
measures was able to make use of all the patents rather than just those held by US
industry.12 One major drawback of using the Silverman concordance ought to be
mentioned, especially in the light of our subsequent findings: it is based on assignments
to industry of manufacture and use made by Canadian patent examiners between 1990
and 1993. This means that it will do a poor job on patents in technologies related to the
growth of the internet and software, because there were unlikely to be many of these in
the Canadian patent system prior to 1994.
Figures 3 and 4 show the distribution of two of the computed Generality indices
for the highly cited patents, Figure 3 the US patent class index and Figure 4 the index

11

Slightly fewer than half the patents granted between 1967 and 1999 are assigned to US corporations that
we can identify (see Hall et al 2002). However, many of these are in multiple industries so the primary
industry assignment may not be relevant for the particular patent or citation that we are using.
12

The actual industry classification we use was developed by Hall and Vopel (1997) from an earlier
classification used by Levin and Reiss (1984). It is based on four-digit SICs aggregated up to a level that

12

Hall-Trajtenberg

October 2004

based on Silverman’s industry of manufacture map. As the figures show, these indices
range from zero to one and the measure based on the industry of manufacture has a
somewhat different distribution from that based on the US classification system. In
Appendix Table A3, we show the correlation matrix for all 5 generality measures for our
highly cited sample. Although they are generally fairly highly correlated, the industry of
use measure (5) is not very correlated with the US class-based measures (1 and 3), and
the industry of manufacture (4) not very correlated with the US class measure (1).
Figures 3 and 4 about here
Table 2 shows the twenty highly cited patents which also have the highest
generality, where generality is measured by each of the five measures. In general, the
most general patents are those in chemicals, especially when we consider the industry of
use. Looking at the industry of manufacture, those in other technologies seem to be the
most general. However, looking by US class, we can see the drawback of this generality
measure: there are a number of chemical classes that are all essentially the same large
class (the series 532-570), whereas in the case of some of the physics-based classes,
there is only a single class. This fact will tend bias the index toward generality in the
chemicals case; however, the fact that the IPC classification produces a similar result is
somewhat reassuring.
Table 2 about here

3.2

Patenting growth
Observation (3) suggested that we look at patent classes with rapid growth in

patenting. Using the entire patent database aggregated to patent class, we constructed
three sub-periods (1975-83, 1984-92, and 1993-99) and computed the average growth

is coarse enough to include most, but not all, whole firms in the US manufacturing sector. We augmented
this industry list with ten industries for the non-manufacturing sector. See Appendix Table A1 for details.

13

Hall-Trajtenberg

October 2004

within class for each of the periods.13 The results are shown in Table 3. As might be
expected, in all three periods, the patent classes with rapid growth are dominated by the
information and data processing classes (395 and 7xx), with the addition of the new
multicellular biotechnology class 800 in the latter two periods. Highly cited patents are
slightly more common in rapidly growing classes, although only a few of these classes
have significant numbers of highly cited patents and the difference may not be very
significant. It does appear that the patent classes that are growing rapidly include
technologies that have more of the character of what we think of as GPTs, but that
although highly cited patents are two to three times more likely to be found in rapidly
growing classes (as we might expect if citations tend to come from the same class), they
do not seem to be disproportionate in these classes.
Table 3 about here
Another way of looking at the growth in patenting following the introduction of a
GPT is to look at the growth of the patent classes that cite such a technology. The
hypothesis is that innovations which build on a GPTlike innovation will themselves
spawn many new innovations. Table 4 shows the patent classes for the top twenty
patents in terms of the growth of their citing patent classes, both for the highly cited
patents and for all patents, excluding those that are highly cited. The message is clear:
using this measure, almost all the patent classes identified are in computing and
communications technology, and most are in data processing technologies more
narrowly defined.
Table 4 about here

13

We have omitted patent classes with fewer than 10 patents at the end of each period.

14

Hall-Trajtenberg

3.3

October 2004

Citation lags
Finally, observation (4) suggested that the average citation lag to GPT patents

might be longer. Of course, citations to patent data for a fixed time period such as ours
(1967-1999) are always subject to truncation. For this reason, we look at mean citation
lags that are large relative to the average citation lag for patents applied for in the same
year.
Table 5 shows that the twenty highly cited patents with long lags (greater than 70
per cent of the average citation lag) are typically in older technologies. It is noteworthy
that there are none in the chemicals or electrical industries and only five in computing
and drugs, most of which are to surgical innovations. The only highly cited computing
patent with long citation lags is a patent on an aspect of computer architecture taken out
by Siemens in 1976; this patent has a mean citation lag of 23 years and is noteworthy
because it is has essentially no citations until after it expired in 1994. It now has over
200. In general, given the fact that long lags by themselves often simply identify older
and slower-moving technologies such as packaging, we will want to use this indicator in
combination with our other indicators when looking for GPTs.
Table 5 about here

3.4

Summary
The GPT measures we have identified (the five generality indexes, the generality

of citing patents, within class growth in patenting, growth in citing patent classes, and
the average citation lag) are promising, but clearly give contradictory messages when
taken separately. The goal is to combine them in a reasonable way to give an indication
of the types of evidence GPTs leave in the patent statistics. We explore solutions to this
problem in section 5 of this paper, but first we summarize the relationship between them
and the probability that a patent is highly cited.
15

Highly cited patents
Table 6 shows that the highly cited patents differ in almost all respects from the

population of all patents, and also from a four per cent sample of patents with at least
one cite that we will use later as a control sample. They take longer to be issued, they
have about twice as many claims, they are more likely to have a US origin, and more
likely to be assigned to a US corporation, more likely to have multiple assignees, and
have higher citation lags on average.14 They also have higher generality, no matter how
generality is measured, and are in patent classes that are growing faster than average.
Although the patents that cite them more likely to be cited themselves, they have only
slightly higher generality than citing patents in general.
Table 6 about here
More than half of the highly cited patents are in two of our six main technology
classes: computing hardware and software, and drugs and medical instruments. Of
course, these are indeed the technology classes where we expect to find modern day
GPTs. In Appendix Table A2, we broke this down, in order to identify the important
technologies more precisely. Highly cited patents are more than twice as likely to be
found in computer hardware and software, computer peripherals, surgery and medical
instruments, genetic technologies, miscellaneous drugs, and semiconductors.
Table 7 shows a series of probit estimations for the probability that a patent with
at least one cite will be highly cited, in order to provide a multivariate summary of the
data in Table 6.15 The table shows the derivative of the probability with respect to the

14

Unlike the case of generality measures, the mean citation lag is linear in the citation counts and
therefore not a biased estimate, conditional on the total number of citations. It is, however, truncated at the
end of the period, but this truncation affects both highly cited and non-highly cited patents equally.
15

The sample used is the 780 highly cited patents plus the four per cent random sample of patents with at
least one cite shown in Table 2. The fact that we use a random sample rather than a population affects the

16

Hall-Trajtenberg

October 2004

independent variable that are implied by the coefficient estimates. In the case of dummy
variables, it shows the change in probability when the variable changes from zero to one.
Because the probability of being one of the highly cited patents in the sample is very
small (0.77 per cent), the values in the table are small. Taking the grant lag as an
example, the interpretation is that an additional year between application and grant
increases the probability of being highly cited by 0.06 per cent, or from 0.77 per cent to
0.83 per cent at the mean. Being a patent in the drugs and medical category increases the
probability by 2.9 per cent, which is a very large change at the mean probability.
Table 7 about here
The table confirms the univariate differences between highly cited and all
patents. In addition, this table shows that variations over time in the probability of high
citation do not greatly affect the coefficients (compare column 4 to column 2). The only
generality measure that enters significantly and positively in this regression is that based
on the US class; the others were all insignificant (IPC, technology subcategory, and
industry of use) or slightly negative (industry of manufacture). Also note that highly
cited patents are far more likely to be cited by patents that are themselves cited by
patents in many technology classes, once we control for the other differences between
highly cited and other patents.

5

Identifying GPT patents
It is not obvious how to combine these measures to choose a sample of GPT

patents. In this first investigation of the topic, we have chosen simply to look for patents
that are outliers in several of the categories, on the grounds that such patents are likely to

constant term in this probit regression, so we do not report it. The other coefficient estimates will not be

give us an idea of the technologies that have given birth to the most subsequent
inventive activity in the largest number of technological areas. Accordingly, we began
with the 780 highly cites patents and then we chose a set of patents that fell in the top
twenty per cent of these patents according to generality, citing patent generality, and the
subsequent five year growth of the patent’s class. We performed this exercise for each of
the five generality measures in turn.
Table 8 shows the result: twenty patents out of the 780 were selected, many by
several of the different criteria. Selection by each of the five generality measures is
indicated by the presence of the measure in the table. Of these patents, all but two were
in technologies related to information and communication technology (ICT). The
remaining two are the oldest (applied for in 1970) and cover a process that is useful in
the making of paper, and in sewage and waste treatment, and absorbable sutures for
surgery. All but one of the patents cover US inventions, five from California, three from
New Jersey, and the remainder from a number of other states. The sole exception comes
from a Toronto-based company. All but one of the patents were assigned to corporations
at the time they were taken out; the exception was a patent for a method of compressing
audio and video data for transmission.
Table 8 about here
The ICT–related patents cover a range of technologies: integrated circuit
manufacturing, handheld computers, spread spectrum technology, and so forth. What is
noteworthy is the number of patents that relate to internet transactions (e-commerce) and
software development, especially object-oriented programming. Some of the ecommerce patents greatly precede the actual use of the technology. For example, the
celebrated Freeny patent (US4528643, shown in Figure 5) was applied for in 1983 and
issued in 1985, but has been successfully asserted against such corporations as Microsoft

18

Hall-Trajtenberg

and Apple almost to the present day.16 The fact that the original use for which this patent
was contemplated is unlikely to have been internet-based e-commerce reminds us to be
cautious in our interpretation of the results in the table: we do not argue that the patents
we identify are necessarily the source of the GPT itself, but we do suggest that by
identifying them via the subsequent growth and generality in their citing patents, we are
observing the symptoms of the diffusion and development of a General Purpose
Technology.
Figure 5 about here
Looking at the actual ICT patents in Table 8 (rather than at the classes in which
they have been placed) yields the following summary: seven are related to objectoriented and windows-based software, four to internet commerce and communication,
three to audio-video applications, two to handheld computing, and 1 each to
telecommunications and semiconductor manufacturing. Thus the specific technologies
identified as being both general and spawning rapid patenting growth are those related to
the effective use of the computer, especially for interacting and transacting over
distance. That is, they are not computing hardware patents per se, but patents on the
technologies that allow a network of computers to operate together effectively, and to
interact with the users of those computers. This seems to us to characterize the GPT of
the 1980s and 1990s, and we would therefore declare our prospecting exercise a
qualified success.17

This patent is currently owned by E-Data Corporation and was agreesively asserted by that company in
the US beginning in 1996. http://www.prpnet.net/7604.html
17
Note that the industry of manufacture and industry of use measures do not identify the software and
internet patents as GPTs, for reasons discussed earlier: they have been obtained using a concordance that
did not really admit these as patentable areas.

Conclusions
Many empirical papers close with interpretive cautions and calls for further

research. This paper is no exception, but the caution and the call are stronger than usual.
For reasons of limited time and computing power we have not been able to explore the
validity and use of the measures we have constructed as much as we would like and we
encourage further work in this area. In particular, all of the generality measures suffer
from the fact that they treat technologies that are closely related but not in the same class
in the same way that they treat very distant technologies. This inevitably means that
generality may be overestimated in some cases and underestimated in others. One
suggestion for future research would be to construct a weighted generality measure,
where the weights are inversely related to the overall probability that one class cites
another class.
A second area of concern has to do with changes in the strategic uses of patents
during the two decades we have studied. These changes are not unrelated to the growth
in importance of ICT technologies but they may also have had an distorting impact on
some of the measure we have used. In particular, as Hall and Ziedonis (2001) have
shown, one reason for rapid growth in semiconductor patenting after the mid-1980s is a
conscious decision on the part of some major firms to build up their patent portfolios in
order to fend off litigation and negotiate cross-licensing agreements. This type of
strategy has spread throughout the industry and the consequences for patenting by firms
such as IBM, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard has been confirmed by Bessen and Hunt
(2004) and Hall (2005). The implication is that citations to earlier patents in the ICT
sector may be growing rapidly partly because of a strategic shift as well as because the
underlying technology is growing in importance and diffusing throughout the economy.
Sorting this out from our data will require more attention to the time series behaviour of
20

Hall-Trajtenberg

October 2004

the indicators, improved generality measures, and more detailed investigation of the
firms involved. In the interim, this paper has demonstrated the potential validity of
patent-based measures of GPTs and we hope it will spur further investigation into the
use of patent data in this way.
