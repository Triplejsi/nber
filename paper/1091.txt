Inflation and the Role of Bonds in Investor Portfolios
Abstract
This paper explores both theoretically and enirically the role of
nominal bonds of various maturities in investor portfolios in the U.S. One of
its principal goals is to determine whether an investor who is constrained to
limit his investment in bonds to a single portfolio of money—fixed debt instruments will suffer a serious welfare loss. Our interest in this question stems
in part from the observation that many employer—sponsored savings plans limit a
participant's investment choices to two types, a common stock fund and a money—
fixed bond fund of a particular maturity. A second goal is to study the desirability and feasibility of introducing a market for index bonds (i.e. an asset
offering a riskiess real rate of return) in the U.S. capital markets.
The theoretical framework is Merton's (1971) continuous time model of
consumption and portfolio choice. Our measure of the welfare gain or loss from
a given change in the investor's opportunity set is the increment to current
wealth needed to completely offset the effect of the change. A novel feature of
our empirical approach is the method of deriving equilibrium risk premia on the
various asset classes. We employ the variance—covariance matrix of real rates
of return estimated from historical data in combination with "reasonable"
assumptions about net asset supplies and the econonbr_wide average degree of risk

aversion to derive numerical values for these risk premia. This procedure
allows us to circumvent the formidable estimation problems associated with using

historical

means, which are negative during some subperiods.

Our main results are: (i) There can be a substantial loss in welfare
for participants in savings plans offering a choice of only two funds, a diversified stock fund and an intermediate—term bond fund. !bst of this loss can be
eliminated by introducing as a third option a money market fund.
(2) The
potential welfare gain from the introduction of private index bonds in the U.S.
capital market is probably not large enough to justify the costs of innovation.
The major reason for the swall gain is that one month bills with their small
variance of real returns are an effective substitute for index bonds.

Inflation

I.

and the Bole

of Bonds in Investor Portfolios.

Introduction

The inflation of the past decade and a half has dispelled the notion

that

default—free nominal bonds are a riskless investment. Conventional

wisdom

used to be that the conservative investor invested principally in bonds, and the
aggressive or speculative investor invested principally in stocks. Short—term
bills were considered to be only a temporary "parking place" for funds awaiting
investment in either bonds or stocks. Thdv many academics and practitioners in
the field of finance have come

to

the view that for an investor who is concerned

about his real rate of return, long—term nominal bonds are a risky investment

even

when held to maturity.
The alternative view that a policy of rolling—over short term bills

might be a sound long—term investment strate' for the conservative Investor has
recently gained credibility. The rationale behind this view is the observation
that

of

for

the past few decades, bills have yielded the least variable real rate

return of all the major investment instruments traded in U.S. financial

markets. Stated a bit differently, the nominal rate of return on bills has
tended

to mirror changes in

the rate of inflation so that their real rate bf

return has remained relatively stable as compared to stocks or longer term
fixed—interest bonds.

This is, of course, not a coincidence. All market—determined interest
rates contain an "inflation premium," which reflects expectations about the

the life of the loan. As
the rate of inflation has increased in recent years, so too has the Inflation
declining purchasing power of the money borrowed

over

premium built into interest rates. While long—terni as well as short—term

_0
interest rates contain such a premium, conventional
long—term bonds lock the

investor into the current interest rate for the life of the bond. If long—term
interest rates on new bonds subsequently rise as a result of unexpected inflation,

the funds already locked in can be released only

by selling the bonds on

the secondary market at a price well below their face value. But

if

an investor

buys only short—term bonds with an average maturity of about thirty days, then
the interest rate he earns will la€ behind changes in the inflation rate by at

most one month. For the investor who is concerned about his real rate of
return, bills may therefore be less risky than bonds, even in the long run.
The main purpose of this paper is to explore both theoretically and
empirically the role of nominal bonds of various maturities in
folios.

investor port-

i-low important is it for the investor to diversify his bond holdings

fully across the range of bond maturities? We provide a way to measure the
importance of diversification, and this enables us to determine the value of
holding stocks and a variety of bonds, for example, as

less

opposed to following a

cumbersome investment strater, such as concentrating in stocks and bills

alone.

One of our principal goals is to determine whether an investor who is

constrained to limit his investment in bonds to a single portfolio of money—
fixed debt instruments will suffer a serious welfare loss. In part, our
interest in this question stems from the observation that many employer—
sponsored tax—deferred savings plans limit a participantts investment choices to
two types, a common stock fund and a money—fixed bond fund of a particular

maturity?

—3—

A second goal is to study the desirability of introducing a market for

indexed bonds (i.e. an asset offering a riskiess real rate of return). There
is a substantial literature on this subject,2 but to our knowledge no one has
attempted to measure the magnitude of the welfare gain to an individual investor
from the introduction of trading in such securities in the U.S. capital market.

In the first part of the paper we develop a mean—variance model for
measuring the value to an investor of a particular set of investment instruments
as a function of his degree of risk aversion, rate of time

preference

and

investment time horizon. We then take ianthly data on real rates of return on
stocks, bills and U.S. government bonds of eight different durations, their
covariance structure, and combine these estimates with reasonable assumptions
about net asset supplies and aggregate risk aversion in order to derive a set of

equilibrium risk premia. This procedure allows us to circumvent the formidable
problems of deriving reliable estimates of these risk premia from the historical
means, which are negative during many subperiods. We then employ these para-

meter values in our ndel of optimal consumption and portfolio selection in

order

to address the two empirical issues of principal concern to us. The paper

concludes with a section summarizing the main results and pointing out possible
implications

for private and public policy.

II. Theoretical Jbdel

A. tdel Structure and Assumptions
Our basic model of portfolio selection is that of Markowitz (1952) as

extended by Merton (1969 and 1911). Merton has shown that when asset prices
follow a Geometric Browr-xian Motion in continuous time and portfolios can be con—

tinuously revised, then as in the original Markowitz model, only the means,
variances and covariances of the joint distribution of returns need to be considered in the portfolio selection process.
In

more formal terms we assume that the real return dynamics on all n

assets are described by stochastic differential equations of the form:
dQ
Q.

=

i

R.dt + a.dz i

where R. is the mean
variance

real rate of return per unit time on asset i

and

2

the

n—vector of means and 1
the variances

the

nxn covariance matrix, whose diagonal elements are

and whose off—diagonal elements are the cowariances

Investors are assumed to have homogeneous expectations about the values

parameters. Furthermore, we assume that

The change in the individual's real wealth in any instant is given by:

(i)

dW = WSw•R•dt

—

n
Cdt + WEw,a•dz

111 1

where W is real wealth, C is the rate of consumption, and w• is the proportion

of his real wealth invested in asset i.

—5—

The

individual's optirial consumption and portfolio rules are derived by

finding:

U(C)dt

where E is the expectation operator, p is the rate of time preference, u(c)
the utility from consumption at time t, and H is the end of the investor's
planning horizon.
The individual's derived utility of wealth function is defined as;

(3)

J(W) =

max

Et

J is interpreted as the discounted expected value of lifetime utility,

tonditional upon the investor's following the rules for optimal consumption and

portfolio behavior. This value can be computed as a function of current wealth.
The specific utility function with which we have chosen to work is the well—
known constant relative risk aversion form:
I

for

y C 1 and I

fory=0

with 6 E 1 — y representing Pratt's measure of relative risk aversion. This
functional form has several desirable properties for our purposes. First, the
investor' s degree of relative risk aversion is independent of his wealth, which

in turn inlies that the optinal portfolio proportions are also independent of
wealth. Secondly, actually solving the problem in (2) allows us to find

explicit

an

solution for the derived utility of wealth function (Merton 1971),

which takes the relatively simple form:

where i is a vector of dimension n all of whose elements are 1.
The degree of relative risk aversion plays an important
specific

role in the

numerical results which follow, so we interpret this parameter by

means

of a simple example. Suppose an individual faces a situation in which there is
a .5 probability of losing a proportion x of his current wealth and a .5 probability of gaining the same proportion. What proportion of current wealth would

the individual be willing to pay a an insurance premium in order to eliminate
this risk?5
Table 1 displays the value of this insurance premium for various values

of x and 6. The second row, for example, shows that for a risk which involves a

gain or loss of 10% of current wealth an investor with a coefficient of relative

the magnitude of' the possible loss) to insure against it, while an investor

with a 6 of 10 would pay b.142% of his wealth (which is fully 14b.2% of the nugni—

tude of the possible loss). If the investor with a 6 of 10 faces a risky
prospect

involving a possible gain or loss of 50%

of his wealth, he would

be

willing to pay 92% of the possible loss to avoid the risk.

The

vector of optimal portfolio weights derived from the optimization

model described above is given by;

Note that these weights are independent of the investor's rate of

The demand for any individual asset can thus be decomposed into two
parts represented by the two terms on the right hand side of equation (7):

where

i,min

v•, is the th element of

the inverse of the covariance matrix. The
first of these two parts is a "speculative demand" for asset i, which depends
inversely on the investor's degree of risk aversion and directly on a weighted
sum of the risk prenia on the n assets. The second coxnponent is a "hedging
demand" for asset i which is that asset's weight in the minilmlm_variance

portfolio. 6
Under our assuniption of homogeneous expectations the equilibriwn risk

preinia on the n assets are found by aggregating the individual demands for each
asset (equation 6') and setting them equal to the supplies. The resulting

This implies that in equilibrium every investor will hold some combination of
the market and the minimum variance portfolios. If the investor is rmz're risk

averse than the average he will divide his portfolio into positive positions in
both the market portfolio and the mininum variance portfolio, with a higher

proportion in the latter the greater his degree of risk aversion. If he is
less risk averse than the average he will sell the mininum variance portfolio
short in order to invest more than 100 percent of his funds in the market portfolio.

c. The Welfare Loss from Incomplete Diversification
Suppose the invesbor faces an investment opportunity set

less than the full set of n assets. How much additional

consisti of

current wealth would he

have to be given in order to make him as well off as he was with the fall set of
n assets?

Let

n) be the lifetime utility of an investor who chooses

from

among n assets, and let (w n — in) be the lifetime utility of an investor
choosing from among a restricted set of assets. Let W represent the investor's
actual Level of current wealth and W the level at which his welfare would be the

same under the restricted opportunity set. W is defined by:

n) = J(w j n - m)
Thus W —

W

is the extra wealth necessary to compensate the investor for

having a restricted opportunity set and is greater than or equal to zero. From
equation (4) we get:

where v is calculated according to equation (5) and corresponds to the
restricted opportunity set.1

Equation (12) implies that the magnitude of the welfare loss will in
general depend on the investorts risk aversion, 6, rate of time preference, P,
and investment horizon, H. Since W is proportional to 4! a convenient measure of
this loss, which is independent of the investor's wealth level, is 1..

1,

the

loss per dollar of current wealth. Since W>W, this number is always greater
than or equal to zero.

—11—

certain restrictions on the investment opportunity set need

not

decrease investor welfare. We know from equation (ii) that even if the

investor had only two mutual funds to choose from, there would be no loss in
welfare, provided they were the market portfolio and the rainimunt

variance

port-

folio. trton (1972) has shown that any two portfolios along the mean—variance

portfolio frontier would serve as well. But, in general, restricting the number

of assets in the opportunity set does lead to a loss in investor welfare.
D. The Shadow RLskless Hate and the Gain from Introducing a Riskiess Asset
We define the shadow riskless real rate of interest as that rate

which an investor would have no change in welfare if

at

his opportunity set were

expanded

to include a riskless asset. When the investment opportunity set

includes

a riskiess asset, Merton (1971)

function is the same as (14),

shows that the lifetime utility of

This gives:

This implies that a risk averse investor will always have a shadow riskiess real
rate which is less than the mean real return on the minimum variance portfolio.
The return differential is equal to his degree of relative risk aversion times
the variance of the minintun variance

portfolio.

If there is a zero net supply of this riskless asset in the econontr,
the equilibrium value of
tion, an investor with

will just be B. — ci21. Therefore, by assump-

average risk aversion will not gain from the introduction

a market for index bonds. For an investor whose risk aversion is different

from the average there will be a welfare gain, ignoring the costs of

establishing and operating such a market. We measure this gain analogously to
the way we measured the welfare cost of incomplete diversification in the previous section.

As before, let W be the investor's actual level of wealth and W the
level at which his welfare would be the same under an opportunity set expanded
to

include a riskless asset offering a real rate of

III. The Data and }rameter Estimates
In

this section we will describe our data and how we used them

to

esti-

mate the parameters needed in evaluating the welfare loss from restricting an
investor's opportunity set and the gain from introducing a real riskless asset.

It must be borne in mind that we were not trying to empirically test the model
of capital market equilibrium presented in section II but rather to derive its
implications for the specific questions being addressed in this paper. It was

therefore important to maintain consistency between the underlying theoretical
model and the parameter estimates derived from the historical data, even if that
meant ignoring some of the descriptive statistics yielded by those data.

Our raw data were monthly real rates of return on stocks, one—month

U.S. Government Treasury Bills, and eight different U.S. bond portfolios. We
used monthly data

of

in order to best approximate the continuous trading assumption

Merton's model, and because one month is the shortest interval for which

information about the rate of inflation is available. The measure of the price
level that we used in computing real rates of return was the Bureau of labor

Statistics' Consumer Price Index, excluding the cost—of—shelter component. We
excluded the cost of shelter component because it gives rise to well—known
distortions in the measured rate of inflation.

The bill data are from Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982), while the bond
data are from the U.S. Government Bond File of the Center for Research in
Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of'

the

Chicago.

The stock data are from

CRSP monthly NYSE file. We divided the bonds into eight different port-

folios based on duration. We felt that duration was superior to maturity as a

—1

criterion for grouping the bonds since it takes into account a bond's coupon as
well as its maturity.8 The durations of the bond portfolios range from one to
eight years.
Table

2 presents the means, variances and correlation coefficients of

the monthly real rates of return on the ten asset categories for three sub—
periods

between January 1953 and December 1981. The first is the twelve years

from January 1953 to December 19614, a period of relative price stability; the
second

is the eight years from 1965 to 1972, a period of moderate inflation; and

the third is the nine years from 1973 to 1981, a period of relatively rapid
inflation.

The measure of the real rate of return used in all cases was

natural logarithm of the monthly real wealth relatives Q.(t)/Qjt —
assumption that these returns follow a geometric

Notes: The measure of the real rate of return used is the
natural logarithm of the monthly real wealth relative. The
reported means were converted to annual rates by multiplying
them_by 12 and the standard deviations by multiplying them

premia called for in models of capital market equilibrium, since their recent
historical pattern is grossly inconsistent with the pattern implied by the
variance—covariance matrix estimated from the same data.

As Merton (1980) has shown, in order to get a reliable estimate of the
mean of a continuous time stochastic process, it is necessary to observe the
process over a long span of time.

standard deviations of all ten assets reported in Table 2 increased
significantly over the three periods. Since we were interested in computing
The

welfare losses and gains for investors in today's U.S. capital markets, we used

in our calculations the variances and correlation coefficients estimated for the
most recent period, 1913—1981.

The standard deviations for this last subperiod fall into a clear pat-

tern. The lowest is for bills, .0126, which is well below that on 1 year bonds,
the next lowest reported in the table. The standard deviation on bonds rises
continuously

with duration, reaching a maxinnm

of .1095 on duration

8.

Stocks

have a standard deviation of .1735, which is 1.6 times that of duration 8 bonds
and about

times that of bills. In the previous two subperiods, while all the

standard deviations are lover than in the 1973—1981 subperiod, they fall into
approximately the same pattern of relative magnitudes.

—16—

Turning to the matrix of correlation coefficients, we see that in the

last subperiod all of the correlations are positive. Stocks had correlations
ranging from .20 (with bills) to .33 (with duration 8 bonds), and they do not

rise uniformly with the duration of the bonds. The pattern for bonds and bills

that correlations are highest among bonds of adjacent durations and fall off
more or less uniformly as one moves to more distant durations. In the 1965—1972

assets, but in the non—inflationary 1953—1965 subperiod the correlations

and bonds follow the same pattern, while the real returns on stocks appear

to be essentially uncorrelated with the real returns on bills and bonds.

In addition to the variance—covariance matrix, the next input we need
for equation (8) in order to generate numerical results is the vector of weights

for the market portfolio. Here we face some problems of both a theoretical and
an

empirical sort.

At the theoretical level, one issue is whether to treat U.S. government bonds as net wealth. There is considerable controversy among monetary
theorists on this issue and a substantial literature on it exists.9

We decided

to treat U.S. government debt as net wealth of the private sector.

We also ignore the default risk premium on corporate bonds by lumping

them together with Treasury bonds. This amounts to assuming that they have the
same variarice—covariance structure.

Another

problem is our exclusion of some important categories of assets

in our computation of the xrket portfolio. ttst notable among these is residential real estate, consumer durables, human capital and social security
wealth)° While we do not include these in the present paper, our plan for

—17—

future extensions of this research is to seek appropriate data on these other
asset classes and redo our calculations to include them.
There remains the empirical problem of determining the relative weights
of those assets which we do include in the market portfolio in the present
study.

The ratio of the market value of corporate equity to the book value of

total government debt was approximately 1.5 in 1980.
weight

Thus, 60% was the

equity

in the market portfolio. The relative supplies of government debt by

duration were approxbnated froai a table in the Treasury Bulletin which breaks
down the quantities of government debt by maturity: issues maturing in less than

one year, in one to five years, and so forth. We arbitrarily spread the weights
evenly anong the years within each of these groupings.
This procedure

obviously omits corporate debt. However, using

Flow—of—Funds data we conuted the percentage of equity by treating both corporate equity and the net worth of unincorporated businesses as equity. Debt
then consisted of federal, corporate and unincorporated business credit market

liabilities. This procedure also yielded a 60%

equity

to wealth ratio. By

lumping corporate debt together with U.S. government debt we are ignoring any

default

risk prenila.

The foregoing ignores financial intermediaries, in effect supposing
that households hold the securities of non—financial businesses and the govern-

ment directly. A different procedure would be to net out securities held by
intermediaries,

and consider the public's holding of bank liabilities as debt.

Finally, in order to determine the equilibrium risk premia we need to
set a value for 6, the econonr.ç—wide average degree of relative risk aversion.

In a recent paper Grossman and Shiner (1981) concluded that a value of 4 is
most consistent with the observed movements of the value of the stock market

over the past ninety years. Friend and Blume (1975) estimated it to be 2, while
Friend and Flasbrouck (1982) found 6 to be sore appropriate. As we show below, a
value

of 14 produces an imputed risk premium on stocks which is in line with

direct time series estimates of this premium obtained by other researchers using
a variety of estimation techniques. We therefore choose 14 as our value for 6 in
the calculation of the equilibrium risk premia which we use in the rerriainder of

the paper. Tb a large extent the particular value of
the deviation of

the risk premium on the market portfolio would

be exactly 4 times its variance if the variance of the minimum variance portfolio were zero rather than .Olhh% per year. The risk premium on bills is only

IV. The Welfare Loss

from Incomplete

Diversification

In this section we address the question of how much
loses

welfare

an investor

by having his choice of assets limited. The main conclusion of the

theoretical discussion in part II was that even if an investor's opportunity set
is limited to only two assets, there will be no loss in welfare provided that
these two assets are the market portfolio and the minimum variance portfolio (or

arw other set of two frontier portfolios). But we are interested in the actual
menu of asset choices offered in practice by many employer—sponsored tax—

plans usual1- offer participants a

extremely risk averse investor, one whose iS value is 10, would still invest
roughly 214 percent of his funds in stocks, 61 percent in bills and the remainder

per year with a variance of only .21% per year.
Note that for coefficients of relative risk aversion smaller than the
econon—wide average of'

the

investor takes larger short positions in bills
and long positions in stocks and bonds ofmost durations. In the first row, for
example, we see that an investor with a risk aversion coefficient of 2 nearly
4,

doubles the mean risk premium on his portfolio relative to the average investor,
but also increases the variance by a factor of four.
Short—selling treasury bills is difficult in practice. This difficulty
can be overcome in two ways. First, a large investment house or pension fund
could allow its less risk—averse investors to short—sell to the more risk—averse
investors,

as a purely internal transaction. Second, and more likely, a less

risk—averse

investor can simply take a long position in stock market futures as

a way to hold a levered position in stocks.
Table 5 and Figure 2 present our estimates of the welfare loss to an

investor from having his opportunity set restricted to various subsets of the

ten asset classes. The numbers in this table represent the amount of money the
investor would need to be given per $10,000 of his current wealth to make him as
well off with the restricted choice set as he would be with the full set of ten

assets. In order to do these calculations we had to determine the mean rates of
return themselves, not Just the risk premia. We did this by assuming that the
mean on bills is zero and calibrating all other rates accordingly. This assumption was based on the actual mean real return on bills observed over the past 30
years.

We also had to assume a rate of time preference and a specific planning

horizon. We arbitrarily set these at 14% per year

and

infinity, respectively,

but did a sensittvity analysis which we report below in Table 6.

It should be

noted that the infinite horizon assumption is really meant to represent the case
where tine of death is uncertain and the parameter p in (2) incorporates the

rate of nortality as in Merton (1911). Note also that Table 5 shows the welfare
loss from restricting the investor's portfolio choice forever, not just for a

limited

period.

the investor is restricted to only
two assets, the welfare impact of the restriction can be quite sensitive to his
coefficient of risk aversion, If the two assets are stocks and bonds of duration
2 years (curve 1), we see that the welfare loss is small for an investor with a
risk aversion coefficient equal to the average, 14, but increases sharply on

when

the other

hand, the two

assets are stocks and

duration 1 year (curve 2), then the welfare loss is greatest for the

risk averse investor, but is not extreri for any investor. Investors with
coefficients of risk aversion equal to 3 or 14 are better off with stocks and
least

bonds of duration 2 years, whereas investors who are either more or less risk
averse

than that

would prefer stocks and bonds of duration 1 year.

A coqarison of the first two columns in Table 5 reveals that stocks

and bonds of duration one year are preferable to stocks and bills for all
investors except those with risk aversion of 2. Mving across Table 5 we see
that as the duration of the bond fund increases the welfare loss becomes more
sensitive to the coefficient of risk aversion. Thus for bonds of duration 14
years the smallest welfare loss relative to the full 10 asset opportunity set

occurs at a coefficient of risk aversion of 3,

side

of that value and becoming particularly severe for very risk averse

investors.

The last column in Ible 5 shows that when the choice set is expanded
from two to three assets, stocks, bills and bonds of duration two years, the
magnitude of the welfare loss rails dramatically for all investors, regardless

of their degree of risk aversion. Itving these three assets to choose from is
thus almost as good as having all ten.

The effects of changing our assumptions about the rate of time pre—

ference and the horizon are shown in Table 6. The magnitude of the welfare loss
from restricting the choice set to stocks and bills is greater the lower the
rate of time

preference

These

plan

and the longer the horizon.

numerical results suggest that if an employer—sponsored savings

is going to restrict its participants to a choice of only two funds, then

since the sponsor does not know the exact degree of risk aversion of the patici—

pants, it would make sense to let the two
1

funds

be stocks and bonds of duration

or 2 years. If, however, the sponsor is willing to expand the number of funds

to three, then stocks, bills and bonds of duration two years will eliminate
alw,st all of the welfare loss relative to the full ten asset opportunity set.
The applicability of our analysis to employer—sponsored tax—deferred

savings plans is limited by two factors; assets held outside the plan, and

taxes. Without taxes it is trivially obvious that the omission of bills from a
savings plan is of no consequence if investors can hold a money market fund on

their

own account. When there are tax advantages to investing in a savings

plan, however, on the margin the investor prefers to hold assets inside the

plan. If the plan fails to offer a full menu of assets, the investor will

suffer a welfare loss. Our numerical calculations can be viewed as applying to
a world in which all assets are invested in a tax—deferred savings plan with a

restricted

menu of assets. In general, however, our numerical calculations

still provide an upper bound on the possible welfare loss, for the following
reason: if the investor could in principle invest all wealth in the plan, and
chooses not to do so, in order to diversify, then the welfare loss must be less
than for an investor who is (as in our

calculations)

constrained to hold only

those assets offered by the plan.
In

practice, of course, additional complications reduce the importance

of tax—deferred savings plans. The IRS imposes a limit on the contributions to
these plans, and frequently there are penalties or delays associated with the
Dreunture

of

withdrawal of funds. These considerations will reduce the percentage

an investor's wealth s.thich is held in such savings plans. Therefore the

failure of the plan to offer certain assets is less important, since freely
chosen assets held outside the plan will undo the effect of restrictions imposed

within the plan. Our

V. Shadow Riskiess Rates and the Welfare Gain from Introduction of a Riskless
Real Asset
In part II we defined the shadow riskless rate of interest as that rate
at which an investor would have a zero gain in welfare from havIng his choice
set

expanded to include an asset which was riskless in real terms. Equation

(12) showed that this rate is below the mean real rate of return on the minimum

variance portfolio by an amount equal to the investor's degree of relative risk
aversion tints the variance of the minimum variance portfolio. Given that our
estinnte of this variance is a mere .Oiblt%

risk averse

per

year, it

follows

that even a very

investor (6 = 6) would be willing to give up less than 9 basis

points.
Since

the avera€e degree of risk aversion is b, if a market for

riskless real bonds could be established costlessly, the market clearing real
interest rate would be about 6 basis points below the mean rate on the mininum
variance
with

portfolio.

Th,ble 7

shows what the welfare gain would be to investors

varying degrees of risk aversion.

The magnitude of the welfare gain to investors does not appear to be

large. The numbers in the first column of Thble 7 show the results obtained
using the actual covariance matrix estimated for the 1913—1981 subperiod. The
second

column shows the results of an experiment in which we made all nominal

debt securities twice as risky by doubling their variances and covariances,
leaving the variance of stocks unchanged. While the effect is to approximately

double the welfare gain to investors at any degree of risk aversion, the magni-

tude of the gain still appears small.

These results suggest one possible reason for the nonexistence of index

bonds in the U.S. capital market. Since there would probably be some costs
associated with

creating

a new market for such bonds, the benefits would have to

exceed those costs. Given the assumptions of our model, in particular the
assumption of homogeneous expectations, the benefit from trading in index bonds
would have to arise from differences in the degree of risk aversion among

investors. If as Table 7 suggests, the welfare gain does not appear to be large
over a fairly broad range of risk aversion coefficients, then one should not be
surprised at the failure of a market for index bonds to appear.
One

should bear in mind that Table 7 is derived assuming a zero net

aggregate supply of index bonds. Thus it does not answer the question of
whether the welfare gain from indexing government debt would be significant.

—27—

VI. Summary and Discussion of Findings
We undertook this research with two main policy questions in mind: Ci)

Is

there a significant welfare loss stemming from the practice on the part of

many employer—sponsored savings plans of restricting a participant's choice of
investments to two or three asset classes?

(2) What is the potential welfare

gain from the introduction of trading in privately issued index bonds? In this
section we summarize and discuss the implications of our findings for each.

With regard to the first of these, we have shown that there is no

necessary
funds,

loss of welfare from

restricting

an investor' s choice set to

only two

provided these two are properly chosen. If they are the market portfolio

and the xniniraim variance portfolio, then there will be no loss at all. In practice, however, many plans offer a diversified common stock fund and an

interdiate—ten fixed—interest bond fund as the only two assets, and in such
cases there can be a substantial welfare loss to participants whose degree of

risk

aversion differs appreciably from the average. ?tst of this loss can be

eliminated for risk averse participants by introducing as a third option a money
market fund.

With regard to the second question, our results indicate that the
potential welfare gain from the introduction of index bonds in the current U.S.
capital market is probably not large enough to justify the costs of innovation.
The

major reason for the small gain we calculate is the fact that one month

bills with their small variance of real returns are an effective substitute for
index bonds.

There are some important factors bearing on these two policy questions,

which we either excluded or ignored in our analysis, and we need to at least

—28—

consider their potential impact on our conclusions. The first is the fact that
we limited ourselves to onJj a subset of the assets which individuals in the

U.S. hold in their portfolios. Specifically, we excluded residential real
estate, consumer durables, and nontradeable assets like human capital and social
security wealth.

UndoubtedJj

the inclusion of

these other assets would affect the nagni—

tude of the welfare effects we calculated. Thus the welfare loss to an individual whose employer—sponsored savings plan offers only a stock fund and a bond

fund would almost surely be smaller. The loss would appear smaller still, were
we to take into account the fact that individuals have access to other assets

outside of the plan. Nonetheless, it is probably still true to say that not
having a money market option lowers the welfare of investors who are more risk

averse than the average. Similarly, the swall welfare gain from index bonds,

which

we calculated, would probably become even smaller, in the context of the

broader spectrum of assets, especially when one considers that Social Security
is indexed.

Our agenda for future research starts with a more detailed quantitative
analysis

of the impact of these additional assets.

is approximately 1J26x . Note that x2 is the variance of the proportional

change in wealth caused by the risky prospect.

Duration, as defined by Macaulay (1938) is a weighted average of the years
to naturity of each of the cash flows from a security. The weights are
the present value of each year's cash flow as a proportion of the total
present value of the security. Duration equals final maturity only in the
case of pure discount bonds. For coupon bonds and mortgages, duration is
always less than maturity. The difference between maturity and duration
for ordinary coupon bonds and mortgages is greater the longer the final
maturity and the higher the level of interest rates. In our sample of
bonds this difference rose steadily over the 1953—1981 period due to the
rising trend in interest rates. The most pronounced differences were in
the 8 year duration category. In 1953 the average maturity of the bonds
in our 8 year duration portfolio was just under 9 years whereas in 1981
the average maturity of the 8 year duration portfolio was 23 years. This
variation over the last 30 years calls into question the appropriateness
of a bond return series with a constant maturity of 20 years, such as the
one tabulated by Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982).

Including

residential real estate would raise another theoretical issue.
Individual holdings of residential real estate serve both to diversify the

portfolio and to hedge against changes in the relative price of housing
services. This hedging denand is ignored in our model and including it
would substantially increase the difficulty of solving for the J function.
