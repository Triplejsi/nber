Regulation of Entry and the Distortion of Industrial Organization
Raymond Fisman and Virginia Sarria-Allende
NBER Working Paper No. 10929
November 2004
JEL No. O14, K2, L11
ABSTRACT
We study the distortions to industrial organization caused by entry regulation. We take advantage
of heterogeneity across industries in their natural barriers and growth opportunities to examine
whether some industries are differentially affected by country-level entry regulation. In industries
with high natural entry barriers, entry regulation has little impact on the quantity and average size
of firms in an industry. By contrast, in industries with low natural entry barriers, countries with high
entry regulation have relatively few, large firms. We find no relation between natural entry barriers
and overall industry share of manufacturing, as a function of entry regulation. Utilizing firm-level
data, we show that operating margins are relatively high in low barrier industries in high entry
regulation countries. Finally, we analyze the ability of industries to take advantage of shocks to
growth opportunities. In countries with high entry regulation, industries respond to growth
opportunities through the expansion of existing firms, while in countries with low entry regulation,
the response is through the creation of new firms; the total sectoral response is invariant to the level
of regulation. Our results suggest that regulation distorts the structure of industry, promoting industry
concentration, but does not have measurable effects on intersectoral allocations.

Economists have presented two contrasting views of government regulation of economic
activity.

Under the Public Choice view (Stigler (1971), regulation is acquired by

industries, and is designed and operated for their benefit, through the increased market
power that regulation allows. By contrast, the Public Interest perspective, as initially
suggested by Pigou (1938), holds that industry will be fraught with inefficiencies
stemming from market failures of all kinds, if left to its own devices. Regulation is
therefore required to achieve socially efficient outcomes. Both perspectives suggest that
entry regulation in particular will have an impact on industrial structure by directly
influencing the costs of starting a new enterprise in a given industry, but differ in their
views on the relative tradeoff between the correction of externalities and the creation of
market power. In order to appropriately assess the extent of this tradeoff requires some
empirical sense of the actual distortions that may be caused by regulatory burdens. That
is the purpose of this paper.
There exists a nascent empirical literature examining the impact of entry
regulation on economic outcomes. Two recent papers take contrasting approaches on this
issue. Djankov, La Porta, Lopes-de-Silanes, and Shleifer1 (2002) document significant
differences across countries in the ease with which firms may open new businesses.
They go on to examine a number of country-level outcomes and find that, consistent with
the Public Choice view, entry regulation is associated with higher corruption and larger
unofficial economies, but not higher quality of public or private goods. Bertrand and
Kramarz (2002) look more closely at the effects of entry regulation on employment of the

1

Referred to as DLLS below

1

retail sector in France, taking advantage of regional and temporal variation in the
stringency with which entry regulation was applied. They find that entry regulation
decreases retail employment, partly due to the increase in concentration and the ensuing
price upturns.
In our paper, we take an approach that empirically straddles the two papers
described above. We will take advantage of heterogeneity across industries in their
natural barriers and growth opportunities to examine whether some industries are
differentially affected in countries with high levels of entry regulation. This will allow us
to examine how entry regulation differentially influences industrial structure, as a
function of industry characteristics, and the opportunities available to firms in that
industry. This approach contrasts with DLLS, who examine the impact of regulation only
at the country level – our approach will allow for the inclusion of both country and
industry fixed-effects, which mitigates some concerns of unobserved heterogeneity and
reverse causality. Furthermore, DLLS examine only ultimate (social) outcomes of entry
regulation, rather than the direct impact upon industry structure that would be the primary
consequence of regulations according to the Public Choice view (in its “acquired
regulation” formulation). Also, in contrast to Bertrand and Kramarz, by considering a
range of industries and countries, we are able to study the differential impact of
regulation across industries, and reflect on how it varies across a much broader range of
institutional structures.
Our methodology is similar to the approach popularized by Rajan and Zingales
(1998), in that we utilize U.S. data at the industry level to proxy for underlying industry
characteristics that have arisen in an economy with relatively few institutional

2

constraints. Also following the approach of Rajan and Zingales, we then examine how
the relation between (underlying) industry characteristics and actual industry structure is
affected by the extent of entry regulation. We report three primary sets of findings; the
intuition behind each is summarized in the following paragraph.
First, we consider the effect of entry regulation on the (static) structure of
industry. We find that in industries with high natural barriers to entry (and hence little
need for additional barriers through regulation), entry regulation has little impact on the
quantity and average size of firms in an industry. By contrast, in industries with low
natural entry barriers, countries with high entry regulation have few, large firms, relative
to less regulated economies. Surprisingly, there is no relation between natural entry
barriers and overall industry share of manufacturing, as a function of entry regulation.
Second, utilizing firm-level data, we show that operating margins are relatively high in
low barrier industries in high entry regulation countries (relative to high natural barrier
industries). Together, these results suggest that, while entry regulation does not distort
intersectoral allocation, the within-industry organization of production is affected by the
regulation of entry.

We then examine the impact of entry regulation on industry

dynamics, by analyzing the ability of industries to take advantage of shocks to growth
opportunities. These results parallel those on static industry structure: in countries with
high entry regulation, industries respond to growth opportunities through the expansion
of existing firms, while in countries with low entry regulation, the response is primarily
through the creation of new firms. Moreover, we find that the investment response to
growth opportunities is stronger in countries with low entry regulation, when we limit the

3

sample to richer countries.

Once again, we find that the total sectoral response is

invariant to the level of regulation.
Overall, our results provide a consistent body of evidence suggesting that
regulation distorts the (within) structure of industry, promoting industry concentration,
but does not have measurable effects on intersectoral allocations. It is plausible that there
may be some socially beneficial elements to the entry regulations that we examine.
However, given the distortions that we uncover, combined with the absence of any
measurable benefits, we argue in our discussion that the results collectively favor the
Public Choice view of regulation.
The rest of the paper will be structured as follows: In Section 1, we further
elaborate on our methodology. Section 2 describes the datasets that we have brought
together for this paper. Our main results and their interpretation are presented in Section
3, and Section 4 contains our conclusions and discussion.

1. Methodology
1.A. Entry Regulation and Industry Structure
Our first approach is based on the assumption that there exist industries that have
‘naturally’ high entry barriers. The underlying sources of these barriers are of secondary
importance to our study, but may include a range of factors, such as capital intensiveness
of production or technological complexity. For our purposes, what is necessary is that
there exists some component of these barriers that is industry specific and invariant

4

across countries, say Ki, where i indexes industry.2 Furthermore, we observe that models
of entry with fixed costs generally predict a convex relationship between the size of fixed
costs and the number of firms in an industry.3 Thus, we may consider the total (fixed)
cost of entry to be Ki + Rc, where Rc is the cost associated with entry regulation in
country c. Since the number of firms, Nic is convex in Ki + Rc, ∂ 2 N ic ∂K i ∂Rc > 0 . For

size,

Qic/Nic,

The intuition is

straightforward: If ‘natural’ industry entry barriers Ki are extremely high (as in, say,
petroleum refineries or tobacco), then the marginal impact of an increase in a (relatively
small) cost of entry, Rc, will be small. However, if industry entry barriers are close to
zero, the marginal impact of Rc may be quite significant.
A suitable test for this conjecture would examine the interaction between natural
entry barriers and entry regulation. If the presence of natural entry barriers mitigates the
impact of entry regulation on industry structure, we would expect to see this effect
empirically in the interaction of (natural) entry barriers and entry regulation. Our
regressions will thus take the form:

(1)

Log(No. of firms)ic=

(2)

Log(Avg. Firm Size)ic=

i

+

c
i

+

+ *(Entry Barrier)i*(Entry Regulation)c +
c

ic

+ *(Entry Barrier)i*(Entry Regulation)c +

ic

Dunne and Roberts (1991) describe a set of industry characteristics that explain much of inter-industry
variations in turnover rates. Furthermore, they find that the correlation between those industry
characteristics and the industry turnover pattern is stable over time, which they take as an indication these
correlation actually result from differences in technologies across industries. This is confirmed by the
evidence presented by Cable and Schwalbach (1991) on systematic inter-industry figures.
3
This is true, for example, of a simple Cournot model with free entry, and (fixed) linear demand.

5

For our main results, we will use firm turnover (defined below as entry + exit) in the
United States, USTurnoveri, as a proxy for industry-specific entry barriers.4

High

turnover will be taken as a sign of relative ease of entry, i.e., turnover is negatively
correlated with entry barriers.5 This has been suggested by Dunne and Roberts (1991).
They report high inter-industry correlations between entry and exit figures, justifying the
characterization of industries with high natural entry barriers as those exhibiting
relatively high entry and exit barriers. More specifically, they argue that industries can be
characterized by turnover ratios as a function of industry-specific levels of sunk costs.6
That suggests translating (1) and (2) into the following specifications that may be
estimated with available data:

(3)

Log(No. of firms)ic=

(4)

Log(Avg. Firm Size)ic=

i

+

c
i

+

+ *USTurnoveri*(Entry Regulation)c +
c

ic

+ *USTurnoveri*(Entry Regulation)c +

ic

As suggested above, we predict a negative coefficient on the interaction term in (3) and a
positive coefficient on the interaction term in (4).7

4

As a robustness check, we also used the mean industry-level turnover from a set of seven developed
countries (Belgium, Canada, Germany, U.K., Norway, Portugal and the USA). Our results are robust to this
alternative specification.
5
One may think of three ‘classes’ of entry barriers: (1) regulatory (2) ‘technical’ exogenous (e.g., capital
intensity) (3) endogenous but consistent across countries (e.g., advertising). Anything else will be
effectively in our error term. Now, our measure of turnover in the U.S. incorporates both (2) and (3), and
we cannot differentiate between a technological need for scale, versus an industry’s affinity for creating
entry barriers through investment. Analyzing these differences would be interesting, since responses may
vary according to different types of barriers; we leave this exercise, however, for future research. From our
perspective, it does not matter why there exist barriers, simply that they exist and that some component of
them is consistent across countries.
6
An alternative measure of natural entry barriers could be given by considering just the ‘entry’ rate;
however, this measure is more directly influenced by the life cycle of each industry. We include analyses
using this alternative measure of entry barriers in the Appendix.
7
Note that we also ran specifications that looked at the share of number of firms by industry, and found
results that paralleled those derived from (3). These results are available from the authors.

1.B. Entry Regulation and Industry Margins
It is possible that any effects uncovered by regressions (3) and (4) could be the result of
‘artificial’ firm boundaries. Under this hypothesis, industry structure is identical across
all levels of entry regulation in actual functioning, but there are different demarcations
‘on paper’ simply to avoid regulatory costs. To test whether there is an impact on actual
industry structure, we utilize a measure of operating margins, a dependent variable that
directly reflects the ability of firms to set prices above costs. We supplement (3) and (4)
with a parallel set of regressions on margins, focusing once again on the interaction of
‘natural’ entry barriers and regulation:

(5)

Marginic=

i

+

c

+ * USTurnoveri*(Entry Regulation)c +

ic

Since high entry regulation is expected to have a greater impact on market power
whenever natural barriers are low (i.e., turnover is high), we expect a positive coefficient
in the interaction term in equation (5).

1.C. Entry Regulation and Response to Growth Opportunities
We now consider the dynamic effects of entry regulation. If a growth opportunity arises,
entry regulation may prevent potential entrants from responding to the new opportunity.8
For incumbents, however, the opportunity presents a chance for expansion, protected
from the competitive pressures that would be present in less regulated environments.
8

If there exists an optimal firm size, from a technological perspective, all adjustment to demand shocks
should take place through changes in the number of firms. The possibility of supply shocks that affect
optimal firm structure precludes any general statement on this point.

7

That is, high entry regulation will promote the expansion of firm size in response to
growth opportunities, whereas low entry regulation will promote an expansion in the
number of firms where growth opportunities arise. We examine the existence of this
differential response by looking at the interaction terms in the following specifications:

(6)

Growth(No. of Firms)ic=

i

+

c

+

*(Growth Opportunity)i*(Entry Regulation)c +
(7)

Growth(Avg. Firm Size)ic=

i

+

c

ic

+

*(Growth Opportunity)i*(Entry Regulation)c +

ic

Similar to the previous sections, if entry regulation distorts responses to growth
opportunities, we predict

< 0 in (6) and

> 0 in (7). Estimating (6) and (7) requires a

measure of global shocks to growth opportunities. Following Fisman and Love (2003a),
we use actual growth in the United States as a proxy. The rationale is very similar to that
described above: assuming that U.S. firms are in an institutional environment that allows
them to optimally respond to growth opportunities, we may write:

(8)

USGrowthi = (Global Growth Opportunity)i +

iUS

That is, actual growth in the United States is a measure of global shocks to opportunities,
plus some U.S.-specific shock

iUS.

We may then simply rewrite (6) and (7) as:

8

(9)

Growth(No. of Firms)ic=

i

+

c

+

*(USGrowth)i*(Entry Regulation)c +
(10)

Growth(Avg. Firm Size)ic=

i

+

c

ic

+

*(USGrowth)i*(Entry Regulation)c +

ic

2. Data
The data on regulation of entry of start-up firms are from DLLS (2002), which contains
information on the regulations of 77 countries in 1999. Our choice for the measure of
entry regulation includes the entire cost incurred by a prospective firm in order to obtain
legal status to operate, as a fraction of per capita GDP. As described by DLLS, it includes
all identifiable official expenses, together with the monetary value of the entrepreneur’s
time.9 We acknowledge that, although we limit ourselves to manufacturing industries,
there is still very likely within-industry variation in regulation. Unfortunately, we have
not been able to obtain reliable information at the industry level; hence, we use the
country-level measure of entry regulation described above, keeping this caveat in mind.
As our measure of natural entry barriers, we use firm turnover, as explained in the
previous section. Following the intuition of RZ of interpreting US data as ‘industry
representative’ of an optimal economy, we use US turnover data as our proxy for natural
barriers of entry.10 We obtain these data from Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1988),
which contains firm-level entry and exit data based on U.S. census data; we define
9

This variable is identified as Cost + time in DLLS.
Alternatively, we used average turnover ratios from a subset of 7 countries: Belgium, Canada, Germany,
Norway, Portugal, UK and USA (as reported by Roberts, 1996). Our results are robust to this specification.
10

turnover as the simple sum of entry and exit, deflated by the number of firms in the
industry.11
High-income countries may be expected to have technological characteristics that
are more similar to those of U.S. firms. Hence, U.S. turnover may be a better proxy for
technological barriers to entry primarily for richer countries, and as a result, we may wish
to restrict our analyses to wealthier countries in what follows. We construct an auxiliary
dummy variable called RICH which takes on a value of 1 if the country has per capita
income greater than the median of our sample and zero otherwise. Throughout, we will
present results for both our full sample of countries, as well as the limited sample of
countries with RICH=1.12 The reasons for this are twofold: first, our U.S.-based proxies
for growth opportunities and natural barriers are more applicable to more advanced
economies. Also, since the UNIDO data are based on national industrial censuses, data
from countries with RICH=1 are of higher quality than that of the less developed
countries in the broader sample.13
Our outcome variables are derived from the United Nations’ UNIDO database,
which provides data on production, value-added, number of employees, number of
establishments and total wages bill, by industry, for a sample of 57 countries. We will use
two country-industry specific outcome variables in our main regressions: average firm
size, defined as the (log of the) ratio of industry value added to industry total number of
establishments; and the (log of the) number of establishments in each industry.14 The use
11

Dunne and Roberts (1986) provides a full description on the data construction.
Countries that have been classified as RICH can be identified in Table 2.
13
We also computed results using only OECD countries, which generated results very similar to those with
RICH=1. When the sample is limited to OECD firms with RICH=1, the results are even stronger than
those reported in the text.
14
These data are available for 52 out of the 57 countries. When merging this data with the regulation data
from 77 countries, only 36 countries survive.
12

10

of logs allows for a relatively straightforward interpretation of coefficients as elasticities,
and also attenuates the effect of any outliers. Following Rajan and Zingales (1998)15, we
also include an industry’s share of total manufacturing production as a control, defined as
industry value added generated to total manufacture value added.16 Also to be consistent
with earlier work, we use the industry composition utilized by RZ, which is a
combination of 3- and 4-digit ISIC industries. All of the variables described in this
paragraph are constructed using data from 1990.
The UNIDO data do not contain information on industry margins; to fill this gap,
we utilize the World Scope Database (WSD), which provides firm-level data on public
companies worldwide, representing over 96% of the world’s market value. We define
margins as the ratio of operating income to total sales, and generate a measure of margins
at the firm level by taking averages over all available years during 1991-97. This is
further collapsed to industry-country medians for some of the analyses that follow.
Finally, for our analyses on industry-level responses to growth opportunities as a
function of entry regulation, we require a measure of industry-specific growth
opportunities. Once again, we follow the intuition of RZ, using industry-level US sales
growth as a measure of growth opportunities worldwide. As with turnover, we may be
concerned that industry-specific shocks to growth opportunities will be more similar in
countries at similar levels of economic development (see Fisman and Love, 2003b, for a
discussion); hence, we will once again consider our results for both, the entire sample, as
well as the sub sample of countries with RICH = 1. The dependent variables in this
section are also similar to those used by RZ, and are simply the compounded industry15

RZ hereafter.
This variable varies with industry and country, and is therefore not absorbed by the inclusion of country
and industry dummies.

level growth rates of average firm size and number of firms, as well as growth in value
added, as defined above, during 1981-90.17
There may be some concerns that regulation is endogenous to industrial structure
(entry regulation being a result of high industry concentration). Even though this is not
likely to apply to our focus of analysis on the differential impact of regulation across
different types of industries (see next section for more details), we address these concerns
by undertaking an instrumental variables approach. In particular, we use legal origin,
from La Porta et al (1998); as well, we utilize dummy variables reflecting majoritarian
(versus proportional) and presidential (versus parliamentary) political systems.18
Finally, we will consider the effect of other regulation on industry structure.
According to the Public Choice theory of government intervention, any regulation may
indeed serve as an entry barrier, and may therefore potentially have a distortionary effect
on industry structure. We use an index of labor regulation as our primary alternative
measure of regulation, derived from Botero et al (2003), which measures the level of
protection of labor and employment laws, taking into account availability of alternative
employment contracts, conditions of employments and job security. As a coarser,
alternative summary measure of regulation, we use an index derived from Holmes,
Johnson, and Kirkpatrick (1997).
Table 1 provides details on the construction and source for each of our variables,
and Table 2 lists summary statistics, by country and by industry. Panel A reports countrylevel statistics; Panel B presents industry-level summary statistics of our main variables.

The reason for dropping the year 1980 is the amount of missing observation in some of our key variables.
We thank Torsten Persson for providing us with these data.

3. Results
Before proceeding to regressions, we present some basic cross-tabulations to illustrate the
patterns in the raw data. In these cross-tabs, we limit observations to countries with
RICH = 1, to control in a limited way for income effects. In Table 3, we start by showing
the data classified in high versus low turnover industries (where turnover is a proxy for
natural entry barriers), and high versus low entry regulation countries. Table 3(a) shows
the total share in the number of firms for high versus low turnover industries. A much
larger number of firms are in high turnover industries, which is implied by the summary
statistics listed in Table 2.

Consistent with our conjecture on the impact of entry

regulation, the differential between high and low turnover firms is much smaller for
countries with high entry regulation. Table 3 (b) shows a similar set of results for
average firm size, where we find that the gap between the size of firms in low versus high
turnover industries is narrower for countries with high entry regulation. Surprisingly,
average firm size is larger overall in low entry regulation countries; in our regressions,
however, all country-specific factors will be absorbed by fixed-effects, which will allow
for a cleaner comparison on the differential effects of entry regulation by industry. These
results are illustrated in the two upper plots of Figure 1. Additionally, Table 3(c) shows
that margins are indeed higher in low turnover industries, and that the gap is narrower in
high regulation countries. This simple cross-tabulation shows that average margins are
lower in high regulation countries, but this will once again be absorbed by country-level
fixed effects.
Table 3 (d) and (e) show cross tabulations that illustrate the effects of entry
regulation on firms’ responses to growth opportunities, by splitting the sample into high

13

and low growth opportunity industries (as measured by actual growth in the U.S.). In
Table 3 (d), we look at growth in the number of establishments; we observe that in
general, the number of establishments grows more within industries with relatively higher
growth opportunities. However, this differential is much greater in countries where entry
regulation is low. Finally, Table 3 (e) shows the growth rate in average establishment
size, where we observe that industries located in countries with high entry regulation
exhibit relatively higher growth rates in average establishment size in industries with
higher growth opportunities. We plot these results in the lower section of Figure 1.

3.A. Entry Regulation and Industry Structure: Regression Results
Our estimations of equation (3) and (4) are listed in Table 4. In columns (1) and (2) of
Panel A, we show our baseline results, for the full sample and without any additional
controls. The coefficients of interest are of the predicted signs, and are significant at least
at the 5 percent level. Furthermore, the magnitudes are large, and may be illustrated with
the following thought experiment: In moving from Singapore, the country at the 25th
percentile of the distribution of entry barriers, to Peru, the country at the 75th percentile,
the difference between the number of firms in Paper and Allied Products (25th percentile
of USTurnover) and the number of firms in Industrial Machinery and Equipment (75th
percentile of USTurnover) narrows by 11.03 percent ((0.81 – 0.61)*(-0.28 + 0.68))*(1.379). Similarly, the difference in average firm size narrows by 4.76 percent ((0.82 –
0.61)*(- 0.28 + 0.68))*(0.595).19

19

I.e., the slope relating number of firms to USTurnover is less positive in Peru than in Singapore, and the
slope relating average firm size to USTurnover is less negative in Peru than in Singapore.

14

We add log(GDP)*USTurnover as a control in columns (3) and (4), and find that
the size of our coefficients are reduced (in absolute values) but their significance
increases to the 1% level. Finally, in columns (5) through (8), we restrict the sample to
countries with RICH = 1, and find that for this subsample the coefficients show a
stronger and more significant effect on average firm size.20
In Panel B, we repeat the same set of regressions, but with Sector Shareic as the
outcome variable. Interestingly, this does not generate any significant coefficients once
we control for the interaction of turnover with the GDP per capita. Our standard errors in
these regressions are not increased, relative to the preceding set of regressions, suggesting
that the effect of regulation does not distort total intersectoral allocations. Rather, the
regulations affect industry structure through within-industry distortions.

3.B. Entry Regulation and Operating Margins: Regression Results
We present our estimation of equation (5) in Table 5. The coefficient on the interaction
term is positive, suggesting that entry regulation disproportionately generates market
power for firms in high-turnover industries. It is highly significant in all regressions once
we either control for the interaction of GDP per capita and turnover or when the sample is
limited to the subset of “rich” countries. A similar thought experiment to that described
above suggests that in moving from Singapore to Peru, the gap in margins between ‘high’
and ‘low’ regulation industries increases by approximately 0.4 percentage points.

3.C. Entry Regulation and Responses to Growth Opportunities: Regression Results
20

In order to address a potential concern on the endogeneity of our control variable ‘sector share’, we also
estimate these regressions without including such controls. The coefficients of interest remain significant at
conventional levels in models (2) through (8).

15

To analyze the dynamic effects of entry regulation, we turn to the empirical tests
described in (9) and (10), and reported in Table 6. The full-sample regressions yield
significant coefficients in the regressions examining growth in the number of
establishments: there is a smaller response to growth opportunities in those countries with
higher barriers to entry. The coefficients in the regressions examining average
establishment size are of the predicted sign, but not significant at conventional levels.
However, when we limit the sample to countries with RICH = 1, both sets of coefficients
are significant and of the predicted sign (see columns (5) and (6)).

3.D. Robustness Checks
Instrumenting for Regulation
There may be some concern that regulation is endogenous to industrial structure. Thus,
for example, countries with high industry concentration may have high entry regulation,
because of lobbying. Under a more benign interpretation, countries that differentially
benefit from industrial concentration may choose high levels of regulation. We begin by
noting that this does not necessarily contaminate our results: we are interested exclusively
in the differential impact of regulation across different types of industries, so that these
interpretations would similarly have to imply differential effects across industries to
account for our results. To try to address these concerns, we consider several variables
that describe a country’s legal and political structure as instruments. In particular, we use
legal origin, as popularized by La Porta et al (1998), as well as dummies that indicate
whether a country has a presidential (versus parliamentary) political system and whether
a country has a majoritarian (versus proportional representation) voting structure.

16

Persson and Tabellini (2003) and others have argued that these variables significantly
impact both the size of government, as well as the extent to which governments intervene
in the economy.
To be effective instruments, these variables must collectively be predictive of the
extent of entry regulation, i.e., the instruments are significant in the first stage, and the
instruments must only (differentially) affect our outcome variables through their impact
on entry regulation. While we cannot rule out the effect of government structure on
industry organization outside of regulation, this is the most natural channel through
which government may influence industry structure. Now, since we are using these
variables as instruments for regulation interacted with either turnover or USgrowth, the
instruments themselves will be interaction terms. In the first stage, our collection of
instruments is significant at the 1 percent level (based on an F-test); our presidential
dummy interaction is not significant, but all others are individually significant. In the
second stages, reported for the sub sample of rich countries in Table 7, we find that the
magnitudes of the coefficients generated by the instrumental variables approach are very
similar to those in our OLS regressions. Furthermore, with the exception of the results on
margins, all coefficients remain significant at conventional levels.

3.E. Other Forms of Regulation
In this paper, we have focused on the specific type of regulation that we expect to most
directly impact industry structure, due to the effect on the fixed cost of entry, relative to
production (fixed or marginal) costs. However, our explanation could potentially apply
to other types of indirect regulatory barriers to entry, which are correlated with entry

17

regulation. We therefore wish to get a sense of whether regulation generally is distorting
industrial structure by acting as a barrier to entry, or whether there is something special
about regulation of entry. We therefore provide an alternative set of results that examine
the impact of labor regulations, based on the data collected by Botero et al (2003).
In Table 8 we show the results of all our main regressions. In the interests of
space, we report only those regressions considering the sub-sample of rich countries and
those where GDP per capita interactions have been included. Given the entry regulation
results, it is remarkable that none of the interaction terms involving labor regulation are
significant.

We have also repeated these regressions using the overall measure of

government intervention of Holmes, Johnson, and Kirkpatrick (1997), and find that
almost all coefficients are insignificant at the 10 percent level.

3.F. Additional Robustness Checks
As Djankov et al (2003) have noted, regulation is correlated with various other countrylevel characteristics. While the most obvious control, log(GDP per capita), is included in
all reported specifications, there may be concerns of other omitted variables.

We

therefore repeated our full set of regressions including interactions involving a number of
additional covariates that might be expected to impact industry structure. First, we
consider interactions with a measure of financial market development, taken from Rajan
and Zingales, defined as the ratio of private domestic credit and stock market
capitalization to GDP. As well, we consider the effect of including interactive controls
utilizing the country-level measure of corruption developed by Kaufmann, Kraay, and
Zoido-Lobatón (2003). Finally, we try to control for overall bureaucratic quality using a

18

measure from Political Risk Services (1997). In no case were any of the coefficients
systematically significant. Furthermore, the coefficients on the interaction terms reported
above were uniformly unaffected by the inclusion of these additional interaction terms.21
A second concern that affects the “average size” specification is that our measure
of firm size is based on value added, which incorporates both prices and quantities
produced. To ensure that these results are not driven purely by price effects, but signify
‘real’ distortions, we repeat these specifications using employment-based measures of
firm size, also derived from the UNIDO data. These results are reported in Table AP1 of
the Appendix, and parallel the firm size results based on firm value-added.
As a final robustness check, we estimate analogous regressions using USEntry
instead of USTurnover as a proxy for entry barriers. These results are listed in Table AP2
of the Appendix; the coefficients in all regressions remain significant at conventional
levels, and are generally larger in magnitude than those reported in the main text.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, we study the distortions to the organization of industry caused by
entry regulation, taking advantage of heterogeneity across industries in their natural
barriers and growth opportunities to examine whether some industries are differentially
affected in countries with high levels of entry regulation. First, we consider the effect of
entry regulation on the (static) structure of industry. We find that in industries with high
‘natural’ barriers to entry, as proxied by firm turnover in the U.S., entry regulation has
little impact on the quantity and average size of firms in an industry. By contrast, in

21

These results can be obtained from the authors.

19

industries with low ‘natural’ entry barriers, countries with high entry regulation have few,
large firms, relative to less regulated economies. We find no relation between ‘natural’
entry barriers and overall industry share of manufacturing, as a function of entry
regulation.

Second, utilizing firm-level data, we show that operating margins are

relatively high in low barrier industries in high entry regulation countries (relative to high
‘natural’ barrier industries). Finally, we examine the impact of entry regulation on
industry dynamics, by analyzing the ability of industries to take advantage of shocks to
growth opportunities, and find that in countries with high entry regulation, industries
respond to growth opportunities through the expansion of existing firms, while in
countries with low entry regulation, the response is primarily through the creation of new
firms; the total sectoral response is invariant to the level of regulation. Overall, our
results provide a consistent body of evidence suggesting that regulation distorts the
(within) structure of industry, promoting industry concentration, but does not have
measurable effects on intersectoral allocations.
It is worth noting, in conclusion, some potential policy implications of our
findings.

The Public Interest view does allow for the possibility that industrial

organization may be distorted through the creation of regulatory entry barriers. However,
the particular form of regulations that we examine here, in contrast to the regulation of
labor, environmental contaminants, or product safety, do not provide obvious social
returns. Therefore, the market power and distortions in industry structure that we report
may not be offset by social gains. We leave further analysis on the overall welfare
implications of regulation as an area for further research.

TABLE 7 – Table 7 presents instrumental variable results. The set of instruments includes a dummy for presidential political
systems, a dummy for majoritarian voting structures, and dummies for legal origin, all interacted with USTurnover in models (1) – (4)
and interacted with USGrowth in models (5) – (7). In all regressions, the sample is limited to countries with RICH=1. The same sets
of controls are included as in the preceding regressions. All regressions include country and industry dummies. ***, ** and *
represent coefficients significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively. Standard errors in brackets.

Table AP2 – Table AP2 shows the regression analysis of the relationship between Entry Regulation and Industry Structure, using
“USEntry” rate instead of “USTurnover” rate as a proxy (inverse) of natural entry barriers. Avsz represents the Firm Average Size
measured as the ratio of Industry Value Added to Industry Number of Establishments and Number measures the Industry Number of
Establishments. The sample is limited to countries with RICH=1. The same sets of controls are included as in the preceding
regressions. All regressions include country and industry dummies. ***, ** and * represent coefficients significant at the 1%, 5%, and
10% levels respectively. Standard errors in brackets.
