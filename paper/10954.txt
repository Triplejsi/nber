Introduction

Ken Rogoff (2003) elaborates on some favorable factors
that have been helping to drive down global inflation in
the 1990s. An hypothesis, which he put forth, is that the
“globalization—interacting

with

deregulation

and

privatization—has played a strong supporting role in the
past decade’s disinflation.”

It is interesting to explore what has guided monetary
authorities in the pursuit of low inflation in the 1990s, in
the presence of strong forces of globalization.

This note considers how the output-gap and inflation
weights, in a utility-based loss function of the monetary
authority, are affected by opening of the country to trade
and by the liberalization of the international capital
flows.

II. Utility Based Welfare Criterion

Michael Woodford (2003, Chapter 6) demonstrates how
to derive a quadratic loss function from a standard
welfare criterion of a representative household. The
welfare criterion, from which he derives a quadratic loss
function, is the expected utility of the representative
household, given by

Where,

and

Real marginal costs are:
s ( y ( j ), Y ; ξ , A) = v y ( y ( j );ξ , A) / uc (Y ; ξ ) .

It follows that the elasticity of

v y ( y ( j );ξ , A)

with respect to y

is given by ω , and the elasticity of real marginal cost s with
respect to Y is given by

Efficient Level of the Output Gap

The steady state level of output is given by
s (Y , Y ;0,1) = v y (Y ;0,1) / uc (Y ;0) =

The symbol

state output level as a result of both taxation and market power:

(1)

τ

is the Woodford-Rothemberg sales-subsidy (financed by

lump sum taxes) that aims at neutralizing the monopolistic
competition inefficiency in the steady state); and
(2)

µ=

θ −1

is the mark up as a result of producers’ market

power.
Efficient (zero mark up) output is thus given by
s (Y *,Y *;0,1) = 1 .

Note that

Y /Y *

Is a decreasing function of Φ , equal to one

when Φ = 0 .
This property enables us to get the approximation
log(Y / Y *) = −(ω + σ −1 )Φ

.

We can naturally define

x* = log(Y / Y *) = −(ω + σ −1 )Φ

Inflation and Relative Price Distortions

We postulate a

(γ ,1 − γ ) split

between the goods prices that are fully

flexible (group 1) and the good prices that are set one period in
advance (group 2).
The aggregate supply relationship is:
π t = E t −1π t + κx t
κ≡

γ σ −1 + ω
1 − γ 1 + θω

.
Now we exploit the property that

log pt( 2 ) = Et −1 log pt(1)
log Pt = γ log pt(1) + (1 − γ ) log pt( 2 )
⇒

π t − Et −1π t = γ [log pt(1) − Et −1 log pt(1) ]
= γ [log pt(1) − log pt( 2 ) ]
⇒
var j log pt ( j ) = γ (1 − γ )[log pt(1) − log pt( 2 ) ] 2
=

[π t − Et −1π t ] 2

This means that Aggregate output and inflation
variations are proper arguments in the welfare
function. It is the output gap and the unexpected
inflation); and the relative weight that is placed
upon the two objects is related to slope of the
aggregate supply.

III. The Open Economy

Razin and Yuen (2002) extended this closedeconomy

framework

to

an

open

economy.

Specifically, they derive the slope of the aggregate
supply relationship for various openness regimes.

Perfect Capital Mobility
If capital is perfectly mobile, then the domestic agent has a
costless access to the international financial market. As a
consequence, household can smooth consumption similarly
in the rigid price and flexible price cases.

=>

Cˆ t = Cˆ tN

The Aggregate-Supply curve is:

π t − E t −1π t =

γ ⎡ nϖ ˆ h ˆ N (1 − n)ϖ ˆ f ˆ N ⎤ 1 − n ⎛ 1

,

where, ê is a proportional deviation of the real exchange rate from
its corresponding steady state level, and

Ŷt f

is a proportional

deviation of the rest-of-the-world output from its corresponding
steady state level.

The approximate utility function is:
U t = −(cons tan t ) Lt

Lt = (π t − E t −1π t ) 2 +

1 γ
nϖ
( x t − x*) 2
θ 1 − γ 1 + ϖθ

x* = (ω + σ −1 ) −1 Φ

Where, n denotes the number of domestically produced
goods, and 1-n denotes the number of imported goods. .

Closing the Capital Account
If the domestic economy does not participate in the
international financial market, then there is no possibility of
consumption smoothing, and we have that:
Cˆ t = Yˆt ; Cˆ tN = Yˆt N

In this case, the Aggregate-Supply Curve is:

π t − E t −1π t =

⎞
γ ⎡ nϖ + σ −1 ˆ h ˆ N (1 − n)ϖ ˆ f ˆ N ⎤ 1 − n ⎛ 1

⎦

, where, e denotes the real

exchange rate.
The Loss function is:
U t = −(cons tan t ) Lt

Lt = (π t − E t −1π t ) 2 +

1 γ 1 γ
nϖ
( x t − x*) 2
θ 1 − γ θ 1 − γ 1 + ϖθ

x* = (ω + σ −1 ) −1 Φ

Closing the Trade Account (Back to the Closed
Economy)
If both the capital and trade accounts are closed, then the
economy is an autarky, completely isolated of the rest of
the world. In this case, all the goods in the domestic
consumption index are produced domestically, which
means that n = 1.

The Aggregate Supply Curve becomes:
⎛ γ
π t − E t −1π t = ⎜⎜
⎝1− γ

⎞⎛ ϖ + σ −1 ⎞ ˆ h ˆ N
⎟⎟(Yt − Yt )
⎟⎟⎜⎜
⎠⎝ 1 + ϖθ ⎠

The loss function is:
U t = −(cons tan t ) Lt

Lt = (π t − E t −1π t ) 2 +

1 γ 1 γ σ −1 + ω
( x t − x*) 2
θ 1 − γ θ 1 − γ 1 + θω

x* = (ω + σ −1 ) −1 Φ

IV. Comparing the Output Gap and Inflation Weights
in the Loss Function
The weight of the output gap in each one of the openness
scenarios is given by:

(i)

ψ1 =

γ nϖ
θ (1 − γ )(1 + θϖ )
1

Goods Mobility)

(Perfect International Capital and

(ii)

ψ2 =

1 γ ( n ϖ + σ −1 )
θ (1 − γ )(1 + θϖ )

(Closed Capital Account and Open

Trade)

(iii)

1 γ (ϖ + σ −1 )
ψ3 =
θ (1 − γ )(1 + θϖ )

(Fully Closed economy)

We can see that,
ψ1 <ψ 2 <ψ 3 .

(Note we implicitly assume that the price-setting fractions
(γ ,1 − γ )

across the different openness scenarios are the same;

empirically this assumption can be relaxed).

This means that successive rounds of opening reduce the
output gap weight in the utility-based loss function.

V. Conclusion

Global inflation has dropped from 30 percent a year to
about 4 percent a year. At this period a massive
globalization process also swept emerging markets in Latin
America and East Asia. This note put forth the hypothesis

that globalization induces the monetary authority, guided in
its policy by the welfare criterion of a representative
household, to put more emphasis on reducing inflation, at
the expense of larger output gaps. In such an endogenous
policy set up, globalization motivates central banks to
engage in pro-active disinflation policies.
