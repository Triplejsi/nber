Where Are We Now? Real-Time Estimates of the Macro Economy

JEL No. E3, C3
ABSTRACT
This paper describes a method for calculating daily real-time estimates of the current state of the U.S.
economy. The estimates are computed from data on scheduled U.S. macroeconomic announcements
using an econometric model that allows for variable reporting lags, temporal aggregation, and other
complications in the data. The model can be applied to find real-time estimates of GDP, inflation,
unemployment or any other macroeconomic variable of interest. In this paper I focus on the problem
of estimating the current level of and growth rate in GDP. I construct daily real-time estimates of
GDP that incorporate public information known on the day in question. The real-time estimates
produced by the model are uniquely-suited to studying how perceived developments the macro
economy are linked to asset prices over a wide range of frequencies. The estimates also provide, for
the first time, daily time series that can be used in practical policy decisions.

Introduction
Information about the current state of real economic activity is widely dispersed across consumers, …rms and policymakers. While individual consumers and …rms know the recent history
of their own decisions, they are unaware of the contemporaneous consumption, saving, investment
and employment decisions made by other private sector agents. Similarly, policymakers do not
have access to accurate contemporaneous information concerning private sector activity. Although
information on real economic activity is collected by a number of government agencies, the collection, aggregation and dissemination process takes time. Thus, while U.S. macroeconomic data
are released on an almost daily basis, the data represent o¢ cial aggregations of past rather than
current economic activity.
The lack of timely information concerning the current state of the economy is well-recognized
among policymakers. This is especially true in the case of GDP, the broadest measure of real activity. The Federal Reserve’s ability to make timely changes in monetary policy is made much more
complicated by the lack of contemporaneous and accurate information on GDP. The lack of timely
information concerning macroeconomic aggregates is also important for understanding private sector behavior, and in particular the behavior of asset prices. When agents make trading decisions
based on their own estimate of current macroeconomic conditions, they transmit information to
their trading partners. This trading activity leads to the aggregation of dispersed information and
in the process a¤ects the behavior of asset prices. Evans and Lyons (2004a) show that the lack of
timely information concerning the state of the macroeconomy can signi…cantly alter the dynamics
of exchange and interest rates by changing the trading-based process of information aggregation.
This paper describes a method for estimating the current state of the economy on a continual
basis using the ‡ow of information from a wide range of macroeconomic data releases. These realtime estimates are computed from an econometric model that allows for variable reporting lags,
temporal aggregation, and other complications that characterize the daily ‡ow of macroeconomic
information. The model can be applied to …nd real-time estimates of GDP, in‡ation, unemployment
or any other macroeconomic variable of interest. In this paper, I focus on the problem of estimating
GDP in real time.
The real-time estimates derived here are conceptually distinct from the real-time data series
studied by Croushore and Stark (1999, 2001), Orphanides (2001) and others. A real-time data
series comprises a set of historical values for a variable that are know on a particular date. This
date identi…es the vintage of the real-time data. For example, the March 31st. vintage of real-time
GDP data would include data releases on GDP growth up to the forth quarter of the previous

1

year. This vintage incorporates current revisions to earlier GDP releases but does not include a
contemporaneous estimate of GDP growth in the …rst quarter. As such, it represents a subset
of public information available on March 31st. By contrast, the March 31st. real-time estimate
of GDP growth comprises an estimate of GDP growth in the …rst quarter based on information
available on March 31st. The real-time estimates derived in this paper use an information set that
spans the history of data releases on GDP and 18 other macroeconomic variables.
A number of papers have studied the problem of estimating GDP at a monthly frequency. Chow
and Lin (1971) …rst showed how a monthly series could be constructed from regression estimates
using monthly data related to GDP and quarterly GDP data. This technique has been subsequently
integrated into VAR forecasting procedures (see, for example, Robertson and Tallman 1999). More
recently, papers by Lui and Hall (2000) and Mariano and Murasawa (2003) have used state space
models to combine quarterly GDP data with other monthly series. The task of calculating real-time
estimates of GDP growth has also been addressed by Clarida, Kitchen and Monaco (2002). They
develop a regression-based method that uses a variety of monthly indicators to forecast GDP growth
in the current quarter. The real-time estimates are calculated by combining the di¤erent forecasts
with a weighting scheme based on the relative explanatory power of each forecasting equation.
I di¤er from this literature by modelling the growth in GDP as the quarterly aggregate of an
unobserved daily process for real economy-wide activity. The model also speci…es the relationship
between GDP, data releases on GDP growth, and data releases on a set of other macroeconomic
variables in a manner that accommodates the complex timing of releases.2 This structure enables
me to compute real-time estimates of GDP as the solution to an inference problem. In practice, I
obtain the real-time estimates as a by-product of estimating the model. First, the model parameters
are estimated by (qausi) maximum likelihood using the Kalman Filter algorithm. The real-time
estimates are then obtained by applying the algorithm to the model evaluated at the maximum
likelihood estimates.
My method for computing real-time estimates has several noteworthy features. First, the estimates are derived from a single fully-speci…ed econometric model. As such, we can judge the
reliability of the real-time estimates by subjecting the model to a variety of diagnostic tests. Second, a wide variety of variables can be computed from the estimated model. For example, the
model can provide real-time forecasts for GDP growth for any future quarter. It can also be
used to compute the precision of the real-time estimates as measured by the relevant conditional
2
By contrast, Lui and Hall (2000) and Mariano and Murasawa (2003) assume that GDP aggregates an unobserved
monthly process for economy-wide activity. This assumption generates a model with a simpler structure, but it
cannot accommodate the complex timing of data releases.

variance. Third, the estimated model can be used to construct high frequency estimates of realeconomic activity. We can construct a daily series of real-time estimates for GDP growth in the
current quarter, or real-time estimates of GDP produced in the current month, week, or even day.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the inference problem
that must be solved in order to compute the real-time estimates. Here I detail the complex timing
of data collection and macroeconomic data releases that needs to be accounted for in the model.
The structure of the econometric model is presented in Section 2. Section 3 covers estimation and
the calculation of the real-time estimates. I …rst show how the model can be written in state space
form. Then I describe how the sample likelihood is constructed with the use of the Kalman Filter.
Finally, I describe how various real-time estimates are calculated from the maximum likelihood
estimates of the model. Section 4 presents the model estimates and speci…cation tests. Here I
compare the forecasting performance of the model against a survey of GDP estimates by professional
money managers. These private estimates appear comparable to the model-based estimates even
though the managers have access to much more information than the model incorporates. Section 5
examines the model-based real-time estimates. First, I consider the relation between the real-time
estimates and the …nal GDP releases. Next, I compare alternative real-time estimates for the level
of GDP and examine the forecasting power of the model. Finally, I study how the data releases on
other macro varaibles are related to changes in GDP at a monthly frequency. Section 6 concludes.

Real-Time Inference

My aim is to obtain high frequency real-time estimates on how the macro economy is evolving. For
this purpose, it is important to distinguish between the arrival of information and data collection
periods. Information about GDP can arrive via data releases on any day t: GDP data is collected
on a quarterly basis. I index quarters by

and denote the last day of quarter

by q( ); with the

…rst, second and third months ending on days m( ; 1); m( ; 2) and m( ; 3) respectively. I identify
the days on which data is released in two ways. The release day for variable { collected over quarter
is r{ ( ): Thus, {r(

)

denotes the value of variable {; over quarter ; released on day r{ ( ): The

release day for monthly variables is identi…ed by r{ ( ; i) for i = 1; 2; 3: In this case, {r(

;i)

is the

value of {; for month i in quarter ; announced on day r{ ( ; i): The relation between data release
dates and data collection periods is illustrated in Figure 1:
The Bureau of Eonomic Analysis (BEA) at the U.S. Commerce Department releases data on
GDP growth in quarter

Figure 1: Data collection periods and release times for quarterly and monthly variables.
The reporting lag for “…nal”GDP growth in quarter , yq( ) ; is ry ( ) q( ). The reporting
lag for the monthly series zm( ;j) is rz ( ; j) m( ; j). for j = 1; 2; 3:
second month; and the “…nal” data are released at the end of quarter

+ 1. The “…nal” data

release does not represent the last o¢ cial word on GDP growth in the quarter. Each summer, the
BEA conducts an “annual”or comprehensive revision that generally lead to revisions in the “…nal”
data values released over the previous three years. These revisions incorporate more complete and
detailed micro data than was available before the “…nal” data release date.3
Let xq(

as the reporting lag for quarterly data. (For data series { collected during month i of quarter ;
the reporting lag is r{ ( ; i) m( ; i):) Reporting lags vary from quarter to quarter because data
is collected on a calendar basis but announcements are not made on holidays and weekends. For
example, “…nal”GDP data for the quarter ending in March has been released between June 27 th.
and July 3 rd.
Real-time estimates of GDP growth are constructed using the information in a speci…c information set. Let

end of day t: The real-time estimate of GDP growth in quarter

there is no a priori reason to believe that real-time forecast error is always small.

For this purpose, I incorporate the

information contained in the “advanced”and “preliminary”GDP data releases. Let y^r(

)

and y~r(

)

respectively denote the values for the “advanced” and “preliminary” data released on days ry^( )
and ry~( ) where q( ) < ry^( ) < ry~( ): I assume that y^r(

represent noisy signals of the

)

represents the revision

represents the revision between days ry^( ) and ry~( ): The

speci…cation of (5) and (6) implies that the “advanced” and “preliminary” data releases represent
unbiased estimates of actual GDP growth.
The three GDP releases {^
yr( ) ; y~r( ) ; yr( ) } represent a sequence of signals on actual GDP
growth that augment the public information set on days ry^( ); ry~( ) and ry ( ): In principle we
could construct real-time estimates based only on these data releases as E[

y
qx
q( ) j q( ) ];where

y
t

is the information set comprising data on the three GDP series released on or before day t :
y
t

y^r( ) ; y~r( ) ; yr(

)

: r( ) < t :

Notice that these estimates are only based on data releases relating to GDP growth before the
current quarter because the presence of the reporting lags exclude the values of y^r( ) ; y~r( ) ; and
yr(

)

from

q( ) :

As such, these candidate real-time estimates exclude information on

qx
q( )

that

is available at the end of the quarter. Much of this information comes from the data releases on
other macroeconomic variables, like employment, retail sales and industrial production. Data for
most of these variables are collected on a monthly basis4 , and as such can provide timely information
on GDP growth. To see why this is so, consider the data releases on Nonfarm Payroll Employment,
z. Data on z for the month ending on day mz ( ; j) is released on rz ( ; j); a day that falls between
the 3’rd and the 9’th of month j + 1 (as illustrated in Figure 1). This reporting lag is much shorter
than the lag for GDP releases but it does exclude the use of employment data from the 3r’d month
in estimating real-time GDP. However, insofar as employment during the …rst two months is related
to GDP growth over the quarter, the values of zr(

;1)

and zr(

;2)

will provide information relevant

to estimating GDP growth at the end of the quarter.
The real-time estimates I construct below will be based on data from the three GDP releases
and the monthly releases of other macroeconomic data. To incorporate the information from these
other variables, I decompose quarterly GDP growth into a sequence of daily increments:
d( )

vary in length from month to month.
The real-time estimates derived in this paper are based on a information set speci…cation that
includes the 3 GDP releases and 18 monthly macro series; z i = 1; 2; :::18: Formally, I compute the

data releases a¤ect estimates of the current state of the economy, and forecasts of how it will evolve
in the future. As such, they are uniquely suited to examining how data releases a¤ect a whole array
of asset prices.

dose not change from day to day

after quarter ends, so the relation between the data release and actual GDP growth is una¤ected
by within-quarter variations in the reporting lag. The reporting lag for the “preliminary”data are
also always less than one quarter. Combining (1) and (6) with the de…nition of

In cases where the reporting lag is two months,

Equations (24) and (25) accommodate all the monthly data releases I use except for the index
of consumer con…dence, i = 18. This series is released before the end of the month in which the
survey data are collected. These data are potentially valuable for drawing real-time inferences
because they represent the only monthly release before q( ) that relates to activity during the last
month of the quarter. I incorporate the information in the consumer con…dence index (i = 18) by
projecting zt18 on the partial sum sm

shock. Equation (27) expresses the growth contribution on day t

as a weighted average of the monthly contributions over the last k (completed) months, plus an
error term. This speci…cation has two noteworthy features. First, the daily contribution on day
t only depends on the history of
m(i) x :
t

Thus, forecast for

xt insofar as it is summarized by the monthly contributions,

xt+h conditional

m(i) x k
t i=1

are the same for horizons h within the

current month. The second feature of (27) is that the process aggregates up to a AR(k) process for
mx
m( ;j)

at the monthly frequency. As I shall demonstrate, this feature enables use to compute

real-time forecasts of future GDP growth over monthly horizons with comparative ease.

Estimation

Finding the real time estimates of GDP and GDP growth requires a solution to two related problems.
First, there is a pure inference problem of how to compute E[xq( ) j

i]

and E[

qx
q( ) j i ]

using

the quarterly signalling equations (18) - (21), the monthly signalling equations (24) - (26), and
the

xt process in (27), given values for all the parameters in these equations. Second, we need

to estimate these parameters from the three data releases on GDP and the 18 other macro series.
This problem is complicated by the fact that individual data releases are irregularly spaced, and
arrive in a non-syncronized manner: On some days there is one release, on others there are several,
and on some there are none at all. In short, the temporal pattern of data releases is quite unlike
that found in standard time-series applications.
The Kalman Filtering algorithm provides a solution to both problems. In particular, given
a set of parameter values, the algorithm provides the means to compute the real-time estimates
E[xq( ) j

i]

and E[

qx
q( ) j i ]:

The algorithm also allows us to construct a sample likelihood func-

tion from the data series, so that the model’s parameters can be computed by maximum likelihood.
Although the Kalman Filtering algorithm has been used extensively in the applied time-series
literature, its application in the current context has several novel aspects. For this reason, the
presentation below concentrates on these features.5

The State Space Form

To use the algorithm, we must …rst write the model in state space form comprising a state and
observation equation. For the sake of clarity, I shall present the state space form for the model
where

xt depend only on last month’s contribution (i.e., k = 1 in equation (27)). Modifying the

state space form for the case where k > 1 is straightforward.
The dynamics described by equations (14) - (17), (22), (23) and (27) with k = 1 can be
represented by the matrix equation:

when “…nal” GDP for the …rst quarter is released before the start of the third quarter, while
ql1t (y) = 0 and ql2t (y) = 1 in case where the release in delayed until the third quarter. Under
normal circumstances, the “advance” and ”preliminary” GDP data releases have reporting lags

12

that are less than a month. However, there was one occasion in the sample period where all the
GDP releases were delayed so that the qlit ({) dummies are also needed for the y^t and y~t equations.
The link between the data releases on the monthly series and elements of the state vector are
described by (24) - (26). These equations can be written as

This equation links the vector of potential data releases for day t; Xt ; to elements of the state
vector: The elements of Xt identify the value that would have been released for each series given
the current state, Zt ; if day t was in fact the release day. Of course, on a typical day, we would
only observe the elements in Xt that corresponding to the actual releases that day. For example, if
data on “…nal” GDP and monthly series i = 1 are released on day t; we would observe the values
in the 3’rd. and 4’th rows of Xt : On days when there are no releases, none of the elements of Xt
are observed.
The observation equation links the data releases for day t to the state vector. The vector of
actual data releases for day t; Yt ; is related to the vector of potential releases by
Yt = Bt Xt ;
where Bt is a n

7 selection matrix that “picks out”the n

13

if data on monthly series i = 1 is released on day t; Bt = [ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ]: Combining this
expression with (31) gives the observation equation:
Yt = Bt Ct Zt + Bt Ut :

(32)

Equation (32) di¤ers in several respects from the observation equation speci…cation found in
standard time-series applications. First, the equation only applies on days for which at least
one data release takes place. Second, the link between the observed data releases and the state
vector varies through time via Ct as qlit ({) and mlit ({) change. These variations arise because
the reporting lag associated with a given data series change from release to release. Third, the
number and nature of the data releases varies from day to day (i.e., the dimension of Yt can
vary across consecutive data-release days) via the Bt matrix. These changes may be a source of
heteroskedasticity. If the Ut vector has a constant covariance matrix

u;

the vector of noise terms

entering the observation equation will be heteroskedastic with covariance Bt

The Kalman Filter and Sample Likelihood Function

Equations (28) and (32) describe a state space form which can be used to …nd real-time estimates
of GDP in two steps. In the …rst, I obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the model’s parameters. The second step calculates the real-time estimates of GDP using the maximum likelihood
parameter estimates: Below, I brie‡y describe these steps noting where the model gives rise to
features that are not seen in standard time-series applications.

Notice that (34) - (36) di¤er from the standard …ltering equations because the structure of the
state-space form in (28) and (32) changes via the At ; Ct and Bt matrices. The …ltering equations
also need to account for the days on which no data is released.
As in standard applications of the Kalman Filter, we need to insure that all the elements of
are identi…ed. Recall that equation (1) includes a error term

t

to allow for annual revisions to

the “…nal” GDP data that take place after the release day ry ( ): The variance of

t;

2;
v

is not

identi…ed because the state space form excludes data on the annual revisions. Rather than amend
the model to include these data, I impose the identifying restriction:

2
v

= 0:6 This restriction

limits the duration of uncertainty concerning GDP growth to the reporting lag for the “…nal”GDP
release. In Section 5, I show that most of the uncertainty concerning GDP growth in quarter
resolved by the end of the …rst month in quarter

is

+ 1; well before the end of the reporting lag.

Limiting the duration of uncertainty does not appear unduly restrictive.
6

In principle, the state space form could be augmented to accommodate the revision data, but the resulting state
vector would have 40-odd elements because revisions can take place up to three years after the “…nal” GDP data is
released. Estimating such a large state space system would be quite challenging. Alternatively, one could estimate 2v
directly from the various vintages of “…nal”growth rates for each quarter, and then compute the maximum likelihood
estimates of the other parameters conditioned on this value.

3.3

Calculating the Real-Time Estimates of GDP

Once the maximum likelihood estimates of

have been found, the Kalman Filtering equations can

be readily used to calculate real-time estimates of GDP. Consider, …rst, the real-time estimates at
the end of each quarter

qx
q( )jq( ) :

By de…nition, Ztjj denotes the expectation of Zt conditioned

on data released by the end of day j, E[Zt j

j ]:

Hence, the real-time estimate of quarterly GDP

growth are given by
q

for

^ tjt denotes the value of Ztjt

based on the MLE of
estimates of

qx
q( )

the sequence

qx
q(

of quarters

and

computed from (34) - (36). The Kalman Filter allows us to study how the

change in the light of data releases after the quarter has ended. For example,
^
)jt = h2 Ztjt , for q( ) < t q( + 1); shows how data releases between the end
qx
q( ) :

+ 1 change the real-time estimates

We can also use the model to …nd real-time estimates of GDP growth before the end of the
quarter. Recall that quarterly GDP growth can be represented as the sum of daily increments:
d( )

xq(

X

xq(

Real time estimates of

The …rst term on the right hand side is the real-time estimate of the partial sum sqt de…ned in
(12). Since sqt is the …rst element in the state vector Zt ; a real-time estimate of sqt can be found
^ tjt : The second term in (38) contains real-time forecasts for the daily increments
as E[sqt j t ] = h1 Z
over the remaining days in the month. These forecasts can be easily computed from the process
for the increments in (27):
E[ xt+h j

Once again it

Iterating on the identity

we can write

Thus, log GDP for quarter

can be written as the sum of quarterly GDP growth from quarters 1

of this expression gives
xq(

E[

xq(i) j

q( ) ]:

(41)

Notice that the terms in the sum on the right hand side are not the real-time estimates of GDP
growth. Rather, they are current estimates (i.e. based on

q( ) )

of past GDP growth. Thus, we

cannot construct real-time estimates of log GDP by simply aggregating the real-time estimate of
GDP growth from the current and past quarters.
In principle, xq(

)jq( )

could be found using estimates of E[

qx
q(i) j q( ) ]

computed from the

state-space form with the aid of the Kalman Smoother algorithm (see, for example, Hamilton 1994).
An alternative approach is to apply the Kalman Filter to a modi…ed version of the state-space form:

Zat = Aat Zat + Vat ;

Yt = Bt Cat Zat + Bt Ut ;

Real-time estimates of log GDP in quarter

based on information available on day t < q( )

can be calculated in a similar fashion. First, we use (7) and the de…nition of xt to rewrite (40) as
q( )

xq(

h=t+1

As above, the real-time estimate is found by taking conditional expectations:

The real-time estimate of log GDP for quarter ; based on information available on day t
comprises the real time estimate of xt and the sum of the real-time forecasts for

Q( )

xt+h over the

remainder of the quarter. Notice that each component on the right hand side was present in the
real-time estimates discussed above, so …nding xq(

To this point I have concentrated on the problem of calculating real-time estimates for GDP
and GDP growth measured on a quarterly basis. We can also use the model to calculate real-time
estimates of output ‡ows over shorter horizons, such as a month or week. For this purpose, I …rst
decompose quarterly GDP into its daily components. These components are then aggregated to
construct estimates of output measured over any horizon.
Let dt denote the log of output on day t: Since GDP for quarter

is simply the aggregate of

daily output over the quarter,
xq(
where d( )

)

Xd(

;

(44)

1) is the duration of quarter : Equation (44) describes the exact nonlinear

relation between log GDP for quarter

and the log of daily output. In principle, we would like

to use this equation and the real-time estimates of xq(

)

to identify the sequence for dt over each

quarter. Unfortunately, this is a form of nonlinear …ltering problem that has no exact solution.
Consequently, to make any progress we must work with either an approximate solution to the
…ltering problem, or a linear approximation of (44). I follow the second approach by working with

18

a …rst order Taylor approximation to (44) around the point where dt = x(

This expression takes the same form as the decomposition of quarterly GDP growth in (7) with
xt = dt

xq(

+ ln d( ) =d( ): Rearranging this expression gives us the following approxi-

mation for log daily output
dt = xq(

1)

+ d( ) xt

ln d( ):

(47)

According to this approximation, all the within-quarter variation in the log of daily output is
attributable to daily changes in the increments

xt : Thus changes in xt within each quarter provide

an approximate (scaled) estimate of the volatility in daily output.
The last step is to construct the new output measure based on (47). Let xht denote the log ‡ow
Ph 1
of output over h days ending on day t: xht
ln
i=0 exp (dt i ) : As before, I avoid the problems
caused by the nonlinearity in this de…nition by working with a …rst order Taylor approximation

Empirical Results

4.1

Data

The macroeconomic data releases used in estimation are from International Money Market Services
(MMS). These include real-time data on both expected and announced macro variables. I estimate
the model using the three quarterly GDP releases and the monthly releases on 18 other variables
from 4/11/93 until 6/30/99. In speci…cation tests described below, I also use market expectations of
GDP growth based on surveys conducted by MMS of approximately forty money managers on the
Friday of the week before the release day. Many earlier studies have used MMS data to construct
proxies for the news contained in data releases (see, for example, Urich and Watchel 1984, Balduzzi
et al. 2001, and Andersen et al. 2003). This is the …rst paper to use MMS data in estimating real
time estimates of macroeconomic variables.
The upper panel of Table 1 lists the data series used in estimation. The right had columns
report the number of releases and the range of the reporting lag for each series during the sample
period. The lower panel shows the distribution of data releases. The sample period covers 1682
workdays (i.e. all days excluding weekends and national holidays).7 On approximately 55% of
these days there was a least one data release. Multiple data releases occurred much less frequently;
on approximately 16% of the workdays in the sample. The were no occasions when more that four
data releases took place.
The release data were transformed in two ways before being incorporated in the model. First,
I subtracted the sample mean from each of the GDP releases. This transformation implies that
the real-time estimates presented below are based on the assumption that long-run GDP growth
remained constant over the sample period. If the span of my data were considerably longer, I could
identify how the long-run rate of GDP growth has varied by estimating a modi…ed form of the
model that replaced (27) with a process that decomposed

xt into short and long run components.

I leave this extension of the model for future work.

The second transformation concerns the monthly data. Let z~r(

Although economic activity obviously takes place on weekend and holidays, I exclude these days from the sample
for two reasons. First, they contain no data releases. This means that the contribution to GDP on weekends and
holidays must be exclusively derived from the dynamics of (27). Second, by including only workdays we can exactly
align the real-time estimates with days on which US …nancial markets were open. This feature will be very helpful
in studying the relation between the real-time estimates and asset prices.

series provide noisy signals on the monthly contribution to GDP growth (see equations (24) - (26)).
Quasi di¤erencing in this manner allows each of the raw data series to have a di¤ering degree of
persistence than the monthly contribution to GDP growth without inducing serial correlation in
the projection errors shown in (24) - (26). The degree of quasi-di¤erencing depends on the
parameters which are jointly estimated with the other model parameters.

Estimates and Diagnostics

The maximum likelihood estimates of the model are reported in Table 2. There are a total of 63
parameters in the model and all are estimated with a great deal of precision. T-tests based on the
asymptotic standard errors (reported in parenthesis) show that all the coe¢ cient are signi…cant at
the 1% level. Panel A of the table shows the estimated parameters of the daily contribution process
in (27). Notice that the reported estimates and standard errors are multiplied by 25. With this
scaling the reported values for the
AR(6) process for

Mx
M( ;j)

i

parameters represent the coe¢ cients in the time-aggregated

in a typical month (i.e. one with 25 workdays). I shall examine the

implications of these estimates for forecasting GDP below.
Panel B reports the estimated standard deviations of the di¤erence between the “advanced”
and "…nal" GDP releases, ! a
releases ! p

y~t

y^t

yt ; and the di¤erence between the “preliminary” and “…nal”

yt : According to equations (5) and (6) of the model, V(! a ) = V(! p ) + V(^
er( ) ) so

the standard deviation of ! a should be at least as great as that of ! p : By contrast, the estimates in
panel B imply that V(! a ) < V(! p ):8 This suggests that revisions the BEA made between releasing
the “preliminary” and“…nal” GDP data were negatively correlated with the revision between the
“advanced” and “preliminary” releases. It is hard to understand how this could be a feature of an
optimal revision process within the BEA. However, it is also possible that the implied correlation
arises simply by chance because the sample period only covers 25 quarters.
Estimates of the parameters linking the monthly data releases to GDP growth are reported in
Panel C. The …rst column shows that there is considerable variation across the 18 series in the
estimates of

i:

In all cases the estimates of

i

are statistically signi…cant indicating that the quasi-

di¤erenced monthly releases are more informative about GDP growth than the raw series. The
i

estimates also imply that the temporal impact of a change in growth varies across the di¤erent

monthly series. For example, changes in GDP growth will have a more persistent e¤ect on the
Consumer Con…dence Index (^ 15 = 0:977) than on Nonfarm Payroll Employment (^ 1 = 0:007): The
i

estimates reported in the third column show that 12 of the 18 monthly releases are pro-cyclical

(i.e. positively correlated with contemporaneous GDP growth). Recall that all the coe¢ cients are
signi…cant at the 1% level so the

i

estimates provide strong evidence that all the monthly releases

contain incremental information about current GDP growth beyond that contained in past GDP
data releases.

To check robustness, I also estimated the model with the V(! a ) = V(! p ) + V(^
er( ) ) restriction imposed. In this
case the MLE of V(^

from the Box-Pierce Q statistic for joint signi…cance of the correlations from lag 1 to j: Overall,
there is little evidence of serial correlation in the innovations. Exceptions arise only in the case
of “preliminary” GDP at the one quarter lag, and in the cases of consumer credit and business
inventories at the six month lag.
To assess the economic signi…cance of these …ndings, panel B of Table 3 compares the (withinsample) forecasting performance of the model against the survey responses collected by MMS.
On the Friday before each scheduled data release, MMS surveys approximately forty professional
money managers on their estimate for the upcoming release. Panel B compares the median estimate
from the surveys against the real-time estimate of GDP growth implied by the model on survey
days. For example, in row (iii) under the MMS columns I report the mean and mean squared error
(M.S.E.) for the di¤erence between the value for “…nal” GDP growth in quarter ; yr( ) ; and the
median response from the survey conducted on the last Friday before the “advanced”GDP release
on day s( ). The mean and M.S.E of the di¤erence between yr(

)

and the estimate of E[yr( ) j

s( ) ]

derived from the model are reported under the Model columns. Notice that the survey and model
estimates are compared against the value for the “…nal” GDP release in all four rows. This means
that the forecasting horizon, (i.e. the di¤erence between r( ) and s( )) increases from less than
one week in row (i), to approximately …ve weeks in row (ii), and approximately 11 weeks in row
(iii). Row(iv) reports the mean and M.S.E. at all three horizons.
The table shows that both the mean and M.S.E. associated with both the survey and model
forecasts increase with the forecasting horizon as we move down from row (i) to (iii). The statistics
in row (i) indicate that the median survey response provides a superior forecast than the model in
terms of mean and M.S.E. Moving to row (ii), the evidence is ambiguous. The model produces a
smaller mean but larger M.S.E. than the median survey. In row (iii) the balance of the evidence
favors the model; the M.S.E. is slightly higher but the mean is much lower than the survey estimates.
This set of results provides rather strong support for the model. Remember that money managers
have access to all the data releases used by the model as well as other public and private information.
Thus, we should expect the forecasts of a single manager to be at least as good as the model
forecasts. And, insofar as these forecasts contain idiosyncratic elements, the median forecast from

Strictly speaking, this assumes that all managers have information that is equivalent to knowledge of the MLE

forecasting horizon is less than a week. At longer horizons, the use of private information imparts
less of a forecasting advantage to money managers. In fact, the results in row (iii) suggest that
as we move the forecasting day back towards then end of quarter ; the survey and model-based
forecasts have comparable performance. When the forecasting day is pushed all the way back to
the end of the quarter, the model-based forecast gives us the real-time estimates of GDP growth.
Thus, the results in panel B indicate that real-time estimates derived from the model should be
comparable to private forecasts based on much richer information sets.

Analysis

This section examines the model estimates. First, I consider the relation between the real-time
estimates and the “…nal” GDP releases. Next, I compare alternative real-time estimates for the
level of GDP and examine the forecasting power of the model. Finally, I study how the monthly
releases are related to changes in GDP at a monthly frequency.

5.1

Real-time Estimates over the Reporting Lag

Figure 2 allows us to examine how the real-time estimates of GDP growth change over the reporting
lag. The green line plots the “…nal”GDP growth for quarter

each quarter. The vertical dashed portion represent the discontinuity in the series at the end of each
quarter (i.e. on day q( )):10 Several features of the …gure stand out. First, the real-time estimates
vary considerably in the days immediately after the end of the quarter. For example, at the end of
1994, the real-time estimates of GDP growth in the forth quarter change from approximately 1.25%
to 2.25% and then to 1.5% in the space of a few days. Second, in many cases there is very little
di¤erence between the value for “…nal” GDP and the real-time estimate immediately prior to the
release (i.e., yr(

)

'

qx
q( )jr( ) 1 ):

In these cases, the “…nal”release contains no new information

about GDP growth that was not already inferred from earlier data releases. In cases where the
“…nal” release contains signi…cant new information, the blue plot “jumps” to meet the green plot
on the release day.
of :
10
In cases where the reporting lag is less than one quarter, the discontinuity occurs (a couple of days) after ry ( )
so the end of each solid blue segment meets the turning point in the green line identifying the “…nal” GDP release.
When the reporting lag is longer than one quarter, there is a horizontal gap between the end of a blue segment and
the next turning point on the green line equal to ry ( ) q( + 1) days.

with a 95% con…dence band. Although the path for the conditional variance varies somewhat from
quarter to quarter, the narrow con…dence band shows that the average pattern displayed in the
…gure is in fact quite representative of the variance path seen throughout the sample.
Figure 3 clearly shows how the ‡ow of data releases during the reporting lag provides information
on

qx
q( ) :

In the …rst 20 days or so the variance falls by approximately 25% as information from

the monthly releases provides information on the behavior of GDP during the previous month

, and the dashed lines denote the 95% con…dent band. The horizontal axis marks the the
number of days i past the end of quarter q( ):
(month 3 of quarter ): The variance then falls signi…cantly following the “advanced”GDP release.
The timing of this release occurs between 19 and 23 working days after the end of the quarter so
the averaged variance path displayed by the …gure spreads the fall across these days. Thereafter,
the variance falls very little until the end of the reporting lag when the “…nal” value for GDP
growth is released.11 This pattern indicates that the “preliminary”GDP release provides little new
information about GDP growth beyond that contained in the “advanced” GDP release and the
monthly data. The …gure also shows that most of the uncertainty concerning GDP growth in the
last quarter is resolved well before the day when the “…nal” data is released.
11
Although the variance falls immediately to zero on the day of the release, the averaged variance falls to zero over
several days in the …gure because the reporting lag varies from 58 to 65 workdays in the sample.

Real-Time Estimates of GDP and GDP Growth

GDP growth releases. The red line plots the values of xq(

cumulant of the “…nal” GDP releases i=1 yr(i) with a lead 60 days. This plot represents an ex
post estimate of log GDP based on the “…nal” data releases. The vertical steps identify the values
for “…nal” GDP growth 60 days before the actual release day.
Figure 4 displays three notable features. First, both sets the real-time estimates display a much
greater degree of volatility than the cumulant series. This volatility re‡ects how inferences about
current GDP change as information arrives in the form of monthly data releases during the current
quarter and GDP releases referring to growth in the previous quarter. The second noteworthy
feature concerns the relation between the real-time estimates. The vertical di¤erence between the
red and blue plots represents the contribution of the

xt+h forecasts to xq(

)jt :

As the …gure shows,

these forecasts contributed signi…cantly to the real-time estimates in 1996 and 1997, pushing the
real-time estimates of xq(

)

well below the value for E[xt j

t ].

The third noteworthy feature of the

…gure concerns the vertical gap between the red and green plots. This represents the di¤erence
between the real-time estimates and an ex post estimate of log GDP based on the “…nal” GDP
releases. This gap should be insigni…cant if the current level of GDP could be precisely inferred
from contemporaneously available data releases. Figure 3 shows this to be the case during the
third and forth quarters of 1995. During many other periods, the real-time estimates were much
less precise.

5.3

Forecasting GDP Growth

The model estimates in Table 2 show that all of the

i

coe¢ cients in the daily growth process are

statistically signi…cant. I now examine their implications for forecasting GDP growth. Consider
the di¤erence between the real time estimates of xt+m and xt+n based on information available on

and xt+n between t and t + n:
Since both revision terms are uncorrelated with elements of

we can use (49) to examine

changes in xtjt . In particular, after multiplying both sides of (49) by xt+mjt+m

The upper panel shows

how predictable the monthly changes in the real-time estimates of xt are for horizons m of 20 to
240 days. The estimated process for
R2

xt implies a reasonable high degree of predictability: the

estimates fall from approximately 20 to 10 per cent as horizon rises from 20 to 140 workdays.

Estimates of R2 (m; n) for quarterly changes in the real-time estimates are reported in the lower
panel of the table. These are somewhat smaller, but again clearly indicate the presence of some
predictability.
The results in Table 4 related to the change in the real-time estimates of xt rather than GDP
growth. Recall from (43) that the real-time estimate of log GDP on day t in quarter is xq( t )jt =
Pq( t )
E[xt j t ] + h=t+1

This equation shows that changes in the real-time estimates of xt are only one component of the
estimated quarterly growth in GDP. Moreover, since the second and third terms on the right hand
side of (50) will generally be correlated with the …rst term, the results in Table 4 may an unreliable
guide to the predictability of GDP growth.
We can examine the predictability of GDP growth by combining (49) and (50) to give

correctly predict the direction of GDP growth 59 per cent of the time.
For perspective on these forecasting results, I also estimated an AR(2) model for quarterly
GDP growth using the sequence of “…nal”GDP releases. This model provides a simple time series
forecast for GDP growth (approximately) one quarter ahead, based on the two most recent releases.
In contrast to the results presented above, estimates of the AR(2) model do not indicate that
quarterly GDP growth is at all predictable: The coe¢ cients are small and statistically insigni…cant
and the R2 statistic is only 3 per cent. These results are hardly surprising. Remember that the
sample mean was removed from all the GDP growth releases so we are attempting to forecast future
deviations in GDP growth. Figure 2 shows that these deviations display little serial correlation.
Thus, it is not surprising that the history of GDP releases has little forecasting power. These
observations also point to the signi…cance of the forecasting results displayed in Table 4 and Figure
5. In particular, they show that monthly data releases contain information that is useful for both

estimating the current state of the GDP and for forecasting its future path.

Monthly Estimates of GDP Growth

One of the unique features of the model is its ability to provide us with high frequency estimates
of log GDP and GDP growth. I now examine how the monthly data releases relate to the changing
real-time estimates of log GDP. My aim is to provide a simply description of the complex inference
problem solved by the model regarding the current state of GDP.
Let t and t + 20 be workdays in quarters

q( 1 ): (Note

the monthly change in the real-time estimates of log GDP to all 18 monthly releases:

=

X

i
ai (rt+20

t+20 ;

(51)

i=1

where rti denotes the last value released for series i on day t: Thus, the value of rti remains that
same from day to day unless t is the day on which a data release for series i takes place. This means
i
that rt+20

rti identi…es the change in the latest value for series i released during the 20 workdays

ending on t + 20: The second model relates the change in the real-time estimates to each monthly
release separately:
xq(

1 )jt+20

xq(

0 )jt

i
= bi (rt+20

rti ) +

t+20 ;

(52)

for i = 1; 2; ::18: Notice that the regressors in both models are available on a daily bases. Estimates
of the ai and bi coe¢ cients therefore summarize how the complex inference imbedded in the model
relate to observable changes in the information set comprised of monthly data releases.
Table 5 reports the estimates of equations (51) and (52). The left hand columns show that the ai
estimates are statistically signi…cant for data on nonfarm payroll, retail sales, industrial production,
personal consumption, factory orders, the trade balance, the index of consumer con…dence and
housing starts. Each of these data releases provides signi…cant incremental information about the
change in the real-time estimates. The 18 monthly releases account for approximately 57 per cent
of the variance in xq(

1 )jt+20

xq(

0 )jt

: This means that more than 40 per cent of the variation in the

real-time estimates is not captured by the simple linear speci…cation. The right hand columns report
the results from estimating equation (52). The most noteworthy aspects of these estimates can be
seen for i = 1; 2; and 3: Changes in both nonfarm payroll and retail sales appear strongly linked

to changes in the real-time estimates. Based on the R2 statistics (in the right hand column), these
variables account for 23 and 19 per cent of the variance in the real-time estimates. The results
for i = 3 provide some justi…cation for the frequent use of industrial production as a monthly
proxy for GDP growth. The estimate for b3 indicates the real-time estimates of log GDP change
approximately one-for-one with change in industrial production between releases. Notice, however,
that the R2 statistic is only 0.233. Industrial production does not account for most of the variance
in the real-time estimates.

Conclusion

In this paper I have presented a method for estimating the current state of the economy on a continual basis using the ‡ow of information from a wide range of macroeconomic data releases. These
real-time estimates were computed from an econometric model that allows for variable reporting
lags, temporal aggregation, and other complications that characterize the daily ‡ow of macroeconomic information. The model can be applied to …nd real-time estimates of GDP, in‡ation,
unemployment or any other macroeconomic variable of interest.
In this paper I focused on the problem of estimating GDP in real time. This application of
the estimation procedure should be of particular interest to policymakers concerned with the lack
of timely information about economy-wide real activity. The real-time estimates I calculate have
several noteworthy features: First, the estimates of log GDP display a good deal of high-frequency
volatility. This volatility re‡ects how inferences about current GDP change as information arrives
in the form of monthly data releases during the quarter. Second, the gaps between the real-time
estimates and ex post GDP data are on occasion both persistent and signi…cant. These …ndings
suggest that the ex post data should not be viewed as a close approximation to what was known at
the time. Third, the model estimates reveal that the monthly data releases contain information that
is useful for forecasting its future path of GDP. Finally, my comparison of the real-time estimates
with the monthly data series shows that standard proxies for real actively at the monthly frequency
capture only a fraction of the variance in the real-time estimates.
These …ndings give but a ‡avor of the uses to which real-time estimates could be put. One
obvious topic for the future concerns the ability of the real-time estimates and forecasts to identify
turning points in the business cycle. This issue could be readily addressed if the model were reestimated over a much longer time-span than was undertaken here. The use of real-time estimates
may also bring new perspective to the link between asset prices and macroeconomic fundamentals.
Evans and Lyons (2004a) use the methods described here to construct real-time estimates for GDP,
in‡ation, and money supplies for the U.S. and Germany. With the aid of these estimates, they then
show that foreign exchange transactions contain signi…cant information about the future path of
fundamentals. Since transaction ‡ows also exert a very strong in‡uence on exchange rate dynamics
in the short run, this …nding points to a much stronger link between fundamentals and exchange
rates than pervious research has uncovered. It remains to be seen whether the use of real-time
estimates will similarly illuminate the links between macro fundamentals and other asset prices.
