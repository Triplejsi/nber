ABSTRACT
This paper offers an empirical test of ownership mix efficiency in the U.S. nursing home
industry. We test to compare the benefits of quality assurance with the costs from the attenuation
of property rights that result from an increased presence of nonprofit organizations. The
empirical results suggest that too few nonprofit nursing homes may exist in the typical market
area of the U.S. The policy implication is that more quality of care per dollar might be obtained
by attracting a greater percentage of nonprofit nursing homes into most market areas.

Introduction

Since Kenneth Arrow’s classic 1963 study “Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics
of Medical Care,” economists have been interested in why nonprofit organizations are
so prevalent in health care markets. As Arrow pointed out, medical care is a highly
complex personal service, one for which there exists considerable uncertainty
surrounding quality. One hypothesis for the prevalence of nonprofits in healthcare
markets is that nonprofit ownership status serves as a signal for quality in the
presence of asymmetric information.
Hansmann (1980) has shown that nonprofit organizations face a non-distribution
constraint because they cannot legally distribute any of their residual earnings.
Nonprofit organizations must dispense all residual earnings for the express
educational, charitable, or religious purposes for which they were formed. Thus, the
non-distribution constraint implies nonprofit organizations face little financial
incentive to compromise the quality of care they provide. This is in contrast to forprofit organizations, which clearly have financial incentives to engage in
opportunistic behavior, such as skimping on the quality of care they provide, when
consumers are imperfectly informed. Consequently, economic theory suggests that an
isolated nonprofit healthcare organization may offer higher levels of quality than an
otherwise comparable for-profit organization.1
However, given the possible attenuation of property rights caused by the nondistribution constraint, economists are quick to point out that nonprofit organizations
are also likely to face a more severe principal-agent problem. In particular, the
absence of a residual claimant with a financial interest in the organization means that

3

no one individual, or group of individuals, has strong incentives to monitor the
behavior of the organization. Therefore, in a nonprofit healthcare organization, the
divergence between the interests of the principal(s) and the agent(s) often leads to the
inefficient production and provision of medical care services. This is because
unconstrained managers of nonprofit organizations will be more inclined to pursue
personal goals and objectives, which are likely to conflict with minimum cost
production, ceteris paribus. Thus, property-rights theory predicts that, in isolation, a
nonprofit healthcare organization will produce at higher costs than an otherwise
comparable for-profit organization.2
While theory tends to be unambiguous in predicting that an “isolated” nonprofit
organization will produce medical care with higher quality and production costs than
an otherwise similar for-profit organization, both Hirth (1999) and Grabowski and
Hirth (2002) have pointed out that nonprofit and for-profit organizations rarely
operate in isolation; in fact, they often compete against one another. Consequently,
they hypothesize that competitive spillovers from nonprofits will lead to a higher
quality of care in for-profit nursing homes. In support of their theory, the researchers
find empirical evidence that an increase in nonprofit market share improves for-profit,
and overall, nursing home quality.
Grabowski and Hirth (2002), and much earlier, Tuckman and Chang (1988), note
that competitive spillovers from for-profits may influence the behavior of nonprofit
nursing homes.3 They argue that competition from for-profit organizations may limit
the inefficiency of nonprofits. Inefficiency is limited because nonprofits have to be
more concerned with the costs of producing medical care when facing competition

4

from the more cost conscious for-profit organizations. Grabowski and Hirth conclude
(p. 19) that ‘If non-profits have a competitive advantage in “trustworthiness” while
for-profits have greater incentives for efficiency, intersectoral competition can yield
better outcomes than a market consisting exclusively of one type of firm.’
Based upon the notion that a mix of for-profit and nonprofit organizations may
promote societal well being, this paper develops and conducts a unique empirical test
to assess the efficiency of the ownership mix in the typical nursing-home market. As
previously discussed, the existence of both nonprofit and for-profit nursing homes in
a single market area can be expected to generate both social benefits and costs. By
empirically estimating the relationship between the nonprofit (or for-profit) market
share and nursing home care utilization, we can infer the net social benefit of
additional nonprofit facilities. We discuss this in the next section of this paper and
also explain how we plan to conduct the empirical test. Section III describes the data
and sample used in the empirical analyses. Section IV presents the empirical findings
and the last section offers conclusions.

II.

Conceptual Model

The approach we use to test for the efficient mix of for-profit and nonprofit nursing
homes in a geographical market is derived from Svorney (1987). Svorney examined
the role of professional interests in establishing physician licensure. She argued that
physician licensure potentially raises costs through higher wages because it acts as an
entry barrier, but, she emphasized, it may also provide greater benefits in the form of
quality assurance. The ultimate test of the efficiency of professional licensure, she

5

argued, depends on whether or not the favorable demand response outweighs the
undesirable supply response. For example, if the benefit of quality assurance causes
demand to increase (i.e., shift the demand curve to the right) more than higher wages
cause supply to decrease (i.e., shift the supply curve to the left), then the utilization of
physician services increases, and this reflects the net social benefit that physician
licensure offers.4 Hence, one may observe the impact of a regulation (or type of
institution) on the utilization of a particular good or service, and from that draw an
inference about its effect on economic efficiency.
In a similar vein, the efficiency of a mix of health care organizations with
different ownership forms may be analyzed in this manner. For example, and in the
context of our research, suppose we are comparing two similar nursing home markets
that differ in the following respect: market area “A” is completely dominated by forprofit facilities whereas market area “B” is characterized by an equal distribution of
market shares across for-profit and nonprofit facilities. A graphical exposition of this
comparison is presented in figure 1 for a competitive marketplace.
[INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]
The curves DA and SA represent the demand and supply for nursing home care in
market A (where for-profit facilities completely dominate). Notice that QA measures
the market clearing quantity of nursing home care in market A.
Given the different mix of ownership structures, the markets are likely to differ in
two principle respects, ceteris paribus. First, there will exist a greater demand for
nursing home care in market area B because of the increased quality assurance
resulting directly (or indirectly) from the greater prevalence of nonprofit nursing

6

homes. The greater quality assurance is captured by demand curve DB in figure 1.
Second, the supply of nursing home care may be lower in area B because of the
higher production costs resulting from the diminished property-rights incentives from
more nonprofit nursing homes operating in the market.5 Higher production costs are
reflected in supply curve SB in figure 1. Because the demand (quality assurance)
effect is assumed to be stronger than the cost effect in our example, the equilibrium
quantity of nursing home care, QB, is greater in market B than market A.
Whether or not the demand effect more than offsets the supply effect in the
typical U.S. nursing home market is an empirical question that can be tested using
multiple regression analyses. The test can be conducted by observing the impact that
nonprofit (or for-profit) market share has on nursing home care utilization, while
carefully controlling for a host of other supply and demand factors. Equation 1
represents the general reduced-form model used in the forthcoming statistical
estimations. In equation 1, Qi represents the equilibrium quantity of nursing home
care in market i; NPSi represents the market share held by nonprofit nursing homes
in market i; D ji is a vector of j additional variables that are expected to influence the
demand for nursing home care in market i; and S ki is a vector of k additional
variables hypothesized to affect the supply of nursing home care in market i. The
error term, µ i , is assumed, for now, to be independent and normally distributed with
constant variance and a mean of zero (constant terms and/or fixed effects in equation
1 have been suppressed for algebraic convenience).

The hypothesis is that the nonprofit share exerts an inverted U effect on the utilization
of nursing home care as illustrated in Figure 2. The general idea is that both the marginal
benefits of quality assurance and marginal costs associated with the attenuation of
property rights depend in part on the relative amount of nonprofit organizations in a
market area. For example, the marginal benefit of increased quality assurance is likely to
decline as a greater percentage of nonprofit nursing homes locate in a market area. That
is, the same marginal improvements in quality become increasingly more difficult to
achieve or squeeze out. Similarly, the marginal costs associated with diminished property
rights incentives may increase with respect to a greater percentage of nonprofit nursing
homes in a market area, especially if a medical arms race ensues from greater nonprofit
activity. For instance, nursing home may compete through cost-enhancing nonprice
means such as superfluous amenities.
[INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT THERE]
Figure 2 allows for diminishing marginal benefits and increasing marginal costs
from the increased presence of nonprofit organizations. Notice as the nonprofit share
increases from 0 to NFP*, utilization increases because the marginal benefits of quality
assurance initially outweigh the marginal costs resulting from the attenuation of property
rights. However at higher values of the nonprofit share the converse holds such that
marginal costs exceed marginal benefits. Hence the coefficient estimates on the linear
and squared NPS terms are expected to be positive and negative, respectively. Given the
nonlinear specification, we can solve for the optimal mix of nonprofit (and for-profit)
nursing homes and compare it to the actual mix for a representative market area.

III. Data and Empirical Test
Data were gathered for each of the 2,939 nursing home markets in the U.S. to test our
ownership-efficiency hypothesis. In our test, the county was assumed to be a reasonable
approximation for the relevant geographical market for nursing home care. Ample
precedent supports the county as a proxy for the relevant geographical market in the
nursing home industry (e.g., Nyman, 1985; Cohen and Spector, 1996; Grabowski and
Hirth, 2002; Gulley and Santerre, 2003). The data used in our empirical analyses are for
the year 1996 and come from five different sources. Table 1 reports the mean value,
standard deviation, and data source for each of the variables used in our empirical
analyses.
[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]
The conceptual model indicates that a measure of nursing home care utilization, or
quantity, Qi , is necessary to conduct the test. We experimented with several measures of
utilization, and they all produced highly similar results. The first measure we employed
was the number of nursing home residents in the market area, expressed both as a fraction
of the total population and as a fraction of the total number of individuals aged both 65
years and older and 85 years and older.

Ratios were used to directly control for

population differences across market areas. The second utilization measure used was the
number of nursing home beds, also expressed as a fraction of both the total population
and the total number of persons aged both 65 years and older and 85 and older. Due to
the high degree of similarity in the findings generated by the various dependent variables,
we only report the multiple regression results from models that employed nursing home
residents per capita as a measure of utilization.

9

The primary focus of our paper is on the impact of ownership mix on efficiency in the
nursing home industry. As a result, the aggregate market share of nonprofit nursing
homes is specified in the regression model to capture the different degrees of competitive
spillovers in the various nursing home markets.

Theoretically, the market share of

nonprofit nursing homes may be endogenous. For example, residents may be drawn to
nonprofit nursing homes because managers set aside extra beds and charge lower prices
in pursuit of the personal utility derived from operating larger organizations (e.g.,
Newhouse, 1970). As a result, we tested if the nonprofit share was endogenous.
Following Grabowski and Hirth (2002), the instrument used to test for the
endogeneity of the nonprofit nursing home market share is the nonprofit share of hospital
beds in 1986.6 In their study, Grabowski and Hirth make a compelling theoretical and
empirical case for this particular instrument. Theoretically, they argue that the lagged
value of the nonprofit hospital market share serves as a plausible instrument because it
captures those areas that have historically been more favorable for the development of
nonprofit health care organizations. In addition, the relative share of non-profits in
different parts of the country may be deeply rooted in historical factors such as the age of
the city and different patterns of voluntarism and charitable provision that have little to
do with the advanced technology and prevalence of third party payment that characterize
the current health care environment (e.g., see Stevens (1989) for a history of the
organizational structure of the U.S. hospital industry). Grabowski and Hirth’s statistical
analysis provided strong support for the suitability of the lagged hospital market share as
an instrument. Using the instrument discussed above, we employed the Hausman test of

10

exogeneity. The test failed to reject the null hypothesis of the exogeneity of the nonprofit
market share.
As previously mentioned, we must also control for other factors that could result in
utilization differences across market areas, in an effort to isolate the impact of ownership
mix on efficiency. Otherwise, the omission of variables that are correlated with both
ownership mix and the number of residents could lead us to draw incorrect inferences
from our empirical results. Following the conceptual model, these other influences are
broken down into the aforementioned demand-side variables, D j and supply-side
variables S k . The demand-side variables affecting nursing home care utilization include:
population (in logs), population density, the median income (in logs), the poverty rate,
the percentage of the population aged 65 years and older, the percentage of the
population aged 85 years and older, the percentage of the population that is white, the
percentage of the female population unemployed, and the percentage of the female
population divorced.
These demand-side variables are intended to control for differences in the willingness
and ability to pay for nursing home care across market areas. Except for a few, the
rationale for including most of these demand-side variables should be self-evident. The
female unemployment and divorce rates are intended to capture the availability of
informal care outside nursing homes. The supply-side variables are intended to capture
relative differences in the costs of providing and the willingness to offer nursing home
care across the various market areas. As such, they include: the CMS area wage index (in
logs), a dummy variable denoting the existence of a Certificate of Need law in the state, a
dummy variable denoting the presence of a nursing facility construction moratorium in

11

the state, and a set of variables capturing the level and type (e.g., retrospective, case-mix
adjusted, etc.) of Medicaid reimbursement in the state. We also estimated models using
state fixed effects in place of these largely state-specific variables.
We experimented with several different specifications involving our dependent
variable, nursing home residents per capita, and the independent variable of interest,
nonprofit market share. A linear specification and a specification involving a logistic
transformation of residents per capita proved to be fairly representative of the various
results obtained. The logistic transformation adjusts to some degree for the skewed
leftward distribution of the number of nursing home residents per capita. White’s test
(1980) identified the presence of heteroscadasticity so the estimates in our models have
been corrected so that they are heteroscadastic-consistent (following his procedure).

IV. Empirical Results
Ordinary least square (OLS) estimates are reported for four specifications in table 2. The
first two columns report the OLS results for the linear model and the model involving a
logistic transformation of the dependent variable without state fixed effects. The last two
columns report our OLS results for the same specifications, but with state fixed effects
replacing the state-level variables. Each independent variable’s coefficient estimate and
its corresponding t-statistic (in absolute terms) shown in parentheses are reported in the
table.7
[INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]
The results for the control variables are fairly consistent across specifications. Some
results are worth pointing out. First, the logistic transformation appears to provide a

12

better fit to theory. Economic theory suggests that market output declines in response to a
supply decrease resulting from such factors like higher wages. Because production is
very labor intensive, one would expect such a relationship to hold in the nursing home
care industry. Notice that the prediction of supply theory is supported by the specification
involving the logistic transformation of the dependent variable given the negative and
statistically significant coefficient estimate on the CMS area wage.
Second, the positive and statistically significant coefficient estimates on the CON law
and moratorium dummy variables in the specifications involving no state fixed effects are
interesting in terms of their implication. CON laws are typically viewed as creating an
entry barrier and thereby leading to a reduction of market output. Our results lend no
support for this monopoly theory behind CON laws. Lastly, the positive and statistically
significant estimated parameter on the Medicaid reimbursement rate agrees with the
predictions of the dual market model and a recent study by Gulley and Santerre (2003).
Recall that our conceptual model hypothesizes an inverted U-relationship between the
nonprofit share and residents per capita. As anticipated, the nonprofit market share does
exert an inverted U impact on the quantity of nursing home care in all four specifications.
Moreover, according to the results, the optimal share of nonprofit homes ranges from
roughly 42 to 46 percent of all nursing homes (shown at the bottom of the table).
Table 3 shows the distribution of the actual nonprofit market shares in the 2,939
market areas. On average the nonprofit market share equals 23 percent with a median
value of nearly 7 percent. According to the table, the nonprofit market share is below 20
percent in nearly 61 percent of the market areas. An additional 15 percent of all market
areas are characterized by a nonprofit market share lying somewhere between 20 and 40

13

percent. Thus, if our specification and empirical findings are correct, efficiency - in terms
of quality of care per dollar - could be significantly improved in a large percentage of the
market areas by changing the ownership of nursing homes from for-profit to not-forprofit status. A change in the ownership of nursing homes from not-for-profit to for-profit
status would also have to occur but only in less than 22 percent of all market areas.
These results are certainly intriguing because they suggest ownership conversion may
be necessary in the nursing home industry to bring about increased efficiency. At the
same time, the results are not surprising given the attention paid to allegations of inferior
quality of care in the nursing home industry (Institute of Medicine, 2001). Interestingly, a
70 percent nonprofit market share characterizes the hospital industry but we cannot be
certain if that figure represents the efficient mix. Why market forces have not naturally
resulted in more nonprofit nursing homes remains a mystery. Noncompetitive factors
such as the presence of third party payers and CON laws may provide some explanation
for the underallocation of nonprofit organizations to the nursing home industry
(Lakdawalla and Philipson, 1998). Future studies are certainly needed to sort out the real
reason behind this observed inability or unwillingness of nursing home markets to make
the necessary correction.

V. Conclusion
This paper offers a test of the efficiency of the ownership mix in nursing home markets
across the U.S. When consumers lack sufficient information about nursing home quality,
the general notion is that nonprofit organizations generate societal benefits by offering
(and signaling) quality assurance, but they may simultaneously result in higher
production costs because of less attention devoted to efficiency. The opposite scenario

14

holds for for-profit organizations. Thus, a mix of ownership types in the marketplace may
keep quality and costs under control as a result of competitive spillovers.
In this study we proposed that the efficiency of the ownership mix might be inferred
by viewing how the ownership mix affects utilization through the use of multiple
regression analyses. Our empirical results suggest that too few nonprofit nursing homes
characterize the typical nursing home market (county) of the U.S., at least in 1996. As a
result, greater quality of care per dollar could be achieved by encouraging more nonprofit
nursing homes in most market areas of the U.S. Local and state policy makers may want
to offer inducements such as zoning waivers and construction bond subsidies to attract
more nonprofit nursing homes into their areas.
Other studies following this approach are warranted, however, before any general
conclusions may be drawn about the efficiency of the overall mix of nonprofit and forprofit organizations in other healthcare industries such as hospital services or dialysis
services. Also, our approach may be relevant for testing the efficiency of ownership mix
in other sectors of the economy. For example, a mixture of ownership forms exists in the
education services and utility industries and also in the local public sector (e.g., refuse
collection). By following our approach, researchers will be able to determine if
competitive spillovers among ownership forms take place and to what degree a particular
ownership form is underrepresented from a societal perspective. We encourage others to
explore the efficiency of ownership forms in other sectors of the economy in the U.S. and
in other countries.

1

For example, Chou’s (2002) empirical results support the theory that for-profit nursing homes practice
opportunistic behavior and sacrifice quality of care for more profits when asymmetric information exists.
2

Nyman and Bricker (1989) were among the first to use data envelopment analysis to show that nonprofit
nursing homes produce with higher costs than otherwise similar for-profit nursing homes.
3

In recent work by Kessler and McClellan (2002) examining the hospital market, areas with a stronger
presence of for-profits have 2.4% lower overall expenditures, but virtually the same patient outcomes.
4

Svorney finds empirically that physician licensure leads to a reduced consumption of physician services.
That is, physician licensure increased entry costs (supply) by more than it increased consumer benefits
from quality assurance (demand). Thus her results provide support for the special interest theory of
physician licensure.
5

Nonprofit organizations also result in lost tax revenues as pointed out by Lakdawalla and Philipson
(1998). More tax revenues will be lost in less competitive market areas. Hence we control for the
competitiveness of the nursing home market with a number of factors as explained later.
6

Grabowski and Hirth also specify the growth of the elderly population for the 5-year period from 1991 to
1996 as an additional instrument. Given that our dependent variable is the number of residents, this
instrument is much less ideal that the lagged nonprofit hospital share.
7

Similar results are obtained when all markets areas with a nonprofit market share of 100 percent are
eliminated from the analysis. In some earlier work, we also controlled for several other factors including
the number of doctors and hospitals per capita, the number of nursing homes per capita, the HerfindahlHirschmann index of the market concentration of nursing homes, the percentage of nursing homes that
were hospital based and in a chain, and the percentage of residents requiring assistance with daily living
activities. The empirical findings from the multiple regression equations that include these variables
support the general conclusions of the paper as presented. Including these variables, however, conflicts
with our intention of estimating a reduced form model.
