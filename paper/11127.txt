Vehicle Currency Use in International Trade

ABSTRACT
Although currency invoicing in international trade transactions is central to the transmission of
monetary policy, the forces motivating the choice of currency have long been debated. We introduce
a model wherein agents involved in international trade can invoice in the exporter's currency, the
importer's currency, or a third-country vehicle currency. The model is designed to contrast the
contribution of macroeconomic variability with that of industry-specific features in the selection of
an invoice currency. We show that producers in industries with high demand elasticities are more
likely than producers in other industries to display herding in their choice of currency. This industryrelated force is more influential than local macroeconomic performance in determining producers'
choices. Drawing on data on invoice currency use in exports and imports for twenty-four countries,
we document that the dollar is the currency of choice for most transactions involving the United
States. The dollar is also extensively used as a vehicle currency in international trade flows that do
not directly involve the United States. Consistent with the results of our model, this last finding is
largely attributable to international trade in reference-priced and organized-exchange traded goods.
Although the magnitude of business-cycle volatility matters for invoicing of more differentiated
products, it is less central for invoicing nondifferentiated goods.

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

I. Introduction
In which currency should exporters set the price of their goods? When selling to a
foreign market, an exporting firm has three options. It can invoice the transaction in its
own currency (producer’s currency pricing, PCP), in the currency of the destination
country (local currency pricing, LCP), in a third currency (vehicle currency pricing,
VCP), or in a combination of these. Which of these three options is best for the firm is
not straightforward from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we contribute to this
issue both theoretically and empirically. We show the interaction between
macroeconomic variability and industry features in influencing invoice currency
selection. We argue that the preserve of Walrasian type goods, characterized by a high
price elasticity of demand, promotes herding in a single currency. In an industry where
goods are close substitutes, a firm has an incentive to limit the movement of its price
relative to that of its competitors, leading it to invoice in the same currency as they do.
This feature leads to a currency becoming the dominant medium of invoicing in the
market. Macroeconomic variability plays more of a role for differentiated products. We
demonstrate these points empirically, after presenting and analyzing rich new data on the
actual invoice currency choices on the exports and imports of twenty-four countries.
Our analysis builds on a rich history of thought on vehicle currency selection.
Swoboda (1968, 1969) stressed the role of transaction costs in trading different
currencies, and provided early arguments that currencies used as mediums of exchange
would be those associated with low transaction costs. Such low costs could for instance
reflect a high degree of liquidity in the foreign exchange markets for the currencies in
question. More recently, Rey (2001) elegantly exposited this theme in a three-country
general equilibrium model, confirming the importance of a currency’s “thick market
externalities” arising from a large presence in global international trade and low
transaction costs of exchange. McKinnon (1979) emphasized the role of industry
characteristics. He argued that industries where goods are homogeneous and traded in
specialized markets likely to be invoiced in a single low transaction cost currency.
Krugman (1980) pointed to the presence of inertia in vehicle currency selection. When a
currency is established as the dominant one in a market, a particular firm has no incentive
to invoice in an alternative currency as this would lead to higher transaction cost and

1

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

more volatile sales because of movements in its price relative to its competitors’. Once a
currency has acquired a prominent role, because of low transaction costs for instance, it
may keep this role even if another currency with similarly low costs emerges.
Macroeconomic variability has likewise been offered as a driver of vehicle
currency choice. Giovannini (1988) was perhaps the first researcher to formalize the role
such variability on both producer profit maximization and the selection of vehicle
currencies. Devereux, Engel and Storegaard (2004) have a similar emphasis, but instead
use a general equilibrium setup to introduce a role for monetary fluctuations in the
invoicing decision. 1 The elegantly show that in a two country world, a high volatility of
monetary stances in either country leads to a high volatility of the exchange rate, leading
producers to set their prices in the currency of the low volatility country.2 Engel (2003)
extent use a similar setup to highlight the parallels between the choice of invoicing when
prices are sticky and the optimal degree of exchange rate pass-through when prices are
fully flexible.
We present a theoretical model intended to nest some of these themes. Although
our analysis is partial equilibrium, we extend Devereux, Engel and Storegaard (2004) in
two key dimensions. First, we consider a model with three countries in order to establish
conditions for selection of non-counterparty vehicle currencies. Second, we provide an
explicit role for industry-specific characteristics in influencing the invoice currency
choice. This extension is essential for capturing some of the McKinnon-Krugman-Rey
insights. We show that, in any country, producers with differing degrees of product
homogeneity can make different invoicing choices for their international trade
transactions. Producers in a industry with homogenous goods aim at keeping their price
in line with their competitors’, leading them to invoice in the currency that has a
dominant role for the industry. By contrast, producers transacting in differentiated goods

Donnenfeld and Haug (2002, 2000) look at the role of exchange rate volatility in driving the invoicing
decision for Canadian trade transactions. They conclude that a higher volatility makes LCP more attractive,
or VCP provided that goods are not too substitutable. These conclusions are in contrast to the ones
discussed above, and may be driven by the particular nature of the (nonstandard) model used. In their
model output is preset first, set prices are set, and then sales take place. The more standard models have
prices set first and then output demand determined. See also Oi, Otani, and Shirota (2004) in which a
general equilibrium model of invoice currency choice is presented and applied to Japanese data. Hartmann
(1998) recently explores vehicle currency choice from a market microstructure perspective.

care less about limiting the movement of their price relative to their competitors, and
focus more on macroeconomic volatility.
This theory provides a nice background for our novel and extensive empirical
evidence on the currency invoicing of international trade for 24 countries. As broad
characterizations, we confirm that the U.S. dollar is the primary, but not unique, invoice
currency choice in transactions involving the United States as a counterparty. The euro
has replaced the legacy currencies in euro-area transactions and has displaced the dollar
mainly in some transactions of European Union accession countries (ECB 2003). The
dollar remains an important invoicing currency in transactions involving Asian countries,
Australia, and the United Kingdom, among others.
Our analysis of this data reveals other more nuanced patterns in the use of the
dollar as a vehicle currency in international transactions. Within the few countries for
which industry details on invoicing are available, we observe substantial cross-industry
variation in the extent to which the dollar is a vehicle currency on trade. For the larger
group of 24 countries, we explore whether a delineation of types of good traded by
degree of product substitutability explains aggregate invoicing currency choices on
exports and imports. Specifically, we establish this heterogeneity after applying the
Rauch (1999) network indices to the trade composition of each of the countries. These
indices enable us to determine the share of a country’s exports and imports in
homogeneous / high elasticity of substitution goods (i.e. reference-priced goods, goods
traded on organized exchanges) versus in differentiated products. While out theory argues
for the possibility of herding in any currency, the data show the dollar use as a vehicle
currency in country trade with non-U.S. counterparties is tightly correlated with the
prevalence in a country’s exports or imports of transactions in the (Walrasian) organized
exchange-traded and reference priced goods.3
These observations do not preclude a role for macroeconomic variation in invoice
currency selection. However, our econometric analysis shows that the industry
composition of a country’s exports is much more important for invoicing than the
3

As detailed in Rauch (1999), “Organized Exchange” traded goods cover products that have an overt
market (i.e. precious metals). “Reference Price” goods are homogeneous goods that nonetheless do not
have a substantial enough volume to have an "official" market (e.g. obscure chemical products), but are
homogeneous enough to have "reference" prices that are published in trade magazines.

countries participating in the trade transactions. Our results do not support a strong role
for standard business-cycle magnitude variation in vehicle currency selection. The
industry effects are most pronounced in trade in more homogeneous products. Small
degrees of macroeconomic volatility are not likely to disturb currency invoicing
equilibria or the strong role of the dollar in the export and import transactions involving
more homogeneous goods.
Overall, we show theoretically and empirically the herding in invoice currency
choice for Walrasian goods. An implication is that, absent large macroeconomic shocks
that could potentially disturb this established vehicle currency equilibrium, the
prevalence of the dollar as a worldwide vehicle currency may be tied to the share of
“homogeneous” goods in world trade and to the share of the U.S. as a direct counterparty
in international trade transactions. While Rauch (1999) had argued that trade barriers play
distinct roles in the context of differentiated products versus homogeneous products, we
likewise find that macroeconomic variables have distinct roles in the determination of
currency invoicing choices across these types of goods.
II. A Three-Country / Three Currency Model of Invoice Currencies
Several recent studies explore conditions under which a firm will set its export
price in its own country’s currency, in which case the price paid by foreign consumers
moves with the exchange rate, or in the currency of its customers abroad, in which case
the firm bears the exchange rate risk.4 The existing theoretical work limits an exporter to
two currencies in her decision, invoicing either in her own currency (PCP) or the
currency of her customers (LCP). While these models are conceptually rich, they ignore
the possibility that the exporter could choose to invoice in a third vehicle currency
(VCP), that is neither her currency nor that of her customer.
We broaden the theoretical modeling of currency choice for trade invoicing,
developing the interaction between industry features and macroeconomic variability in a
new open-economy macro model with price rigidities that builds on Devereux, Engel and
Storegaard (2004). Although we do not derive a full-blown general equilibrium version

4

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

of our model, we nonetheless extend the existing theory in several key dimensions. First,
we move from a two-country / two-currency world to a world consisting of three
countries and three currencies, thereby allowing for invoicing in a vehicle currency that
belongs neither to the exporter or importer home markets. The use of a specific currency
in invoicing international trade transactions can now be broader than the importance of
that currency’s home country as a direct counterparty in international trade transactions.
Second, we contrast the role of industry characteristics, such as the substitutability
between competitors'goods, with macro-economic factors, such as business cycle and
exchange rate volatility. We show that industry characteristics are more relevant for
industries where goods are closer substitutes. Consider the situation of a firm selling to a
foreign market. With prices in the market set in different currencies, exchange rate
fluctuations will affect the price of the firm’s goods relative to that of its competitors,
leading to fluctuations in the quantities sold. If there is little differentiation between the
goods produced by different firms, even small movements in relative prices generate
large movements in each firm’s quantity sold. The firm then has an incentive to limit the
fluctuations of its relative price by choosing a trade invoicing strategy close to that of its
competitors. This leads to a type of ‘herding’ behavior in invoice currency choice as the
exporter of a relatively homogeneous product chooses to invoice in the currency that is
used by the majority of other sellers.
Third, we introduce decreasing returns to scale in production. A specification with
constant returns to scale limits the results of the model, a point recognized by Devereux,
Engel and Storegaard (2004), since a firm’s marginal cost is not affected by fluctuations
in its output. Output volatility, stemming from volatile prices relative to the firm’s
competitors for instance, then has no direct cost implication. Devereux, Engel and
Storegaard (2004) maintain the assumption of a constant returns to scale technology, but
address this limitation by introducing a link through which output volatility leads to
volatility in wages. While generating a channel through which output volatility affects
marginal costs, their apparatus requires wages to respond to short run movements in
demand, a feature that is disputable. We choose instead to model a technology with

Engel and Storegaard (2004).
5

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

decreasing returns to scale, so that an increase in output leads to an increase in the
marginal cost even when wages are not responsive.
Overall, the theory provided below emphasizes the roles of product
substitutability and macroeconomic variability in a single theoretical framework.
Although we limit ourselves to a partial equilibrium model, this provides us with more
flexibility when we turn to the empirical section.5 While we can get macroeconomic
variability to play the type of role laid out in recent theoretical studies, our extensions
imply that macroeconomic variability is an important consideration only when the trade
transactions are in differentiated products, where the need to limit movements in relative
prices is less pronounced. The degree of macroeconomic volatility needed to disturb an
invoicing status quo for trade in more homogeneous products would need to be
exceptionnaly large. This result supports the inertia and thick market externalities argued
by Krugman and by Rey. But, importantly, our theoretical prediction is that -- even
within a country where all economic agents face the same degree of macroeconomic
volatility-- different producers will make different invoice currency choices.
II.1 The profit function
We assume that an exporting firm has to post a price for its goods before knowing
the realization of various shocks affecting the economy. The exporter produces a brand z,
is located in country e, and sells her goods to the destination country d. The exporter
produces goods using a technology with decreasing returns to scale:
Yed ( z ) =
0<

where Yed ( z ) is the output of z, H ed ( z ) is the labor input, and α is the returns to scale
parameter. The firm faces the following demand in country d:

By contrast Devereux, Engel and Storegaard (2004) derive the optimal invoicing in a general equilibrium
model. While this allows for a complete solution, their analysis is focused on the role of macroeconomic
volatility, and does not include any role for inertia stemming from the dominant role of a currency in the
past.
6

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

where C d is the total demand for brands of the relevant sector in country d, Ped ( z ) is the
price, in country d currency, of the brand z produced in country e, and Pd is the price
index, in country d currency, across all brands of the relevant sector sold in country d.

λ>1 is the elasticity of substitution between the various brands. (2) shows that the
demand for a specific brand reflects its price, relative to the prices of other brands in the
sector, and the strength of overall demand.
The exporter producing brand z sets its price in currency k before the realization
of the shocks affecting the economy. We denote the price by Pedk ( z ) . The currency of
invoicing can be the currency of the country in which the exporter is located (k=e), the
currency of the country of destination (k=d), a third vehicle currency (k=v), or a
combination of these three currencies. While considering invoicing in a basket of
different currencies may appear odd, it provides a simple way to generate a partial passthrough of exchange rate fluctuations to consumer prices, following Corsetti and Pesenti
(2001). The presence of partial exchange rate pass-through is a desirable feature in light
of the empirical evidence [Campa and Goldberg (2004, 2002), Frankel, Parsley and Wei
(2004), Anderton (2003)].
The exporter sets its price in currency k to maximize expected profits:

where S ek is the exchange rate between currency e and currency k, in terms of units of

currency e. De is the state-specific discount factor at which profits are evaluated,6 and
We is the nominal wage. With its price set in currency k, the unit revenue for the exporter

6

We consider that the firm is owned by agents in the exporting country, so profits are discounted using the
marginal utility of income for these agents. This is done without loss of generality: while a resident of
another country would value profits after converting them in her own currency, this has no impact on the
optimal invoicing decision that is the focus of the paper. All we require is that the owner treats her marginal
utility of income as independent from the profits of a particular firm, in a similar way as she treats the
consumer price index as independent from the price set by a particular firm.

in currency e is S ek Pedk ( z ) . Similarly, the price in currency d paid by consumers in the
destination country is [S ed ] S ek Pedk ( z ) .

Following steps detailed in the Appendix, we solve the producer problem by
expressing the profit function (3) in terms of quadratic approximations around a nonstochastic steady state. Denoting log deviations from the steady state by lower case letters
( x = ln X − ln X ss ) we obtain:

q edk = s ek − s ed − p d

(5)

where we ignore terms that are independent of the invoicing decision.
The term q edk in (5) is the price of brand z in the destination country, relative to
the price of the competing brands in that country. Following shocks, the price of brand z
set in currency k does not move. The price paid by a consumer in the destination currency

d is then driven by the exchange rate between currency k and currency d: s dk = s ek − s ed ,
with an appreciation of currency d vis-à-vis currency k (i.e. s ek − s ed < 0 ) reducing the
price paid by the consumer. The average price paid by the consumer for competing
brands, in currency d, is given by the industry-wide index: p d . An increase in the relative
price ( q edk > 0 ) indicates that the firms producing brand z looses competitiveness, leading
consumers in the destination country to shift their purchases towards other brands. The
magnitude of this shift is driven by the elasticity of substitution between brands, λ.
Intuitively, the various terms of (4) reflect the co-movements of the marginal
revenue and marginal cost with demand.7 The impact of exchange rate movements on the
marginal revenue is given by the term s ek − λq edk , which reflects the fluctuations in the
quantity sold because of movements in competitiveness, as well as the fluctuations in the
exporter-currency revenue of a given sale, stemming from movements in the exchange
rate between the exporter and invoicing currencies. (4) shows that profitability is
increased when exchange rate fluctuations lead to a high marginal revenue in the states of

8

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

nature when demand is strong in the destination country (i.e. E [s ek − λq edk ] c d > 0 ).
Marginal costs are increasing in the wage and the strength of demand, the later aspect
reflecting decreasing returns to scale. Profitability is higher when the exporter looses
competitiveness in the states of nature where wages or demand are high
( Eq edk we > 0, or Eq edk c d > 0 ). Intuitively, the reduced competitiveness shifts demand away
from the exporter, sparing her from having to produce at a high cost.
II.2 Optimal invoicing

The exporter chooses the currency k in which her goods are invoiced to maximize
(4). Specifically, her choice is captured by the exchange rate between the currency of her
country and the currency of invoicing, s ek , in the profits (4) and the relative price (5). The
exporter regards all the other variables in (4)-(5), such as the demand c d , wage we , and
aggregate price p d and exchange rate s ed as independent from her invoicing decision.
We do not restrict the exporter to invoice entirely in either currency e, d or v.
Instead, we model the invoicing decision as a choice of weights of the three available
currencies in the invoicing currency basket k. Specifically, the weights of currencies d
and v in the invoicing of exports to country d are β dd and β dv respectively, with the
s
weight of currency e being 1 − β dd − β dv . The exchange rate between the exporter'
currency, e, and the composite currency in which she invoices, k, is then a linear
combination of the exchange rates between currency e and the other two currencies, d
and v, with weights reflecting the composition of the invoicing basket:
s ek = β dd s ed + β dv s ev

(6)

Pricing in the producer'
s currency (PCP) corresponds to β dd = β dv = 0 , while pricing in
the customers'currency (LCP) corresponds to β dd = 1, β dv = 0 , and pricing in vehicle
currency (VCP) is the case where β dd = 0, β dv = 1 .
As discussed above, the relative price between brand z and the competing brands
(5) plays a key role in the invoicing decisions. We now turn to the sensitivity of the price

7

A more detailed discussion can be found in the Appendix.
9

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

index of competing brands, p d , to exchange rate movements. Some brands are invoiced
in currency d, so the price paid by the consumers for these brands is unaffected by
exchange rate movements. Other brands are invoiced in currency e, and the consumer
price in currency d moves with the exchange rate between the two currencies, s ed , with
consumer paying a higher price when currency e appreciates (i.e s ed < 0 ). A final set of
brands are invoiced in currency v, so the price paid by consumers is higher when
currency v appreciates (i.e. s ed − s ev < 0 ). We denote the share of competing brands
invoiced in currency d by η dd , and the shares invoiced in currency e and v by η de and η dv
respectively.8 The impact of exchange rate movements on price index of competing
brands is then:

(

)

p d = −η de s ed − η dv (s ed − s ev ) = − 1 − η dd s ed + η dv s ev

(7)

Combining (6) and (7), we write the relative price (5) as:

(

)

(

)

q edk = β dd − η dd s ed + β dv − η dv s ev

(8)

(8) shows that a full stabilization of the relative price requires the exporter to choose
weights on the different currencies that exactly correspond to their shares in the industry
wide price index: β dd = η dd , β dv = η dv .
The firm chooses the invoicing weights β dd and β dv to maximize the expected
profits (4), under the constraint that β dd , β dv and β dd + β dv do not fall outside the [0,1]
interval. For a concise illustration of the determinants of the optimal weights, we focus on
an interior solution where both weights are given by setting the first derivatives of (4) to
zero. Following steps detailed in the Appendix we obtain:
β dd = Ωη dd + (1 − Ω )ρ (med s ed )

The three shares sum to one.
10

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

The term med in (9)-(11) reflects the influence of exogenous factors on the firm’s
marginal cost. Movements in wages translate directly into movements in the marginal
cost. Fluctuations in demand also affect the cost. Because of decreasing returns to scale, a
1 percent increase in demand requires a 1 / α percent increase in the labor input, hence a
1 / α percent increase in cost, holding the wage constant. The increase in demand also

leads to a 1 percent increase in revenue, holding the price constant. The net increase in
the marginal cost is then 1 − 1 / α = (1 − α ) / 1 percent.
The terms ρ (med s ed ) and ρ (med s ev ) in (9)-(11) capture the sensitivity of the
marginal cost, med , to the exchange rates s ed and s ev . Specifically, the coefficients of a
regression of the marginal cost on the exchange rate are ρ (med s ed ) for s ed , and
ρ (med s ev ) for s ev .

The intuitive interpretation of the optimal invoicing (9)-(11) is that an exporter
invoices in a currency other than her own for two reasons: herding and hedging.
Invoicing in the exporter’s currency has the advantage of fully stabilizing the exporter’s
marginal revenue, as she receives a given amount of her own currency for each unit sold.
This full stabilization ( β de = 1 ) is not necessarily an optimal choice however, for two
reasons.
The first reason for deviating from a full invoicing in the exporter’s currency
reflects a herding motive, captured by the terms Ωη dd and Ωη dv in (9)-(10). The exporter
optimally limits the movements of her relative price by choosing an invoicing strategy
close to that of its competitors. For instance, the exporter puts a higher weight of
invoicing in the destination currency, β dd , when her competitors invoice a higher share of
their own sales in that currency, η dd . A similar motivation holds for invoicing in the
vehicle currency.
The second reason captures a hedging motive, denoted by the terms

(1 − Ω )ρ (med

s ed ) and (1 − Ω )ρ (m ed s ev ) in (9)-(10). The exporter wants to choose an

invoicing strategy that limits the impact of fluctuations in marginal costs on her profits. If
she invoices in the destination currency, d, a depreciation of her currency vis-à-vis the
destination currency ( s ed > 0 ) increases the exporter’s revenue, in her own currency, from

11

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

each unit sold. If depreciations of the exchange rate tend to be associated with increases
in marginal costs, i.e. ρ (med s ed ) > 0 , invoicing in the destination currency provides an
hedge as marginal revenue and marginal costs then move in steps. A similar logic applies
to the vehicle currency.
Equations (9)-(10) show that the extent of invoicing in the destination and vehicle
currencies reflects the herding and hedging considerations. Interestingly, there is nothing
‘special’ about invoicing in the currency of the destination country, as it is driven by the
same considerations as invoicing in any vehicle currency.
The relative weight on the herding dimension in (9)-(11) is given by the term Ω ,
which solely reflects the structural parameters of the model, namely the elasticity of
substitution between goods, λ, and the degree of returns to scale, α. The herding
dimension is more pronounced ( Ω is large) in industries where goods are more
substitutable (λ is large), as movements in relative prices then leads to large fluctuations
in quantities sold. The effect is also stronger the more the technology exhibits decreasing
returns to scale (α is small), because fluctuations in output generate large movements in
marginal cost.
Our model indicates that the herding motive can dominate invoicing under
reasonable parameters. Chart 1 shows the combinations of α (horizontal axis) and λ
(vertical axis) leading to a small weight of the herding motives ( Ω =0.2), a medium
weight ( Ω =0.5) and a large weight ( Ω =0.8). Considering values of α=0.65 and λ=6,
which are reasonable parameters,9 leads to to a weight on the herding motive of 0.76. In
the limit case of perfect competition ( λ → ∞ ), only the herding motive remains as the
firm needs to fully stabilize its relative price:
lim Ω = 1

λ →∞

lim β dd = η dd

λ →∞

lim β dv = η dv

λ →∞

lim β de = η de

λ →∞

This feature of the solution suggests important distinctions in invoicing choices
across types of industries. The invoicing of exports in industries that are highly
differentiated is relatively more responsive to the pattern of volatility in macro-economic
9

In a model with a constant returns to scale technology in labor and a fixed factor, such as capital, a labor
share of 65 % is a standard specification. A value of 6 for the elasticity of substitution corresponds to a
20% markup. Elasticities of this magnitude, or even higher, are a common parametrization.
12

variables, such as wages and demands. By contrast, in industries that produce a more
homogenous good, firms will invoice in a basket of currencies close to that of their
competitors.

Another aspect also points to a moderate role for co-movements of the exchange
rates with marginal cost, relative to herding. The terms ρ (med s ed ) and ρ (m ed s ev ) in (9)(11) are essentially ratios between the covariance of the exchange rates with wages and
demand, and the variance of the exchange rates. If the magnitude of exchange rate
fluctuations is much larger than the magnitude of their co-movements with other
variables, the denominators in the terms ρ (med s ed ) and ρ (m ed s ev ) are relatively large,
hence the terms themselves relatively small. If exchange rates are considerably more
volatile than demand and wage fundamentals, herding in invoicing currency selection
will dominate the role of these fundamentals.
As stressed by Engel (2003), the factors driving the choice of invoicing currency
when prices are sticky are the same driving the optimal degree of exchange rate passthrough under flexible prices. While he focuses on limit cases of invoicing, with prices
set either in the producer or consumer currencies, we can show that the optimal invoicing
weights (9)-(10) are equal to the optimal degrees of pass-through under flexible prices.

II.3 A simplified model

The optimal invoicing in (9)-(11) shows that there is no simple relation between
the volatility of a particular exchange rate and the choice of invoicing. Instead, the comovements between exchange rates and marginal costs play a central role. To put more
structure in the setup, we model the exchange rate between currency e and currency d as
driven by fundamental factors (such as monetary policy) in country e and in country d.
We denote these factors by f e and f d respectively. Recognizing the sometimes difficult
reconciliation between fluctuations in fundamentals and those in exchange rates, we
model the exchange rate as also driven by two noise terms, denoted by

e

and

d

respectively.10 The exchange rate between currency e and currency v is similar, and we
write:
s ed = f e − f d +

e

−

d

s ev = f e − f v +

,

−

,

s dv = f d − f v +

We assume that the wage is driven by the fundamental in the exporting country, while
demand in the destination market follows the fundamental in the importing country:11
we = γ w f e

,

cd = γ c f d

,

γw ≥0 , γc ≥0

where γw and γc reflect the sensitivity of wages and demands to the relevant
fundamentals. The presence of noise in the exchange rate relations allows for exchange
rates to react to variables which have no effects on contemporaneous wages and demand.
Following steps detailed in the Appendix, we assess how changes in the volatility of the
various fundamentals impact the invoicing. The results are summarized in Table 1, where
σ 2 ( x ) = E ( x )2 :

10

Frankel and Rose (1995) show that volatility of industrialized countries’ exchange rates is an order of
magnitude higher than volatility in fundamentals. Engel and West (2004) provide an interesting fresh
perspective on this issue by treating exchange rates as reflective of a discounted stream of expected future
fundamentals.
11
These assumptions are consistent with the effects of monetary shocks in a general equilibrium model.

Table 1 shows that an increase in the volatility of fundamentals in one country leads
exporters to reduce the weight of its currency in their invoicing decision, and increase the
role of the other two currencies. The detailed expressions in the Appendix also show that
the shift is more pronounced towards the least volatile currency. For example, if
e
v
σ 2 ( f d ) > σ 2 ( f v ) , an increase in σ 2 ( f e ) reduces β d , and increases β d by more than it

increases β dd .
While the sensitivity of the optimal invoicing to the volatility of fundamentals is
unambiguous and intuitive, as shown by table 1, the sensitivity to the volatility of the
noise terms is more complex. The Appendix shows that in general the effect is
ambiguous. The only clear pattern is that a higher volatility of the noise term in the
vehicle country, σ 2 (ε v ) , has the same impact than a higher volatility of the fundamentals,
σ 2 ( fv ).

This model sets the stage for empirical analysis of the determinants of invoice
currency choice across producers and across countries. We begin by expositing facts on
the currency invoicing of international trade. We then examine industry-specific choices
and the role of macroeconomic variability in invoicing outcomes.
III. The use of dollars and other currencies in international trade
III.1 Overview.

Details on the currency invoicing of international trade transactions are hard to
come by. Some recent but discrete facts are given in papers motivated by individual
countries or regions, as in Swedish invoicing by Friberg (1996), Canadian invoicing by
15

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

Donnenfeld and Haug (2003), and Japan by Oi, Otani, and Shirota (2004). Evidence has
become available for euro-area and accession countries, in part triggered by the advent of
the euro and efforts to track its adoption in goods markets and financial markets (ECB
2002, 2003).12 No single data source compiles the information from these studies, or
from the various discrete sources of information on country invoicing of international
trade transactions. This section of the paper provides cross country, cross industry and
some intertemporal data.
The twenty-four countries for which we have collected invoicing information are:
the United States, the United Kingdom, eight euro-area countries (France, Germany,
Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, and Portugal), nine European Union accession
countries (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland,
Slovakia, and Slovenia), plus Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Australia. The data
availability and sources for our study are summarized in Appendix Table 1.13
The availability information varies tremendously across countries in terms of
details and time histories. Recently, ECB efforts have made available rich cross-country
data within Europe. The United Kingdom and Australia have very detailed information
on currency invoicing of trade transactions of different commodities or with different
country partners. Within Asia, detailed data is available for both Japan and Korea. Data
for the United States is drawn from Customs information used in constructing
international price series.14
Chart 2 shows the extent to which each country’s aggregated exports are invoiced
in the exporter’s currency, corresponding to the notation β de aggregated across exporters
from the model. The smaller countries represented in this chart typically use their own
12

Between 1999 through 2001Q3, the European Commission (Quarterly Review of the Use of the Euro)
published quarterly information on the international transactions of euro area firms. This publication
focused on the transition period of the euro, and measured the use of the euro compared with both national
currencies (DM, Ffr, etc) and the foreign currencies.
13
As Appendix Table 1 details, some of these data are unpublished but made available to us for this work.
We are grateful to the agencies that provided this information and approved our use and dissemination. The
table also shows that different methods have been used by countries in constructing the data. Looking
across countries, in some cases we cannot definitely state whether the data capture the currency of
transaction invoicing or currency of transaction settlement.
14
For the United States, the BEA the International Price Program collects data on currency solely to
convert prices into U.S. Dollars for the purpose of producing price indexes. The U.S. Customs Service
collects the data on the value of imports and exports, but doesn’t keep data on the currency in which trade

16

currency on less than 20 percent of their export transactions. Indeed, a number of small
countries not shown in the chart (but indicated in the footnote) do not even report details
of use of their own currency in international trade transactions. The euro is used as the
invoice currency on 40 to 50 percent of (extra euro area) exports by euro area countries.
The Korean won is seldom used, the yen is used on about a third of Japanese exports, and
the pound sterling on about half of UK exports. The United States is the clear exception,
invoicing more than 90 percent of exports in U.S. dollars. Broadly similar patterns in
country imports, except that the importing country currency is typically less often used in
the import transactions, supporting Grassman’s Law.

Countries for which we do not have specific data
for this chart are: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia.

Industry details on currency invoicing are directly available for four of the
countries in our database: Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
For each country, the industries for which invoicing data are available are compiled into
one of three broad groups: differentiated products, goods traded on “organized
exchanges”, and “reference priced” goods. The assignment of industries to group follows
the Rauch (1999) painstaking classification of commodities at the three and four-digit
is conducted. A second caveat is that the data they collect is a sample of overall trade rather than every
transaction.
17

SITC level. In the Rauch indices, an “organized exchange” good is anything that has an
overt market (i.e. precious metals). A “referenced priced” good is a homogeneous good
that nonetheless does not have a substantial enough volume to have an "official" market
(e.g. obscure chemical products), but that because of its homogeneity does have
"reference" prices that are published in trade magazines. These three broad categories
roughly correspond to classes of competitive pricing of goods, with organized exchange
traded goods those that are most highly substitutable with similar categories of foreign
produced goods, and the differentiated products least substitutable.
Chart 3 provides suggestive evidence that the extent of invoicing in the exporter’s
currency is related to the amount of transactions on reference priced or organized
exchange goods. It indicates the share of exports invoiced in the exporter’s currency for
exports of differentiated goods (column ‘n’), reference-priced goods (column ‘r’) and
goods traded on an organized exchange (column ‘w’) for Australia, Japan and the United
Kingdom. It shows that the extent of pricing in the exporter’s currency is higher for
differentiated products, the pattern being most pronounced for Australia. With the
exception of the United States, we observe that the exporter’s currency is more frequently
used on transactions in differentiated goods than in transactions on reference priced or
organized exchange goods.

III.2. Explaining the U.S. Dollar as a Vehicle Currency

Table 2 reports the use of the U.S. dollar in the invoicing of exports and imports
in our sample. More than 95 percent of U.S. exports and 85 percent of U.S. imports were
invoiced in dollars in early 2003. The use of the dollar in U.S. export and import
transactions depends on the trading partner.15 U.S. exports to and imports from Latin
America, China, Mexico, and most small countries, are almost exclusively invoiced in
U.S. dollars. By contrast, foreign currencies appear more prominently in the invoicing of
U.S. imports from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan. While the
specific shares assigned to foreign currencies is not always consistent across reporting
partner countries, from the perspective of U.S. data about 25 percent of U.S. imports
from Germany (in value terms) are euro invoiced; 14 percent of U.S. imports from the
UK are invoiced in pound sterling, while 12 percent of U.S. imports from Japan are in
Japanese yen. U.S. imports from the rest of the world are overwhelmingly invoiced in
U.S. dollars.
Turning to other countries, approximately one third of the exports of most euro
area countries (to countries outside of the euro area) are invoiced in dollars. Close to 40
percent of comparable euro area imports are invoiced in dollars. Looking across
countries, the U.S. dollar is used intensively in U.K. trade transactions, on 26 percent of
U.K. total exports and 37 percent of U.K. imports. The EU accession countries are mixed
in the extent to which dollars are used in invoicing their international trade transactions.
Currently, dollar use on invoicing is often lower than incidence of use by euro-area
countries. As we will detail later, these patterns are starkly different than in the recent
past for these accession countries.

15

The extent to which the dollar is used in bilateral trade transactions is often not identical across the two
parties reporting currency use in trade transactions. Given the sampling limitations in the U.S.-sourced
data, we defer to foreign source data for currency shares when that foreign data is available.

By contrast, the dollar remains a dominant currency in the invoicing of both
exports and imports by countries outside of Europe. Both Korea and Thailand use the
dollar in invoicing more than 80 percent of their export and import transactions. For
Japan, Australia, and Malaysia, the dollar is used in more than 50 percent of trade
transactions.

US Dollar Invoicing Share in Country Exports, %
Source: DOTS and various national sources
Euro-area country data, with the exception of Italy data, refer to extra-euro area trade and invoicing

To gain perspective on what portion of these dollar invoicing results might be
directly attributable to country transactions with the United States and what portion is a
pure vehicle currency role, in Chart 4 we contrast the dollar invoicing share in export
transactions of each country (horizontal axis) with the share of the United States as a
direct recipient of a country’s exports (vertical axis).16 Under an extreme assumption of
complete dollar invoicing of trade with the United States and no vehicle currency role for
the dollar, the indicated points would lie along the diagonal of this chart. All data points
are to the right of the 45 degree line, presenting strong (and understated) indicative
evidence of dollar use as a vehicle currency. This vehicle currency role appears
particularly strong for trade transactions by Korea, Thailand, Australia, the United
Kingdom, and Greece, among others. Overall the prevalence of dollar invoicing of a
country’s export and import bundles is far greater than what would be expected purely on
the basis of the direct importance of the U.S. as a direct trade counterparty for any of
these countries.
16

We have done a similar analysis for country imports from the United States, with broadly similar
findings.
21

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

Another very compelling empirical finding arises from our application of the
Rauch indices to export data in order to explain the portion of each country’s exports that
is invoiced in dollars, without the United States as a counterparty, and in organized
exchange traded or reference priced goods. 17 For each country, we construct measures of
the share of total exports of that country (in trade that excludes the United States) that are
in organized exchange traded products, or referenced priced products. The share of these
transactions in country export transactions are shown in Table 3. Among the countries in
our table, Australia has the highest share of exchange traded and reference priced goods
in its exports, weighing at 66 percent of the exports to countries other than the United
States. Greece, Bulgaria, and Cyprus all have this type of export share at about 40
percent. Japan and Germany have low shares of these types of goods, on the order of 15
percent of their non-U.S. exports.
Visually, Chart 5 builds on Chart 4. The horizontal axis shows the share of
exports invoiced in dollars, while the vertical axis shows the total share of exports that
are either going to the United States, or consist of reference priced goods going to
destinations other that the U.S. While the role of the dollar exceeds the role of the U.S. as
a destination market, as shown in Chart 4, the pattern shown in chart 5 aligns more
closely with the 45 degree line. Specifically, the role of the dollar in invoicing is in line
with the role of the U.S. as a market and the role of exports of reference priced goods to
countries other than the United States. Consistent with the detailed data available from
Australia, the United Kingdom, and Japan, across countries these commodity-type
transactions appear to “explain” the widespread vehicle currency use of the dollar in most
of the countries (outside of the U.S.) for which we have compiled trade invoicing data.
While Chart 5 brings us closer to a complete understanding of the role of the
dollar in international trade, two country groups stand out. First, the role of the dollar for
Eastern European countries is smaller than what their patter of exports suggests. This
likely reflects the prominent role of the euro area as a destination market. An exporter
from Eastern Europe selling a non-differentiated goods, such as chemicals, in the euro
area puts a high weight on keeping his price in line with that of his competitors. If a
substantial share of the competitors price in euro, because for instance they are firms
17

We do an analogous exercise also on the import side for each country, with qualitatively similar findings.
22

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

located in the euro area, then the exporter will also invoice in euro. The second outlier
group is made of countries in South-East Asia for which the exports to the U.S. and in
reference-priced goods still fall short of accounting for the role of the dollar as an
invoicing currency. This possibly reflects a downward bias in the measured role of the
U.S. as a trading partner, because of trade flows to the U.S. that go through other
countries. Consider the case of a Thai exporter selling components to a producer in
Malaysia for assembly for final goods destined to the U.S. While the trade flow from
Thailand is not going directly to the U.S., it is part of an export from the region to the
U.S.

Econometrics of Herding versus Macroeconomic Variability

Our model emphasizes that β de , β dd , and β dv are endogenous to both industry
structure and macro-economic volatility. The herding motive in invoicing is a more
important consideration for walrasian goods. The macroeconomic volatility underlying
the hedging motive matters more for trade in differentiated products, with the likelihood
of a country’s currency being chosen for invoicing international trade transactions

24

VEHICLE CURRENCY USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

inversely related to the volatility of the country’s fundamentals. In this section, we
provide an econometric analogue of the previous sections graphics. We also relate the
invoicing unexplained by trade with the U.S. or walrasian exports to the volatility of
aggregate demand in the exporting country versus, for example, the United States
market.18
The regressions take a panel format using all countries for which we have
invoicing data, except the United States. Two dependent variables are used in the
regressions, 1) the share of a country’s exports that are invoiced in dollars, or 2) the share
of a country’s exports that are invoiced in the home country currency.19 The explanatory
variables are the share of the U.S. as a destination market for exports, the share of a
country’s exports (excluding those to the U.S.) that are in Rauch-type walrasian goods
(exchange traded plus organized exchange traded), and home country aggregate demand
volatility. The regressions for invoicing in home currencies also add a variable to reflect
the share of a country’s trade with the euro area. The results of these regressions are
presented below in Table 4. In some specifications, we test whether euro-area countries
have different invoicing sensitivities than countries that have not yet adopted the euro.

18

We have derived an explicit mapping from the theoretical specification to a regression specification
under the assumption that there are two types of goods in the world, walrasian versus differentiated. This
explicit formulation also assumed that, for a particular industry, the average share of invoicing in the
exporter’s currency is a weighted average across the choices with respect to each trade partner destination,
with the weights corresponding to the importance of each partner as an export market. We have
experimented with specifications of trade-partner weighted volatilities as explanatory variables, but have
not gotten additional insights from those specifications.
19
A few countries do not report shares of exports that are invoiced in their home currency (Bulgaria,
Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, see Appendix Table 1 for more details). These
countires are not included in the regression for the home currency invoicing share of exports, but are
included in the regression for the dollar invoicing share.

The regression results support the arguments of our theoretical section, and
reconfirm the empirical observations from Charts 4 and 5. The results for the dollar use in
invoicing as reported in the top panel of Table 4 are most interesting. Regression 1
includes only the share of the U.S. in total exports, allowing for a different effect for
euro-area exporters. This factor alone explains one third of the cross country variation in
dollar use, with a higher dollar use in invoicing by countries that are not in the euro-area.
Regression 2 introduces also consider the role of exports of walrasian goods to countries
other than the U.S. These walrasian good terms explain an additional 25 percent of the
cross-country variation in dollar use in trade invoicing. Once we account for the trade
role of the United States and the composition of trade, we have a good indication of the
extent to which a country will be using dollars to invoice exports.
The results of regressions 3 and 4 show that the volatility of aggregate demand in
the exporting country is not a statistically significant contributor. It is important to note
that this finding is not necessarily a refutation of the potential role for macroeconomic
volatility terms in the invoicing decisions of producers. As the U.S. aggregate demand
volatility is low relative to the volatility observed in most countries in our sample, a
choice of invoicing in dollar based on volatility considerations would to a large extent be
captured by the constant term. Nevertheless, the constant is not statistically significant,
and the absence of a role for volatility persists even when we distinguish between
countries in the euro-area, with a similar volatility than the U.S., and others. This points
to a limited role of volatility as a driver of invoicing.
The regression for the use of the home currency is presented in the bottom panel
of Table 4.20 The only statistically significant results are that the countries in the euroarea are more likely to invoice their exports in the euro. Also, higher domestic volatility
reduces the use of the home currency.

The results exclude the countries that do not report shares of exports invoiced in their home currency
(Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia).

III.4

Perspectives for the international role of the dollar.

Our analysis suggests that the perspectives for the future role of the dollar as an
invoicing currency are driven both by the role of the U.S. in international trade, and by
the importance of world trade in goods that transact via organized exchanges or via
reference pricing. Based on annual data 1980 through 2002, the U.S. share in total world
imports fluctuates between approximately 15 and 20 percent, in relation to the U.S.
business cycle. Also centrally important is the composition of world trade, and
particularly the share of goods are in industries with high degrees of product
substitutability. As one rough measure of this, Chart 6 shows the share of world trade in
goods traded on organized exchanges or goods that are reference priced (which we
construct using the Rauch measures). This type of trade has been declining steadily as a
share of world trade over recent decades, consistent with the rapid growth of trade in
manufactured goods both as intermediate components and as final products. These stark
declines point to a steady decline in dollar invoicing of trade via this channel.

IV. Concluding Remarks

Our analysis shows that the dollar is strongly used on all trade transactions with
the United States, and on other transactions that are primarily in goods that are traded on
organized exchanges or that are reference priced. We have shown that this use of the
dollar does not primarily depend on the exchange rate between the dollar and other
partner currencies. Instead, the role of the dollar as a transaction currency in international
trade has elements of industry herding and hysteresis, often with a less central role in
invoicing for hedging as associated with variances and covariances among
macroeconomic fundamentals.
Our theoretical and empirical results support the type of conclusion reached in a
recent European Central Bank report
“While the existence of international pricing standards does not preclude, by
itself, the use of another currency for settlement, the euro area’s trade in energy and raw
materials will probably continue to be both invoiced and settled in U.S. dollars, as long as
international prices continue to be expressed in that currency.”
ECB 2002 pp.41-42.
We argue that industries with highly substitutable goods have a strong incentive
to herd in their choice of invoicing currency. This type of conclusion is consistent with
the intuitions of McKinnon (1979), Krugman (1980) and Rey (2001). The U.S. dollar
appears to be important in the invoicing of world trade both because the U.S. is an
important consumer and producer in world markets, and because of its use in invoicing
the many products that are traded via organized exchanges or using reference pricing.

where we dropped the z index on Pedk ( z ) as all firms face the same problem and hence
choose the same price.
We express the profits functions (3) in terms of a quadratic expansion around a

exchange rate movements, including through movements in competitiveness. Exchange
rate movements affect the relative price of brand z vis-à-vis the competing brands, q edk ,
leading consumers to shift the allocation of their purchases across brands. In addition,
with the price fixed in currency k, a depreciation of currency e (i.e. s ek > 0 ) increases the
amount of currency e received by the exporter for each unit sold abroad. Expected
revenue for the exporter is higher when exchange rate fluctuations lead to a high marginal

revenue in the states of nature when demand is strong (i.e. E [s ek − λq edk ] c d > 0 ).

considerations,

The expected cost is reduced when the firm in country e is not

competitive (i.e. its relative price Qedk is high) precisely in the states where wages are
high ( Eq edk we > 0 ), as the reduced competitiveness spares the firm from having to produce
a lot at a high cost. The expected cost is also lower when the firm is not competitive in
the states where demand is high ( Eq edk c d > 0 ).Because of the decreasing returns to scale,
fluctuations in output are costly. When Eq edk c d > 0 , a strong demand is offset by a low
competitiveness, a pattern that stabilizes the exporters'marginal cost.

Setting the first derivatives to zero and solving the resulting system of two

A.3.1 Driving factors
We consider that each country experiences shocks in a fundamental variable f,
such as the monetary stance. Wages in the exporter’s country and demand in the
destination market are driven solely by the fundamental in the exporting and destination
country, respectively. The exchange rate between two countries follows the difference
between the fundamentals. We also let the exchange rate be driven by a noise variable, ε,
in order to capture the fact that exchange rates are more volatile than wages and demand.
The wage in the exporting country, the demand in the destination country, and the
exchange rates are given by:
we = γ w f e , c d = γ c f d , m ed = γ w f e +

The currency breakdown of Spain’s trade in goods and services with non-euro
countries (called the extra euro area) are based on settlement currency instead
of invoicing currency. There is no way to assess when the settlement currency
is also the invoicing currency. As these data have not been published yet, a
proper checking and cleaning process has not been carried out, so the
cleaning and the quality of Spanish data cannot be guaranteed sufficiently.

In general, the data are derived from a survey conducted twice a year. This
survey was implemented in 1989 to cover overall trade exports for DM and
some other European invoicing currencies, USD and Yen. From 2002
onwards, data on currencies for trade imports were included; above that, the
survey was expanded to implement the extra euro area trade breakdown.
Since then, the respective invoicing currencies are broken down by EUR,
USD, Pound Sterling and others.
