Smart Institutions, Foolish Choices? The Limited Partner Performance Puzzle
Josh Lerner, Antoinette Schoar, and Wan Wong
NBER Working Paper No. 11136
February 2005
JEL No. G1, G2
ABSTRACT
The returns that institutional investors realize from private equity investments differ dramatically
across institutions.

Using detailed and hitherto unexplored records of fund investors and

performance, we document large heterogeneity in the performance of different classes of limited
partners. In particular, endowments’ annual returns are nearly 14% greater than average. Funds
selected by investment advisors and banks lag sharply. These results are robust to controlling for
the type and year of the investment, as well as to the use of different specifications. Analyses of
reinvestment decisions and young funds suggest that the results are not primarily due to
endowments’ greater access to established funds. Finally, we examine the differences in the choice
of intermediaries across various institutional investors and their relationship to success. We find that
LPs that have higher average IRRs also tend to invest in older funds and have a smaller fraction of
GPs in their geographic area, and that the performance of university endowments is correlated with
measures of the quality and loyalty of the student body.

Introduction
Over the past three decades, institutional investors have controlled an increasing

share of the U.S. equity markets: Gompers and Metrick (2001) calculate that their share
of U.S. public equity markets exceeded the 50% threshold in 1995.1

There is a

significant and growing literature in financial economics that seeks to understand the
investment decisions of institutional investors and the differences between the various
classes of investors. Gompers and Metrick (2001) document that institutional investors
prefer stocks that have greater market capitalizations, are more liquid, and with higher
book-to-market ratios and lower returns in the prior year.2 This literature thus far has
been focused on the differences between institutional and individual investors.

One question that has attracted much less scrutiny, however, is the heterogeneity
in investment strategies and sophistication across different types of institutional
investors. (Table 2 of Gompers and Metrick (2001) is a rare exception.) This neglect is
surprising because of the large differences in organizational structure, investment
objectives, or even the perceived level of sophistication across various institutions.
Moreover, recent theoretical literature highlights the extent to which differences in the
sophistication about financial markets as well as agency problems between the ultimate
Their calculation only examines institutions with greater than $100 million of securities
under discretionary management that are required to file a 13F form with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, and thus excludes hedge and private equity funds
and those with less than $100 million in assets. Thus, their estimate is a lower bound on
institutional holdings.

Other studies have suggested that institutional investors are less likely to buy stocks on
days with high trading volume (Barber and Odean (2003)) or to herd into particular
stocks (Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992) and Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers
(1995)) and that their investments fall into a few well-defined styles (Froot and Teo
(2004)).

investors and financial institutions can have profound implications for investment
decisions, portfolio allocations, and ultimately investment returns.3

Moreover, many institutions do not invest all—or even most—of their funds
directly, but rather do so through intermediaries. While there has been a growth of
research into investment style of intermediaries in recent years,4 the choices that
institutions make when selecting intermediaries, what we may term "intermediary style,"
are poorly understood.

This paper looks at a specific class of investment decisions made by institutions:
their investments in private equity funds. We analyze investment styles and performance
across several different classes of investors, known as limited partners (LPs). We begin
with the identification of a puzzle: different classes of investors in private equity have
enjoyed dramatically different returns over the past two decades.

Using detailed

records—hitherto unexplored by academics—of the composition and performance of
funds that are selected by different classes of investors, we document very substantial
differences across the returns that investors enjoy. On average, endowments’ average

3

For example, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) suggest that information asymmetries between
investors and intermediaries create limits to arbitrage that can affect the portfolio
strategies and eventually the returns of the latter. (Similarly, see Gromb and Vayanos
(2002).) Because the extent of agency problems may differ dramatically across
institutions, considerable differences in the behavior of institutional investors could be
expected.
4

For example, Barberis and Shleifer (2003) theoretically discuss investors’ choices
between value and growth stocks and their implications.
2

annual returns from private equity funds are nearly 14% greater than the average investor.
Funds selected by investment advisors and banks lag sharply.

Next we explore the importance of LPs’ reinvestment strategies in explaining the
differences in LP performance. This is the central means by which LPs can adjust their
portfolio and exert governance pressure on the fund, since private equity is a very illiquid
industry where investors have little recourse to their investment once the capital has been
committed. We find that endowments and public pension funds generally are much less
likely to reinvest in a given partnership than all other LP classes. Moreover, these two
classes of LPs are better at forecasting the performance of follow-on funds. Follow-on
funds in which endowments (and to a lesser extent, public pension funds) decide to
reinvest show much higher performance than those funds where they decided not to
reinvest. Other LP classes do not display these performance patterns. Corporate pension
funds and advisors are more likely to reinvest if the current fund had high performance,
but this often does not translate into higher future performance. These findings suggest
that endowments proactively use the information they gain as inside investors to improve
their investment decisions, while other LPs seem less willing or able to use this
information.

A natural concern is whether these substantial performance differences between
LP classes could be driven by other factors than variations in ability or sophistication.
First, we want to assess whether these differences are driven by differences in the time
periods in which the investments were made and other observable characteristics. Earlier

3

studies have shown that the private equity industry is subject to large cyclicality in
returns. (See, for example, Gompers and Lerner (1998, 2001) and Kaplan and Schoar
(2004).) Moreover, many endowments began investing in private equity funds before
other investors. Even after controlling for fund type and the vintage year in which the
investment was made, we continue to see superior annual performance of between 9 and
12 percent by endowments. The results are robust to examining patterns at the fund,
rather than the investment, level: performance is positively related to the number of
endowments investing in the fund, but negatively related to the number of banks
investing. We also find that within the different groups, older LPs tend to have better
performance than LPs that enter the industry at a later time. These differences are
particularly significant for corporate pension funds, advisors, and insurance companies.
We suggest that this may at least partially due to the fact that younger LPs are less
experienced in private equity investing and also might have inferior access to established
and successful funds.

A second important concern is whether these variations in performance could be
due to systematic differences in the risk profiles of the funds that different classes of LPs
choose. For example, endowments could be systematically investing in riskier funds and
therefore have higher returns. To address this concern, we control for a number of
observable characteristics that are often considered risk factors, such as the focus and
maturity of the investments selected by the fund and the fund’s size, age, and location.
While our results are robust to these controls, we cannot completely rule out the
possibility that unobservable differences in risk profiles are affecting our results based on

4

these tests. Therefore, we undertake an additional set of tests to see if the ex-post
variation in portfolio returns is larger for those classes of LPs that have higher average
returns. If endowments achieve their superior returns by taking on more risky
investments, we should expect that they have a higher variation in performance across
their private equity investments. When we compare the standard deviations of returns
across the different LP classes, we indeed find that endowments are among the LP classes
with higher variance, though they are not the highest. However, this variance is entirely
driven by the positive skewness of the return distribution of endowments. Once we
condition on the lower 75% of the funds across all LPs, we see that endowments in fact
have the lowest variation across all LP classes. These results do not support the idea that
endowments achieve their superior performance by relying on riskier investment
strategies.

An alternative story is that performance differences across LPs could in part be
the result of differences in the objectives that LPs pursue when investing in private equity
(and not necessarily their ability). For example, Hellmann, Lindsey, and Puri (2004)
suggest that banks as limited partners might diverge from maximizing returns on
investments in order to maximize future banking income from the portfolio firms in
which they invested. We find, however, that banks under perform the other LPs not only
in the buyout industry (where considerations about future business might be important),
but even in VC deals where the benefits from selling future services seem much smaller.

5

We also explore the possibility that the superior performance of endowments or
public pension funds results from historical accident: i.e., that these LPs through their
early experience as limited partners may have greater access to established private equity
groups (also known as general partners (GPs)) that manage high performing funds. To
test this hypothesis, we examine investments in young private equity groups (those
established after 1990) across all classes of LPs. If the performance difference is mainly
driven by the superior access that older LPs have in established private equity groups,
conditioning on younger GPs should erase the difference in performance between the
different classes of LPs. When we repeat our analysis conditioning on young GPs, we
still find a performance premium for endowments and public pension funds, though the
difference is much smaller than in the analysis using all GPs. While this finding does not
support the idea that the superior performance of these LPs is merely driven by historical
accident, we cannot rule out that some of the performance difference is due to their early
access to superior funds.

Next, we examine the LP-specific differences in the selection of intermediaries.
For that purpose we undertake an analysis of LP specific fixed effects.

We find

significant differences in investment styles across LPs in the sample. Moreover, these
investment styles are significantly correlated with the performance differences among
LPs. LPs that have higher IRR fixed effects also tend to concentrate their investments in
the funds of older GPs and have a smaller fraction of GPs in the same geographic area as
the LP.

6

These results support the idea that intermediary style seems to be important, as
has often been highlighted by practitioners. One of the clearest examples is the Yale
endowment. The fundamental characteristics of their investments vary dramatically: in
hedge funds, for instance, they prefer value-oriented funds while they heavily back
technology-focused venture funds in private equity. But they have a consistent style in
selecting intermediaries, whatever the investment style they employ: they favor long-term
relationships with seasoned groups based in the United States which have well-aligned
incentives (Lerner, Hardymon, and Leamon (2004)).

Finally, in the last part of the paper, we perform a simple cross-sectional analysis
of the performance of university endowments. We find strong correlations between the
LP specific fixed effects from IRR regressions and academic ranking measures. In
particular, proxies for selectivity from applicant pools and for alumni loyalty exhibit
strong correlations with the performance of university endowments, suggesting that the
top-performing schools benefit from their close ties to accomplished alumni.

This paper is related to the literature on the establishment of private equity funds.
Poterba (1989) and Gompers and Lerner (1998) explore how tax and other public policies
affect venture capital (VC) fundraising. Gompers and Lerner (1996) and Lerner and
Schoar (2004) examine the contracts entered into between investors and funds, and how
they are affected by the nature of the targeted investments and the limited partners.
Mayer, Schoors, and Yafeh (2003) examine the sources of VC financing across countries,
and how these are correlated with investment choices. Kaplan and Schoar (2004) study

7

how the level of returns affects the ability of private equity groups to raise follow-on
funds. But the drivers and consequences of the decisions by individual LPs to invest in
private equity funds have been hitherto unexplored, largely because the data has been
unavailable until very recently.

The results shed light on the large cycles in the private equity market that a
number of papers, including Gompers and Lerner (1998, 2000) and Kaplan and Schoar
(2004), have documented. The work of Lerner and Schoar (2004) implies that, optimally,
LPs would use their inside information to screen out poorly performing general partners
(GPs). The fact that many LPs appear not to be using their information optimally distorts
the resulting equilibrium. The presence of inefficient LPs allows poorly performing GPs
to raise new funds and thus makes the governance mechanism of exit by sophisticated
LPs less effective.

The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the
selection of private equity funds by institutional investors. Section 3 summarizes the data
used in the analysis.

Section 4 presents the analysis of performance.

Sections 5

examines reinvestment decisions; Section 6, the performance of young funds. Section 7
presents the LP-level analysis. Section 8 examines how the cross-sectional performance
among endowments varies with observable characteristics. The final section concludes
the paper.

2. Institutions and Private Equity5
Institutional investors frequently choose to invest in private businesses through
funds. This choice is largely driven by the difficulties of directly investing in private
firms. The selection of appropriate direct investments requires intensive relationships
and excellent due diligence skills, which few institutional investors have. Similarly, most
institutional investors do not have the resources to intensively monitor a portfolio of
private firms. Efforts to jointly invest in private firms with private equity groups have
frequently encountered agency problems. Moreover, the limited partnership structure
protects the investors from potential liability issues that could arise if they were to invest
directly in a firm.

As a result, the bulk of institutional investment in private equity is done through
funds.

These funds are raised for a specified period (typically a decade, though

extensions may be possible) and are governed by an agreement between the investors (the
limited partners) and the principals in the fund (the general partners), which specifies the
nature of the fund’s activities, the division of the proceeds, and so forth. Private equity
groups will typically raise a fund every few years, beginning the fundraising process as
the process of investing the previous fund is being completed.

Institutional investors are reputed to widely differ in their sophistication in their
approach to private equity investments. University and foundation endowments are often
regarded as being on average the most sophisticated investors, while public pension funds
This section is largely based on the industry notes and cases in Lerner, Hardymon, and
Leamon (2004).

9

are considered the least. Universities and foundations began many of the earliest private
equity investment programs. These groups thus frequently have a deeper understanding
of private equity investments, as well as “grandfather” rights that allow them to continue
to invest in subsequent funds of private equity groups that are closed to new investors.

By way of contrast, the investment boards at many public pension funds are often
dominated by political appointees. These directors frequently have little understanding of
the private equity industry, and may in some cases be seeking to direct investments in
ways that are personally advantageous to themselves.

These problems, while not

unknown, are less severe at other classes of institutions. Moreover, many public pension
funds offer compensation levels that are very modest by the standards of the financial
services industry. As a result, there frequently is high turnover among their investment
professionals, and average level of experience is modest. In some cases, career concerns
may shape the investment decisions of some pension fund investors. Some universities
have been very successful at preventing turnover by offering a variety of financial and
non-pecuniary benefits to their investment professionals.

Two other classes of investors also deserve discussion. An increasingly important
LP is the investment advisor, sometimes known as a “fund-of-funds.” Consultants
typically help institutions assess the past performance of previous funds by private equity
groups, as well as evaluate the groups’ future prospects. In recent years, as more public
pension funds and individual investors have begun investing in private equity, funds-of-

10

funds have become more prominent. These groups will aggregate capital from a number
of limited partners, and then invest it in a variety of private equity funds.

Banks have long been important private equity investors. The motivations for
their investment activity, however, are frequently more complex than those of other LPs.
While they also seek to earn high returns, their investment decisions are often shaped by
indirect considerations as well. For instance, many banks garner substantial profits from
lending to firms undergoing leveraged buyouts or else from advising on these
transactions. As a result, they may invest in a buyout fund that they do not expect to
yield high returns, if the investment will increase the probability that they will generate
substantial fee income from the group’s transactions.

3. The Data
As noted in the introduction, the primary barrier to research of this question has
been data availability.

The greater disclosure in recent years of private equity

investments has allowed us to overcome this barrier. This section describes the data
sources we employ.

Investment decisions. To ascertain which institutional investors had invested in
which private equity funds, we employ two sources. The first comes from the investors
themselves. Numerous public pension funds disclose the funds in which they have
invested. In some cases, this information was contained in annual reports that were
posted on the Internet; in other cases, these were provided by funds after a written

11

request. In addition, a number of private investors with whom the authors had personal
relationships provided us with confidential listings of the funds in which they had
invested. We obtained detailed information about these portfolio allocations from 20
different institutional investors.

The second source was the compilation of private equity investors by Asset
Alternatives. Since 1992, Asset Alternatives has sought to compile the investors in
private equity funds though informal contacts with the funds and investors themselves.
This information is included as part of their Directory of Alternative Investment Sources,
though the underlying data has not been made hitherto available to researchers. While
their database is not comprehensive, it covers a large and diverse fraction of the private
equity industry.

Fund characteristics. We collected information on the fund size, stage, the
previous funds raised, etc., from the Asset Alternatives funds database (included as part
of their Galante’s Venture Capital and Private Equity Directory, though typically again
not shared with researchers) and Venture Economics’ online funds database. These two
databases were merged and discrepancies reconciled. We distinguished between the
overall count of the fund and the sequence of this particular family of funds. In addition,
we used the data on management fees and carried interest of funds from Gompers and
Lerner (1999), updated through the review of the records of a number of limited partners
who gave us access to their files. In total, our database covers 1,398 separate funds that
belong to an LP portfolio in our sample.

12

Fund returns. Our primary source for return data was Private Equity
Intelligence’s 2004 Private Equity Performance Monitor, which presents return data on
over 1,700 private equity funds. This information is compiled by Mark O’Hare, who
over the past five years has created a database of returns from public sources (e.g.,
institutional investors who have posted their returns online), Freedom of Information Act
requests to public funds, and voluntary disclosures by both general and limited partners.6
We supplemented this with the return data that we had previously gathered from public
sources. Note that we will only use IRR data in our sample for funds established prior to
1999 (and we verify the results for a sample of funds raised prior to 2002), since this
performance metric is unlikely to be very meaningful for younger funds. IRRs are
reported net of fees and carried interest. As Gompers and Lerner (1999) shows, the
majority of funds have a fee structure with carried interest of 20% and management fees
of 1.5% to 2.5%.

Institutional investor characteristics. We compiled information on the overall size
of the assets managed by the limited partner, the length of each institution’s experience
with private equity investing and location from Venture Economics’ Directory of Private
Equity Investors and Asset Alternatives’ Directory of Alternative Investment Sources.

4. Analysis
4. 1. Descriptive Statistics
6

O’Hare has been highly successful at gathering data not only on the returns of new
funds, but also many of the most established in the industry.
13

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of the 1,398 funds and 417 limited partners
in our main sample. Data on characteristics of interest were not always available. We
indicate in Table 1 the number of non-missing observations. Panel A of Table 1 shows
statistics of the funds, broken down into three categories: early-stage venture capital,
later-stage venture capital, and buyout funds. Our sample is split relatively evenly across
these three types of funds. We have a limited amount of data on carried interest and
management fees, while we have fund performance data for close to half of the funds in
our sample.

Fund Characteristics. The average fund in our sample that LPs invested in is
$406 million, but there is large heterogeneity between funds. The smallest fund is $4.5
million dollars, while the largest one is $6.1 billion. Not surprisingly, buyout funds are
much larger with an average size of $660 million, while later-stage venture funds average
$330 million and early-stage VC funds $210 million. The average fund is a fourth fund
(the average sequence number is 3.7), but there is substantial variation ranging from
partnerships that are in their first fund to those that have raised 32 funds. Our sample
contains funds that were raised between 1991 and 2001, and the average fund in our
sample was closed in 1997. We find that venture capital funds tend to be somewhat older
(average sequence number of later-stage VC funds is 4.2), reflecting the longer history of
this segment of the private equity market.

Performance. In terms of performance, we find that the average fund in our
sample has an (unadjusted) IRR of 6.7 percent, but again with a great amount of

14

dispersion: the worst fund returned negative 94 percent while the best performing fund
had an IRR of more than 500 percent. The average performance in this sample might
seem very low. But it is important to note that this sample includes all funds up to 2001,
which might include a fair number of funds that have not been fully liquidated.
Therefore we also report the average performance for all funds that were raised prior to
1999 (and thus had at least 5 years to realize returns). If we condition on this sample, we
see that the average IRR across all funds in the sample is 24% (excess returns of 11%).
This performance is comparable in magnitude (but a little higher) to the average
performance found in Kaplan and Schoar (2004) or in Ljungqvist and Richardson (2003).
Over the entire period, we also find that early and later stage venture funds in our sample
had significantly higher performance than the buyout funds; 14 percent and 8 percent
versus 0 percent, respectively (on an unadjusted basis).

Geographic Distribution. Finally, we see that the funds in our sample are
concentrated on the East and West Coasts, with 47 percent and 31 percent of the U.S.
funds in the sample respectively. Only 23 percent of the funds are based in the South or
the Midwest. When differentiating by type of fund, we see that the majority of earlystage venture capital funds are based in the western United States (56 percent), while 50
percent of later-stage VC and 62% of buyout funds are based in the northeastern region.
This is not surprising since the buyout industry tends to be concentrated around New
York and early-stage venture funds around Silicon Valley.

15

Composition of Limited Partners. Panel B of Table 1 shows the distribution of
limited partners in our sample and their characteristics.

Endowments comprise the

largest group, with 100 LPs, followed by public pension funds (74) and corporate pension
funds (72). When we differentiate among the different sub-classes of endowments we
find that the majority of endowments in our sample are private university endowments
(63), followed by foundations (27) and public university endowments (10). There are 66
advisors in the sample, 32 insurance companies, 30 commercial and investment banks,
and 43 LPs that cannot be classified in any of the above categories. (Among such LPs
are investment agencies of foreign governments, corporate venturing departments of
large corporations, and religious organizations.) Advisors and public pension funds
constitute the largest amounts of capital committed to the industry overall (averaging
$3.6 billion and $2.2 billion committed to private equity investments, respectively).

Sample Period. Panel C shows the breakdown of vintage years for the funds in
our sample. The number of funds in our sample increases over the 1990s. This is due to
two different phenomena.

First, the coverage of the Galante’s database appears to

become more comprehensive in the later part of the sample period. Second, the 1990s
represent a period of massive growth of the private equity industry, in terms of the
number of funds raised and the number of investors participating in the industry. To
alleviate concerns that sample selection issues due to improved coverage of LPs over
time might drive our result, we replicate our findings for the sample of 20 LPs where we
have their complete investment history.

16

Availability of fund performance data. Finally, Panel D shows characteristics of
funds for which we were able to collect performance data, compared to the entire sample.
IRR data is available for just over 40% of all funds in the sample across the various fund
categories (early-stage VC, later-stage VC, and buyout funds). The funds for which we
have performance data tend to be slightly larger in size, have higher sequence numbers,
and have more LPs investing in them.

4.2. Performance Differences across LP Classes
Table 2 provides an overview of the investments made by each type of limited
partner in the different fund categories.

There is enormous heterogeneity in the

performance of funds in which different groups of institutions invest. The funds that
endowments invested in have by far the best overall performance. The average IRR of
funds that endowments invested in is 20 percent. This high performance is, however,
entirely driven by their VC investments. On average, early- and later-stage VC funds that
endowments invested in returned an IRR of 35 and 19 percent, respectively. In contrast,
the buyout investments of endowments only had an IRR of less than one percent.
Overall, endowments had a very positive average, since they invested in many more
venture capital than buyout funds.

If we again break down endowments into the different types of endowments
(public, private, and foundations) we find that foundations and private university
endowments have higher IRRs than public endowments.

This difference becomes

particularly large when we form the weighted average IRRs where each fund is weighted

17

by its asset size. Public endowments have a weighted average IRR of 3.2% while private
university endowments and foundations have a weighted average IRR of 19.1% and
23.3%, respectively. Interestingly, public university endowments perform much worse
across all different types of private equity classes than the other endowments once we
weight by size. This might partly be a reflection of the fact that these endowments are
much larger and thus forced to place the bulk of their investments in larger and less
profitable funds. Moreover, all endowments perform relatively poorly in the buyout
arena.

This difference in performance across different forms of private equity
investments might suggest that endowments have specific human or organizational
capital that allows them to outperform in the VC investments, rather than a model where
endowments have fewer agency problems. Since we do not see the same performance
differential for their buyout investments, the data suggest that endowments have
specialized knowledge in the venture industry. In section 8 we will analyze in more
detail what can explain this superior performance.

The picture looks quite different for public and corporate pension funds (and to
some extent, insurance companies). On average, the funds that these classes of LPs
invested in had more moderate IRRs (eight percent and five percent, respectively). But
the drivers of positive returns are less skewed for this group. The average VC fund these
LPs invested in had an IRR of slightly over 10 percent, while their buyout funds had an
IRR of two percent. Finally, we see that the funds picked by advisors and banks on

18

average had very poor performance (IRRs of negative two and negative three percent,
respectively).

This trend seems to hold across all different types of private equity

investments.

Interestingly, bank and finance companies picked particularly poor

performing funds among the early-stage VC funds (IRR of negative 14 percent). We
must be careful not to interpret these findings as the overall performance of the private
equity portfolio of these groups, however, since this calculation does not reflect the
actual size of the allocations to each of the different funds. This exercise represents the
ability of different groups of LPs to identify (good) funds on average.

We also estimated the LPs’ investment performance by assigning weights to each
LP’s portfolio constituents as follows.

For investments where the dollar amount

committed to the fund and the overall private equity commitments by the LP are
available, we weighted the returns from each fund by the amount committed to the fund
in relation to the LP’s total private equity commitments. For all remaining funds in an
LP’s portfolio for which the commitment amount was not known, we simply assumed
that the LP invested an equal amount in each fund. The results of this exercise indicate
that the performance changes little.7

4. 3. Are these Performance Patterns Robust?
7

Panel A also reveals that public and corporate pension funds tend to invest in larger
funds, whereas endowments and insurance companies invest in smaller funds. Public
pension funds also tend to invest in funds with higher sequence numbers. Interestingly,
we see that the smaller fund size for endowments is driven by their allocations to small
buyout funds and the greater share of venture capital funds in their portfolio: the VC
funds they invest in are larger on average. We find that insurance companies and banks
tend to invest in early funds (lower sequence number) across all fund categories.

19

A natural question is whether these univariate results are robust to controlling for
the time period when the investments were made, or the choice between venture and
buyout funds. We address this concern through regression analyses of fund returns.

For these and subsequent analyses, we will analyze investments at the LP-fund
level (except for Table 4, which is conducted at the fund level): that is, we will use each
investment by a limited partner in a fund as a separate observation. We control for the
fact that we have multiple observations by clustering the standard errors at the fund level.
We regress the realized IRR of a fund on a set of dummies for the different classes of LPs
and control variables for year fixed effects, fund category fixed effects, the year the LP'
s
private equity investment program was launched,8 and the geographical co-location of the
fund and LP. Public pension funds are the omitted category from the set of LP dummies.
We only include funds that were started before 1999 to guarantee that a majority of the
returns of the funds have already been realized.

In Table 3, column (1), we find that only funds in which endowments invest
outperform public pension funds, while other LPs on average pick funds that under
perform relative to those groups. In particular, corporate pension funds and banks invest
in funds with significantly lower IRRs. To understand the difference in the performance
of endowments in more detail we also replicate this regression where we distinguish
between private university endowments, public university endowments, and foundations.
We find (not reported in the table) the superior performance of endowments overall is

predominantly driven by the private universities. The public universities and foundations
have positive but not statistically significant coefficients.

In column (2), we include a dummy equal to one if the LP and GP are in the same
region of the United States and a control for the age of the private equity program of the
LP. We also add a number of other LP-specific controls such as the logarithm of the LP
size (measured as committed capital) and dummies for the region the LP is located in.
We find that the main results described above are not affected by the inclusion of these
controls.

The relationship between LP size and performance is negative but not

significant. When we include a squared term for log of size in an unreported regression,
however, we see that the average performance of the funds they invest in is concave. The
direct effect of size is positive while the coefficient on the squared term is negative
although not statistically significant, i.e., those LPs that are very big tend to under
perform the average.9

The geographical proximity factor is negatively associated with fund
performance, which might suggest that LPs are willing to invest in funds with lower
performance if they are in the same local area. In unreported regressions, we also interact
the dummy for whether LP and GP are in the same region with the dummies for different

9

One could imagine that there are severe capacity constraints in the industry, for example,
in terms of how much an LP can invest in a given fund and at what pace new fund
managers enter. Under this model, larger endowments might be forced to experiment
more and invest into new fund managers to secure the future choice of GPs. The need for
this type of investment might further depress the performance of large funds, since we
know from Kaplan and Schoar (2004) that first-time funds on average under perform the
industry.
21

LP classes and we find that the negative effect is entirely driven by the public pension
funds. Only these display a large negative coefficient on the interaction term. We also
differentiate whether LP and GP are in the same region or in the same state. We find that
public pension funds continue to display poor performance when investing in funds that
are in the same state, while funds in the same broad region of the U.S. but not in the same
state do not under perform. When we disaggregate the endowments as above, there is
also a strong negative effect for public universities. These findings are consistent with
the idea that public pension funds and public endowments face politically motivated
pressures or constraints to invest in their local areas despite possibly unfavorable effects
on performance.

The coefficient on LP vintage is positive but insignificant. We then interact the
LP type dummies with the vintage of the LP’s private equity investment program to find
out whether, within the different classes of LPs, those that started investing in private
equity earlier display different performance from those that started to invest later. We
find negative coefficients on the interaction terms for most LP classes. In particular,
among corporate pension funds, those LPs that started investing in private equity earlier
have significantly higher IRRs.

4. 4. Importance of Market Cycles
To analyze how sensitive fund returns are to market cycles, in column (4) of
Table 3 we replace year fixed effects with a measure of the aggregate annual inflow of
capital into the industry. From earlier papers by Gompers and Lerner (1998, 2001) and

22

Kaplan and Schoar (2004) we know that capital flows and returns in private equity are
very cyclical. Therefore, our measure of industry capital flows can be interpreted as a
proxy for the ability of funds to time the market. The coefficient on the aggregate inflow
of capital is negative and highly significant.10 Parallel to before, we now interact the LP
dummies with the measure of aggregate capital inflow. Column (5) shows that the
coefficient on the interaction term between LP type and aggregate inflow of capital is
negative and highly significant in general, but particularly so for advisors (at the 1%
level) and for endowments and insurance companies (at the 5% level). These results
suggest that advisors have significantly lower returns if they invest during periods of high
capital inflows into the industry. This result is consistent with an interpretation where the
latter LPs tend to display more herding behavior when the market is “hot,” which leads to
investments in lower return funds.

To test the robustness of this finding we also sort our data into two sub-samples,
funds with vintage years from 1991-1994 and those from 1995-1998, and repeat the
regressions described in Table 3 (not reported). Consistent with the herding story above,
we find that the poor performance of corporate pension funds and banks are
predominantly driven by their investments in the 1995-1998 period, which is usually
considered the beginning of the bubble period. By way of contrast, endowments show a
positive performance difference in both periods. In fact, the private endowments show

10

This pattern continues to hold when we employ other proxies, such as the inflows into
venture capital funds only or the level of the NASDAQ. We employ similar alternative
controls in subsequent analyses.
23

no difference in performance across the two periods, but the public endowments have a
more significant positive performance in the earlier period.

4. 5. Robustness Checks
We replicate the results in Table 3 using excess IRR as the performance measure.
Excess IRR is measured as the fund’s own IRR minus the median IRR of all private
equity funds in that year and category. These results are reported in the appendix
Table 3A. The results are equivalent to the results reported above. We also repeat our
analysis for the full sample of LP investments, including those made after 1999. Again,
the overall picture is very similar. We also repeat the analysis using median regressions
to reduce the importance of extreme values and the results are qualitatively similar. The
interaction terms between the different LP classes and industry capital flows become
statistically more significant, while the interaction terms with LP age become less
significant. The other results are unchanged.

Lastly, in Table 3, we used the individual investment decisions by LPs as an
observation. We might be concerned that this overstates the amount of independent
variation we have in the sample despite the fact that we are clustering at the fund level.
Therefore, in Table 4 we now turn to an alternative empirical approach where we
collapse the data at the fund level. We use the number of LPs of each class that invested
in a given fund in our sample as explanatory variables for fund performance, together
with fund size and controls for year fixed effects and fund category effects. We again use
two measures of fund performance, IRR and excess IRR. As in Table 3, we find a

24

significant positive correlation between the performance of a fund and the number of
endowments that invest in it. For all other classes of LPs, the coefficient is again
negative, but it is only significantly negative for banks and corporate pension funds.
Overall these results reconfirm our earlier findings in Table 3.

5. Differences in Reinvestment Decisions of LPs
In the subsequent analyses, we will try to explain what drives these differences in
the performance of LPs. One of the most important decisions for LPs is whether they
reinvest in the next fund of a partnership or not. Reinvestment decisions of LPs are
particularly important in the private equity industry, where information about the quality
of different private equity groups is more difficult to learn and is often restricted to
existing investors (see Lerner and Schoar (2004) for a discussion of asymmetric
information in private equity). Moreover, LPs have very few governance tools except for
exit, i.e., not reinvesting in the next fund.

For each fund in our sample, we identify whether the private equity organization
raised a follow-on fund of the same type. For each LP investing in the fund, we then
determine whether the same LP reinvested in the follow-on fund. In this way, we make
sure that we do not miscode situations where no follow-on fund was raised as a decision
not to reinvest.

Panel A of Table 5 shows the reinvestment outcomes by class of LP and fund
type. Public pension funds and insurance companies reinvest in roughly 60 percent of the

25

funds where a next fund was raised. They are followed by endowments and advisors,
who reinvest in about 50 percent of the cases, while corporate pension funds and banks
reinvest in only 39 percent of the cases. Interestingly, endowments and advisors differ in
their reinvestment rates across different fund categories. They are both more likely to
reinvest in venture funds than in buyout funds.

Most other LPs do not show a

pronounced difference in reinvestment rate across fund categories. Moreover, funds in
which endowments choose to reinvest have much higher average IRR than those of other
classes of LPs. Again these higher average IRRs are especially driven by investments in
venture capital funds. By way of contrast, the funds banks and advisors reinvested in
show particularly poor performance.

Panel B of Table 5 explores some of the consequences of reinvestment decisions.
We find that, across all LP classes, there are significant performance (IRR) differences
between funds in which LPs did and did not reinvest. We see that LPs tend to reinvest in
the next fund of the partnership if the current fund has a high IRR (on average these
funds have an IRR of 25 percent). In those instances where LPs decided not to reinvest,
the current fund on average had a significantly lower IRR of 17 percent. The same
pattern holds when we look at the IRRs of the subsequent fund. Funds in which LPs
reinvested have significantly higher performance than those in which they did not
reinvest (seven versus negative two percent respectively).

In Panel C, we now break out the reinvestment decisions differentiated by class of
LP. The difference in the average current fund performance between reinvested and

26

discontinued funds we found in Panel B is largely driven by the reinvestment decisions of
public and corporate pension funds and advisors, who tend to reinvest when the current
fund performance is higher.

Interestingly, endowments do not show a significant

difference in the current performance of partnerships in which they decided to reinvest
versus those they did not (39 versus 37 percent). This picture reverses when we look at
the performance of the next fund. Funds in which endowments decided to reinvest have
much higher performance than those they decided not to (31 versus 7 percent). They
appear to be able to select funds that maintain their high performance and avoid those
that will have lower performance going forward. Moreover, they tend to re-invest when
current funds are smaller in size.

Public pension funds show a similar ability to

differentiate between good and bad performers, but at, however, a much lower average
performance level. Funds they reinvested in on average have six percent returns, while
those they passed on had negative 2 percent. Advisors also appear to follow a similar
approach of reinvesting when the current fund is smaller, but are less successful at
picking the better performing next funds. In short, some investors appear far more able
to benefit from and/or act on the inside information that being a limited partner provides.

In Table 6, we present the results from a linear probability model of reinvestment.
The dependent variable is a dummy equal to one if an LP decided to reinvest in the next
fund of a given partnership (conditional on a next fund being raised) and zero otherwise.
In column (1), we find a positive but barely significant relationship between reinvestment
and the past performance of the prior fund.

Once we control for overall industry

conditions (measured as aggregate inflows of capital into the industry), LP vintage, and a

27

dummy for whether LP and GP are in the same area, this relationship becomes slightly
more significant (see column (2)). By way of contrast, market cycles have a much more
significant effect on reinvestments: in times when more capital flows into the private
equity industry, LPs are also more likely to reinvest. Moreover, we see that the LPs’
vintage has no significant effect on the reinvestment decision, but LPs tend to be more
likely to reinvest if the GP is geographically proximate. We add dummies for the
different classes of LPs in Column (3).

We see that corporate pension funds and

endowments are less likely to reinvest on average. This might indicate that these groups
follow a more proactive investment strategy, in which they exercise their exit right if they
are not happy with the relationship.

In column (4), we now add interaction terms between the LP class dummies and
the LP vintage. This allows us to test whether older LPs in different LP classes are more
likely to reinvest. We find that among corporate pension fund and banks, older LPs are
more likely to reinvest in a GP. This result could suggest that corporate pension funds
and banks tend to be less proactive in their investment strategy. Of course one could also
conjecture that these older LPs tend to have valuable long-standing relationships with
their GPs. Given the lower performance results we documented for these types of LPs in
Table 3, however, this interpretation seems less plausible.

Finally we also interact LP types with fund IRR or aggregate capital inflow (not
reported in the table). By doing so, we hope to test whether different types of LPs are
more sensitive to the past performance of a fund or the market conditions when deciding

28

whether to reinvest. While across most funds the coefficient on this interaction term is
positive, it is not significant. We also repeated all the analyses in Table 6 using logit
specifications with qualitatively the same results (not reported).

6. Are the Patterns Driven by Fund Access?
One possible explanation is that the superior performance of endowments is an
accident of history. As Kaplan and Schoar (2004) document, private equity funds display
a concave relationship between fund size and performance: the best funds apparently
limit their size, even if they could raise far more capital. Typically, these limitations are
implemented by restricting access to existing limited partners, who are given the right to
reinvest a set amount, and not accepting new investors. These facts may imply that
endowments enjoy superior returns not because of better fund selection, but because their
early experience gave them a “seat at the table” among superior groups. To explore the
possibility that the results simply reflect superior access, we analyze recent investment
decisions in young private equity groups. In these cases, access to the funds is much less
critical: existing limited partners should have little preferential access.11

Table 7 summarizes the performance of different classes of LPs for funds
managed by recently established private equity groups. We use the median founding year
(1990) of all private equity groups in our sample as a cut-off, and explore whether
endowments continue to enjoy superior performance when they invest in the younger
11

It is possible that existing relationships and prestige of an established limited partner
help somewhat in getting access to the hottest new funds, but typically new funds are not
in the position of turning away new investors.

29

private equity groups. Panel A shows the results if we include all funds started after
1990. In this case we find that endowments and public pension funds do not outperform
the sample anymore. Moreover, the differences in performance between the different
LPs are less pronounced. But advisors and banks seem to perform most poorly when we
condition on the younger GPs. One might be concerned that including all funds started
after 1990 in the sample could create bias, if some classes of LPs such as endowments are
more likely to invest in recent years when returns have not been realized. We therefore
repeat the analysis restricting the sample to young funds that closed before 1999 (Panel
B). The picture changes significantly if we use this cut-off, since now endowments and
public pension funds tend to outperform the rest of the LPs, while banks and other LPs do
worst. The difference between the LP classes, however, is again less pronounced than in
Table 2.12

Overall, these results suggest that some of the differences in the performance of
LPs (in particular, endowments and public pension funds) might be attributable to
preferential access of these LPs that have been in the industry for a long time. Over time,
they may have developed good relationships with established and successful funds in the
industry.

But endowments still outperform other LPs to some extent, even when

choosing among the younger GPs. Moreover, it might be optimal for established LPs to
invest in a number of younger funds even if the expected returns on these funds are low
12

We also repeat a regression approach along similar lines as Table 3, including only
funds established after 1990 and before 1999. Parallel to the descriptive statistics we find
young funds in which banks invest do significantly worse. All LP dummies except for
endowments have a negative coefficient relative to the omitted category (public pension
funds) but none of these are significant. When we use excess IRR as the dependent
variable, endowments have significantly positive performance.

30

initially. The goal of this strategy could be the need to generate information about new
classes of funds (e.g., Chinese venture capital) and to create a pipeline of a new
generation of GPs with whom they will have preferential relationships going forward.
This in turn could bias our results on the returns of young funds downwards and make the
differences between LP classes less pronounced than they might otherwise be.

7. LP-Specific Differences
Our analysis so far has focused on the differences between LP classes. But not all
endowment or pension fund investors are equal. Therefore, we now turn to analyzing the
importance of the underlying heterogeneity among individual LPs. The analysis that
follows will allow us to investigate whether differences in investment styles are
systematically related to differences in the performance of LPs.

For that purpose, we estimate a model with LP-specific fixed effects.

We

augment the standard model we used in Table 3 by adding a full set of LP-specific fixed
effects instead of dummies for LP classes. This allows us to test whether individual LPs
differ in their intermediary investment styles, e.g., their propensity to invest in younger,
larger, or better performing funds. Table 8 reports the results from this exercise for a
number of different dependent variables. The first row of this table reports the R2 of a
regression of the raw fund IRR on controls for fund category and vintage year fixed
effects. The R2 in this regression is 28.9%. We now add the dummies for LP classes to
this specification. Row 2 shows that the R2 goes up to 29.7%. Moreover, the F-test for
the joint significance of the LP class dummies is significant at the 1% level. When we

31

include the full set of individual LP fixed effects, the R2 of the regression increases to
35.2%. This increase is much more pronounced relative to the base model than when we
included the LP class dummies in row 2.

This finding suggests that LP-specific

heterogeneity explains a bigger fraction of the overall variation of LP performance than
differences between LP classes. We also find that an F-test on the joint significance of
the LP fixed effects is significant at the 1% level.

We also repeat this analysis using excess IRR as the dependent variable.
Similarly to before, we find that R2 between the base model and the model with LP type
dummies increases from 11.7% to 12.7%, but when we include the individual LP fixed
effects the R2 goes up to 19.2%.

The same patterns hold for the other dependent

variables: GP founding year, GP size, and the change in size between two consecutive
funds. In each case, the increase in R2 is much larger when including the individual LP
fixed effects. Overall, these findings suggest that LP-specific differences in investment
styles are more important than differences between LP types in explaining the variation
in LP performance.

7. 1. Differences within LP Classes
A natural question is whether some classes of LPs are more heterogeneous than
others. To look at the heterogeneity in LP styles by class of LP, we collect the estimated
LP fixed effects and calculate the mean, median, and standard deviations of these fixed
effects by LP type. If the distribution of the estimated fixed effects is very tight around
the sample mean, it would suggest that LPs do not vary greatly within LP classes, and

32

vice versa if the distribution is very wide.

Moreover, we can analyze if there are

differences in the distribution across different LP class.

The results in Table 9 suggest that the standard deviations of IRR fixed effects for
endowments are somewhat larger than the other LPs. Panels A and B show that the
standard deviation of the raw IRR and excess IRR fixed effects for endowments are 31
and 23 respectively, higher than for the other LP classes (except the “other” category).
However, this could be driven by the positive skewness of fund returns for endowments.
Indeed, when we condition on the lower 75% of funds across all LPs, the difference in
spreads across the different LP classes is much less apparent (Panels C and D, and
Figure 1). The standard deviations are relatively similar across the different LP classes
for the other dimensions of LP investment styles, which suggest that there is no striking
asymmetry in the amount of heterogeneity across LP classes.

7. 2. Correlation between the Dimensions of LP Investment Styles
Finally, we analyze how the different dimensions of an LP’s investment style
correlate with one another and with performance. For that purpose, we accumulate the
estimated LP fixed effects in one matrix, where each row contains all the estimated fixed
effects from the regressions with different dependent variables for a given LP. So an LP
who has high performance across its different funds and invests with smaller GPs on
average will have a high fixed effect in the performance regression and a lower fixed
effect in the GP size regression. We can now correlate these different fixed effects to
understand how these different investment dimensions are related to one another.

33

Table 10 shows the correlation structure within our sample of LPs. Each cell in
this table represents the correlation between one set of fixed effects, described in the top
row of the table, and another set of fixed effects described on the left hand side of the
table. The first cell shows that, not surprisingly, the correlation between the raw IRR
fixed effects and the excess IRR fixed effects is high (point estimate of 0.62) and strongly
significant.

When we look at the correlation of raw IRR fixed effects and other

dimensions of LP investment style, we find that LPs who have higher fixed effects on the
change in fund size and GP size are correlated with higher performance fixed effects.
The interpretation of these results is that LPs who invest in larger and faster growing
funds on average tend to have higher average IRRs. And finally, we document a negative
correlation between the IRR fixed effect of an LP and the fixed effects on average GP
founding year and the fraction of GPs in the same region as the LP.

Looking at the other dimensions of LP investment style, we find that LPs that
have higher fixed effects on the change in fund size (that is, those investing in funds that
increase their fund size more from one fund to the next) have lower GP founding year
fixed effects, a lower fraction of GPs in the same area, higher GP size fixed effects, and
higher reinvestment fixed effects.

Moreover, we find positive and significant

relationships between the fixed effect for GP size, reinvestment by the LP, and the
fraction of GPs in the same region. And finally we find a positive correlation between

34

the reinvestment decision and the number of funds per GP, as well as the fraction of GPs
in the same region.13

Overall, this supports the hypothesis that LPs vary in their overall investment
styles along a number of dimensions. These include the average size, growth rate, and
founding year of GPs they invest in, the tendency to reinvest in funds, and the proclivity
to invest in GPs that are geographically close to the LP. Most interestingly, these
different investment styles are systematically related to differences in the performance of
LPs.

8. Endowments
In this section, we try to understand in more detail what explains the superior
performance of endowments. For that purpose, we perform a simple cross-sectional
analysis relating the variation in performance among endowments to their observable
characteristics. Of the 73 endowments in our sample, 55 are universities for which
ranking data was available in the 1995 survey of U.S. colleges and universities conducted
by U.S. News and World Report magazine (47 private and 8 public universities).
U.S. News compiles data from various sources and aggregates them into one overall score
for each university.

We also use a similar approach to take another look at the risk and return question
alluded to in the introduction. We compute for each LP a rough measure of the total (not,
as we would prefer, the systematic) risk of its portfolio: the standard deviation of the
logarithm of raw and excess IRRs of the funds in its portfolio. (We use logarithms to
reduce the impact of the skewness of the distribution.) We find a positive correlation—
which in some specifications is statistically significant and in others is not—between this
proxy for risk and the LP-specific fixed effects from the IRR and excess IRR regressions.
13

35

Table 11 shows descriptive statistics for the universities in our sample. The
overall score of all rated universities in our sample ranged from 71.6 (the lowest score
assigned to a rated university by U.S. News) to 100 (the highest). We also collected data
on the individual measures of academic quality used by U.S. News to determine the
rankings. Universities in our sample had academic reputation rankings ranging from 1
(the highest) to 129. The high school class standing of entering freshmen, measured as
the share of freshmen in the top 10 percent of their high school classes, ranged from a
low of 14% to the highest possible 100%. Acceptance rates among applicants ranged
from 14% for the highly selective schools to 88%. Yield rates, or the percentage of those
accepted who actually enrolled, were between 21% and 75%. Student to faculty ratios
varied from 6 to 20. The strength of a school’s resources was determined by its total
expenditures on instruction, administration, student services and academic support
divided by total full-time equivalent enrollment, with expenditure per student ranging
from $8,270 to $63,575. Freshmen retention rates—representing the average percentage
of freshmen entering in 1990 to 1993 who returned the following year—ranged from
71% to 99%. Graduation rates were based on the average percentage of students in the
1985 to 1988 freshman classes who graduated within six years, and ranged from 47% to
97%. Finally, alumni giving rates were based on the average percentage of living alumni
who gave to fund drives in the preceding two years, and ranged from 10% to 58%.

To assess whether these characteristics and ranking factors are associated with
investment performance, we employed two approaches.

36

First, we simply compare

average performance for the different subsets of endowments. We find that, overall,
university endowments outperform other endowments by 9%. Among the university
endowments, we see that private universities have an average IRR of 22% while the
public ones only achieve an IRR of 17%. Finally when we sort universities into the top
50% versus the bottom 50% according to the U.S. News ranking, we find that
endowments in the upper half outperform the lower-ranked half by 11%. We confirm
that these univariate results hold even when using a regression framework as in Table 3
where we include controls for fund vintage years and fund categories (not reported).

We also use an alternative approach similar to the one in section 7.2, where we
collect the estimated LP fixed effects in regression models that incorporate LP-specific
fixed effects. We then correlate these estimated fixed effects with the academic ranking
variables. Table 12 shows the correlations obtained for the universities in our sample.
The first column of figures shows the correlations between LP fixed effects in regressions
using raw IRR as dependent variable on LP dummies, LP vintage, dummies for the
region of the LP and for the co-location of the LP and GP, fund vintage years, and fund
categories. The next two columns show the correlations when weighted IRR and excess
IRR are used as dependent variables in the LP-specific regressions. We find that there is
a strong positive correlation between LP fixed effects and overall ranking scores
(particularly for the weighted IRR regressions, which has a correlation coefficient of
0.71, significant at the 1% confidence level). In other words, endowments that received
higher scores in the U.S. News rankings tend to perform better. Acceptance rate and
alumni giving rate also show consistently significant correlations across all

37

specifications: the more selective universities and those that have loyal and generous
alumni tend to perform better in their private equity investments. These effects are still
present but slightly weaker when we restrict the analysis to exclude funds closed in 1999
and after.

Overall, these results suggest that private endowments and those with higher
academic rankings are associated with better investment performance in private equity.
The fact that the proxies for the selectivity of the student body and alumni loyalty are
particularly significant explanatory variables suggests that the advantage of topperforming schools may lie in the information generated by close ties to accomplished
alumni, rather than simply in the wealth of the university.

9. Conclusion
The differences between institutional and individual investors have attracted
growing attention by financial economists. The diversity of strategies across the various
classes of institutional investors, however, has been much less scrutinized. This paper
seeks to address this gap, examining the experience of various institutional investors in
private equity funds.

Using data on investment choices and performance that have not been hitherto
explored by economists, we document a puzzling pattern: dramatic differences in the
performance of investments by different institutions. Endowments have an annual return
some 14% better than other institutions, while funds selected by investment advisors and

38

banks perform particularly poorly. These differences remain present when we employ a
variety of controls and specifications. We explore the importance of funds’ reinvestment
strategies in explaining the differences in LP performance. We find that endowments and
corporate pension funds are much less likely to reinvest in a given partnership.
Moreover, those LPs are better at forecasting the performance of follow-on funds. Funds
in which endowments decided to reinvest show much higher performance than those
where endowments decided not to reinvest. This suggest that endowments proactively
use the information they gain from being an inside investor, while other LPs seem less
willing or able to use information they obtained as an existing fund investor.

We also explore the possibility that the superior performance of endowments or
public pension funds results from historical accident: i.e., that these LPs through their
early experience as limited partners may have greater access to established, highperforming funds. To test this hypothesis, we examine investments in young private
equity funds (those raised after 1990) across all classes of LPs. If the performance
difference is mainly driven by the superior access that older LPs have in established
funds, conditioning on younger funds should erase the difference in performance between
the different classes of LPs. When we repeat our analysis conditioning on young funds,
we still find a performance premium for endowments and public pension funds, though
the difference is much smaller than in the funds formed before 1990. While this finding
does not support the idea that the superior performance of these LPs is merely driven by
historical accident, we cannot rule out that some of the performance difference is due to
their early access to superior funds.

39

Finally, we examine the LPs’ “intermediary style”: the systematic patterns they
display when selecting private equity funds. We show that LP-specific differences in
investment styles are significantly correlated with the performance differences between
LPs. LPs that have higher IRR fixed effects also tend to invest in older funds and have a
smaller fraction of GPs in the same geographic area as the LP. In addition, a crosssectional examination of the variation in performance among endowments reveals that
private endowments and universities with higher quality and more loyal students enjoy
superior returns from their private equity investments.

This paper poses a number of follow-on questions that would reward further
research:
•

First, better understanding the sources of the performance puzzle is an important
challenge. What specific agency problems, for instance, have led to the poor
selection of funds by investment advisors and banks? While we can speculate on
some of the causes—for instance, the weak incentive compensation offered many
advisors and the desire on the part of many banks to attract lending and advisory
business by investing in new funds—clearly more work is needed to understand
these issues.

•

Second, we noted in the introduction that the differing experience levels of the
LPs might exacerbate cycles in the private equity market. To fully investigate this
question, it would be necessary to link the records of LP investments that we have

40

investigated here with the characteristics of the individual companies backed by
private equity funds.
•

Finally, it would be interesting to explore the generality of these results. Are the
same patterns seen, for instance, in the returns from hedge fund and public equity
managers? If so, it may be interesting to explore the broader consequences of the
changing mixture of institutional investors.

Table 1 (continued). Descriptive Statistics
The sample of funds consists of 1,398 distinct funds listed by Asset Alternatives.
Panel A summarizes fund characteristics according to the type of fund (early-stage VC, later-stage
VC, and buyout funds). Excess IRR is internal rate of return minus the median IRR of the portfolio
formed for each fund category every year. Geographical location by region follows the U.S. Census
classification of states: West includes California; Northeast includes Massachusetts, New York,
Pennsylvania; South includes Texas; Midwest includes Illinois, Ohio.
Panel B summarizes overall investment characteristics of 417 limited partners (LPs) who invested
in those 1,398 funds, presented according to class of LP (public pension fund, corporate pension
fund, endowment, etc). Percentage committed to VC funds includes both early-stage and later-stage
VC investments. Percentages committed to VC funds and to buyout funds do not add up to 100%
because LPs also invest in other types of specialized private equity funds, such as oil, gas and
energy, real estate, or venture leasing funds, which are not covered by our analyses.
Panel C shows the distribution of the funds by vintage year.
Panel D shows mean characteristics of funds for which performance data was available, relative to
the entire sample. Standard deviations are in parentheses.

The table shows groupings of 7,587 investments by 417 LPs in 1,398 funds, and mean values of
selected characteristics of those funds. Fund size refers to the total dollar value raised from all
investors in the fund, fund sequence number is by reference to the private equity firm’s funds
portfolio, fund IRR is the internal rate of return of the fund obtained from Private Equity
Performance Monitor, and weighted fund IRR is internal rate of return weighted by commitment
to a fund as a fraction of each LP’s total commitments to private equity funds.

Table 3 (continued). Fund Performance Regressions
The sample consists of investments by 417 LPs in 1,398 funds as compiled by Asset Alternatives, and
excludes funds closed in 1999 and after. Several versions of the following pooled regression are run
and coefficient estimates and standard errors are reported by columns in the table:

FundIRR ij = β 0 +
+
k

j

β 0 j DummyLPj +

j

β1 j DummyLP j × FundInflow i

β 2 k DummyLPk × LPvintage j + β3D_sameregion ij + controls

FundIRRij is the internal rate of return of fund i in %. Six dummy variables identify the class of LP for

The sample consists of 324 funds that were closed prior to 1999 and for which data is available to run
the following ordinary least squares regressions:
FundPerformancei = β 0 +

k

β1k NumLPik +β 2 log(FundSizei ) + controls

Fund performance is measured in two ways: (1) internal rates of return for individual funds, obtained
from Private Equity Performance Monitor, (2) excess IRR, calculated by subtracting from each fund’s
IRR the median IRR of the portfolio formed that year and in that category. NumLPik is the number of
LPs of class k that invested in fund i. FundSizei is the total closing amount for fund i in MM$.

Reinvestedij is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if LP j reinvested in the next fund in the same
family as fund i. Six dummy variables identify the class of LP for each LP-fund pair, with DummyLPk
= 1 for each observation consisting of an investment in fund i by LP j belonging to LP class k and = 0
otherwise. “Public pension funds” is the ‘base LP class,’ with zero values for all LP dummy variables.
CurrentIRRi is the internal rate of return of fund i in %. FundInflowi is the year-on-year change in the
amount of funds inflow into either total private equity or venture capital in the country and in the year
of closing of fund i, and is a proxy for market conditions. LPvintagej is the year of establishment of
the private equity program at LP j relative to that of the median LP in the sample, which began its
private equity program in 1987. D_sameregionij is a dummy variable and = 1 if both LP j and private
equity firm managing fund i are headquartered in the same region in the U.S. (Midwest (includes
Illinois and Ohio), Northeast (includes Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania), South (includes
Texas), and West (includes California)), and = 0 otherwise. Robust standard errors allowing for
clustering by LP in all the regressions are in brackets.

Panel A shows groupings of 1,586 investments for which fund performance data was available by 366
LPs in 686 funds managed by 442 “young” private equity groups (i.e. established after 1990) as
compiled by Asset Alternatives. Fund IRR is the internal rate of return of each fund obtained from
Private Equity Performance Monitor, and weighted fund IRR is fund IRR weighted by proportional
commitment to the fund in each LP’s private equity portfolio.
Panel B excludes all funds established in 1999 and after.

The sample consists of investments by 417 LPs in 1,398 funds as compiled by Asset Alternatives.
Reported in the table are the results from fixed effects panel regressions, where standard errors are
clustered at the fund level. For each dependent variable (as reported in column 1), the fixed effects
included are:
Row 1: fund category and vintage year fixed effects;
Row 2: fund category, vintage year, and LP class fixed effects;
Row 3: fund category, vintage year, and individual LP fixed effects.
Reported are the F-tests for the joint significance of the LP class fixed effects (column 2), and
individual LP fixed effects (column 3). For each F-test, we report the value of the F-statistic, the
p-value and the number of constraints. Column 5 reports the number of observations and column 6 the
adjusted R2 for each regression.
***, **, *

indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

The above table shows descriptive statistics for university rankings that were obtained from the
1995 U.S. News and World Report survey of colleges and universities in the U.S..
Overall ranking score is a weighted measure calculated by U.S. News based on several
individual measures, which included the following:
Academic reputation is an ordinal rank compiled from responses by college presidents, deans
and admissions directors who participated in U.S. News’ survey. Freshmen in top 10 % of class
refers to the share of freshmen in the top 10 percent of their high school classes and is a measure
of the high school class standing of entering freshmen. Acceptance rate is the percentage of total
applicants who received offers of admission. Yield is the percentage of those accepted who
actually enrolled. Student to faculty ratio is the ratio of full-time-equivalent students to fulltime-equivalent faculty. Education expenditure per student is a measure of the strength of a
school’s resources and is equal to its total expenditures on instruction, administration, student
services and academic support divided by total full-time equivalent enrollment. Freshmen
retention rate represents the average percentage of freshmen entering in 1990 to 1993 who
returned the following year. Graduation rate is the average percentage of students in the 1985 to
1988 freshman classes who graduated within six years. Alumni giving rate is the average
percentage of living alumni who gave to fund drives in the preceding two years.

Table 3A (continued). Fund Performance Regressions
Using Excess IRR as Dependent Variable

The sample consists of investments by 417 LPs in 1,398 funds as compiled by Asset Alternatives,
and excludes funds closed in 1999 and after. Several versions of the following pooled regression
are run and coefficient estimates and standard errors are reported by columns in the table:
ExcessIRR ij = β 0 +
+
k

j

β 0 j DummyLPj +

j

β1 j DummyLP j × FundInflow i

β 2 k DummyLPk × LPvintage j + β3D_sameregion ij + controls

ExcessIRRij is the internal rate of return of fund i in % minus the median IRR of the portfolio
formed for each fund category every year. Six dummy variables identify the class of LP for each
LP-fund pair, with DummyLPk = 1 for each observation consisting of an investment in fund i by
LP j belonging to LP class k and = 0 otherwise. “Public pension funds” is the ‘base LP class’,
with zero values for all LP dummy variables. FundInflowi is the year-on-year change in the
amount of funds inflow into venture capital in the country and in the year of closing of fund i,
and is a proxy for market conditions. LPvintagej is the year of establishment of the private
equity program at LP j relative to that of the median LP in the sample, which began its private
equity program in 1987. D_sameregionij is a dummy variable and = 1 if both LP j and private
equity firm managing fund i are headquartered in the same region in the U.S. (Midwest (includes
Illinois and Ohio), Northeast (includes Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania), South
(includes Texas), and West (includes California)), and = 0 otherwise. Robust standard errors
allowing for data clustering by funds in all the regressions are shown in brackets below the
coefficient estimate. Intercepts are not reported.
***, **, *

indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.
