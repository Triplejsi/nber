THE THEOREMS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WITH FACTOR MOBILITY

Abstract

This

paper addresses the relation between goods trade and

international factor mobility in general terms. Conditions for factor price
equalization are derived for situations with trade in both goods and factors,
as well as Rybczynski and Stolper—SarnuelSofl theorems. A weak price version

of the Heckscher—Ohlifl theorem is presented, as well as stronger quantity
versions.

The basic theorems of international trade, suitably interpreted,

are shown to hold in their strong versions if the number of international
markets is at least as large as the number of factors.

The crucial

dimensionality issue is hence not the relative number of goods and factors

per se, but the number of international markets relative to the number of
factors. Only the price version of the Heckscher—Ohlifl theorem fails to be
essentially preserved by this condition.

Economic Studies, University of Stockholm

1. Introduction
This paper addresses the relation between commodity trade and

international factor mobility in general terms. There are two rtivations.
The first is the intrinsic importance of the subject relative to the limited
attention it has thus far received. MuJ.ti—commodity and imilti—factor

generalizations of the standard factor proportions theory of international

trade deal rstly with goods trade only and ignore international nobility of
factors of production (see Ethier (1982b) for a recent survey). Although
there exists an extensive literature on various aspects of international
factor nobility (surveyed in Jones and Neary (1982)), there are few attempts
systematically to discuss the trade pattern in both goods and factors when

some factors are traded. Such a discussion is contained in Svensson (1982),
who extends previous work by Dixit and Woodland (1982) to trade in factors as

well as in goods. But Svensson's analysis deals only with marginal factor

endowment differences in the neighborhood of an autarky equilibrium. Thus a
more general treatment is needed.
Our second notivation is the dixnensionality issue. As is well
known, the standard theorems of factor—endowments trade theory are very
sensitive to whether the nwnber of goods equals the number of factors or

not.1 This is widely regarded as very damaging to the theory, since the

—2—

relative abundance of

technolor,

goods

and factors is an arbitrary feature of nature and

and one about which most of' us have limited intuition. Ethier

(1982b) presents a countervailing argument assigning factor mobility a key

role. There are two parts to the argument.
which

(i) Those traditional results

are otherwise quite general, with equal numbers of'

goods and factors,

are weakened only slightly when goods outnumber factors but substantially

when factors outnumber goods. Thus the key requirement is that there be at
least as xxariy goods as factors, not that they be precisely equal in number.

(ii) The n.in reason dimensionality natters is not the technological distinc—
tion between goods and factors, but the assumption that the former are inter-

nationally traded while the latter are not. Thus the standard

preserved

results are

when factors outnumber goods if enough factors are traded. This

interpretation leaves the basic propositions sensitive nainly not to an

arbitrary feature of nature but to whether enough narkets exist —— to which

most substantive results in economics are sensitive. In any event, this
discussion implies a central role for factor mobility in an understanding of
the significance of the basic propositions of factor endowments trade theory.

Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out the basic
framework, and then Section 3 offers a full treatment of' factor—price

equalization,2 exposing the role of dimensionality. Section 4

derives

some

Rybczynski—type and Stolper—Sainuelson type results. The relation of commodity trade and factor trade to each other and to factor endowments is the
topic of the Heckscher—Ohlin type results of Section 5, which thereby also
extend the previous analysis in Svenssori (1982) of narginal factor endowment

differences. Section 6 contains a sumnary and some conclusions.

International Equilibrium
Consider a

world of two countries, home and foreign. First we

of

describe the home country. There are M goods, indexed i=l,...,M, all

which

are traded. They are produced by N factors, NT of which are traded and NN c

which

are

not. Factor endowments are fixed.
There are J (production) sectors, indexed j =

l,...,J.

Ehch

production sector is characterized by a convex technology T' of feasible

combinations (ii, v3) of net output M—vectors y of goods and non—negative

input N—vectors v of factors. In particular, there are no externalities
between sectors. (Indeed, sectors are defined as the finest partition of the
overall production technology for which there are no intersectoral
externalities.)

By using this concept of sectors, we can include joint production.3
For the special case of no joint production, we can identify sectors with

goods, and for sector j all (yi, v) in T will have y 0, and y =

equivalently, the natrix product between the row vector p' and the column

domestic product function is defined as G(p,v) =

denote home factor endowments, where the

NT_vector k denotes ownership of traded factors and the Nw_vector 2. denotes
endowments of nontraded factors. For simplicity we shall call these
"capital"

and "labor", respectively-. Let the NT_vector k denote capital

input in production (as distinct from capital endowments) in the home
country-,

for

and let the NT_vector r denote rentals, the price of capital.

Then,

given goods prices and rentals, and given factor endowments, we define

the national product function G(p,r,v) as
G(p,r,k,L) =

Ci)

G(p,k(p,r,L),&)

Here the capital input function i(p,r,L) is the solution to flEX {G(p,,L) +

Hence we assume each sector behaves competitively, and takes goods

Assume that the demand side of the home country can be represented
by a standard M—vector demand function D(p,Y), where Y is national income.

3. Factor Price Equalization
We first determine when free trade in goods and capital will
internationally equalize the rewards of nontraded factors. To this end we
now assume that the two countries have identical technology

linearly homogeneous in 2, and the functions apply to both countries.

Thus the

Under these circumstances, a possible free—trade equilibrium, (7)
and (8), is obtained if each country produces a scaled—down version of the
world output vector, if no capital is actually traded, and if goods are

traded to accommodate taste differences. (Depending upon dimensionality,
there nay be other equilibria as well, with the same prices, but this

possibility will not disturb our subsequent argument. We assume that the
equilibrium

price vector is unique, up to a irultiplicative factor.) That is,

we have

Also, w =

so that the prices of nontraded

factors are equalized. We wish to know the circumstances under which this
equalization is preserved when we abandon the assumption that endowments in
the two countries are strictly proportional

to each other.

As a first step, let the relative endowments depart irarginally from
proportionality

by perturbing the above equilibrium by redistributing

number of sectors is e.ctly equal to the number of non—traded factors.

The next step is to consider large international differences in
relative endowments. The above argument applies

Now, suppose the world is in the initial equilibrium, and consider

bottom factor price equalization depends not on an arbitrary aspect of nature

(the relative numbers of goods and factors) but rather, just like nDst
interesting propositions in economics, on the existence of enough nurkets.
Note,

however, that

Comparative Statics
In factor—endowments models

of

commodity trade, the Rybczynski

theorem describes the effects of endowment changes on outputs, and the
Stolper—Samuelson theorem addresses the implications of commodity—price

changes for factor rewards.' Both propositions exploit the technological
relation between goods and factors and do not depend upon whether factors

are

internationally traded or not (although the latter might help determine

the circumstances under which

the Rybczynski theorem's description

example,

respond

the theorems can in fact be applied). For
of how commodity outputs

to changes in a nation's employment of factors is not sensitive to

whether the latter changes are due to domestic factor accumulation or to the

import of traded factors. Thus we need say little about the influence of
factor trade on the standard propositions. Instead we focus on the new
questions

that arise.

There are three relevant aspects to the two theorems. First, they

are linked together by the "reciprocity relations." Next, each of the
theorems contains two assertions, one relating to nagnitudes and one relating
to directions. For example, the Stolper—Samuelson theorem asserts that
commodity price changes produce unambiguous changes in real factor rewards,

—l 4—

also that relative factor intensities help to predict the direction of
the latter. We examine in turn each of the three aspects.
and

(i)

The reciprocity relations
The standard reciprocity relations follow from differentiation of

the domestic product function. We have G

=

G,

where again a prime denotes

transpose. Hence, for good i and factor j,

(/av)(aG/p')

ayh/vi =

(32)

(3/p1)(aG/avi) =

These relations hold whenever the respective terms are well defined. They
reflect only the technology (and the optimization implicit

product

in the domestic

function) and these hold regardless of whether factor j is traded or

nontraded. But the presence of traded factors introduces the questions
of how changes in the endowments of nontraded factors influence a country's
use of traded factors, and of how changes in the (international) price of

traded factors affect the rewards of nontraded factors. We therefore derive

an appropriate set of reciprocity relations. This is not difficult. For we
have, using twicedifferentiability of the national product function,

for traded factor i and nontraded factor j.

lhgnitudes

It is well known that

circumstances

the

following results hold under very

general

when M = N and there is no joint production: (a) an increase

in the price of any good causes a nDre—than—proportional rise in some factor

reward and a decline in some other factor reward; (b) at given commodity
prices, an increase in the econonr_wide use of any

factor

requires a

more—than--proportional rise in the output of some good and an absolute fall

in the output of some other good; (c) application of the reciprocity
relations

(32) to the "Stolper—Samuelson" result (a) yields

further

"Rybczynski" results and application to the "Rybczynski" result (b) yields

further "Stolper—Samuelson" results. If there are nrre goods than factors
these results are almost completely preserved, but they are weakened

substantially

when the number of factors exceeds the number of goods.15

The presence of traded factors has

little

effect on these

propositions: the results follow whenever the conditions are met- But two
points should be rrade.

First, the above results are weakened when there are

more factors than goods because endowment changes at constant prices then
require changes in factor rewards for factor nErkets to clear.

analysis

of

Thus the

the previous section implies that, with traded factors, condition

(31) replaces M N as the dimensionality requirement for the results to hold
in full

strength:

there must be at least as iiany international nurkets as

factors.

The second point concerns the relation between traded and nontraded

factors. Suppose an exogenous rise in the reward of some traded factor, all

—16—

other international prices renining fixed. Then some factor reward must

fall,

else no sector would be able to earn non—negative profits at unchanged

commodity prices. With the rewards of traded factors fixed, it must be a
nontraded

factor that becomes cheaper. Furthermore, this is a. real decline

since commodity prices have not changed. Thus each traded factor is an
"enemy-'t to some nontraded factor. The reciprocity relations (35)

then

imply

that the denRnd for any traded factor is reduced by a rise in the endowment

of some single nontraded factor. Note that these results do not require

factor—endowments trade

imodels, factor intensities predict, in

average sense, the response of factor rewards to commodity—price changes

and the response of outputs to factor—endowment changes. For example,

commodity—price changes are positively correlated with changes in the rewards

of those

factors used relatively most intensively (see Ethier (1982a,b)).

Such predictions are not sensitive to whether some factors are traded or

t.l6 But now we are interested instead in predicting the direction of
change of commodity outputs and traded—factor usage jointly in response to
changes in the endowments of nontraded factors, and also in predicting
changes in nontraded factor rewards in response to changes in the vector of

commodity prices and traded—factor rewards. We have

This is the generalized quantity version of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem. It
says

that the induced net exports of goods and the z' portion of the net export

of capital are positively correlated with the country's relative abundance of
the nontraded factors utilized relatively intensively. Equation (1i5) decomposes
total factor trade z into what we call "endowment factor trade" and "induced
factor trade" z'. The endowment trade component is the direct result of the
extent to which the country's ownership of traded factors is not proportional to
the world supply of these factors. This trade is independent of factor

intensities

(and technolor generally), of tastes, of prices, and of endowments

of nontraded factors, except in the indirect sense that all these help to
determine the factor of proportionality g, which depends upon the actual
equilibrium.

By contrast, induced factor trade z', which alone enters into

(145), is determined, jointly with induced commodity trade, by factor intensities
and by endowments of nontraded factors. Ownership of traded factors has no

influence (except, a.in, if it

helps determine the general equilibrium).

—25—

Broadly speaking, countries conduct endowment trade directly to export abundant

traded

factors and to import scarce traded factors, and they conduct induced

factor trade indirectly to export abundant nontraded factors and to import
scarce nontraded factors —— in the form of those traded factors which best

substitute

for them in

the production process. Both components of total factor

trade thus have a factor—endowment base.

Note the analor between the two types of goods trade and the two

types of factor trade. Induced goods trade, like induced factor trade, is
determined by relative factor intensities as summarized in (145).

Preference

(goods) trade reflects taste differences just as endowment (factor) trade

reflects

ownership differences. If

tastes are identical and homothetic, and if

the home and foreign countries own traded factors in identical proportions, (145)

describes

all trade. It is common to use the term "demand reversal" to describe

a situation where taste differences cause the opposite pattern of commodity

trade

(in a 2x2 world) to that predicted on the basis of relative factor

endowments. We can analogously use the term "demand—endowment reversal" to
refer to the case where x' and

are such that (x,z)R[L1 — g(p1 +

< 0.

The basic result (145) allows joint production, is valid no matter

how great the difference between home and foreign endowments, requires no
restrictions

on dimensionality, and imposes no additional restrictions on

technolor (such as ruling out higher dimensional analogs of factor—intensity

reversals). To proceed further, suppose that

the

number of sectors equals

the number of goods, that there are at least as many goods and traded factors

as there are factors, and that in the free trade equilibrium the home and

export those goods which make relatively

course applies only

to

induced trade. We describe as a "demand reversal" the

I
case where substitution of x for x in (146) reverses the direction of the
inequality.)

Note two aspects of this result. First, the concept of relative
factor intensity employed here is the most natural one: simply

the

sizes of the direct nontradedfactor input requirements of the techniques

use. Second, note that

and only that

part

only

the endowments of nontraded factors,

of the input matrix pertaining to nontraded factors, enter

into (146). Changes in the ownership of traded factors, or technological
changes which do not influence the use of nontraded factors, will produce no

effect. That is, (146) establishes a sense in which the pattern of induced
commodity trade, on average, cannot be reversed by such changes, even if

the

trade vector x' changes. But such a reversal could result from a change in the
traded status of a factor,19 since such a change would add or subtract from the
matrix in (146).

—27—

Expression (16) can be interpreted, in the custonRry way, as

saying

that comnrdity trade substitutes for the exchange of nontraded factors. A
similar relation can, surprisingly, be established between (induced) goods trade
and actual (induced) factor trade. Using (38b) in the same way that we have
used (38a) and (36) leads to

This says that a country on average exports those goods that nake relatively

trade. That is, induced trade in goods and the induced exchange of traded
factors are, in a sense, substitutes.2° Note that, again, the relevant concept
of factor intensity is the relative size of the direct traded—factor inputs of

6. Summary and Conclusions
Factor price equalization for nontraded factors, with trade in goods
and some factors, results if the number of distinct sectors with positive value
added is at least as large as the number of nontraded factors and if each
country's endowment of nontraded factors is in the generalized diversification

cone. If there is no joint production, this requires the number of goods and
traded factors to be at least as large as the total number of factors, that is,
the number of international markets should be at least as large as the number of

factors. The introduction of nontraded goods does not change this result.
Factor price equalization does not per se depend on the (rather
arbitrary) relative number of goods and factors but instead on the (less
arbitrary) relative number of international markets and factors.
Next

usual

we examined the 1rbczynski and Stolper—Samuelson theorems. The

reciprocity

variations

relations hold between the effect on output of factor input

(at constant goods prices) and the effect on factor prices of goods

—29—

price variations (at constant factor input), independently of whether some

factors are traded or not. We also derived additional reciprocity relations,
between the effect on traded factor inputs of nontraded factor input variations
(at constant goods and traded factor prices) and the effect on nontraded factor

prices of 'variations in traded factor prices (at constant nontraded factor
input).
The "ngnitude" aspects of the Rybczynski and Stolper—Samuelson

theorems require the conditions for nontraded factor price equalization to hold

in full strength, that is, there should be at least as nny international
markets as factors.

Even without nontraded—factor price equalization, each

traded factor is an "eneny" to some nontraded factor, in that the nontraded

factor's price niist fall if the traded factor's price increases. By the
reciprocity relations, the demand for any traded factor is reduced by the
endowment of some single nontraded factor.

We derived a general (directional) Ry-bczynski theorem: any change in

the endowment of nontraded factors will, at constant goods and traded factor

prices,

tend on the average to raise the nest the output of those goods, and to

reduce the ixst the usage of those traded factors, that

use

relatively

intensively those nontraded factors which increase the most. Here, "relative
intensity"

is defined from the sign pattern of the generalized Rybczynski nntrix

of the national product function. This result is extremely general in that it
allows

joint production, applies to arbitrary endowment changes, and is

independent of the relative numbers of goods, traded factors, and nontraded
factors.

—30—

If the conditions for factor price equalization hold, the above
theorem holds for relative intensity defined from the direct nontraded factor
input

coefficients.

We also derived a (directional) Stolper—Samuelson theorem

a change in goods and traded—factor
prices

that

prices on average increases the most the

of those nontraded factors used relatively intensively by the goods and

traded factors whose prices increase the most.

Finally, we looked at patterns of trade in goods and factors. The
principle of comparative advantage extends in straightforward fashion to
encompass factor trade. The price version of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem is,
however,
trade

weak.

The quantity version fares better. Decomposing factor

into "endowment trade" and "induced trade", with the former due to the

country's
of

rather

endowment of traded factors not being proportional to world endowments

traded factors, induced factor trade is positively correlated with the

relatively abundant nontraded factors used relatively intensively. Decomposing
goods trade into "preference trade" and "induced trade", with the former

reflecting taste differences, we derived a quantity version of the
Heckscher—Qhljn theorem: the induced net export of goods and induced factor
trade are positively
nontraded

correlated with a country's relative abundance of the

factors used relatively intensively. This result is

again very

general, allows for joint production, arbitrary differences between home and

foreign endowments, and requires no restriction on dimensionality. Assuming
nontraded factor price equalization, the theorem holds for relative intensities

defined by direct nontraded factor input coefficients. We also demonstrated

—31—

that

in general induced goods trade and induced factor trade are substitutes,

and we

established the precise sense in which this is so. The Travis—Vanek

theorem was extended to factor trade, under nontraded—factor price equalization.
The basic theorems of international trade, suitably interpreted, hold

with both goods

trade and factor trade. In

particular, with at least as uany

distinct sectors as goods, the crucial dimensionality condition under which the

markets

their strong versions is that the number of international
for goods and traded factors be at least as large as the total number

factors.

Hence, the crucial issue is not the relative number of goods and

theorems hold in

factors
only

per se but rather the number of markets.

Of the

central proposition,

the price version of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem fails to be essentially

preserved by this condition.
