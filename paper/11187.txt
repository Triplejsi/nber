ABSTRACT
The integration of the annual I-O accounts with the GDP-by-industry accounts is the most recent in
a series of improvements to the industry accounts provided by the BEA in recent years. BEA
prepares two sets of national industry accounts: The I-O accounts, which consist of the benchmark
I-O accounts and the annual I-O accounts, and the GDPby- industry accounts. Both the I-O accounts
and the GDP-by-industry accounts present measures of gross output, intermediate inputs, and value
added by industry. However, in the past, they were inconsistent because of the use of different
methodologies, classification frameworks, and source data.
The integration of these accounts eliminated these inconsistencies and improved the accuracy of both
sets of accounts. The integration of the annual industry accounts represents a major advance in the
timeliness, accuracy, and consistency of these accounts, and is a result of significant improvements
in BEA’s estimating methods. The paper describes the new methodology, and the future steps
required to integrate the industry accounts with the NIPAs. The new methodology combines source
data between the two industry accounts to improve accuracy; it prepares the newly integrated
accounts within an I-O framework that balances and reconciles industry production with commodity
usage. Moreover, the new methodology allows the acceleration of the release of the annual I-O
accounts by 2 years and for the first time, provides a consistent time series of annual I-O accounts.
Three appendices are provided: A description of the probability-based method to rank source data
by quality; a description of the new balancing produced for producing the annual I-O accounts; and
a description of the computation method used to estimate chaintype price and quantity indexes in the
GDP-by-industry accounts.

Integrating Industry and National Economic Accounts:
First Steps and Future Improvements
Ann M. Lawson, Brian C. Moyer, Sumiye Okubo, and Mark A. Planting

I. Introduction
As part of its continuing efforts to improve the system of economic accounts, the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has begun a series of strategic initiatives to
ultimately integrate the gross-domestic-product-(GDP)-by-industry, annual input-output
(I-O), and benchmark I-O programs within the industry accounts, as well as to integrate
the industry accounts with the national income and product accounts (NIPAs).2
Full achievement of this goal will require several years of effort by BEA, as well as the
continuing participation and cooperation by other statistical agencies, particularly the
Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), to further enhance source
data. In the interim, BEA has moved forward with integrating two out of three of its
industry programs—specifically the merging of the GDP-by-industry accounts with the
annual I-O accounts. Initial results of this effort will be released in June 2004 as part of
BEA’s 5-year comprehensive revision.
The integration of the GDP-by-industry accounts with the annual I-O accounts is
the most recent in a series of improvements to the industry accounts. These
improvements include the following: Resuming the publication of the annual I-O
accounts; accelerating the release of the annual I-O accounts to within 3 years after the

2

In addition, it is BEA’s long-run goal to integrate the industry accounts and NIPAs with related regional
accounts, namely gross state product (GSP) by industry and regional I-O multiplier estimates. Consistency
between the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts will improve the quality of the GSP
accounts, and any increase in timeliness of the GDP-by-industry estimates will be reflected in more speedy
delivery of the GSP estimates. Consistent and better measures of value added would also potentially
strengthen the links between the GSP accounts and the regional I-O multiplier estimates.

end of the reference year; expanding the GDP-by-industry accounts to include gross
output and intermediate inputs for all industries; developing an accelerated set of GDPby-industry accounts that are available with a lag of 4 months after the end of the
reference year; and continuing to work closely with the Bureau of the Census on new
initiatives to improve the quality and the timeliness of the source data used to prepare the
industry accounts.
With these improvements to the industry accounts in place, as well as with the
general improvements made to the quality of industry source data, BEA is ready to
integrate the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts as a first step
towards full integration.3 For purposes of the current paper, this integration is being
referred to as “partial integration” and is the first tangible result of the initiative to reach
BEA’s data users.
This partial integration could have been achieved through a variety of methods.
For example, many countries produce integrated annual I-O accounts and GDP-byindustry accounts by assuming that the industry ratios of intermediate inputs to gross
output do not change from the most recent set of benchmark I-O accounts. By making
this assumption, these ratios are then used to estimate a time series of value added by
industry from the annual source data on gross output by industry. BEA has taken a very
different approach in developing its integration methodology because of the richness of
the source data that are available in the United States. For example, the Bureau of the
Census, BLS, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provide data that can be used to
estimate value added by industry in various ways. However, the quality of these source

5
data varies by data series and by industry, particularly in terms of their relative coverage
and definitional consistency. As a result, BEA has developed a method that ranks the
available source data based on measures of coverage and consistency, among other
factors, and then estimates a balanced set of annual I-O accounts and GDP-by- industry
accounts that incorporate the resulting weighted average of these source data. In this
manner, BEA’s integrated annual I-O accounts and GDP-by-industry accounts will
provide a more consistent and a more accurate set of estimates.
For full integration of the industry accounts, the measure and level of value added
by industry for the industry accounts will be based on the benchmark I-O accounts,
beginning with the 2002 accounts. These accounts are prepared for years of the
quinquennial economic census and are currently used to establish the measure and level
of final expenditures by use category contributing to GDP in the NIPAs. Annual updates
of the integrated industry accounts would be based on less comprehensive survey and
administrative record data available in nonbenchmark years. For full integration, the
measures of value added by industry would be independent of the NIPA measures of
gross domestic income (GDI), and would provide a “feedback” loop to the NIPAs that
would improve the estimates of the commodity composition of GDP final expenditures.4
To achieve this ambitious goal, BEA is working cooperatively with the Census Bureau,
BLS, and other statistical agencies to make the necessary improvements to the quality

4

BEA currently uses two approaches to measure GDP: The expenditures approach and the income
approach. The expenditures approach measures GDP as the sum of consumption spending, investment
spending, government expenditures, and exports minus imports. The income approach measures GDP as
the sum of compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports, less subsidies, and gross
operating surplus. These approaches allow maximum use of up-to-date, high-quality economic indicators
from the Bureau of the Census, the IRS, and the BLS to produce timely, reliable measures of the
economy’s current performance.

6
and coverage of the underlying source data, particularly for information on industry
expenses.
This paper has five sections and three appendices. The first section is this
introduction. The second section describes in greater detail the partial integration being
achieved in the short run. The third section presents BEA’s vision for full integration in
the long run, including some of the major requirements for achieving this goal as well as
the major benefits. The fourth section describes the methodology developed for the
partial integration of the annual industry accounts. The last section outlines the future
steps required to reach the goal of full integration. The appendices include an expanded
description of the probability-based method used to develop a weighted-average estimate
of each industry’s gross operating surplus; a detailed description of the new balancing
procedure developed for automating production of the annual I-O tables; and a statement
of the computation method used to estimate chain-type price and quantity indexes in the
GDP-by-industry accounts.
Highlights of the partial integration methodology are as follows:
•

It allows BEA to incorporate the most timely and highest quality source data
available into both the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts.

•

The annual I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts will be released
concurrently for 1998-2002 in June of this year, and for the first time both sets of
accounts will present fully consistent measures of gross output, intermediate
inputs, and value added by industry.

•

The quality of the annual industry accounts will be improved because the
accounts will be prepared within a balanced I-O framework; that is, all the

7
components of the accounts will be in agreement within a balanced row-andcolumn framework.
•

The release of the annual I-O accounts will be accelerated by 2 years in a
sequence of two steps that will be completed by the fall of 2004, when they will
be released 1 year after the end of the reference year.

•

For the first time, the 1998-2002 annual I-O accounts will be presented as a
consistent time series; as a consequence, the annual I-O accounts will be more
useful for analyses of trends over time.

II. Partial Integration: The First Step
BEA prepares two sets of national industry accounts: The I-O accounts, which
consist of the benchmark I-O accounts and the annual I-O accounts, and the GDP-byindustry accounts. Both the I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts present
measures of gross output, intermediate inputs, and value added by industry; however,
they are often inconsistent because of the use of different methodologies, classification
frameworks, and source data. These inconsistencies are frustrating to data users, who
would like to be able to combine the richness of information from each for their own
applications. The goal of partial integration is to eliminate these inconsistencies, as well
as to improve the accuracy of the combined accounts by drawing on their relative
strengths in methodologies and source data. In this section, the traditional I-O and GDPby-industry methodologies are reviewed and the comparative advantages of each are
examined in the context of an integrated methodology that produces both sets of
accounts.

8
II.1 The Traditional I-O Accounts Methodology
The I-O accounts present a detailed picture of how industries interact to provide
inputs to, and use output from, each other to produce the Nation’s GDP. The I-O
accounts consist of benchmark I-O accounts and annual I-O accounts. The benchmark IO accounts are prepared every 5 years and are based on data from the quinquennial
economic census covering most businesses.5 The annual I-O accounts update the most
recent benchmark I-O accounts, and, although they are more timely than the benchmark
I-O accounts, they are generally less detailed because they rely on annual data based on
smaller sample surveys.6 At present, the I-O accounts are prepared only in current
dollars.7
Both the benchmark and the annual I-O accounts are prepared within a balanced
row-and-column framework that is presented in two tables: A “make” table and a “use”
table. The make table shows the commodities that are produced by each industry, and the
use table shows the commodities that are used in industry production and that are
consumed by final users. In the use table, the columns consist of industries and final uses
(chart 1). The column total for an industry is its gross output (consisting of sales or
receipts, other operating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change). The rows in
the use table consist of commodities and value added. The commodities are the goods
and services that are produced by industries or imported and that are consumed either by
industries in their production processes or by final users. The commodities consumed by
industries in the production process are referred to as intermediate inputs (consisting of
energy, materials, and purchased services). Value added in the I-O accounts is computed

as a residual--that is, as gross output less intermediate inputs by industry. In concept, this
residual, which represents the sum of the costs incurred and the incomes earned in
production, consists of compensation of employees, gross operating surplus, and taxes on
production and imports, less subsidies.8 GDP equals valued added summed over all
industries, and it also equals final uses summed over all commodities.
The I-O accounts have traditionally served two major purposes, both of which
have focused on information about the use of commodities and which have supported
BEA’s NIPAs. First, the accounts have provided the NIPAs with best-level estimates of
the commodities that comprise final expenditures for GDP in benchmark years. Second,
they provide the NIPAs with information to split estimates of commodities produced
annually into their business (intermediate) and final consumer components--information
that is critical for estimating GDP final expenditures in nonbenchmark years. Because of
their importance in determining the levels of GDP in the NIPAs, the I-O accounts have
traditionally focused more on the commodity composition of the economy and less on the
measures of value added by industry.
II.2 The Traditional GDP-by-Industry Accounts Methodology
In contrast to the I-O accounts, the GDP-by-industry accounts have traditionally
focused on the industry composition of the U.S. economy and the relative performance of
these industries as reflected in their measures of value added. The GDP-by-industry

8

Previously, these costs and incomes were classified as either compensation of employees, property-type
income, or indirect business tax and nontax liability. These new classifications are consistent with the
aggregations introduced as part of the comprehensive NIPA revision; see Moulton and Seskin for more
information. Specifically, all the nontax liabilities except special assessments are removed from indirect
business tax and nontax liability, and the remainder of this category is renamed “taxes on production and
imports;” the nontax liabilities except special assessments are added to property-type income; subsidies are
removed from property-type income, and the remainder of this category is renamed “gross operating
surplus;” and subsidies are netted against the value of taxes on production and imports.

10
accounts are particularly suited for time series analysis of changes in industry shares of
GDP and contributions to GDP growth. They provide annual estimates of gross output,
of intermediate inputs, and of value added by industry and the corresponding price and
quantity indexes.9
The GDP-by-industry accounts use a different estimating approach than that used
for the I-O accounts. They measure value added by industry as the sum of the costs
incurred and the incomes earned in production. Value added by industry is estimated as
the sum of the industry distributions of compensation of employees, gross operating
surplus, and taxes on production and imports, less subsidies (chart 2). In the GDP-byindustry accounts, total intermediate inputs by industry are measured as a residual--that
is, total intermediate inputs equal gross output less value added for an industry.
The GDP-by-industry estimates are based on data from three primary sources.
Gross output by industry is based on establishment-based annual survey data from the
Bureau of the Census that are used to extrapolate best-level estimates from the most
recent set of benchmark I-O accounts. The measures of value added by industry are
derived from the industry distributions of the components of gross domestic income
(GDI) from the NIPAs, which, in turn, are based on establishment-based data from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics and on enterprise-based annual tax return and administrative
record data from the IRS.
Real measures of gross output and intermediate inputs by industry are estimated
by deflating with detailed price indexes. Price indexes and quantity indexes are derived
for each industry’s gross output, of intermediate inputs, and of value added.

11
II.3 Combining the Two Methodologies
The primary strength of the I-O methodology is the balanced row-and-column
framework in which the detailed estimates of gross output and intermediate inputs by
industry are prepared; this framework allows for a simultaneous look at both the
economy’s industries and commodities. The primary strength of the GDP-by-industry
accounts methodology is the direct approach to estimating a time series of value added by
industry from high quality source income data. The methodology for partial integration
incorporates the relative strengths of both. It yields a new and improved set of annual IO accounts and GDP-by-industry accounts that are prepared within a balanced
framework and that incorporate the most timely and highest quality source data available.
It also ensures the consistency of the estimates of gross output, of intermediate inputs,
and of value added by industry across the two sets of accounts.
The strength of using a balanced I-O framework is demonstrated by again
referring to chart 1. A balanced use table ensures that the industry estimates of the I-O
accounts (the column totals) are in balance with the commodity estimates of the I-O
accounts (the row totals).10 This framework tracks all of the detailed input and output
flows in the economy and guarantees that each commodity that is produced is either
consumed by industries as an intermediate input or is consumed by final users. An
imbalance in the use table--for example, too little, or too much, supply of a commodity
after intermediate inputs by industry and final uses have been accounted for—flags an
inconsistency in the data. Therefore, a balanced framework provides a “consistency

The I-O framework also includes a balanced make table, which requires that the different commodities
produced by industries are consistent with total commodity and industry outputs for the economy.

12
check” of the use table. No comparable procedure to balance industries and commodities
exists for the GDP-by-industry accounts.
The strength of the GDP-by-industry methodology is that the estimates of value
added by industry are derived directly from high quality source data, so these measures
generally provide better estimates of value added for industries relative to the I-O
estimates. Nonetheless, several factors can affect the quality of the GDP-by-industry
estimates for specific industries. For example, gross operating surplus, one component of
value added by industry, includes several items--such as corporate profits before tax,
corporate net interest, and corporate capital consumption allowances--that are based on
corporate tax return data from the IRS. Because the consolidated tax return data of an
enterprise may account for activities by several establishments classified in different
industries, BEA must convert these enterprise- or company-based data to an
establishment or plant basis. The conversion can introduce errors because it is based on
employment data for establishments that are cross-classified by enterprise, and because it
is based on relationships from an economic census year that are likely to change over
time. In addition, proprietors’ income, another component of gross operating surplus, can
introduce errors because the industry distributions of proprietors’ income are based on
incomplete source data. Industries with large shares of value added from proprietors’
income are regarded as having lower quality estimates.11

11

Proprietors’ income is defined here to equal the sum of NIPA estimates for proprietors’ income without
inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) and capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj), proprietors’ net
interest, proprietors’ capital consumption allowance, and proprietors’ IVA. The NIPA adjustment to
nonfarm proprietors’ income without IVA and CCAdj for misreporting on income tax returns is shown in
NIPA table 7.14 “Relation of Nonfarm Proprietors’ Income in the National Income and Product Accounts
to Corresponding Measures as Published by the Internal Revenue Service.”

13
The GDP-by-industry measures of value-added may be of a higher or lower
quality than those from the benchmark I-O accounts, depending on the data used. For an
industry with high quality data on gross output and intermediate inputs, the measure of
value added from the benchmark I-O accounts may be superior, particularly when the
GDP-by-industry measure includes a large enterprise-establishment adjustment or a
substantial amount of proprietors’ income. Alternatively, for an industry with a small
enterprise-establishment adjustment and a negligible amount of proprietors’ income, the
GDP-by-industry measure may be superior, particularly if the coverage of intermediate
inputs in the quinquennial economic census is small for the benchmark I-O measure. For
the 1997 benchmark I-O accounts, less than half of all intermediate inputs were covered
by the economic census; for many industries, this results in lower quality measures of
value added. In contrast, for nonbenchmark years, the GDP-by-industry accounts always
provide the preferred measures of value added, because estimates of intermediate inputs
in the annual I-O accounts are currently based on very sparse data and are unable to yield
high quality measures of value added by industry.12
The advantages of a partial integration methodology, however, go beyond
incorporating the best methods and source data from each methodology. Because the
annual I-O accounts will be estimated concurrently with the GDP-by-industry accounts,
they will be released on an accelerated schedule. The 2002 annual I-O table, scheduled
for release in June 2004, will be released 18 months rather than 36 months after the end
of the reference year. In addition, beginning in the fall of 2004, the annual I-O accounts

12

The Bureau of the Census has recently undertaken initiatives to improve the coverage of intermediate
inputs by industry in several of its annual surveys. For example, the Annual Survey of Manufactures has
expanded its coverage of expenses to include purchased services by industry and the Service Annual
Survey has initiated the collection of data on expenses by industry.

14
will adopt the revision schedule of the NIPAs; at that time, the revised tables for 2001
and 2002 and new tables for 2003 will be released. The revised I-O estimates that are
consistent with the annually revised NIPA estimates will provide users with yet another
level of consistency. Finally, the partial integration methodology will impose a time
series consistency on the annual I-O tables, making the tables more useful for analyses of
trends over time.
A further advantage of the partial integration methodology is a “feedback loop” to
the NIPAs that is demonstrated by examining the relationships among the national
accounts (chart 3). Before the integration of the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-byindustry accounts, the benchmark I-O accounts provided the following: A starting point
for updating the annual I-O accounts (arrow 1), the best-level estimates of gross output to
the GDP-by-industry accounts (arrow 2), and the best-level estimates and commodity
splits of GDP to the NIPAs (arrow 3). The NIPAs provided estimates of GDI by industry
to the GDP-by-industry accounts (arrow 4) and information on the annual composition of
GDP to the annual I-O accounts (arrow 5). The partial integration results in an exchange
of information between the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts
(arrow 6), and it also provides a feedback loop to the NIPAs (arrow 7). Because the
integrated industry accounts will be prepared within a balanced framework, they will
provide annual estimates of the commodity composition of GDP final expenditures that
could potentially be used to improve the NIPA measures of GDP.

15
III. Full Integration: The Long-Run Goal
Integration of the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts is only
the first step, although a very important one, towards BEA’s long-run goal to fully
integrate all components of its industry accounts, including the benchmark I-O accounts,
and to integrate the industry accounts with the NIPAs. Although full integration is
dependent upon continued costly investments by the Federal statistical agencies to
improve the coverage and consistency of their economic data, the benefits are significant
in providing higher quality information to data users. With more consistent and
comprehensive data on industry inputs, the benchmark I-O accounts would provide the
best measures of value added by industry for benchmark years. With updated annual
information on intermediate inputs by industry, the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-byindustry accounts would provide annual updates of value added by industry that would be
independent of the NIPA measures of GDP. With full integration, BEA would have a
production-based measure of GDP that would provide new information to the NIPAs
through the feedback loop discussed earlier (chart 3). That is to say, it could provide
valuable insights into imbalances between BEA’s primary measure of GDP based on the
final expenditures approach and its “shadow” measure based on income—that is, GDI.
BEA views the underlying framework now being implemented for partial
integration as able to accommodate the requirements for full integration. That being said,
however, for full integration, the data needed to populate much of this framework is
presently missing, particularly consistent and comprehensive data on intermediate inputs
for industries. For example, less than half of the intermediate input estimates in the 1997
benchmark I-O accounts were based on high quality, consistent data collected by the

16
Bureau of the Census; estimates for the balance were based on fragmented information
from trade associations, company annual reports, anecdotal information, and prior
benchmark I-O accounts. To be reliable, a production-based estimate of GDP requires an
expansion by Census in its coverage of business expenses from less than half to 100
percent. The methods developed by BEA to achieve partial integration in the short run
are not an adequate substitute for these improvements to source data in the long run, if
the goals of full integration are to be realized. To acquire this information, BEA is
working collaboratively with other statistical agencies, particularly the Bureau of the
Census to both expand information collected for its annual surveys and for its
quinquennial economic census, beginning with that for 2002.
Full integration also implies greater consistency in the data provided by different
statistical agencies. For example, the quality of BEA’s industry estimates can be affected
by inconsistencies in the sampling frames used by the statistical agencies, as well as
differences in classification and data collection and tabulation practices. Table A
compares estimates of nonagricultural payroll data collected by the Bureau of the Census
with wage and salary data collected by BLS for selected industries in 1992. Industries for
which comparable information was not available are excluded from the table. The
comparison shows that the estimates differ by 10 percent or more for about half of these
industries. Although these differences do not directly affect measures of total value
added, they can potentially impact the reliability of BEA’s estimates of the labor-capital
splits of industry value added. BEA envisions that it will be able to further enhance the
consistency and quality of its fully integrated accounts because data-sharing initiatives
should reveal the sources of these and other similar differences in source data from the

17
various Federal statistical agencies. In the case cited, the consistency between its
measures of gross output by industry and compensation of employees by industry, would
be improved if payroll by industry data prepared by the Bureau of the Census and the
wages and salaries data prepared by BLS were brought into agreement by the source
agencies.
At the earliest, full integration could not be attained until the 2008-2010
timeframe, which is when expanded data from the 2002 Economic Census will be fully
incorporated into BEA’s economic accounts, beginning with the release of the 2002
benchmark I-O accounts in 2007. If limited data sharing by statistical agencies is also
made viable in the interim, BEA will be able to better identify the sources of the
differences in data from other agencies such as those identified in the example presented
above for BLS and Census data. The major benefit of such data sharing would be to
enhance the consistency and quality of BEA’s fully-integrated economic accounts.

IV. The Partial Integration Methodology
The methodology, including the source data and the estimating procedures that
will be used for the partial integration of the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-byindustry accounts is discussed in this section. The methodology is described in a
sequence of five steps: (1) Establishing a level of detail for both industries and
commodities; (2) revising the previously published 1997 benchmark I-O accounts that
will serve as a reference point for the integrated accounts; (3) developing a 1998-2002
time series for the annual estimates of value added by industry; (4) updating and
balancing the annual I-O accounts for 1998-2002, incorporating the revised 1997

18
benchmark I-O accounts from step 2 and the 1998-2002 estimates of value added by
industry from step 3; and (5) preparing price and quantity indexes for the GDP-byindustry accounts for 1998-2002.
IV.1 Step 1: Level of Industry and Commodity Detail
The first step in integrating the annual I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry
accounts is to establish the level of detail that can be used for both sets of accounts.
Table B shows this detail and the corresponding 1997 North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) industry codes. Table B no longer shows a statistical
discrepancy that has traditionally appeared as an industry in the GDP-by-industry
accounts. This reflects the use of a balanced framework which requires consistency
between GDP measured in terms of final expenditures and in terms of value added or
income. In addition, table B does not include an industry for the inventory valuation
adjustment, which has traditionally been shown in the I-O accounts. In the integrated
accounts, the inventory valuation adjustment is treated as a secondary product produced
by industries and included in their gross output, as well as a separate commodity going to
final demand. The level of detail shown in table B applies to both industries and
commodities and serves as the publication level of detail. Most of the estimation
procedures, however, are applied at a finer level of industry and commodity detail in
order to ensure the best estimates at the publication level.
IV.2 Step 2: Revised 1997 Benchmark I-O Accounts
The second step in the partial integration process is to revise the previously
published 1997 benchmark I-O accounts, because it must provide the relationships and
levels for integrating the annual I-O accounts and GDP-by-industry accounts. The

19
necessary revisions are from two sources. First, the 1997 benchmark I-O accounts must
be modified to incorporate the definitional, methodological, and statistical changes from
the 2003 comprehensive revision of the NIPAs. Incorporating these changes ensures that
the integrated accounts for 1998-2002 are consistent with the levels and composition of
GDP in the NIPAs. The major NIPA changes and their effects on the 1997 benchmark IO accounts are summarized in table C.
Second, after the NIPA revisions are incorporated, the level and the composition
of value added for each industry must be further modified on the basis of information
from both the I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts.13 As discussed above,
value added by industry in the I-O accounts is computed as the difference between gross
output and intermediate inputs by industry, and value added by industry in the GDP-byindustry accounts is computed from the industry distributions of GDI from the NIPAs. In
general, these two measures of value added for an industry will differ (see the first two
columns of table D).14
Chart 4 shows a matrix that demonstrates how the quality of the value added by
industry estimates varies across the benchmark I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry
accounts. For example, both the benchmark I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry
accounts provide good measures of value added for the health care industry because of
the near-complete coverage of gross output and intermediate inputs by the economic

13

The GDP-by-industry value added that is based on the NIPA GDI estimates will also incorporate the
results from the 2003 comprehensive NIPA revision.
14
Research indicates that the magnitude and sign of these differences vary across industries and across
time. For example, using data for 1992, Yuskavage (2000) finds that the property-type income for the
manufacturing sector is, on average, lower in the GDP-by-industry accounts than in the benchmark I-O
accounts. However, more recent research, using data for 1997, finds that the reverse is true; for the
manufacturing sector, the gross operating surplus from the GDP-by-industry accounts is, on average, larger
than the gross operating surplus from benchmark I-O accounts. BEA is continuing its research into the
sources of these differences.

20
census and the relatively small amount of redistributions of income resulting from
enterprise-establishment adjustments. On the other hand, both sets of accounts provide
poor measures for the construction industry because of incomplete coverage in the
economic census and because of large, lower-quality, enterprise-establishment
adjustments. For many industries, the quality of industry value added is mixed. Mining
value added, for example, is good in the benchmark I-O accounts because of nearcomplete industry coverage, yet poor in the GDP-by-industry accounts because of
relatively very large enterprise-establishment adjustments. The partial integration
methodology draws the best information from both sets of accounts into a single,
“combined” estimate of value added for each industry. These combined measures are
then incorporated into the 1997 benchmark I-O accounts.15
The combined value added for an industry is an average with weights
determined by criteria that reflect the relative quality of value added from the two sets of
accounts. In general, these criteria are based on the quality of the source data used for
each. The criteria for the benchmark I-O accounts include the following:
•

The percent of intermediate inputs by industry that are covered by source data
from the quinquennial economic census, and

•

the percent of an industry’s total gross output that is accounted for by the
quinquennial economic census.

The criteria for the GDP-by-industry accounts include the following:

15

The estimates of “compensation of employees” and “taxes on production and imports, less subsidies” in
the revised 1997 benchmark I-O accounts are consistent with those published in the NIPAs. For censuscovered industries, the compensation in the previously published 1997 benchmark I-O accounts was based
on the 1997 Economic Census. See Lawson, et al. (2002), p. 31.

21
•

The quality and the size of adjustments used to convert the enterprise-based,
profit-type income data to an establishment basis, and

•

the percent of an industry’s value added that is accounted for by proprietors’
income.
For both the benchmark I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts, these

criteria, along with expert analyst judgment, are applied at the industry level shown in
table B in order to identify point estimates and estimates of variance for each industry’s
measure of value added.16 These point estimates and estimates of variance are used to
develop a probability distribution of value added for each industry from each set of
accounts. Each probability distribution represents a measure of the likelihood that the
“true” value added takes on a particular value, given the information available. The
distributions are then combined to produce a measure of value added for each industry.
Essentially, the combined measure is an average of the two point estimates with the
weights being determined by the relative variances--that is, a point estimate with a
smaller variance receives a larger weight. Appendix A provides technical details on the
procedures used.
Chart 5 gives an example of this process for the educational services industry.
The point estimate of value added is $63.4 billion from the revised 1997 benchmark I-O
accounts and $61.3 billion from the GDP-by-industry accounts. The benchmark I-O
value-added estimate reflects only a limited amount of information on this industry’s

16

The estimates are prepared at this level of detail because the industry distributions of GDI are available at
this level. These estimates are allocated to more detailed industries when the revised benchmark I-O table
is balanced. Source data for 1997 were not available on the 1997 North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS) basis for all of the components of GDI. For selected components, BEA converted data
from the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) basis to the 1997 NAICS basis.

22
gross output and intermediate inputs, because most establishments classified in this
industry are out-of-scope of the quinquennial economic census. Therefore, the
information used to prepare the I-O estimates was drawn from a variety of sources,
including trade association data. The quality of these data is not as high as data from the
economic census. In contrast, the GDP-by-industry value-added estimate reflects
relatively complete data, based on the industry distributions of GDI from the NIPAs.
Nevertheless, examining the two quality criteria for the GDP-by-industry accounts
reveals that proprietors’ income for this industry is about 3 percent of total value added
and that the amount of adjustment required to convert enterprise-based profit-type
income data to an establishment basis is about 1 percent. This implies that the combined
estimate should be close, but not equal to, the GDP-by-industry point estimate.
A more formal analysis of the educational services industry is shown in chart 5,
which includes the related probability distributions for each of the two point estimates.
Note that the GDP-by-industry distribution is more peaked (smaller variance) than the
distribution from the I-O accounts (larger variance). The smaller variance reflects a
relatively good GDP-by-industry estimate; the larger variance for the benchmark I-O
accounts reflects a relatively lower quality estimate. As expected, the combined estimate
of $62.2 billion is closer to the GDP-by-industry estimate than to the I-O estimate; the
GDP-by-industry estimate is given a weight of about 57 percent, while the I-O estimate is
given a weight of about 43 percent. Because more information is used to make this
combined estimate, its overall quality is higher than that for either of the individual
estimates, as shown by their distributions in chart 5. A complete list of the combined
estimates of value added by industry is shown in the third column of table D.

23
After the two sets of revisions have been made to the 1997 benchmark I-O
accounts, it is then balanced. For this balancing, each industry’s gross output and new
measure of value added are fixed, and its total intermediate inputs is allowed to adjust to
the difference. Balancing ensures that the use of commodities equals their supply, the
sum of each industry’s value added and intermediate inputs equals its gross output, and
the sum of final uses equals published GDP. The revised and balanced 1997 benchmark
I-O accounts then provide a starting point for preparing the integrated accounts for 19982002.
IV.3 Step 3: A Time Series of Value Added for 1998-2002
A time series of value added by industry is prepared by extrapolating the revised
1997 benchmark I-O estimates of value added by industry forward to 1998-2002, using
the GDI-based measure of value added from the GDP-by-industry accounts as the
extrapolator for each industry. The integrated industry accounts for 1998-2002 are
presented on the 1997 NAICS basis.17 The components of GDI that compose value
added by industry and information on the major source data and on the industrial
distribution for each component are shown in table E.
As discussed above, the quality of the GDI-based measures of value added
depends on a number of factors, including the size of adjustments required to convert
enterprise-based, profit-type GDI data to an establishment basis and the size of
proprietors’ income. Nonetheless, they are preferred as growth indicators when
compared with those from the annual I-O residual methodology because of the scarcity of
annual data on intermediate inputs for credible measures of value added.
17

For earlier years, GDP-by-industry estimates are available currently on a 1987 SIC basis only. BEA is
currently conducting research on methods to extend the GDP-by-industry estimates backwards for years
prior to 1998 on the 1997 NAICS basis.

24
After extrapolating the revised 1997 benchmark I-O level of value added forward
with the GDI-based measure for each industry, the resulting sum of value added across
industries will not necessarily sum to GDP in a given year--part of the difference being
the statistical discrepancy and the other part being extrapolation errors.18 This procedure
allocates this difference in two steps. In the first step, expert analyst judgment is used to
adjust some industries with known measurement problems. In the second step, the
remaining difference is distributed across industries in proportion to the industries’ value
added.
IV.4 Step 4: Updated and Balanced Annual I-O Accounts for 1998-2002
Five tasks must be completed sequentially to update and balance each of the five
annual I-O tables for 1998-2002. These tasks include (1) estimating gross output for each
industry and commodity; (2) estimating the commodity composition of intermediate
inputs for each industry; (3) estimating the domestic supply for each commodity; (4)
incorporating estimates of commodities used for personal consumption, for gross private
fixed investment, and for government consumption and investment as part of GDP finaldemand expenditures; and (5) balancing the use of commodities with available supply
and the output of industries with necessary inputs for production.
IV.4.a Industry and Commodity Gross Output
For most industries and commodities, annual source data are available to estimate
current-year industry and commodity gross output. The data sources used are shown in
Table F. Manufacturing, trade, and most service industry estimates are based on annual
18

BEA also investigated using gross output by industry as an extrapolator for the revised 1997 benchmark
I-O value added. This procedureBwhich assumes industry input-output ratios are constant over timeBwas
not adopted, because tests on historical data showed that it yields larger discrepancies between the sum of
extrapolated value added and GDP relative to GDI extrapolation.

25
survey data from the Bureau of the Census. Agriculture, insurance, and government
enterprise estimates, as well as transportation, utilities, finance, and real estate estimates,
are primarily based on data from other government statistical agencies and private
sources. For those industries and commodities for which annual source data are not
available at the 1997 benchmark I-O level of detail, more aggregated source data are used
as extrapolators.
IV.4.b Intermediate Inputs to Industries
Industry inputs are estimated in three steps. First, for domestic inputs, each
industry’s current-year output is valued in terms of the previous year’s prices, using an
industry price index that is calculated--in a Fisher index-number formula--as a weighted
average of the price indexes for commodities produced by the industry. Estimates of
inputs from foreign sources are revalued using import price indexes. For commodities
for which a price index is unavailable, an aggregate price index is applied to multiple
commodities. The data sources used to prepare these indexes are shown in table F.
Second, each industry’s current-year output, valued in the prices for the previous
year, is multiplied by the previous year’s direct requirements coefficient for the same
industry. The initial set of coefficients used are from the revised 1997 benchmark I-O
accounts. The result of this multiplication yields current-year intermediate inputs valued
in the prices of the previous year.19 At this point, the composition of an industry’s inputs
per dollar of output (valued in the prices of the previous year) is unchanged from that of
the previous year. To adjust for changes in relative prices, the results are reflated to
current-year prices, using the commodity price indexes.

19

A direct requirements coefficient represents the amount of a commodity required by an industry to
produce a dollar of the industry’s output.

26
Finally, commodity taxes, transportation costs, and trade margins for each
intermediate input are estimated. Commodity taxes are added to increase the value of
intermediate inputs from basic prices to producers’ prices, and transportation costs and
trade margins are added to increase the value further to purchasers’ prices.20 Estimates for
commodity taxes and total transportation costs and margins are developed as part of the
annual estimates of commodity gross output and are distributed to transactions using
1997 benchmark I-O relationships.
IV.4.c Domestic Supply
The domestic supply is estimated. The domestic supply of each commodity is the
total value of goods and services available for consumption as intermediate inputs by
industries or for final use as personal consumption, private fixed investment, and
government consumption and gross investment. It is calculated as domestic commodity
output, plus government sales, and imports less exports and change in private inventories.
Imports and exports are based on foreign trade statistics from the Bureau of the Census
and on BEA’s international transactions accounts. Changes in private inventories are
from the NIPAs and the commodity composition of inventories held by industries is
based on relationships from the revised 1997 benchmark I-O accounts.
IV.4.d Commodity Composition of Final Uses excluding Imports and Exports
and Changes in Private Inventories
The annual estimates of the major expenditure components of final uses for
personal consumption, private fixed investment, and government consumption and gross
investment are obtained directly from the NIPAs. The initial commodity compositions of

20

The basic price is the price received by the producer for goods sold; it excludes the taxes collected by the
producer from purchasers, as well as transportation costs and trade margins.

27
these components are estimated using relationships from the revised 1997 benchmark I-O
accounts.
IV.4.e Balancing the Use Table
Finally, commodities and industries are brought into balance using a
biproportional adjustment procedure. This procedure sequentially adjusts rows and
columns to equal the estimated output control totals. The adjustments are made
iteratively until the use of each commodity equals its domestic supply, the sum of value
added and intermediate inputs for each industry equals its gross output, and final-demand
expenditures equal levels in the NIPAs. Unlike many I-O balancing systems, the system
employed for the annual I-O tables takes advantage of the very detailed relationships
included in the 1997 benchmark I-O accounts and balances in both producers’ and
purchasers’ prices. The system balances approximately 3,000 rows and 1,200 columns
while maintaining information on transportation costs and margins for each transaction.
Appendix B provides a more detailed discussion of the techniques used for this
balancing.
The annual I-O accounts are finalized for 1998-2002 after the results have been
reviewed and verified. The measures of gross output, intermediate inputs, and value
added by industry are then incorporated into the GDP-by-industry accounts.
IV.5 Step 5: Price and Quantity Indexes for the GDP-by-Industry Accounts
Price and quantity indexes for the GDP-by-industry accounts are prepared in two
steps. First, price and quantity indexes for gross output and intermediate inputs are
prepared for each industry. Second, information on gross output by industry is combined

28
with information on intermediate inputs by industry to derive price and quantity indexes
for value added by industry, using the double-deflation procedure.
IV.5.a Indexes for Gross Output and Intermediate Inputs by Industry
Price and quantity indexes for gross output by industry are derived by separately
deflating each commodity produced by an industry and included in its gross output.
Information on the commodities produced by industries is obtained from annual I-O
make tables. Price and quantity indexes for intermediate inputs are estimated by
deflating the commodities used by industries from the annual I-O use tables. The
commodity price indexes used for this deflation are listed in table F. When a commodity
price index is based on more than one detailed price index, a Fisher index-number
formula is used to prepare the composite index. Appendix C “Computing Chain-Type
Price and Quantity Indexes in the GDP-by-Industry Accounts” shows the Fisher indexnumber formulas that are used to prepare the price and quantity indexes for gross output
and intermediate inputs by industry.
IV.5.b Indexes for Value Added by Industry
Price and quantity indexes for value added by industry are calculated using the
double-deflation method. In the double-deflation method, separate estimates of gross
output and intermediate inputs by industry are combined in a Fisher index-number
formula in order to generate price and quantity indexes for value added by industry (see
Appendix C). This method is preferred for computing price and quantity indexes for
value added by industry because it requires the fewest assumptions about the
relationships among gross outputs.

29
V. Future Research
There are several areas of research that must be addressed in order to achieve
BEA’s long-run goal of full integration of the accounts. The most important of these
include:
•

Additional evaluation of the coverage, quality, and consistency of data from
different sources for the purpose of improving BEA’s industry accounts overall
and its estimates of value added by industry specifically. This includes working
cooperatively with other statistical agencies for the purpose of collecting
additional data as well as expanding data sharing initiatives to address differences
across alternative data sources.

•

Related research to determine the underlying reasons for the discrepancies that
existed between the GDP-by-industry and I-O levels of value added prior to
setting a “combined” level for the integrated accounts. The fact that these
discrepancies were clearly evident prior to the integration indicates underlying
inconsistencies in source data and methodologies that need to be explored further.
This research will also require working cooperatively with the statistical agencies
providing the source data.

•

Continued research to develop new methods and data sources that improve
measures of gross operating surplus and direct measures of value-added-byindustry that are consistent with establishment-based definitions for industries.
This is in contrast to the method of estimating value added as a residual resulting
from intermediate purchases being subtracted from gross output. Although this

30
method results in consistent estimates, it also picks up statistical errors that do not
have anything to do with value added.
•

Development of additional procedures to incorporate new data from the 2002
Economic Census and annual surveys of intermediate inputs by industry into
BEA’s industry accounts on a more accelerated basis, including techniques for
evaluating “best-level” estimates as compared to “best-change” estimates.

•

Development of new processes and procedures for incorporating information
from the production-based approach of measuring GDP into the NIPAs on a
timely basis.

•

Extension of the NAICS-based industry accounts backwards for years prior to
1998. For the period 1947-86, research is underway to develop current-dollar
GDP-by-industry estimates for broad industry groups. 21 Additional research is
needed to create current-dollar annual I-O tables for years prior to 1998.

21

In November 2004, BEA published the NAICS-based GDP-by-Industry Accounts for the period 198797. See Yuskavage and Pho.

31

Appendix A: Estimating the “Combined” Level of Value Added by Industry

This appendix describes the procedure used to determine the “combined”
estimates of value added by industry that are incorporated into the revised 1997
benchmark input-output (I-O) accounts. The procedure allows for the best information
from both the I-O accounts and the Gross-Domestic-Product (GDP)-by-industry accounts
to be used in determining the combined estimates. This is accomplished by preparing a
weighted average of the two independent measures of value-added where the weights
reflect the relative quality of the two measures. For each of the 61 industries presented in
table B, a weighted average is given by

Combined i = bi ,I −O (I - O i ) + bi ,GDP by Industry (GDP by Industry i ),

where (I-O i) is industry i’s point estimate of value added from the benchmark I-O
accounts and (GDP by Industry i) is industry i’s point estimate from the GDP-by-industry
accounts. bi , I −O and bi ,GDP by Industry are the weights for the benchmark I-O accounts and the
GDP-by-industry accounts, respectively.
In this linear combination, the weights are a simple function of the relative
precision of each point estimate. A modeling framework is developed to estimate the
precision of each industry’s value-added estimator. The precision of each point estimate
is summarized using two measures. First, an ordinal quality ranking of industries is
developed for both the benchmark I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts.
Second, an approximate 95-percent confidence interval for each point estimate is
determined by evaluating the uncertainty in the underlying source data. Implicit in both

32
the ordinal ranking and the confidence intervals are the quality criteria outlined on page
19 of the main text. A review of these criteria suggests that a significant amount of
expert analyst judgment is incorporated into this framework.
Two practical considerations constrained the modeling framework finally selected
by BEA for estimating weights. First, the overall objective is to obtain the most accurate
weighted average feasible from the information currently available. Second, the model
must not be overly sensitive to misspecifications of the 95- percent confidence intervals.
The chosen model requires the following assumptions:
1. Information about each benchmark I-O and GDP-by-industry value-added
estimate can be effectively summarized by estimating the mean and standard
deviation of a normal distribution. (This assumption implies that the standard
deviation accurately summarizes the uncertainty associated with each
estimator.)
2. The relative quality of the estimates from the benchmark I-O accounts and the
GDP-by-industry accounts can be evaluated based on their point estimate-tostandard deviation ratios.
3. The point estimate-to-standard deviation ratios for all industries can be
represented by an ordered vector with elements sampled from a beta
distribution.
The steps for estimating each industry’s standard deviation are as follows (for
illustrative purposes, only the benchmark I-O accounts are discussed but the process is
performed on the GDP-by-industry accounts as well):

33
1. For the benchmark I-O accounts, set candidate values for the two parameters of
the beta distribution as a starting point. This distribution is evaluated as a
candidate for characterizing the underlying distribution of point estimate-tostandard deviation ratios for all industries in the benchmark I-O accounts.
2. Sample 61 values from the distribution from step 1.
3. Rank order the 61 values from step 2 and assign one to each benchmark industry
based on its ordinal ranking.
4. For each industry, use the assigned point estimate-to-standard deviation ratio and
the known point estimate to determine the implied standard deviation--that is,
solve the following equation for industry i’s standard deviation.
Error Metrici = (Standard Deviationi) / (Point Estimatei).
5. Repeat this process many times (on average, about 5000 times), storing the
implied standard deviations of the industry estimators from each repetition.
6. Compute the average of the sampled standard deviations for each industry using
the results from step 5; use this average to develop a 95-percent confidence
interval based on the normal distribution—that is,
N(Point Estimatei, Average Standard Deviation).
7. Compare the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval estimated in step
6 with the original 95-percent confidence interval estimated for the benchmark IO accounts.
8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 with all candidate beta parameters. Find the beta
parameters that minimize the sum of squared deviations between the 95-percent
confidence intervals from the benchmark I-O accounts and those from step 6.

34
9. After estimating the beta parameters from step 8, follow steps 2 through 6 to
estimate the standard deviation for each of the 61 industries in the benchmark I-O
accounts.
This procedure approximates the estimator variance for each benchmark I-O and
GDP-by-industry value-added estimate. The estimator variance estimates are used to
determine the weights for the combined estimates. Estimators with smaller variances are
given greater weight, that is to say, the following weights are used to estimate the
combined level of value added for each industry:
bi ,I-O =

σ2

i , GDP bt Industry

σ

2
i , GDP bt Industry

+ σ i , I -O
2

and bi ,GDP by Industry =

σ2

i , I −O

σ

2
i , GDP bt Industry

+ σ i2,I-O

Appendix B: New Updating and Balancing Processes for BEA’s Annual I-O Tables

Since 1999, when the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reinstated its annual
input-output (I-O) program beginning with the release of accounts for 1996, BEA has had
among its many goals that of releasing annual I-O tables on a schedule synchronized with
that for the GDP-by-industry accounts. To achieve this goal implies regularly providing
a time series of annual I-O tables with those for the most recent years being updated and
revised through the standard advance, preliminary, and final iterations—a potentially
very resource-intensive process.
The five broad tasks required to produce annual I-O tables were identified and
discussed in the main body of this report (see section III, step 4, beginning on page 21).
In evaluating likely prospects for increased automation, BEA focused on task 5,
“balancing the use table,” which has tended to be very labor intensive because of BEA’s
extensive use of hand adjustments for the process. This appendix summarizes the results
of BEA’s research in this area and describes the changes being incorporated into the
current balancing procedures for the 1998-2002 annual I-O accounts.1
The appendix is divided into three sections. The first section describes BEA’s
new balancing procedure. The second section describes the different tests that BEA
performed on this procedure before it was adopted. The third section provides summary
remarks.

Accounts,” by M. Planting and J. Guo, in Economic Systems Research, No. 2, Vol. 16, 2004. The complete
paper can also be obtained from BEA’s Web site at http://www.bea.gov/bea/papers/Timeliness.pdf.

36
1. Expanded Automation of Balancing Procedures

BEA has developed a new set of automated procedures for balancing its time
series of integrated annual I-O tables for 1998 to 2002. Consistent with the research
results, the new balancing procedures:
•

Are based on an adjusted RAS (bi-proportional) process;

•

balance the I-O table in producers’ and purchasers’ prices simultaneously;

•

incorporate more exogenous data; and

•

process the tables at the most detailed level of data feasible.

The new procedures generally begin with an I-O use table that has been updated,
following steps one through four described in the main body of this report. The I-O use
table matrix is then balanced in both basic prices and purchasers’ prices. (The
purchasers’ price equals the basic price plus commodity taxes, transportation costs, and
margin costs.) This process allocates transportation costs and margin costs to industries
and final uses as functions of how the commodities are moved by the economy’s
transportation system (rail, truck, water, air, pipeline, and gas pipeline) and through its
distribution channels (wholesale trade and retail trade). In the use table, these costs are
summed for each industry and shown as separate commodity purchases.
The new balancing procedures require fifteen matrices, each of which must be
balanced internally, while maintaining the different relationships specified among
matrices. The following matrices are prepared: A matrix with commodities valued in
basic prices and one in purchasers’ prices; one for commodity taxes; one for each of the
six transportation modes (rail, truck, water, air, oil pipe, and gas pipe); one for wholesale
trade margin; one for retail trade margin; and two matrices for taxes by each type of

37
margin (see Figure 1). The transportation and wholesale trade matrices are of the same
dimensions as those for producers’ and purchasers’ prices. The retail trade matrix is a
single vector with one margin total for all consuming industries and final users. The
matrix valued in basic prices is related to that valued in purchasers’ prices through the
taxes, transportation, and trade matrices. A cell in the purchasers’ value matrix equals
the corresponding cell in the basic value matrix plus the cells in the taxes, transportation
and trade matrices; conversely, a cell in the basic value matrix equals the corresponding
cell in the purchasers’ value matrix less those in the taxes, transportation and trade
matrices.
Control totals are identified for each matrix. The basic price, tax, transportation,
and trade matrices are two dimensional and have separate control totals for each row or
commodity. The retail trade margin matrices are one dimensional and have single control
totals for the margin, sales tax, and other retail tax. The purchasers’ price matrix is two
dimensional and is the sum of producers’ price inputs plus transportation and trade
margin costs; it has column control totals for each industry and final use category.
Detailed national income and product accounts (NIPA) estimates, in purchasers’
prices, are used as controls for the different types of final uses. These detailed data
provide the basis for expanding estimates of personal consumption expenditures from one
to 210 categories; gross private fixed investment from one to 33; structures, from one to
26; and government expenditures and investment from six to 136. Elements that remain
constant or fixed in all matrices include exports, imports, changes in business inventories,
and other negative cells.

38
Balancing the fifteen matrices is complex and requires several steps and
iterations. Beginning first with the rows, adjustment factors are calculated, equaling the
row control less the sum of the fixed cells in the row, divided by the sum of the new cells
less the fixed cells. These adjustment factors are applied to the row cells that are not
fixed in each matrix. The purchasers’ price matrix is then calculated as the sum of the
twelve other matrices. To balance the columns, adjustment factors are again calculated,
this time equaling the column control less the sum of the fixed cells in the column,
divided by the sum of the column cells less the fixed cells. These factors are then applied
to the column cells that are not fixed in each matrix. The cells in the basic price matrix
are then calculated as the difference between the purchasers’ price and the sum of the
twelve other matrices.
After a set number of iterations, and when the cells are close to being balanced in
both basic and purchasers’ values, then the taxes, transportation, and trade matrices are
forced to also balance to their respective row control totals. The balancing of the taxes,
transportation, and trade matrices is delayed until the matrices valued in basic and
purchasers’ prices are approximately balanced in order to maintain the initial tax rates,
transportation cost rates, and trade margin rates as long as possible.

2. Tests on the New Procedures

BEA tested both the new balancing procedures and an alternative, more highlyautomated set of procedures, referred to as a “basic model,” using an old workfile with
1997 detailed data. Results were then compared to the published 1997 annual I-O use
table. Unlike the new procedures which balance multiple matrices, the basic model
balances the table in producers’ prices only. To evaluate the results from the two

39
approaches, a set of tests were designed to answer the following questions:
•

Does balancing in both producers’ and purchasers’ prices improve results? Most
I-O tables are balanced in producers’ prices (basic model). However, balancing in
producers’ prices ignores the detailed estimates of final use expenditures from the
NIPAs, which are valued in purchasers’ prices as well as the relationships
between transportation and margin costs and the use of goods. It is hypothesized
that valuing in purchasers’ prices and using detailed data from the NIPAs improve
the reliability of the balancing model.

•

Does the addition of known estimates of value added for industries improve
results? Value added makes up a significant portion of each industry’s input
structure. It is hypothesized that providing estimates of value added for industries
significantly reduces necessary adjustments and improves overall results. (Value
added is determined endogenously as a residual for the basic model.)

•

Does greater industry and commodity detail improve the results? The more
aggregated the table, the more diverse the mix of products grouped together as a
single commodity and the more diverse the market. Conversely, the more
disaggregated the table, the more specialized commodities are to different
markets. It is hypothesized that using more detail at the working level improves
the initial distributions of commodities to users and, consequently, also improves
the reliability of the balancing model.
To answer these questions, BEA designed twelve tests that could be used to

compare results from the new procedures with those from the basic model. Each version
of a use table was balanced, using both the new adjustment process and the basic

40
adjustment process. For the balancing, each was run through 40 iterations. Each final
use table was then collapsed to the summary level and compared to the published 1997
annual I-O use table.
The measure used for comparing results is the direct coefficient—that is, the
amount of a commodity required by an industry to produce a dollar of output. The fewer
the differences in direct coefficients between the balanced tables and the published 1997
annual table, the better the balancing model. Our comparisons were limited to the larger
cells of the use table, that is, to direct coefficients with underlying intermediate values of
$100 million or greater in producers’ prices, and to those cells with absolute value
difference (published less the balanced direct coefficient) of greater than 0.01 for direct
coefficients.
Table 1 provides the major test results. Overall, large coefficient differences
decreased from 11.7 percent for the basic model, balanced at the publication level of data
and using value added calculated as a residual, to 5.8 percent for the new model, balanced
at the source data level and using independent, fixed value-added estimates. The major
conclusions from the tests are as follows:
•

Results from the new balancing procedures are better than those from the basic
model;

•

working with more detail data improves results;

•

the addition of known value-added estimates improves results; and

•

the new balancing procedures result in only 5.8 percent of the direct coefficients
changing by more that 0.01 with a absolute average change of 0.029.

41
3. Conclusions

One of BEA’s goals has been to develop the capability for producing I-O tables
that are more current but are not extremely resource intensive to produce. Research to
this end has resulted in BEA’s development of new automated procedures for balancing
its use tables. From the test results examined, it is concluded that the best results are
obtained when balancing in both purchasers’ and basic prices. The test results also show
that providing fixed estimates of value added and working at the detailed source data
level both improve final results. However, although the new procedures produce use
tables that are fairly comparable to the published table, the remaining differences are still
important. Additional research is needed to evaluate these remaining coefficient
differences and their causes.

Appendix C: Computing Chain-Type Price and Quantity Indexes in the GDP-byIndustry Accounts

The computation of the chain-type Fisher price and quantity indexes for gross
output, intermediate inputs, and value added for an industry or an aggregate is
summarized below. The value-added price index for an industry represents the price of
its primary factors of productionBthat is, it represents the price of capital and labor used
in the production of gross output. Similarly, the value-added quantity index for an
industry represents the quantity of capital and labor used in the production of gross
output.
1. Chain-type price indexes

In the notation, LPt-1, t refers to the Laspeyres price relative for the years t-1 and t,
PPt-1, t refers to the Paasche price relative, FPt-1, t refers to the Fisher price relative, and
CPt refers to the Fisher chain-type price index. The superscript GO refers to gross output,
II refers to intermediate inputs, and VA refers to value added; p refers to detailed prices,
and q refers to quantities.
