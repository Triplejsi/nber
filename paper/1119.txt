Supply Shocks, Wage Stickiness, and Accommodation

ABSTRACT

The main issue discussed in the SUpply shock literature that followed the
oil and food price shocks of the seventies was whether to accommodate. The

supply shock reduces the equilibrium 1eel of output, and monetary policy cannot
affect that. But in the seventies supply shocks were also followed by

recessions. The

question

is whether monetary policy can and should be used to

prevent such recessions. The paper analyzes the conditions under which a suppiy
shock will result in. recession, and the potential for monetary policy to offset

the fall in output. The basic result is that a pure supply 3hock need not result
in a recession if the money stock is held constant.

Aggregate demand effects

associated with the supply shock-—including the effects of monetary policy
attempts to fight the inflation caused by the supply shock--may cause a

recession, as also may real wage resistance by workers. The choice of polloy
response to the supply shock then turns on the same basic issues as counter—
cyclical policy in general, particularly the relative costs of inflation and

unemployment.

But consumption falls as capital is

In this case of Hicks—neutral technical regress,

which will be taken as the

standard case, the supply shock reduces the steady state capital stock and

consumption. Investment and the real wage decline on impact, along with the real
return to capital. This pattern occurs

also if the supply shock is Harrod

(i.e. if the share of labor exceeds the elasticity of substitution). Given
that estimated elasticities of substitution are around one, this is a real

possibility. Despite the higher steady stae physical capital stock, the steady
state output level would be lower. Following the shock investment increases and
consumption sharply decreases.
Energy-Efficient Capital:

We now introduce two types of capital, types

1

and 2, with differing

productivities. Type1 can be thought of as energy inefficient and type 2 as
more energy efficient.

Thus for

decline in the productivity of type 1 capital will lead to a smaller

steady state capital stock, where capital is measured in units of consumption
goods.

The major difference between the two capital good and the one capital good

models is that the marginal products of existing and new capital may now differ;
correspondingly the tight link between the change in steady state capital stocks
and short run investment behavior is broken.

When a supply shock occurs,

existing capital becomes less productive, and the marginal product of existing

capital falls. But the marginal product of energy efficient capital may be
higher than the steady state interest rate. Investment in type 2 or energy

efficient capital will begin immediately. The old capital goods remain in
servic gradually depreciating and being in the long run replaced by more
productive or energy efficient capital. Steady

state and short run real wages

are reduced by the supply shock.
The other p'itterns of response discussed in the one capital good model are

also possible. Supply shocks may lead to an

investment slowdown or seizure in

the short run, as existing capital is allowed to depreciate and the capital stock
works down to a lower steady state level.7

No serious macroeconomic issues arise when the economy adjusts as smoothly
as the neoclassical model described above. We begin macroeconomic analysis in

as it would be

7The adjustment process to the supply shock in this neoclassical economy could
also require some unemployment. For instance, if the economy were modelled as
having two sectors, with the shock implying a shift of labor from one sector to
the other, there might well be unemployment as labor is reallocated.

section, locating the source of slow adjustment in wages. I assume the wage

is sticky, being predetermined within each period. The demand for labor
determines aggregate supply within the period; to minimize complexity aggregate

demand is described by the quantity equation. Output and the price level are
determined by aggregate supply and demand, and the adjustment of wages is
responsible for the dynamics of the response of the system to the shock.

Within any period, the nominal wage is predetermined.

Thus the price level

curves. The initial equilibrium is at point E.

Now suppose there is an adverse supply shock, meaning that et in equation

The intuition of the result in (20) is straightforward. The supply shock
requires the real wage to fall in

the same proportion as real GNP when the shock

is Hicks neutral. With the nominal wage constant, and nominal aggregate demand
constant through the quantity theory, both

real output and the real wage fall in

the same proportion.

Unemployment and the Supply Shock: In

this simplest case of a Hicks neutral

supply shock there is no change in employment in the short run, even with nominal

wage stickiness. There are however several mechanisms that could generate
unemployment following a supply shock.

employed. There is thus unemployment. In the Solow neutral case, unemployment
rises if the elasticity of substitution is less than one.

11

First, unemployment will occur if an adverse demand shock accompanies the

supply shock. Such a shock may occur because of the redistribution of wealth
associated with the shock, for instance to OPEC or farmers.'2 Alternatively, the
demand shock may result from policy attempts to fight the rise in the price level

caused by the supply shock. Such shifts move the AD curve in Figure 2 down to
the left, reducing output to below its full employment level.
The use of the simplest quantity theory to model aggregate demand ignores

other demand effects that may be associated with the supply shock. For instance,
the optimizing analysis of Section I showed that the rate of investment would

typically fall following a supply shock. The propensity to consume should rise

at the same time. Given the uncertainty generated by a supply shock, it is not
clear that consumers would want to raise the propensity to consume. In such a
case there would be a reduction in nominal aggregate demand given the real
interest rate.

UnempThyment may also occur if the supply shock has differential sectoral

effects. For instance, as noted above, labor may have to be reallocated from
energy intensive to other sectors, and the reallocation could be accompanied kby
unemployment.

These effects may modify the basic result of equation (20), which is that
if monetary policy is passive, an adverse supply shock need not, on impact,
generate unemployment.

Dynamics and the Phillips Curve:

In the next period the nominal wage may be higher, as workers try to recoup
for the losses due to the unanticipated inflation caused by the adverse shock.

12This is one of the assumptions by which Gordon (1975) obtains an increase in
unemployment following a supply shock.

12

This by itself tends to cause unemployment. At this point we need to develop
more fully the dynamic analysis based on a Phillips curve.

Assume that nominal wages are set one period in advance. The logarithm of
the wage is:

(21) Wt

All

are positive. The nominal wage is set equal to last period's

wage, w1, with several adjustments. First, expectations of unemployment reduce

the unemployment rate expected at time (t—i )

prevail at t. (A similar notation is used throughout.) Second, to the extent
that inflation is expected, the nominal wage is increased, as reflected in the

term

1. The final term in (21) is a catch—up for real wages: if the price level was
higher than expected in period (t-i), the nominal wage for period t is increased
to compensate.

The dynamics of response to the supply shock would be more extended and

realistic if overlappiing labor contracts were modelled. But the current
formulation (21) contains the necessary essentials: short run fixity of the
nominal wage combined with slightly longer run responses to unemployment, to
expected inflation, and to past unanticipated inflation.

The complete model now consists of the aggregate supply equation (18), the
aggregate demand equation (19), and the Phillips curve (21)' in which (17) has
been used to substitute out for the expectation of the unemployment rate:

the system moves immediately to

its new steady state level of output, without unemployment, when the supply shock

hits. Attempts to compensate for future inflation, through the term in (21)
involving a1, do not affect the smooth adjustment to a supply shock in the

If there is real wage resistance, then real output

rises back to its new

represents a powerful effect of unemployment on wages, and large b2 represents a
powerful effect of real wages on output.

The reason a large 81 increases the

speed of return to equilibrium is that there is deflation from periods 2 on as
the economy returns to equilibrium - thus a large a1 ensures the rate of wage
increase drops along with the inflation.

Examining price level behavior in more detail, the impact of the supply
shock is to raise the price level in the current period.

If there is no real

wage resistance, there is no further adjustment. If there is real wage
resistance, the price level will rise again in the next period. Then the price
level gradually falls back to its steady state level - above the level before the
shock - as unemployment pushes down the wage.

Demand Shocks: The supply shock may be accompanied by either a monetary policy

Summary: The analysis of monetary and demand shocks provides the second
component of the response of the economy to a supply shock. If the economy is
affected by an adverse demand shock (negative v) along with the supply shock,

output will certainly fall and unemployment rise (for a Hicks neutral shock) when
the shock hits.

Further, the unemployment is sure to be prolonged. Note from (26) that for
an adverse demand shock not to have prolonged effects, a2 has to be equal to 1.

But from (23), if

a2

1, the supply shock has prolonged effects.13

13This result depends on the assumption that the nominal wage response to a fall
in the real wage is the same whether the real wage drop is caused by a supply or
a demand shock.

the price rise caused by the supply shock are adverse. Whatever these costs may
be, any attempt to fight the inflation through restrictive monetary policy will
result in a recession——thus the issues in choosing the appropriate policy action
here are precisely those that arise in considering anti—inflationary policy in
general.

2. Real Wage Resistance. Assuming the supply shock is pure (aggregate demand is
unaffected) then a passive monetary policy will result in no prolonged recession

unless there is real wage resistance by workers. If there is real wage
resistance, but there is money illusion in the Phillips curve in that a1 and/or a

a2 is less than one, then as (24) shows, expansive monetary policy can be used
to offset the decline in output caused by the real wage resistance. If both a1
and a2 are equal to one, there is nothing but unemployment that will reduce the

real wage. In either case, expansionary monetary policy will reduce unemployment
only by producing a higher price level. Once again the decision whether to use
active monetary policy turns on the relative costs of inflation and
unemployment.
3.

Offsetting

Aggrepate Demand Shocks. Finally, suppose that the supply shock

is accompanied by aggregate demand disturbances that tend to produce

unemployment. Note that such disturbances would themselves tend to mitigate the
inflation caused by the supply shock. Here too the basic issue is the same:
expansive aggregate demand policy will reduce unemployment but produce more

inflation than there would otherwise have been. Whether such policy is justified
depends on the relative costs of inflation and

unemployment.

Policies. In each circumstance in which the use of expansionary

considered above, the decision turns on a

weighting of the cost cf increased

of
inflation against the benefit of lower unemployment. Supply side policies,
to reduce
which a reduction in the payroll tax is the standard example, promise

both inflation and unemployment. In Figure

2, such policies shift the aggregate

supply curve down and to the right.

Supply side policies thus seem

the perfect answer to supply shocks, since

they offset the two macro problems_—inflation

supply shock. However, it is always

and uxiemploymeflt-cau5ed by the

desirable to have less inflation and less

level of
unemployment, so we need also to consider what determines the base
supply side policy instruments.

If these instrumeflts-for instance the payroll

tax——are set optimally, then the marginal

equal to the marginal cost of

benefit of raising the payroll tax is

raising it. Accordingly, it is unlikely that

offset the
supply side policies can be deployed in strength and by themselves to

effects of a supply shock. It will probably

be necessary to use demand side

policics as well.

Policy Issues.

In the cases discussed above, it was assumed that the government's actions

had no impact on expectations of

future policy actions. This convenient

assumption is untenable. When the Fed responds to a particular shock,

having stability of nominal

values. Thus it might be optimal for the Fed to have the goal of keeping the
price level stable, following the monetary rule proposed by Henry Simons. With
price level stability, real wage adjustment has to take place through nominal
wage changes.

Keynes's alternative (1936, pp. 270-271) was nominal wage stability,

proposed as a policy rather than a description of behavior. He argued that
monetary pulicy should aim to keep the nominal wage rising gently, with necessary
changes in real wages being brought about by changes in the price level.
Successful stabilization of the average nominal wage is presumably self—
reinforcing, leading to sticky wage behavior as the norm.
There is as yet no complete analysis of the appropriate choice of a monetary

standard. Choosing labor as the standard of value fits the traditional
prescription that the commodity in question be widely traded. But then so does
choosing goods in general as the standard of value. The typically long term
nature of labor contracts and

job

attachments suggests a preference for nominal

wage predictability. The analysis of this choice will turn also on the relative
ease of co—ordinating private sector responses to shocks with attractive monetary
standards.1'

Someof the issues are di3cussed in Fischer (1980).

Nothing said so far in this section relates particularly to supply shocks.
There is one special issue raised by the supply shocks of the last decade. That
is the question of the optimal response

to what appears to be a new type of

and
phenomenon. When neither the private nor the public sector knows the nature

consequences of a shock, responses of both are bound to be tentative. But the
government in general, and the Fed in particular. with its command over research

resources and information, is the natural leader in analyzing and carrying out

a response. Of course, the basis for its actions should be explained. But it
should take those actions that lead the private sector, with its conventional
reactions to shocks, towards equilibrium.
