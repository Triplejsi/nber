Hospital Ownership Mix Efficiency in the US: An Exploratory Study

ABSTRACT
This paper offers an empirical test of ownership mix efficiency in the U.S. hospital services industry.
The test compares the benefits of quality assurance with the costs from the attenuation of property
rights that result from an increased presence of nonprofit organizations. The empirical results suggest
that too many not-for-profit and public hospitals may exist in the typical market area of the U.S. The
policy implication is that more quality of care per dollar might be obtained by attracting a greater
percentage of for-profit hospitals into some market areas. This conclusion, however, is tempered
with several caveats. We discuss these and also make recommendations for further research.

Introduction

Health care spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product has been on the
rise again in the United States, with an increase from 13.3 percent in 2000 to 14.9
percent in 2002 (Levit et al., 2004). A considerable share of this growth can be
attributed to the hospital services sector of the health economy because expenditures
on hospital services account for 36 percent of all personal health care spending. The
observed high level of spending in this sector has sometimes been linked to the
inefficient use of resources by nonprofit organizations, which may result from the
attenuation of property rights incentives.
Hansmann (1980) notes that nonprofit organizations face a non-distribution
constraint because they cannot legally distribute any of their residual earnings. By
law, nonprofit organizations must dispense all residual earnings for the express
educational, charitable, or religious purposes for which they were formed. As a
result, economists are quick to point out that nonprofit organizations are likely to face
a more severe principal-agent problem than for-profits. In particular, the absence of a
residual claimant with a financial interest in the organization means that no one
individual, or group of individuals, has strong incentives to monitor the behavior of
the organization. Therefore, in a nonprofit health care organization, the divergence
between the interests of the principal(s) and the agent(s) often leads to the inefficient
production and provision of medical care services. This occurs because unconstrained
managers of nonprofit organizations are more inclined to pursue personal goals and
objectives, which are likely to conflict with minimum cost production, ceteris

3

paribus. Consequently, property-rights theory predicts that a nonprofit healthcare
organization, in isolation, will produce medical services at higher costs than an
otherwise comparable for-profit organization.
However, if nonprofits do produce with higher costs, as property-rights theory
predicts, it becomes unclear why nonprofit organizations are so dominant in many
health care markets. Arrow (1963) has cleared up some of this ambiguity by pointing
out that medical care is a highly complex personal service, one for which there exists
considerable uncertainty surrounding quality. Accordingly, one hypothesis for the
prevalence of nonprofits in healthcare markets is that nonprofit ownership status
serves as a signal for quality in the presence of asymmetric information.
In this case, the non-distribution constraint implies nonprofit organizations face
little financial incentive to compromise the quality of care they provide when
consumers face asymmetric information.

This is in contrast to for-profit

organizations, which clearly confront financial incentives to engage in opportunistic
behavior, such as skimping on the quality of care they provide, when consumers are
imperfectly informed. Thus, economic theory suggests that an isolated nonprofit
healthcare organization may offer higher levels of quality than an otherwise
comparable for-profit organization.
While theory tends to be unambiguous in predicting that an “isolated” nonprofit
organization will produce medical care with higher quality and production costs than
an otherwise similar for-profit organization, both Hirth (1999) and Grabowski and
Hirth (2002) have pointed out that nonprofit and for-profit organizations rarely
operate in isolation; in fact, they often compete against one another in the same

4

market area. They hypothesize that competitive spillovers from nonprofits may lead
to a higher quality of care in for-profit organizations. In support of this theory, the
researchers find empirical evidence that an increase in nonprofit market share
improves for-profit, and overall, nursing home quality.
Grabowski and Hirth (2002), and much earlier, Tuckman and Chang (1988), also
note that competitive spillovers from for-profits may influence the behavior of
nonprofit organizations because competition from for-profit organizations may limit
the inefficiency of nonprofits. Inefficiency is limited because nonprofits have to be
more concerned with the costs of producing medical care when facing competition
from the more cost conscious for-profit organizations.1

Grabowski and Hirth

conclude (p. 19) that ‘If non-profits have a competitive advantage in
“trustworthiness” while for-profits have greater incentives for efficiency, intersectoral
competition can yield better outcomes than a market consisting exclusively of one
type of firm.’
Based upon the notion that a mix of for-profit and nonprofit organizations may
promote societal well being, this paper develops and conducts a unique empirical test
to assess the efficiency of the ownership mix in the typical hospital services market.
As previously discussed, the existence of both nonprofit and for-profit organizations
in a single market area can be expected to generate both social benefits and costs. By
empirically estimating the relationship between the nonprofit (or for-profit) market
share and the utilization of hospital services at the market level, we can infer the net
social benefit of additional nonprofit facilities. We discuss this in the next section of
this paper and also explain how we plan to conduct the empirical test. Section III

5

describes the data and sample used in the empirical analyses. Section IV presents the
empirical findings and the last section offers conclusions, caveats, and suggestions for
future research.

II.

Conceptual Model

The method we employ to test for the efficient mix of for-profit and nonprofit
hospitals in a geographical market is derived from Svorney (1987). Svorney
examined the role of professional interests in establishing physician licensure. She
argued that physician licensure potentially raises costs through higher wages because
it acts as an entry barrier, but, she emphasized, licensure may also provide greater
benefits in the form of quality assurance. The ultimate test of the efficiency of
professional licensure, she argued, depends on whether or not the favorable demand
response outweighs the undesirable supply response. For example, if the benefit of
quality assurance causes demand to increase more than higher wages cause supply to
decrease, then the utilization of physician services increases, and this reflects the net
social benefit that physician licensure offers.2 Hence, one may observe the impact of
a regulation (or type of institution) on the utilization of a particular good or service,
and from that draw an inference about its effect on economic efficiency.
In a similar vein, the efficiency of a mix of health care organizations with
different ownership forms may be analyzed in this manner. For example, and in the
context of this research, suppose we are comparing two similar hospital services
markets that differ in the following respect: market area “A” is completely dominated
by for-profit facilities whereas market area “B” is characterized by an equal

6

distribution of market shares across for-profit and nonprofit facilities. A graphical
exposition of this comparison is presented in figure 1 for a competitive marketplace.
[INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]
The curves DA and SA represent the demand and supply for hospital services in
market A (where for-profit facilities completely dominate). Notice that QA measures
the market clearing quantity of hospital services in market A.
Given the different mix of ownership structures, the markets are likely to differ in
two principle respects, ceteris paribus. First, a greater demand for hospital services
will exist in market area B because of the increased quality assurance resulting
directly (or indirectly) from the greater prevalence of nonprofit organizations. This
higher level of quality assurance is captured by demand curve DB in figure 1. Second,
the supply of hospital services may be lower in market area B because of the higher
production costs resulting from the diminished property-rights incentives from the
greater proportion of nonprofit hospitals operating in the market. Higher production
costs are reflected in supply curve SB in figure 1. Because the demand (quality
assurance) effect is assumed to be stronger than the cost effect in our example, the
equilibrium quantity of hospital services, QB, is greater in market B than in market A.
Whether or not the demand effect more than offsets the supply effect in the
typical market for hospital services is an empirical question that can be tested using
standard regression techniques. The test can be conducted by observing the impact
that the nonprofit (or for-profit) market share has on hospital care utilization, while
carefully controlling for a host of other supply and demand factors. Equation 1
represents the general reduced-form model used in the forthcoming statistical

7

estimations. In equation 1, Qi represents the equilibrium quantity of hospital care in
market i; NPSi represents the market share held by not-for-profit hospitals in market
i; 3 PSi stands for the market share held by public or government hospitals in market i;
D ji is a vector of j additional variables that are expected to influence the demand for

hospital care in market i; and S ki is a vector of k additional variables hypothesized to
affect the supply of hospital care in market i. The error term, µ i , is assumed to be
independent and normally distributed with constant variance and a mean of zero
(fixed effects in equation 1 have been suppressed for algebraic convenience).

The coefficients on the not-for-profit and public hospital shares reflect whether
the two ownership forms generate positive or negative net benefits at the margin. For
example, if β0 < 0 the benefit of quality assurance (i.e., demand increases) is less than the
costs resulting form the diminished property rights incentives (i.e., supply decrease). In
this case, the results would indicate that too many not-for-profits exist in the typical
market area. If β0 > 0, however, the opposite scenario holds. Finally, if β0 = 0 this
suggests that an efficient mix of not-for-profit and for-profit organizations exist in the
typical market area.4 The same logic holds for the public market share variable and the
coefficient β1.

III. Data and Empirical Test
In our test, the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was assumed to be a reasonable
approximation for the relevant geographical market (RGM) for hospital services. While
this definition of the RGM is not without its weaknesses (Dranove and White, 1994),
urban hospital markets are commonly defined in this manner for empirical research (e.g.,
Joskow, 1980; Manheim, Bazzoli, and Sohn, 1994; Spang, Bazzoli, and Arnould, 2001;
Douglas and Ryman, 2003). Only community hospitals were included in the analysis
because they provide a similar cluster of inpatient services and therefore operate in the
same relevant product market. Access to necessary data such as the uninsured rate, the
penetration rate of health maintenance organizations, and the Medicare managed care
penetration rate prevented us from extending the empirical analysis to all 320 MSAs in
the U.S. But the 90 MSA observations, for which we could obtain all of the required data,
account for 75 percent of the population in the U.S. The data used in our empirical
analyses are for the year 1999 and come from Health Forum (2002) and the Agency for
Health Care Research and Quality.5 Table 1 reports the mean value, standard deviation,
and data source for each of the variables used in our empirical analyses.
[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]
The conceptual model indicates that a measure of hospital care utilization, or
quantity, Qi , is necessary to conduct the test. We employed several measures of
utilization: number of admissions, inpatient beds, inpatient days, surgeries, outpatient
visits, and emergency room visits. All of these indicators were measured on a per capita
basis. Because good instruments are unavailable, we were unable to test and correct for
the possibility that the market shares based on ownership are endogenous from a market

9

perspective. While an endogenous market share is indeed a possibility, there are
nevertheless strong theoretical and institutional reasons to treat the hospital services
market shares based on ownership as being exogenous. Evidence suggests that these
market shares tend to change very little from one year to the next. In fact, Grabowski and
Hirth (2002) note that the relative share of nonprofit hospitals in different parts of the
country may be deeply rooted in historical factors such as the age of the city and different
patterns of voluntarism and charitable provision that have little to do with the advanced
technology and prevalence of third party payment that characterize the current health care
environment. However, as Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995) have shown, when faced
with the choice of using weak instruments and no instruments at all, the latter is often the
best empirical strategy because weak instruments may lead to large inconsistencies in the
IV-generated estimates.

Moreover, if endogeneity is present, IV estimates in finite

samples will still be biased in the same direction as OLS-generated estimates.
As previously mentioned, in an effort to isolate the impact of ownership mix on
efficiency, we must also control for other factors that could result in utilization
differences across market areas. Otherwise, the omission of variables that are correlated
with both ownership mix and the measures of output could lead us to draw incorrect
inferences from our empirical results. Following the conceptual model, these other
influences can be broken down into the aforementioned demand-side variables, D j and
supply-side variables S k .
Demand-side variables affecting hospital care utilization include indicators of
population size, population density, the age composition of the population, the level of
income and its distribution in the area, the presence and prevalence of disabilities among

10

the population, the percentage of uninsured individuals and the type of insurance
coverage (e.g., HMO penetration rate and Medicare managed care penetration rate),
competitiveness of the HMO insurance market, the availability of community health
centers as an alternative to hospitals, and environmental conditions (e.g., unemployment,
crime, and housing). These demand-side variables are intended to control for differences
in the willingness and ability to pay for hospital services across market areas. Supply-side
variables are fewer in number and include population density (as a proxy for the price of
land), the presence of non-teaching hospitals (as a surrogate for quality of care), and the
number of hospitals per capita. By construction, each measure of output, such as the
number of admissions per capita, captures the average amount observed for the typical
hospital in each MSA. Thus, the dramatic case-mix and quality of care differences
normally observed among hospitals within a given metropolitan area are likely to be
neutralized through the averaging process such that the average outputs are more similar,
in terms of quality and case-mix, across MSAs (Keeler and Ying, 1996). We also
controlled for individual state effects using a fixed-effects model specification to capture
any omitted variables that may vary systematically across states.

IV. Empirical Results
The multiple regression equations for the six different measures of output are estimated
by the ordinary least square procedure. White’s (1980) test did not detect the presence of
heteroscasticity. Each independent variable’s coefficient estimate and its corresponding tstatistic (in absolute terms) are reported in table 2. The six regression equations explain
between 48 and 80 percent of the variation in the various measures of output.

11

[INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]
Looking across the various columns, it can be noted that the coefficient estimates
on the not-for-profit and public hospital market shares are remarkably similar across the
six regression equations in terms of their signs and magnitudes. This finding suggests
that both types of nonprofit hospital organizations exert a similar marginal impact on
efficiency. More specifically, the coefficient estimates are negative on both the not-forprofit and public hospital market shares in five of the six equations. Recall that a negative
coefficient estimate indicates an overrepresentation of a particular type of hospital
ownership from an efficiency perspective. For two of the five equations, inpatient beds
and admissions, the coefficient estimates are statistically different from zero on the notfor-profit hospital market share and for three equation, inpatient beds, admissions, and
days, the coefficient estimates are statistically significant on the public hospital market
share. From an inpatient care efficiency perspective, these results suggest that not-forprofit and public hospitals may be overly dominant in the typical market area. That is,
more quality of inpatient care per dollar might be realized by somehow growing the
market share of for-profit hospitals.
However, notice in the outpatient visits equation that both the not-for-profit and
public hospital market shares possess positive and statistically significant parameter
estimates. Taken alone, this result suggests that not-for-profit and public hospitals should
participate more extensively in the outpatient care sector of the hospital industry because
they are underrepresented from an efficiency perspective. Our only reticence in drawing
this particular conclusion is that the measure of market share is based on hospital
admissions and not outpatient visits. Data limitations preclude us from constructing a

12

measure of market share based on other measures of output and, unfortunately, we do not
know the strength of the correlation between market shares based on inpatient admissions
and outpatient visits. However, considering that the outpatient facilities of hospitals often
compete with physician clinics that are organized on a for-profit basis, it may not be too
surprising that nonprofit organizations are underrepresented in the outpatient sector from
an efficiency perspective.
Assuming that our results for the outpatient visits equation are plausible, can we
draw any conclusion about the overall efficiency of the hospital ownership mix in the
typical MSA? We can if we know something about the relative value that society assigns
to the two types of hospital care. For instance, suppose we just focus on the regression
results for hospital admissions since they mirror the results for inpatient beds (as well as
inpatient days and surgeries but not as precisely). Using the coefficient estimates on the
not-for-profit (-0.68) and public (-0.70) shares in the inpatient admissions equation, it can
be determined that a one-percentage point increase in the shares of each type of hospital
will reduce the number of inpatient visits per 1,000 population by .68 and .70,
respectively. Evaluated at the sample mean for inpatient admissions (118 per 1,000
population), it follows that a one-percentage point increase in the two shares reduces
inpatient admissions by .57 and .59 percent.
Following the same procedure for outpatient visits, it can be determined that the
number of visits increases by .77 and .69 percent with respect to a one-percentage point
increase in the market share of not-for-profit and public hospitals. Thus, if society values
inpatient care and outpatient care equally, one might draw the conclusion that a greater
presence of not-for-profit and public hospitals would benefit society from an overall

13

efficiency perspective because the percentage gain in outpatient visits outweighs the
percentage loss in inpatient care. However, society most likely does not value equally
both types of hospital care. For one reason, many visits to the outpatient care facility of a
hospital are not the result of a life-threatening situation. In fact, notice in table 2 that the
market shares of not-for-profit and public hospitals are not statistically related to the
number of emergency room visits, a situation where the medical attention may be life
saving in nature.
Another reason why the two types of care cannot be treated equally is that
expenditures on inpatient care have tended to dwarf spending on outpatient care on a per
unit basis. In 2000, for example, outpatient revenues amounted to $6,177 per discharge
whereas inpatient revenues equaled $229 per visit.6 Using these values to weigh the loss
of inpatient admissions and gain of outpatient care resulting from a one-percentage point
increase in the market shares, it can be determined that the losses amount to $4,200 for
the not-for-profit share ($6,177 x 0.68) and $4,323 for the public hospital market share
($6,177 x 0.70). The corresponding benefits equal $3,073 ($229 x 13.42) and $2,792
($229 x 12.19). Thus, according to these calculations, a marginal expansion of the notfor-profit and public market shares would result in net social losses.

V. Conclusions
This paper offers a test of the efficiency of the ownership mix in various hospital services
markets across the U.S. When consumers lack sufficient information about hospital
quality, the general notion is that nonprofit organizations generate societal benefits by
offering (and signaling) quality assurance, but they may simultaneously result in higher
production costs because of less attention devoted to efficiency. The opposite scenario

14

holds for for-profit organizations. Thus, a mix of ownership types in the marketplace may
keep quality and costs under control as a result of competitive spillovers.
In this study we proposed that the efficiency of the ownership mix might be inferred
by viewing how the ownership mix affects utilization through the use of multiple
regression analyses. Our empirical results suggest that too many not-for-profit and public
hospitals may characterize the typical hospital services market of the U.S., at least in
1999. As a result, greater quality of care per dollar could possibly be achieved by
encouraging more for-profit hospitals to enter into some market areas of the U.S. Local
and state policy makers could attract more for-profit hospitals by offering inducements
such as zoning waivers and construction bond subsidies.
However, before policies of this kind are actually enacted it may be beneficial to
replicate this study by obtaining richer data and by using a much larger panel data set of
individual hospitals. Data of this kind are not available to us. A larger panel set would
allow the investigator to control for a large number of hospital-specific features by
employing fixed effects and may also permit some changes in the market shares of the
different types of hospitals over time. Lastly, a richer data set might allow market share
to be constructed with various measures of output or revenues involving inpatient and
outpatient care. At the very least, our study here provides an initializing template to help
organize and execute a more ambitious study on such an important and timely topic.

Endnotes
1

In recent work by Kessler and McClellan (2002) examining the hospital market, areas with a stronger
presence of for-profits have 2.4% lower overall expenditures, but virtually the same patient outcomes.
2

Svorney finds empirically that physician licensure leads to a reduced consumption of physician services.
That is, physician licensure increased entry costs (supply) by more than it increased consumer benefits
from quality assurance (demand). Thus her results provide support for the special interest theory of
physician licensure.
3

We categorize the difference types of hospitals based on ownership as private for-profit, private not-forprofit and public or government. Thus, the term “nonprofit” refers to both private not-for-profit and public
organizations in this paper.
4

In fact, an inverted U relationship might hold between each ownership market share and an output
measure. However, sufficient variation in ownership does not exist to map out an entire inverted U
relationship. We can only identify the direction of the slope.
