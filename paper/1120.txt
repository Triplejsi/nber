Balance of Payments

Financing and Adjustment

ABSTRACT

This paper explores some implications of the use of national

currencies as international reserves. First, a closed economy overlapping—generations model is developed to derive time—consistent tax
and inflation policies for a government that is financing a given

stream.of expenditures. Second, the effects of allowing a government
to hold a foreign currency as a reserve asset and to have its currency

held as a reserve asset abroad are considered. The use of national
currencies as currencies of denomination for international lending
creates an incentive for the governments whose currencies are used
to

alter their Inflation rates to extract resources from the rest

of the world. When reserves are constrained to be nonnegative the

use of national currencies

as international reserves raises the

rate In reserve issuing countries but does not effect
Inflation rate in reserve holders. The opposite result arises

With the decline in the role of gold in the international economy

the primary method that countries have used to finance payments imbalances
has been borrowing and lending denominated in terms of national currencies.

In the last century sterling was the primary reserve currency

while in this

century it has been the U.S. dollar. Recently the currencies of a number
of additional countries have emerged as international stores of values.
These currencies have also served as the primary currencies of denomination

of international loans. The introduction of Special Drawing Rights (SDR's)
constitutes an attempt to replace national nneys with an international
money for use as an international reserve. Its adoption thus far has
been only partial, however, and its value remains tied to that of national

currencies, In the absence Of a credible cOmmitment to a commodity
exchange standard such as the gold exchange standard, the value of assets
and liabilities denominated in national currencies has been subiec.t to the

political control of the governments and central banks issuing those

currencies. The use of these currencies to finance payments imbalances
will depend upon the expectations held by international transactors about
the strength of these institutions' commitment to maintain the real values
of their currencies,

Nevertheless, a currency's introduction into use as an international
store of value changes the context in which the issuers of currencies act.

First, the process whereby national currencies are distributed throughout

theworid economy requires an adjustment via

payments.itnbalances

that may.

have severe economic consequences for reserve issuers and holders alike.

Second the presence of large currency balances held outside the country

of

issue and of loans abroad denominated in local

currency has serious

2

implications for the effect of central bank policy on national welfare.
As a consequence, one might anticipate that being thrust Into the role
of a reserve issuer or international lender may significantly change the
issuing country's monetary policy.

It is widely recognized that the use of a currency as an inter—
national reserve and currency of denomination of international assets and

liabilities requires trust in the issuer's willingness and ability to
maintain the real value of its currency. Triff in's (1961) discussion

of thedollar problem emphasized that the U.S. dollar's widespread use
as a reserve currency could, by itself, undermine belief in its long—run

stability. The incentives facing a reserve Issuer to undermine the
value of its currency by inflation have been discussed by Mundell (1971)
and Calvo (1978).

The use of national moneys as international reserves raises a

number of questions: (i) What characteristics of a country make it
likely to emerge as a reserve issuer? (ii) How does becoming a
reserve issuer affect the inflation rate that is optimal from a national

perspective? (iii) If, in fact, the rate of return on a currency is
likely to fall if it is adopted as an international reserve, why are other
countries' central banks willing to hold this currency as a reserve if
they perceive this effect? and (iv) What are the costs and benefits of
becoming a reserve issuer and a reserve holder?
Our purpose ifl this paper is to develop a mode]. of the inter-

action of national. monetary policy and international reserves to answer

these questions. The issue is considered from the perspective of both

3
reserve issuers and reserve holders.

To understand how the use of national moneys as international

reserves affects the conduct of monetary policy, one needs to specify
the objectives of the government and the technology and preferences

of the private sector. To generate a demand for currency at the
national level, the exact consumption loan model of Samuelson (1958) is

adopted. While this framework is very simple and highly stylized, it does
generate a demand for money based directly on an underlying technology

and individual preferences. Precise welfare comparisons across regimes
are therefore possible,1

We assume that the government of each country must meet an exogen-

ous level of government spending each period. This expenditure may

be

financed via a nondistortionary tax imposed on the current younger

generation or by monetary issue. The government's objective is to
waximize a weighted average of the lifetime utilities of all generations
of its citizens.

Section I of the paper presents a closed—economy version of the

nxdel, The tax rate and inflation rate that obtain in each period reflect
the government's weighting of the younger and older generations currently

alive, The greater the weight placed on the older generation, the lower
the inflation rate, and conversely. Only when equal weight is placed on
the representative member of each generation alive does the steady—state
rate of return on money balances equal the growth rate, achieving the golden

rule. Otherwise, the lifetime utility of the representative citizen in the
steady state is below the maximum possible level. When, in fact, this Is

4

due to a rate of return on currency below the growth rate (when the govern—

Tnent places greater weight on the utility of the younger generation), the
outcome is not Pareto efficient. The problem arises because the government

in

any given period cannot credibly commit itself or its successor in the

next period to avoid inflating the currency at a faster rate, thereby
reducing the rate of return on savings to the current younger generation.
It constitutes an example of the problem of the time inconsistency of
optimal policy discussed by Kydland and Prescott (1977).

•Section II introduces foreign reserves into the ndel. It incorporates both domestic holdings by the government of foreign currency

and foreign holdings of domestic currency. We assume that reserve holders
take current and future returns on foreign currencies as given, anticipating
them correctly,and that reserve issuers take current and future holdings

by foreigners of their currency as given, anticipating these correctly as

well. We show that holding a foreign currency as a reserve does not
affect the steady state inflation rate of the reserve holding country.

The demand for reserves depends not only upon the government's weighting
of the two generations currently alive but upon Its weighting of future

generations. When the government assigns future generations weights
that decline geometrically into the future, then foreign reserves are

demanded perfectly elastically at the rate of return on domestic currency.
When the government acts only in the interests of generations currently alive, the demand for reserves is also infinitely elastic, but at a

rate of return that is higher than that on domestic currency.

5

The rate of inflation in the reserve issuer is, however, affected

by changes in foreign holdings of domestic reserves. The effect of an
increasein foreign holdings on impact is ambiguous, but in the new steady
state, in which more reserves are held abroad, the rate of inflation in the
issuing country is necessarily higher.

Section III considers global equilibrium in a world in which
there are two types of countries, one characterized by a low inflation
rate under financial autarky and another by a high inflation rate under
financiai. autarky. We distinguish two cases, one in which gross
international lending is always denominated in the currency of the
lender, in which case reserves are constrained to be nonnegative, and
the opposite case in which borrowing Is always denominated in the

currency of the borrower. The two cases generate quite different
equilibria. Our model does not predict which type of equilibrium will
emerge, or if it will be an intermediate one. This paper suggests, however,
that a theory of default combined with an assumption of convertibility
niay be incorporated into the model to endogenize this decision.'

We show that when loans are denominated in the currency of

the borrower

countries with low rates of inflation under financial autarky become
borrowers, while countries with high inflation rates become lenders.
Becoming a borrower In Its own currency raises a country's steady—state

transition from one steady state to the other may be quite different,
however, with the reserve issuer experiencing a lower inflation rate along

the way. The opposite results with respect to inflation arise when loans
are denominated in the lender's currency. In this case, the high—inflation
countries lend to low—inflation ones in the former group's currencies.

loans then provide an incentive for lenders to lower their inflation
rates but have no effect on inflation in the second group. The average
These

world inflation rate is consequently lower in the long run.
Our model allows one to compute the welfare effects of trade in

reserves. We find that in

the

steady state,

the

utility of the representa-

is higher in lender countries but can be lower in borrower

countries. The effects on generations alive during the transition may be
quite different, however. The results thus suggest a justification for
attempts by some governments to prevent

reserve

their currencies from becoming

currencies.

Section IV discusses some possible extensions of our analysis that

we believe would be especially worthwhile. Each of the issues raised
here can potentially be analyzed in the framework we have developed, but they
lie beyond the scope of a single paper. Section V provides a suitmmary of

the major results.

7

I. The Closed Economy Model
We illustrate our points in a very simple model. Our point of
departure is the Samuelson (1958) exact consumption—loan model. Individuals
live two periods, earning income only in the first period and saving a

fraction of that income in order to consume in the second period. Individuals
who enter the labor force in period t earn, before tax, an exogenously given
in the first period of their lives, a fraction

amount

of which is

taxed by the government. Domestic government debt, which is assumed to be
nonetary, is the only asset available to individuals as a store of value.
Output is nonstorable.

We assume that the utility function of a representative individual
entering the labor force in period t is given by

— Ln

0 < 8

C + 8Ln

(1)

where C denotes consumption in the first period of life, t, when the
consumption when the individual is old,

individual is young, and

period t + 1. While the Bernoulli assumption is special it provides a
number of restrictions that simplify the analysis substantially. We will
discuss the implication of relaxing some of these assumptions later on.
Let

denote the price level in period t and let

denote the

real savings, and hence real money holdings at the end of period t of
an individual born in period t. In period t, then, the individual chooses

An Open Economy !bdel with Reserves

Consider now a situation in which the government of the country
being considered (i) has available to it a foreign money which can be
held as a reserve currency or (ii) finds that some of its money is held

abroad as a reserve currency. Denote foreign holdings of domestic money

denominated in domestic currency in period t as M and domestic holdings
of foreign currency denominated in foreign currency in period t as

(17)

One reason is that this country may be one of a large number of small

countries that hold this reserve currency, and its contribution to total
demand is negligible. We assume that this country anticipates perfectly
the actual rate of return on foreign currency.

68

If the rate of return on foreign reserves exceeds this level, demand will

grow to infinity and conversely. Thus, in the long run the demand for
foreign reserves is perfectly elastic at the rate of return (l+n) (8+6+86 )
68

This rate of return will exceed the return on domestic money, which remains
(1-n) •

Therefore a country in which the government maximizes the welfare

of only generations currently alive will not hold reserves unless the.

return strictly exceeds the rate of return on domestic currency. The reason

is that an unborn generation,

the younger generation in period t+l, will

share the return from an investment in reserves in period t with the younger

generation in period t. The myopic government weights only the second gain in
making its decision. Consequently, a higher rate of return is required for an
investment in reserves to appear worthwhile.

19

currencies, but which finds that foreign countries hold its currency as

a reserve. It is assumed that this country takes foreign holdings of its own

currency,

much as the steady—state change and may even rise. A permanent increase in reserves held abroad will consequently increase the permanent inflation rate, though
it

may iflitjallY lower the inflation rate.

This

section considers how the introduction of inter-

nationally held currencies will change the steady state of the-

world

economy. it focuses first on two extreme cases, one in which reserves
cannot be held in negative amounts and one in which reserves cannot

be held in positive amounts. The first case corresponds to one in which
loans are denominated in the borrower's currency and the second to one

in which they are denominated in the lender's currency. While the model
does not preclude a priori the possibility of two—way transfers of reserves,
attention will -focus

only on steady states in which net and gross

reserve positions are identical.
Nonnegative Reserves

The following proposition can now be established;

Proposition 2: In a steady state in which foreign reserves are held at a
positive, finite level, (i) type II (low—inflation) currency will be held by
type I (high—inflation) countries as a reserve, arid (ii) the rate of return on
type II currency will fall to ir1.

introducing reserves has raised inflation everywhere to the level in the

countries. The superscript

of return when international lending takes place. The reason is that type I
countries find type II currencies attractive at their autarky inflation

rates. An excess demand for these currencies will exist until the inflation
rate is driven up to the level in type II countries.

As type I countries

accumulate reserves, the increased reserves provide an incentive for
type II countries to inflate at a higher rate, imposing an inflation

tax on type I countries. Since the welfare of foreign holders of its
currency, as opposed to domestic holders, does not enter the reserve

issuers' objective functions, they are less constrained to maintain
low inflation rates.

These results suggest how introducing liabilities denominated in the

of introducing international reserves can be analyzed in terms

of our model. This paper will not attempt a thorough discussion but will

25
Thus,

the long—run effect of a move from reserve autarky to

trade in currencies raises steady—state welfare in the reserve—holding

countries but can lower steady—state welfare in the issuing countries.
The effects during the transition, however, may

go in the opposite

direction.
One

remaining

question is how much currency of a typical type II

international reserves will therefore be proportional to that country's
population.

Nonpositive

Reserves

The following proposition can also be established:

Proposition 3: In any steady state in which international borrowing

takes the form of issuing foreign—currency—denominated liabilities

at a finite, positive level, (i)

rises to 4. Thus, when positive, rather than

negative, reserve holdings are precluded, international financial

integration reduces, rather than increases, inflation. The reason is
that when countries lend in their own currency, rather than borrow by
issuing reserves denominated in their own

currency,

their

26
governments have an incentive to reduce, rather than to increase, their
inflation rates.

The welfare effects of international financial integration when

borrowing is foreign—currency denominated, both on impact and in the steady

state, can be analyzed as well. The effects are substantially similar, so
that issue will not be discussed here.
Relaxing the Nonegativity Constraints

If no constraint is imposed on the sign of reserve issue our model

an infinite number of solutions. While borrowing in both

markets, the possibility of outright default may place

on

such liabilities can occur without affecting the value of domestic

agents'savings.

As long as currency is internationally mobile, default on

domestic currency held abroad could only occur if domestic households were

defaulted upon as well. This ramification is likely to limit the incentive
of a national government to default o its domestic currency or to destroy
its value through inflation.

Introducing

a Nominal Interest Rate on Borrowing

It has been assumed that money pays a zero nominal rate of return.
Introducing a nonzero nominal

interest rate would not affect the results,

that the inflation rate would equal the nominal rate minus the
real rate of return derived here, Whatever nominal return a reserve
except

issuer offers its creditors ex ante, it determines the real rate of
return ex post through its inflation policy.

IV. Possible Extensions
This paper has developed a model for analyzing the effects of
introducing reserve currencies on inflation and welfare in the world

economy. In order to obtain concrete results the analysis has been kept very

simple. We conclude with a discussion of some issues that we believe are
of considerable interest that could be analyzed in terms of the framework

we develop

here.

Non—Bernoulli Preferences

The assumption of the model that utility is logarithmic in consumption

leads to savings behavior and private currency demand that is independent of

levels

the rate of return on the

currency. The analysis is enormously simplified

by this assumption. Alternative specifications would lead to much more
complicated responses to alternative policies. In particular, the effect
of expectations of future policy on the current private demand for currency

would have to be incorporated into the model. Introducing non—Bernoulli
preferences would consequently introduce a much richer set of dynamics
as well as an additional source of potential time inconsistency of optimal
policy.
Distortioriary Taxation

Our model assumes that the government has access to proportional

income taxes as a means of raising government revenue. Since income is
exogenous in our model, such taxes are nondistortionary. If taxes do, in
fact, impose an excess burden, then an additional role for seigniorage

arises, as an alternative distortionary source of revenue. Differences
in autarky inflation rates may then reflect differenct financing needs
among countries as well as different valuations of generations by govern—

ments. The role of• seigniorage as a form of optimal taxation in an open

2g
economy has been analyzed in a small, open economy context by Calvo (1978)
and Eaton (1982), but the role of reserves in redistributing tax burdens
internationally has yet to be studied.

Default Risk
Our model does not introduce formally the possibility of outright

default on foreign debt. The issue of default has by now been investigated
extensively. See, for example Eaton and Gersovitz (l981a, 1981b), Sachs
and Cohen (1982), or Kletzer (1982). One topic of potential interest

would be to integrate analytic models of default into our paper's
framework here. As suggested earlier, one important issue that such
research might shed light upon is the currency of denomination of
international debt.

Productive Capital

No role for productive capital exists in the model. The effects
of international capital market integration on the allocation of capital
has been analyzed in a nonmonetary overlapping generations model by

Buiter (1981). It would be of considerable interest to investigate how
the monetary phenomena considered here would interact with the inter-

national allocation of capital in the steady state, In particular, it
would he interesting to determine to what extent the trading of
monetary assets can substitute for trade in physical capital.
Uncertainty

Our model assumes perfect certainty. Introducing uncertainty
about future values of exogenous variables would provide insight Into a

29

number of issues. For example, the effects on uncertainty on the rates
of return of alternative currencies could be examined. Optimal reserve
portfolios could then be characterized,which could presumably include

more than one reserve held simultaneously. The role of government policy
in redistributing risk between generations domestically and the role of
reserves in reallocating risk internationally could be examined. Lapan
and Enders (1980), Aizenman (1981), and Eaton (1982) have considered the
implications of alternative exchange rate regimes for the International

allocation of risk. The implications of their analysis for reserve
positions in a multicountry context have yet to be drawn out.
Strategic Behavior
In

our model governments make decisions taking other countries'

inflation rates and reserve positions as given. While this assumption

30

V. Conclusion
The major conclusions of our analysis can be summarized in the
following

points:

(1) Under financial autarky, inflation rates in different countries
can be explained by their monetary authorities' attitudes toward the

welfare of the younger and older generations. The probl2m of time consistency

may

yield

an inflation rate that is not optimal.

(2) A government's demand for a foreign currency as a reserve
in the long run may be infinitely elastic at a rate of return that is
equal to or higher than the rate of return on that country's currency.

Holding a foreign currency as a reserve does not affect the steady—state
inflation rate of the reserve holder.

(3) The steady—state inflation rate of a country increases when
foreign demand for that country's currency as a reserve rises to a higher
permanent level.

(4) Trade in borrower—currency—denominated assets raises the
average steady—state world inflation rate, while trade in lender—currency—
denominated assets has the opposite effect.

(5) Trade in assets raises steady—state lifetime welfare in
reserve—holding countries but can lower

although

it in reserve—issuing countries,

the effect on the welfare of generations alive during the

transition from autaky to the new steady state may be reversed. Governments may therefore be justified In acting to prevent their currencies'
use as International reserves,

literature.

generally, as Kareken and Wallace (1981) have pointed out,
the multicountry model of the type we are dealing with is characterized

by multiple equilibria. The paper restricts its attention to equilibria
in which gross and net reserve positions are equal, and in which there is
either a nonnegativity constraint or nonpositivity constrain on reserve

positions. These restrictions identify a unique steady—state equilibrium.
