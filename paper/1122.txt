I. Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the determinants of

the cyclical variability of manufacturing investment. The prevailing "neoclassical" theory of investment developed by Jorgenson (1963). and extended by
Hall and Jorgenson (1961) •

Eisner

and Nadiri (1968) • and Pischoff (1971) among

others, does not provide a completely satisfactory explanation of the deter-

minants of business investment. The dissatisfaction with the estimated neoclassical investment equations is not based on the "fit" of these equations or

on shifts in these equations; rather, the problem arises from the difficulty

of interpreting the estimated distributed lags. Are we to interpret these
distributed lags as expectational lags, as delivery lags, or perhaps, more
likely, as some convolution of expectatioual and delivery lags?

An alternative approach to the estimation of investment equations uses
the q theory of investment Tobin (1969) which is based on the cost of adjustment literature developed by Eisner and Strotz (1963), Lucas (1967a, b). Gould

(1968). and Treadway (1969). fly explicitly modeling the costs of adjustment,

which give rise to distributed lagged responses of investment to various

shocks, we are led to a clearer distinction between the delivery and/or
adjustment lags on the one hand and expectational lags on the other hand. In
the estimated q model, the effects of all lagged variables on the expectations

of relevant future variables are captured by q. The effects of delivery lags
on investment would appear as a relation between investment and lagged expectations of q.

Although the q model appears attractive because it distinguishes delivery

lags from expectational lags, its empirical performance has not been that

—2—
impressive. Studies which regress investment on q [von Furstenberg (1977)

Summers (1981), Blanchard—Wyplosz (1981)] typically find that q does not
explain a large part of the variation in investment and that the unexplained

movement in q is highly serially correlated. However, these studies used
average q (the value of the firm divided by the replacement cost of its capi-

tal) rather than marginal q (the valuation of an additional unit of capital

relative to the cost of this capital). The advantage of using average q is
that it is based on market value data and relies on the market to calculate
the relevant expectations. The disadvantage1 of course, is that in situations

in which average q and marginal q differ, it is marginal q which is the
relevant determinant of investment.

In this paper we study the relation between marginal q and investment.
Because marginal q is not directly observable from asset market data, we must

construct a series for marginal q before relating investment to marginal q.
The construction of the marginal q series is a nontrivial task but provides us

with several interesting results, even before we relate marginal q to invest-

ment. There are two major problems involved in computing marginal q.

The

first problem is a standard conceptual question about the appropriate definitions of the cost of capital and marginal profit; we consider alternative sets

of assumptions about goods markets and financial markets and calculate a mar-

ginal q series for each set of assumptions. The second major problem is
technical: we have to compute the expectation of a present value of a stream
of marginal profits.

Since we treat as random the one—period discount fac-

tors, the calculation requires the computations of the sun

of

expected values

of products of random variables. A simp1e approach to this problem would be
to linearize the sum of the products of random variables and then calculate

—3—
its expected value. however, this linearization would not capture the effects

of any second—order (or higher) moments,

Because we thought that certain

co;A.1a11ccs might have important effects on marginal

.

ecided

to use a

quadratic rather than a linear approximation.

As mentioned above, the calculation of q provides interesting results
quite apart from any estimated relation between q and investment. The first
result is technical but of

some importance for future work. We find that

there is a negligible difference between the linear and quadratic approximation to q. That is, taking account of the relevant covariances has very lit—
tie effect on the calculation of q. The other two major results are substantive. We find that the cyclical movement in q is due less to movements in the

marginal profits of capital than to movements in the cost of capital. This
result is surprising in light of the fact that investment equations typically

derive more explanatory power from output or accelerator effects than from
cost of capital effects. The final result from the calculation of marginal q
is that the cost of capital component of q and the marginal profit component
arc highly positively correlated.

After constructing the marginal q series, we then investigate the relation between investment and marginal q. Although regressions of investment on

q are unlikely to be structural relations, they are a convenient way of sum-

marizing sample evidence. The main finding is that, as in the studies cited
above, q is generally a significant explanator of investment but leaves unex-

plained a large, serially correlated fraction of investment. Since our findings are so

similar

to the results obtained relating investment to average q,

we find little support for the view that the low explanatory power of average

q is due to the fact that average q is simply a poor proxy for the

—4—
theoretically more appealing marginal q. We find that output and profit vari-

ables still enter significantly when added to our investment equations. The

uniformity of results across our different sets of assumptions leads us to
conclude that our data are not sympathetic to the basic restrictions imposed
by the q theory, even extended to allow for — simple —

delivery

lags. \Vhether

the problem comes from the assumptions implicit in aggregation, the assumption
of homogeneous capital or the assumption of perfect capital markets is a question left for future research.

In section II we develop a model of the optimal investment behavior of a

firm and present an expression for marginal q.

We also discuss various

approximations to marginal q. After describing the construction of the data
in section III, we briefly discuss in section IV the estimation of the vector
autoregressions used for forecasting the cost of capital and the marginal pro-

fitability of capital. In section V we calculate marginal q under various
alternative sets of assumptions. We compare the linear and quadratic approximations to marginal q. and then compare the relative contribution of the cost
of capital variation and the marginal profit variation to the cyclical varia-

tions in q. After discussing the observed correlation of the two major components of q. we then present the standard errors of estimates of q. In sec-

tion VI, we examine the empirical relation between investment and our constructed series for marginal q. Concluding remarks are presented in section
VII.

under the fairly restrictive assumption of multiplicative uncertainty.

Marginal Profit

In order to measure the marginal profit of capital we need to make some
assumptions about technology and about the demand curves facing manufacturing

firms. We assume that capital is homogeneous and any technological progress
is disembodied so that the marginal profit

does not depend on the dates at

which capital was installed. We also assume that the production function is
linearly homogeneous in capital, investment, and the variable factors of product ion.

We have chosen to make two alternative assumptions about the demand
curves facing manufacturing firms. Our first assumption is that manufacturing

firms are perfectly competitive. That is. they are price—takers and face no
quantity constants in output markets or factor markets. Under these assumptions the marginal profit of capital M (u for unconstrained) is simply equal
to the average profit of capital.2 In this case.

true only if ac/ax is zero. However this restriction is not compatible
with the assumption that the production—cum—adjustment cost function is
linearly homogeneous in capital, investment and the variable factors of
production. Nonetheless we ignore the cyclical variations in ac/ax.

is the nominal price of capi-

tal.

The

alternative

assumption is that firms may have faced binding output

constraints during the sample period.

In this case, the marginal profit of

capital is equal to wage savings accruing to an additional unit of capital,
which is equal to the wage rate multiplied by the marginal rate of substitu-

tion of labor for capital. In general, calculations of a series of marginal
profits would require a complete specification of technology. Here we assume

that the production function is additively separable in capital and labor on
the one band and other factors of production on the other hand. Futhermore we
suppose that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, denoted.

by a, is constant.

In this case, marginal rate of substitution of labor for

capital is proportional to (L/(Pirt/Pt)Kt)°. Therefore, the after—tax marginal profit of capital, Mc(0) can, except for a constant of proportionality, be

von Furstenberg's q series because his series covers only the period 1953:1 to

1976:4. However, we followed his procedure to construct a similar average q

non—trivial, and I is a 28 x 28 matrix which is identically zero except for
the 7 x 7 matrix in the upper left corner.

A detailed discussion of the estimated parameters in the two vector
autoregressions would be of little interest; we simply note here that all of

the eigcnvalues of A lie well inside the unit circle.

first exponentially detrended.)

for each of six vector autoregressions. Three VAil's were run for each infor-

For each information set we ran 3 different VAt's

The two results worth noting are the consistently low It2 for Z1, the ex post

discount factor. The low fl2 for

is to be expected given the large move-

ments in stock prices and the resulting large rates of capital gain or loss.

capital variability positively or negatively correlated with the variations in
resulting from variability in expected marginal profits?

The Empirical Importance of the Quadratic Terms

quadratic terms Q(1.I) and Q(p.M) are not very important empirically. For

For this series, the standard deviations of Q(f34J) and

standard deviation of their sum is .0052, which is equal to 5.1% of the standard deviation of the full quadratic approximation.

The result that the quadratic approximation to

stantially from the linear approximation to

does not differ sub-

is important for future

research on investment and perhaps on asset prices in general. To be feasi-

ble, efficient methods of estimation of models under rational expectations
require these models to be linear or linearized. Our findings above suggest
that although the initial specification of

is highly nonlinear, a linear

approximation appears to be acceptable. in the remainder of this section, we
consider the linear approxinat...r. q + L(j3) + L(M)

and refer to it as linear

The Contributions of 13 and N to Variability of q

Our calculated q series exhibit variation over time because both the
discount factor 3 and the marginal profit M vary over time. Based on the fact

that most empirical studies of investment find a strong relation between
investment and some measure of output or profit, but find a weaker relationship between investment and the cost of capital, we expected to find most of
the variability in q would be due to variability in M rather than variability

in .

As explained below, we found the opposite to be true.

Recall that L(D) is the linear approxir't ion to the q series based on the

assumption that only

varies over time and that P1 remains constant. Simi-

larly LU!) is the linear approximation to the q series based on the assumption

that the cost of capital f3 remains constant and only the marginal profit M
varies over time. The standard deviations of L(D) and LU!) are presented in
columns one and two, respectively, of Table 2. In every one of the 12 cases
in Table 2, we find that the standard deviation of L() exceeds the standard

— 18 —

of

LU!); often the difference is quite substantial. In general, we find that

calculating the q series under the assumption that

is constant will reduce

the standard deviation of the q series by a factor of 2 or 3. This result
contrasts sharply with our a priori beliefs expressed above.

The finding that the standard deviation of q is reduced by a factor of 2
or 3 when we suppress the variation in the discount factor may shed some light

on volatility tests of asset pricing models. These volatility tests are based

on the assumption that, for instance, stock prices are equal to the expected

present value of dividends. Using this assumption, and the assumption that
the discount factor is constant, one derives a relation between the variability of dividends and the variability of stock prices. Typically, actual stock

prices exhibit much greater variability than implied by variability in dividends, holding the discount factor constant. Our findings indicate that, in a

different context, constraining the discount factor to be constant leads one
to understate the standard deviation of the expected present value series by a

factor of 2 or 3. That is, the assumption of a constant discount factor is
far from innocuous.

The correlation of L() and L(M) is presented in the third column of
Table 2.

In every one of the 12 cases presented in Table 2, L(p) and L(M)

have a positive correlation, and in 10 of the 12 cases the correlation exceeds
.75.

Thus we find that L(I3). L(M) and by implication q, move cyclically

together. That is, periods in which the sequence of expected marginal products is high tend to be periods in which the sequence of expected discount
factors is high, or equivalently, periods in which the sequence of eipected
costs of capital is low. As will be showi below, this does not imply that the

one—period expected discount factor moves cyclically with L(iI).

(Note that since 13

initially thought, that this finding might be a spurious result which is a

To make the point more generally, we observe that over the entire sample

period, the correlation of the cx post rate of return, s_i' with the cx ante

rate of return, 3. is 0.46 and the correlation of _i and L(P) is —0.06.
In addition, the correlation of

the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters of A. we can calculate the
variance of the expression in (21). (See Appendix B). Thus we can compute the

VI. The a Series and Investment

The motivation for the construction and analysis of a series for marginal

q is that it should be the major determinant of the rate of investment. As
explained earlier, equation (Sa) implies that the optimal rate of investment
is an increasing function of q. If in addition we assume that

is a

linearly homogeneous function, then the optimal decision rule for investment

can be expressed as a positive relationship between the investment capital
ratio, Tt/Kt. and marginal qy

where

is the tax—adjusted price of capital5 which depends on the investment

tax credit, the present value of depreciation deductions and the price of cap-

ital; a(L) and p(L) are distributed lag operators. The specification in (22)

differs from the investment rule in (5a) in three ways: (1) we have included
the tax factor

which recognizes that the investment tax credit and depreci-

ation deductions reduce the effective price of new capital goods; (2) we have

allowed for the disturbance term

to be serially correlated; (3) we have

included lagged values of Sq on the right hand side. One should not interpret

the lagged values of Sq as representing the effects of delivery lags. However, we included lagged values

to make our investment specification com-

parable to specifications using current and lagged values of marketvalue
based average q. Thus, these regressions should not be viewed as structural
relations but rather as a convenient way of examining sample correlations.

The first and fourth columns of Tables 5a and 5b present the regressions

of I/K on current and lagged

for various information sets (0LqS) and

values of a (0.3. 0.5). These 4 columns all lead to the same results.

In all cases, the various q variables leave unexplained a large and

serially correlated residual which is fairly well approximated by a second—
order autoregressive process. Finally, the implied elasticities of I/K with
respect to current and lagged q are roughly 0.1 to 0.3.

The results of regressing I/K on our constructed series for marginal q
are remarkably similar to the results obtained using average q measures based

on asset market valuation of firms. The fact that both types of measures of

q, which are constructed in very different manners, leave large serially
correlated residuals in investment suggests that there may be other important

factors which are not captured by q. We chose to consider the output/capital
ratio (measured by Z4) and profit per unit of capital (measured by Z4—Z3).

Tables 5a and 5b present the regressions in which lagged values of Z4 and

(Z4—Z3) are added to the specification in (22). To avoid obvious simultaneity
problems, and because

not structural equations but are merely a convenient form in which to present
sample correlations. We find that in all cases, the output or profit variable

is significant. That is, it appears that output or profit has an effect on
investment beyond any effects which work through marginal q.

We return now to the question of delivery lags and the lagged expecta-

tions of q.

If a type of capital requires n periods for delivery, then

investment orders at time t would depend on E(q*la1). Investment expenditures at time t would depend on investment orders from time t—n to t, and

thus on E(q*

The calculation of E[q*IL3_] is particularly simple for q measured by

where y and c are the scalar and vector constants described below equation
(21). We have calculated these lagged expectations of q and have regressed

I/K on them. However, these lagged expectations of q proved much less suc-

cessful than lagged values of q: E(q*Ifl_1) generally had a negative and
often significant coefficient; E(q*Ic_2) and E(qIfl_3) generally had positive but insignificant coefficients. Further research is required in order to
combine the q theory and delivery lags in an empirically satisfactory manner.

VII. Concluding Remarks

The research reported in this paper can be divided into two parts: first
we calculated and analyzed the properties of series for marginal q calculated
under a variety of assumptions; then we examined the relation between invest-

ment and our various q series.

The major finding of the first part of the

paper is that more than half of thc yciical variation (as measured by the
standard devta;ion) of marginal q is accounted for by variation in the ex ante

cost of capital. This finding appears to be rather robust: it holds for each
of our 12 sets of assumptions which are based on alternative information sets,

alternative measures of the marginal profitability of capital and alternative

shares of equity in total financing. As explained earlier, this finding that
variation in discount factors accounts for a substantial fraction of the vari-

ation in a present value series has implications for the variability of asset
prices in general.

Although the first part of the paper succeeded in finding a large contri-

bution of cost of capital variability to the cyclical variability of q, the
link between investment and the cyclical behavior of the cost of capital is

more tenuous because of the relatively poor performance of q in explaining

— 25 —

investment. There is a long list of potential culprits. The first is aggregation problems.

The second is the specification of technology and the

assumption of homogeneity of capital. The third is the assumption of perfect

financial markets and the absence of "liquidity constraints' for firms.
Prosecution and indictments are left for future research.
