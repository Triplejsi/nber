The Tactical and Strategic Value of Commodity Futures

ABSTRACT
Historically, commodity futures have had excess returns similar to those of equities. But what should
we expect in the future? The usual risk factors are unable to explain the time-series variation in
excess returns. In addition, our evidence suggests that commodity futures are an inconsistent, if not
tenuous, hedge against unexpected inflation. Further, the historically high average returns to a
commodity futures portfolio are largely driven by the choice of weighting schemes. Indeed, an
equally weighted long-only portfolio of commodity futures returns has approximately a zero excess
return over the past 25 years. Our portfolio analysis suggests that the a long-only strategic allocation
to commodities as a general asset class is a bet on the future term structure of commodity prices, in
general, and on specific portfolio weighting schemes, in particular. In contrast, we provide evidence
that there are distinct benefits to an asset allocation overlay that tactically allocates using commodity
futures exposures. We examine three trading strategies that use both momentum and the term
structure of futures prices. We find that the tactical strategies provide higher average returns and
lower risk than a long-only commodity futures exposure.

1. Introduction
Historically, investing in commodity futures appears to have been as rewarding as investing
in equities. Figure 1 shows that, since 1969, the 12.2% compound annualized return of the
Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) compares favorably with an 11.2% return for the
Standard and Poor’s 500. In fact, the compound return on a rebalanced portfolio of 50% stocks
and 50% commodity futures has historically outperformed both stocks and commodity futures
with a significantly lower standard deviation of return.i However, it is often dangerous to
extrapolate past performance into the future.ii Arnott and Bernstein (2002) point out that the past
high excess returns for U.S. equities do not make the case that the forward looking equity risk
premium is high.iii Dimson, Marsh and Staunton (2004) present a similar case for global equities,
and challenge the value of conclusions based on the performance of any single country. If history
is an incomplete guide to investment prospects, what is the benefit to investing in commodity
futures? To answer this question, it is necessary to create a framework for thinking about the
prospective return from a commodity futures investment and analyze the role that commodity
futures play in strategic and tactical asset allocation.

2. Commodity indices and constituents
2.1 Three benchmark commodity indices
The usual way to compare the performance of commodity futures to other assets is to examine the
performance of a fully collateralized, unlevered, diversified commodity futures index. A
collateralized index provides the return of a passive long-only investment in commodity futures
contracts such as wheat, gold, oil and copper. In making a fully collateralized commodity futures
investment, an investor desiring $1 of commodity futures exposure would typically go long a
commodity futures contract and invest $1 of “collateral” in a “safe” asset such as a Treasury bill.
The three most commonly used commodity futures indices are the Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index (GSCI)iv, the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index (DJ AIG)v, and the ReutersCRB Futures Price Index (CRB).vi Figure 2 shows that the GSCI represents 86% of the combined
open interest of the three indices, with the DJ AIG accounting for 10% of open interest and the
CRB making up the remaining 4% of open interest.

Figure 3 shows that the three commodity indices have experienced different levels of return
and volatility. The GSCI has twice the volatility of the CRB commodity index during the
common time period for all three indices.vii The DJ AIG Commodity Index and the GSCI have
average returns similar to the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index and the CRB has a return similar to
three-month Treasury bills, underperforming the Lehman Aggregate by 4% per annum.
Surprisingly, the CRB index has a lower correlation with the GSCI (0.66 ) than the Wilshire 5000
has with the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index (0.70 ). The low correlation of
U.S. equity returns and non-U.S. equity returns can be explained by the generally nonoverlapping
composition of these equity portfolios. But this is not the case for commodity futures.

2.2 Benchmark constituents and weighting
The relatively low correlation can be explained by the different weighting of individual
commodity futures contracts in each of the indices. As Table 1 shows, the GSCI currently invests
in 24 underlying futures contracts, the DJ AIG index invests in 20 and the CRB index invests in
17 different futures contracts. The GSCI is heavily skewed towards energy exposure because its
portfolio weighting scheme is based on the level of worldwide production for each commodity.viii
The DJ AIG Commodity Index focuses primarily on futures contract liquidity data, supplemented
with production data, as well as limits on maximum exposures to determine portfolio weights.ix
The CRB index is an equally weighted index.x

There is an important difference between the weighting schemes of commodity indices
versus stock and bond indices. Most stock and bond market indices use market capitalization
weights. While there may be a debate as to what measure of stock or bond market capitalization
to use (total market capitalization or some float or liquidity adjusted measure), market
capitalization weights are seemingly objective. However, there is no market capitalization for
commodity futures. In fact, as Black (1976) pointed out, since there is always a short futures
position for every long futures position, the market capitalization of commodity futures is always
zero. The CRB index employs equal weights. In contrast, the GSCI uses “production” weights.
These weights are determined annually by calculating the annual production for each commodity,
averaging the production values over five years and then weighting each commodity relative to
the sum of all the production values. Portfolio weights for the DJ AIG index are rebalanced every
year using a combination of production weights and liquidity considerations. Liquidity-based
portfolio weights emphasize storable commodities, such as gold, and production based portfolio
weights emphasize non-storable commodities, such as live cattle and oil.

2.3 Interpreting the historical performance
The differing approaches to weighting complicate the historical analysis. In addition, it is also the
case that the performance histories of commodity futures indices are longer than the trading
histories of the indices. However, in making strategic asset allocation decisions, many investors
will use the complete history of returns – even if some of the history is backfilled. For these
commodity indices with subjective choices of weights, one needs to exercise caution. For
instance, the GSCI has been traded since 1992, yet its performance history was backfilled to
1969. From 1969 to 1991, the GSCI had a compound annual return of 15.3%, beating the 11.6%
return for the S&P 500. From 1991 to May 2004, the compound annualized return of the GSCI
was 7.0% and the S&P 500 had a return of 10.4%. Is it possible that the GSCI weights were
determined with an eye towards creating an index that outperformed stocks and to enhance the
ability of Goldman Sachs to convince investors of the appeal of commodity futures investment?
The historical performance of the DJ AIG index potentially suffers from similar construction bias
since it has been traded since 1998 but its history goes back to 1991. From the inception of the
performance history of the DJ AIG Commodity Index to its first trade date in July of 1998, the
AIG index had a compound annualized return of 4.1% while the GSCI only had a return of 0.5%.
Is it possible that the DJ AIG index was created with an emphasis on demonstrating hypothetical
historical outperformance relative to the GSCI and to respond to some investors concerns about

6

the high energy weighting. The CRB index's performance history commences in 1982 and the
futures contracts first started trading in 1986. For each of these indices, the returns since trading
actually started are tangible while the pre-trading returns are to some degree hypothetical.
Table 2 looks at the historical excess returns of the overall GSCI, five GSCI sectors, and
twelve individual constituents of the GSCI. We begin the analysis in 1982 because (a) the GSCI
is currently an energy oriented commodity index, (b) energy futures are a large part of all futures
open interest, and (c) the first energy futures contract entered the GSCI in January of 1983.xi
Over this sample, the GSCI has a compound annualized excess return of 4.49%, higher than the
3.45% excess return for the Lehman Aggregate bond index and lower than the 7.35% excess
return for the S&P 500. The energy sector of the GSCI provides a return of 7.06% and the nonenergy sector had a return of -0.12%. Among the twelve individual commodities, heating oil has
an annual return of 5.53% and silver has a return of -8.09%. An initially equally weighted buyand-hold portfolio experiences an average annual return of 0.70%, an equally weighted, monthly
rebalanced, portfolio has an average annual return of 1.01% and the equally weighted average of
the twelve individual commodity returns is -1.71%. The difference in return between the GSCI
and these three averages reflects the significant energy exposure of the GSCI.

2.4 The correlation of constituents
Our initial analysis of the data raises an interesting point: the average commodity futures contract
has a return that is close to zero (-1.71%) yet there is substantial dispersion of individual
commodity futures returns about this average.
Table 3 shows that the average level of commodity return correlations is low. Heating oil
and silver excess returns are essentially uncorrelated (0.02). The average correlation of the twelve
commodity futures returns with the GSCI is 0.13. The average correlation of individual
commodities with one another is only 0.09. For instance, heating oil’s average correlation with
the other eleven commodities is 0.03, its highest correlation of 0.15 is with gold and its lowest
correlation of -0.07 is with coffee. The average correlation of the commodity sectors (energy,
livestock, agriculture, industrial metals and precious metals) with the GSCI is 0.33. However, this
correlation is driven by the 0.91 correlation between the overall GSCI and the energy sector.

3. Models of expected returns
Most previous research has focused on the expected returns of a commodity index, without
considering the expected returns for the portfolio constituents. We will consider both.

3.1 Decomposition of the index return
The total return on a diversified cash collateralized commodity futures portfolio can be
decomposed into three components:
Commodity Portfolio Total Return = Cash Return + Excess Return + Diversification Return

9

The excess return is simply the change in the price of a futures contract. If, for instance, an
investor purchases a gold futures contract for $400 an ounce and later sells the contract for $404
an ounce, the excess return on this position would be 1%. The diversification return is a
synergistic “the whole is greater than the sum of the parts” benefit attributable to portfolio
rebalancing. For a portfolio consisting of two or more assets, a diversification return simply
means that the compound return of a fixed weight portfolio will be greater than the weighted
average of the compound returns of the individual investments. The diversification return is due
to the reduction in variance as investors form diversified portfolios.xii
Regardless of the model for expected excess returns of the components, Greer (2000) and de
Chiara and Raab (2002) show that commodity futures indices might have expected returns similar
to equities. The ongoing process of rebalancing investments in a commodity futures index can be
a significant source of return. We explore the diversification return in more detail in section 3.5.

3.2 The CAPM perspective
Lummer and Siegel (1993) and Kaplan and Lummer (1998) argue that the long-run expected
return of an investment in the GSCI should be similar to that of Treasury bills. For the cash
collateralized GSCI, this is equivalent to saying that the expected excess return should be zero.
Given that commodities tend to have low correlations with other commodities as well as with
stocks and bonds, this view is consistent with analysis of Dusak (1973) who documents low betas
and low expected returns in the context of the Capital Asset Pricing Model of Sharpe (1964) and
Lintner (1965).
There is considerable evidence that a multifactor model is needed to explain the crosssection and time-series of asset returns. In section 3.5, we explore the role of unexpected inflation
as well as a five factor model.

3.3 The insurance perspective
Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2004) point out that Keynes’ (1930) theory of normal backwardation,
in which hedgers use commodity futures to avoid commodity price risk, implies the existence of a
commodity futures risk premium. If this risk premium is large enough, then returns could be
similar to that of equities.

10

Keynes (1930) advanced the theory of normal backwardation in which he suggested that the
futures price should be less than the expected future spot price. If today’s futures price is below
the future spot price, then as the futures price converges towards the spot price at maturity, excess
returns should be positive. Keynes' insight was that commodity futures allow operating
companies to hedge their commodity price exposure, and since hedging is a form of insurance,
hedgers must offer long-only commodity futures investors an insurance premium. Normal
backwardation suggests that, in a world with risk-averse hedgers and investors, the excess return
from a long commodity investment should be viewed as an insurance risk premiumxiii. Under
normal backwardation investors who go long commodity futures should receive a positive risk
premium, a positive excess return, and it is for this reason that normal backwardation provides a
rationale that a long-only portfolio of commodity futures is an efficient way to allocate capital.
Normal backwardation should also affect the cross-section of commodity futures excess
returns. That is, a more normally backwardated commodity future should have a higher return
than a less normally backwardated commodity future. However, since it is impossible to know
what the expected future spot price is, normal backwardation is unobservable. Normal
backwardation is primarily a belief that long-only investors in commodity futures should receive
a positive excess rate of return. In spite of the ex ante nonobservability of normal backwardation,
positive excess returns should be a good ex post indicator of the existence of normal
backwardation. To test for a normal backwardation risk premium, Kolb (1992) looked at twentynine different futures contracts and concluded that “normal backwardation is not normal”.
Specifically, he noted that nine commodities exhibited statistically significant positive returns,
four commodities had statistically significant negative returns and the remaining sixteen
commodity returns were not statistically significant. Table 2 seems to support Kolb’s earlier
finding. However, as Ibbotson and Kaplan (2000) show, a satisfactory understanding of asset
returns requires an examination of the cross-section of returns, the time series of returns and the
level of returns.

3.4 The cross-section of commodity returns
3.4.1 Hedging pressure
Is there an explanation for the lack of empirical support for the theory of normal backwardation?
Cootner (1960) and Deaves and Krinsky (1995) note that Keynes’ theory of normal
backwardation assumes that hedgers have a long position in the underlying commodity and that

11

they seek to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations by short selling commodity
futures. As a result the futures price is expected to rise over time, providing an inducement for
investors to go long commodity futures. They suggest that both backwardated commodities,
where the spot price is greater than the futures price, and contango commodities, where the spot
price is less than the futures price, might have risk premia if backwardation holds when hedgers
are net short futures and contago holds when hedgers are net long futures. Bessembinder (1992)
finds substantial evidence, over the time period 1967 to 1989, that average returns for sixteen
nonfinancial futures are influenced by the degree of net hedgingxiv. In other words, commodities
in which hedgers were net short had, on average, positive excess returns and commodities in
which hedgers were net long had, on average, negative excess returns.
De Roon, Nijman and Veld (2000) analyze twenty futures markets over the period 1986 to
1994 and find that hedging pressure plays an important role in explaining futures returns. Anson
(2002) distinguishes between markets that provide a hedge for producers (backwardated markets),
and markets that provide a hedge for consumers (contango markets). He points out that a
commodity producer such as Exxon, whose business requires it to be long oil, can reduce
exposure to oil price fluctuations by being short crude oil futures. Hedging by risk averse
producers causes futures prices to be below the expected spot rate in the future. Alternatively, a
manufacturer such as Boeing is a consumer of aluminum, it is short aluminum, and it can reduce
the impact of aluminum price fluctuations by purchasing aluminum futures. Hedging by risk
averse consumers causes futures prices to be higher than the expected spot rate in the future. In
this example , Exxon is willing to sell oil futures at an expected loss and Boeing is willing to
purchase aluminum futures at an expected loss. Alternatively, investors receive a risk premium, a
positive excess return, for going long backwardated commodity futures and for going short
contangoed commodity futures. This suggests that a portfolio that goes long backwardated futures
and short contangoed is an attractive way to allocate capital. The losses incurred by the hedgers
provide the economic incentive for the capital markets to provide price insurance to hedgers.
Both of these examples highlight a view that commodity futures are a means of risk transfer and
that the providers of risk capital charge an insurance premium.

3.4.2 The term structure of futures prices and the ‘roll’ return
The term structure of futures prices depicts the relationship between futures prices and the
maturity of futures contracts. Figure 4 illustrates the term structure of futures prices for crude oil

12

and gold at the end of May 2004xv. The futures price for crude oil declines as the time horizon
increases, from a price of $40.95 per barrel of oil in for the July 2004 futures contract to a price of
$36.65 for the June 2005 futures contract. This is an example of market backwardationxvi, in
which the futures price for a commodity is lower than the current spot price. Typically, the
current spot price is the futures contract with the shortest time to maturity, the nearby futures
contract. In this example, the futures price for gold increases as the time horizon increases. This
relationship is known as contango. An upward or downward sloping term structure of futures
prices creates the possibility of a futures price “roll return”xvii. For instance, in this example, the
futures price of oil in July 2005 was $36.65 and the July 2004 price was $40.95. If the term
structure of oil remained unchanged, then the roll return from buying the July 2005 oil contract
would be 13% ($40.95/$36.65 -1 = 13.1%). For gold, assuming no change in the term structure of
gold futures prices, the roll return would have been -1.4% ($398.3/404-1 = -1.4%). Another way
of looking at this is as follows: the term structure of commodity futures prices may provide
hedgers with a convenient way to determine the expected price of commodity price insurance.

Figure 5 shows that, since 1982, the excess return for heating oil futures was 5.5% per
annum. The excess return consists of a spot return and a roll return. The spot return is the change
in the price of the nearby futures contract. Since futures contracts have an expiration date
investors who want to maintain a commodity futures position have to periodically sell an expiring
futures contract and buy the next to expire contract. This is called rolling a futures position. If the
term structure of futures prices is upward sloping, an investor rolls from a lower priced expiring
contract into a higher priced next nearest futures contract. If the term structure of futures prices is
downward sloping, an investor rolls from a higher priced expiring contract into a lower priced
next nearest futures contract. This suggests that the term structure of futures prices drives the roll
return. For heating oil the spot return was about 0.9% and the roll return was about 4.9%. The roll
return was positive because the energy markets are typically, but not always, in backwardation.
The excess return for gold futures was about -5.7% per annum, the spot price return was -0.8%

14

Gold price ($/Troy ounce)

Crude Oil

and the roll return was about -4.8%. The roll return was negative because the gold futures market
is almost always in contango. The average spot return of heating oil and gold futures was close to
zero. The 11.2% excess return difference between heating oil and gold was largely driven by a
9.5% difference in roll returns. The 1.7% difference in spot returns was a relatively minor source
of the overall return difference between heating oil and gold. This example illustrates that excess
returns and spot returns need not be the same if roll returns differ from zeroxviii.

3.4.3 Implications for asset allocation
How important have roll returns been in explaining the cross-section of individual
commodity futures excess returns? Figure 6 shows the historical relationship between excess
returns and roll returns for individual commodities. Three commodities (copper, heating oil, and

15

live cattle) had, on average, positive roll returns and positive excess returns. Corn, wheat, silver,
gold and coffee had, on average, negative roll returns and negative excess returns. The average
excess return for the positive roll return commodities was 4.2% and the average excess return for
the negative roll return commodities was -4.6%. The almost 9% excess return difference between
the positive roll return portfolio and the negative roll return portfolios consists of a 7.5%
difference in roll returns and a 1.4% difference in spot returnsxix. Roll returns explain 91% of the
cross-sectional variation of commodity futures returns in Figure 6.
Long-only normal backwardation suggests that commodity futures excess returns should be
positive, for both backwardated and contangoed commodity futures. In fact, Gorton and
Rouwenhorst (2004) suggest that under normal backwardation there should be no relationship
between the term structure of commodity futures prices and the returns from investing in
commodity futures. Under normal backwardation, what matters is the degree of normal
backwardation, which, unfortunately, is unobservable ex ante. Normal backwardation suggests
that all of the observations in Figure 6 should lie in the northeast and the northwest quadrants.
The hedging pressure hypothesis is consistent with the observation that excess returns are
positively correlated with roll returns and that backwardated commodity futures should have
positive returns and contangoed commodity futures should have negative returns. Figure 6 does
not, therefore, empirically provide any support for long only normal backwardation. Figure 6
challenges the relevance of normal backwardation as an explanation of actual commodity futures
returns.
Roll returns are a major driver of the cross-section of realized commodity futures excess
returns. Realized commodity futures returns have two components: the expected price of
insurance and the unexpected price of insurance. Roll returns represent the expected price of
insurance. As Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2004) note, unexpected price deviations, which represent
the unexpected price of insurance, are unpredictable and should average out to zero over time. It
is interesting that over a very long time period, the expected price of insurance has been the
dominant driver of long-term commodity futures returns and that unexpected returns have played
a secondary role. The regression intercept of 0.89% in Figure 6 seems to suggest that if the term
structure of commodity prices was flat, that is if prices were the same for each futures maturity,
then roll returns and excess returns would be close to zero. Further examination of the data also
reveals that the roll return accounts for more than half of the excess return level of the GSCI
(2.59% of the 4.49% excess return) and more than three quarters of the equally weighted twelve
commodity average excess return.

Compound Annualized Roll Return

The term structure of futures prices may reveal information about whether suppliers of
commodity price insurance should expect a positive rate of return. If unexpected price changes
average to zero over time, then going long a commodity futures in a backwardated market
supplies price insurance and going short a commodity futures in a contagoed market supplies
commodity price insurance. Similarly, going short a backwardated commodity futures, or going
long a contangoed commodity futures, is similar to buying insurance. If there is a long-term
return from investing in commodity futures, it will be from providing insurance, not from buying
insurance. If positive returns only accrue to buyers of insurance ultimately there will be no
providers of insurance. In the context of the insurance explanation, it is not surprising that the
term structure of futures prices is a significant driver of the cross-section of commodity futures
returns. This insight will be important for both strategic and tactical asset allocation.

17

3.5 Time-series variation in commodity futures returns
We now consider multifactor models of commodity futures returns. However, first we explore the
conventional wisdom that commodity futures provide good inflation hedges.

3.5.1 Inflation hedges – but what component of inflation?
Over the 1970 to 1999 period, Greer (2000) shows that the Chase Physical Commodity Index had
a time series correlation of 0.25 with the annual rate of inflation and a time series correlation of
0.59 with the change in the annual rate of inflation. Strongin and Petsch (1996) find that the GSCI
does well during periods of rising inflation (especially relative to stocks and nominal bonds).
First, we need to explore the relation between the components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
and the components of commodity futures indices.

Figure 7 shows two ways of categorizing the components of the CPI. Commodities have
about a 40% weight in the CPI and services have a 60% weight. Energy commodities make up
only about 4% of the CPI, food commodities constitute about 14% of the CPI and other
commodities account for the remaining commodity exposure of the CPI. It is clear that a broadbased commodity futures index excludes many items measured in the CPI. For instance, the
single largest component of the CPI is the owners' equivalent rent of a primary residence. It is
possible that a commodity futures index could be a good hedge of the 40% of the CPI that
consists of commodities, but what of the other 60%? It seems reasonable to expect that the greater
the overlap between the composition of a commodity index and the composition of the CPI the
higher the correlation of returns. The mismatch between the composition of a commodity futures
index, such as the GSCI, and an inflation index, such as the CPI, limits the ability of commodity
futures to be an effective inflation hedge.

3.5.2 Expected and unexpected inflation
Actual inflation can be decomposed into two components: expected inflation and unexpected
inflation, the difference between actual and expected inflation. Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2004)
point out that absent any systematic errors in the market's forecast of future spot prices, expected
trends in spot prices should not be a source of return for futures investors. This suggests that the
expected inflation beta of commodity futures should be zero. Assuming, for purposes of
convenience, that year-over-year changes in the rate of inflation are unpredictable, a good proxy
for unexpected inflation is simply the actual change in the rate of inflationxx. Figure 8 shows that,
historically, contemporaneous changes in the annual rate of inflation have explained 43% of
GSCI annual excess return time series variationxxi. That is, average GSCI excess returns have
been positive (+24.5%) and above average (+4.9%) when year-over-year unexpected inflation
rises, and the GSCI excess return has been negative (-8.4%) and below average when year-overyear inflation falls.

Table 3 shows that individual commodity futures excess returns are largely uncorrelated
with one another.

This suggests that the sensitivity to inflation varies across the commodity

futures components. Table 4 shows the historical sensitivity of commodity returns (index, sector
and components) to actual prior annual inflation and actual changes in the annual rate of inflation
over the 1982-2003 period. The GSCI has a positive, but statistically insignificant, actual inflation
beta and a positive, and significant, unexpected inflation beta. Three sectors (energy, livestock
and industrial metals) and three individual commodity futures (heating oil, cattle and copper)
have significant unexpected inflation betas. The precious metals sector has a statistically
significant negative inflation beta, as do gold and silver. No other sectors or individual
commodities have significant positive inflation betas. Though some commodities respond
positively to changes in the rate of inflation, others have negative or insignificant inflation betas.
Indeed, the equally weighted average of the twelve commodities has positive, but insignificant,
inflation betasxxii. Clearly, not all commodity futures are good inflation hedges.

The wide variation in individual commodity futures unexpected inflation betas is explained
by the roll returns. Figure 9 shows that average roll returns have been highly correlated with
unexpected inflation betas. Average roll returns explained 67% of the cross-sectional variation of
commodity futures unexpected inflation betas. In other words, the realized return for supplying
commodity price insurance has been highly correlated with realized unexpected inflation betas.
Commodities such as copper, heating oil, and live cattle had positive roll returns and high
unexpected inflation betas. Commodities such as wheat, silver, gold and soybeans had negative
roll returns and negative unexpected inflation betas.

21

What explains the linkage between roll returns and inflation betas? Table 2 shows some
commodities that Till (2000, 2003) suggests are difficult to store, and it is these commodities that
seem to have had high roll returns and positive inflation betas. Storability, then, could be the link
between roll returns and inflation betas.

3.5.3 Sensitivity to other market risk factors
Even though commodity returns seem to be largely uncorrelated with one another, perhaps they
exhibit some common connection to other pervasive risk factors. Early research by Bailey and
Chan (1993) empirically estimates a connection between the commodity futures basis (the spread
between spot commodity and futures prices) and a number of factorsxxiii over the 1966 to 1987

22

period. We consider the five-factor model of Fama and French (1993). In addition to the popular
three factors (market excess return, a high minus low book to market return (HML) and a small
minus large cap return (SML)), they also consider a term spread return (long-term bond excess
return) and a default spread (corporate bond return minus government bond return). While they
find no evidence that these last two factors are priced for stocks, they might be important for
commodity futures. Finally, following Ferson and Harvey (1993) and Dumas and Solnik (1995),
we consider the foreign exchange rate exposure of the commodity futures. If the return to
investing in individual commodity futures is the return from supplying individual commodity
price insurance, a multifactor explanation is equivalent to saying that the price of individual
commodity price insurance is driven by various common risk factors.
Table 5 presents the unconditional (i.e. assumed constant) monthly betas of commodity
excess returns relative to a common set of “risk factors”. The GSCI has a statistically significant
negative beta with regard to the change in trade weighted dollar and no statistically significant
betas with regard to other risk factors. The non-energy sector has a statistically significant, but
small equity risk premium beta and energy has a statistically significant negative dollar beta.
Reinforcing the earlier observation that commodity futures have low correlations with one
another, there are no uniformly positive or negative sensitivities to these risk factors across
individual commodities. Nor are there any risk factors that seem to be more important than others
in explaining the time series variation of individual commodity futures returns.

3.5 The diversification return
The diversification return provides another reason to simultaneously analyze the performance of a
commodity index and its constituents. The diversification return can lead to significant
differences between the compound return of a commodity index and the weighted average
compound return of the index's constituents. For instance in Table 1, the compound return of an
equally weighted and monthly-rebalanced portfolio of twelve commodities was 1.01%. Yet the
average geometric return of the twelve individual commodity was -1.71%. In other words,
rebalancing a portfolio added 2.72% per annum to the performance of the portfolio. Hence, it
would be a mistake when measuring the performance of an equally weighted portfolio to ascribe
the return of 2.72% to a risk premium. Booth and Fama (1992) show that rebalancing a portfolio
to predetermined fixed weights results in a diversification returnxxiv. They showed that the stand

24

alone geometric return of an asset can be approximated as its arithmetic average return minus one
half its variance. However, the geometric return of an asset in a portfolio can be approximated as
its arithmetic average return minus one half its covariance with the portfolio. The diversification
return is roughly one half the difference between an asset's variance and its covariance.
Table 6 illustrates the mechanics of the portfolio diversification return using the historical
annual excess returns for the GSCI Heating Oil index and the S&P 500. From 1993 to 2003,
heating oil had a geometric annual excess return of 8.2%, the S&P 500 had a geometric annual
excess return of 6.8%, the average of these two returns was 7.5% and the geometric excess return
of an equally weighted annually rebalanced portfolio was 10.9%. The diversification return in this
instance is simply the difference between 10.9% and 7.5%, or about 3.4%.
Whether or not the 8.2% excess return of heating oil is a risk premium, it is certainly obvious
that the 3.5% diversification return is not a risk premium. The average of the individual variances
was 12.8% (the average of the heating oil variance of 21.2% and the S&P 500 variance of 4.4%)
and the average of the asset covariances with the equally weighted portfolio was 5.3% (the
average of the heating oil covariance of 9.5% and the S&P 500 covariance of 1.1%). One half of
the difference of these two averages is about 3.5%, the diversification return.

Figure 10 shows that the diversification return can vary substantially. For an equally
weighted, monthly rebalanced portfolio of the twelve individual GSCI commodities, the
diversification return has been 2.72% over the December 1982 to May 2004 period. The size of
the diversification return is influenced by the average variance of a portfolio’s constituents.
Separating the twelve individual commodities into two portfolios of above median volatility
commodities and below median volatility commodities, shows that the above median volatility
portfolio had a diversification return almost three times larger than the low volatility portfolio. De
Chiara and Raab document a diversification return of 2.8% for the DJ AIG index, over the 1991
to 2001 time period, and Greer estimates a 2.5% diversification return for the Chase Physical
Commodities index over the 1970 to 1999 time period. An equally weighted portfolio consisting
of the seventeen individual commodities currently in the CRB index, rebalanced monthly, had a
diversification return of 4.24% since 1990. Additionally, the frequency of rebalancing can impact
the size of the diversification returns. For the seventeen individual commodities currently in the
CRB index, if the portfolio weights were only rebalanced annually, the diversification return
would have been 2.33%.

26

It is important to distinguish between a return caused by portfolio variance reduction and a
return that might otherwise be credited to a risk premium. For a risk premium, expected returns
increase as risk rises. For a diversification return, returns rise while portfolio variance falls.
Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2004) analyze the performance of an equally weighted portfolio of
commodity futures over the time period 1959 to 2004. They find that the historical risk premium
of this monthly rebalanced portfolio was about 5%. However, Figure 10 shows that the
diversification return for a sample of seventeen equally weighted commodities over the time
period 1990 to 2004 was over 4%. This raises the possibility that the risk premium they infer
from their data is actually a diversification return.

4. Asset allocation with commodity futures
Our historical analysis has revealed the following facts. First, the average return to commodity
futures is close to zero. Second, the correlation of the index constituents is low. Third, the
diversification return is an important contributor to the average performance. One can think of the
diversification return as the return to a mechanical active strategy. Fourth, the term structure of
commodity futures is a strong explanatory driver of the cross-section of returns. The setting we
have described is one that invites active asset allocation.

4.1 Strategic asset allocation
There are two ways that investors usually think about forming portfolios: an asset only exercise
and an asset-liability exercise. From an asset only perspective, Anson (1999) looks at the
performance of stocks, bonds and cash collateralized commodity futures indices from 1974 to
1997, finds that the demand for commodities rises as an investor's risk aversion rises and that an
investor with high risk aversion should invest about 20% in commodities. Jensen, Johnson and
Mercer (2000) examine portfolios that can invest in stocks, corporate bonds, Treasury-bills, real
estate investment trusts and the cash collateralized GSCI over the period 1973 to 1997. They find
that, depending upon risk tolerance, commodities should represent anywhere from 5-36% of
investors' portfolios. Over the 1972 to 2001 period, Nijman and Swinkels (2003) address the issue
from the standpoint of pension plans with nominal and real liabilities. They find that pension
plans seeking to hedge nominal liabilities that already invest in long-term bonds and global equity
are unlikely to improve risk adjusted returns through commodity investment. They find, though,
that pension plans with liabilities indexed to inflation can significantly increase the return-risk
trade off through commodity futures investment. For many investors commodity futures
investment remains a curiosity. Harvard University's endowment is an example of an organization
that has acted on its curiosity and currently has a 13% strategic asset allocation to commoditiesxxv.
Imagine an investor with a strategic asset allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. This
strategic asset allocation reflects the level of risk the hypothetical investor is willing to tolerate.
How should this investor go about investing in commodity futures? One possibility is to make a
cash collateralized commodity futures investment producing the total return of the GSCI index.
Since there are a number of commodity futures vehicles using bonds as the underlying collateral,
bond collateralized commodity futures are another investment possibility. Recognizing that

28

collateralized commodity futures are overlaid on another asset, yet another possibility would be to
invest in an equity collateralized commodity futures vehicle.
Figure 11 illustrates the historical return and risk of five possible investments: bonds, stocks,
cash collateralized commodity futures, bond collateralized commodity futures and stock
collateralized commodity futures. Figure 11 also makes clear that no matter which collateral is
used, a standalone long-only GSCI commodity futures investment has volatility most comparable
to stocks. Efficient frontier 1 represents optimal mixes of stocks and bonds. Efficient frontier 2
traces out optimal mixes of the five assets: bonds, stocks, cash collateralized commodity futures,
bond collateralized commodity futures and equity collateralized commodity futures. Think of this
as having the opportunity to invest in a combination of five different mutual funds where the
long-only portfolio positions are constrained to add up to 100% of portfolios assets.

Annualized Standard Deviation of Return

Historically, for the risk level of the 60/40 stock-bond portfolio, adding commodity futures
enhanced return by about 2% (from roughly 10% to 12%). This volatility matching portfolio

29

consists of a 59% allocation to bonds, a 7% allocation to bond collateralized commodity futures
and a 34% allocation to stock collateralized commodity futures. The portfolio Sharpe ratio rises
to 0.64 from the 0.44 Sharpe ratio of the 60% stock and 40% bond portfolio.xxvi Equity
collateralized commodity futures have a higher Sharpe ratio and information ratio than equities
and this drives the allocation shift from stocks into equity collateralized commodity futures. The
portfolio constraint requiring that volatility equal the volatility of a 60% stock and 40% bond
portfolio drives the increased bond allocation. The message of this exercise is that commodity
futures should be thought of as an asset allocation overlay, and that there is no natural underlying
asset to attach the overlay returns to. The strategic rationale for commodity futures exposure is to
optimally combine commodity futures with other portfolio assets in order to achieve the highest
possible portfolio Sharpe ratio. Long-only commodity futures can be useful portfolio diversifiers
as long as they provide a positive source of uncorrelated return (alpha). This conclusion holds for
both an asset-only framework and an asset-liability framework.
Is exposure to a long-only commodity futures index such as the GSCI the best way to
improve a portfolio’s Sharpe ratio with commodity futures? Treynor and Black (1973) showed
that an asset’s information ratio is a guide to the potential improvement in a portfolio’s Sharpe
ratio. Table 7 shows that, from December 1982 to May 2004, the long-only GSCI had an
information ratio of about 0.36 relative to stocks, bonds and a balanced portfolio consisting of
60% stocks and 40% bonds. Energy has the highest information ratio relative to stocks and the
balanced portfolio. Industrial metals and energy have the highest information ratios relative to
bonds. However, the highest information ratio portfolio is formed by going long assets with
positive information ratios and going short assets with negative information ratios. “Optimal”
long-short commodity futures portfolios had information ratios of 0.75 relative to stocks, 0.86
relative to bonds and 0.75 relative to the balanced portfolio. The fact that these long-short
commodity futures portfolios have information ratios twice as high as the long-only GSCI is
consistent with the work of Grinold and Kahn (2000) and Clarke, de Silva and Thorley (2002) on
the portfolio efficiency gains of long-short investing.

In our sample, the long-only GSCI had a historical excess return of about 6% per annum.
But Figure 12 shows that the rolling one-year GSCI excess and roll returns exhibit a declining
return trend over time. While this trend do not tells us whether returns will be higher or lower in
the future, however, it does raise some doubts as to whether commodity futures investment will
average 6% in the future. The reason is simple. Though the term structure of commodity prices
may be an important long-run driver of realized commodity futures returns, there is no way to
determine what the term structure of futures prices will look like in the future. For instance,
energy futures are often, though not always, backwardated, but it is not obvious what the degree
of future backwardation will be or even that these markets remain backwardated. Gold futures are
seemingly always in contango. Will the future return from going long gold futures continue to be
as negative as it has been in the past?

Another way of thinking about the value of historical returns as an indicator of future returns
is to look at return persistence over long periods of time. Figure 13 looks at the excess return
persistence of the GSCI, GSCI sectors and individual commodity futures from December 1982 to
September 1993 and from October 1993 to May 2004. The correlation between first period and
second period returns is 0.03. The positive first period return-positive second return quadrant is
populated by the energy and industrial metals sectors, and these two sectors drive the positive
returns of the GSCI during both time periods. Each of the return quadrants has approximately the
same number of observations. There seems to be little evidence of long-term return persistence
across commodity futures.

Even though commodity futures provide price insurance, it is reasonable that the price of
commodity price insurance will dynamically fluctuate over time in response to the supply of and
demand for insurance. If too much capital is supplied for a finite insurance need, it makes sense
that returns should decline. Obviously, a shortage of capital should increase returns. If investors
respond to research identifying the ability of commodity futures investment to raise portfolio
Sharpe ratios, the supply of capital increases. It is certainly possible that the trend decline in the
excess and roll return exhibited in Figure 12 is a reflection of too much capital chasing too few
opportunities. Extrapolating past long-term term structure returns into the future might be
convenient, but it is no more revealing than asserting that future stock returns will be high
because past long-term stock returns have been high. Ultimately, a long-term strategic asset
allocation to long-only commodity futures makes sense for investors with a subjective view that
future excess returns will be high enough to increase a portfolio’s Sharpe ratio. Without a
defensible expectation for the excess return of a long only commodity futures investment it is
hard to argue for a strategic allocation to long only commodity futures.

33

4.2 Tactical asset allocation for commodity indices
Though it may be challenging empirically to justify a long-run long-only strategic asset
allocation to commodity futures, the possibility of short-run return predictability across time
might make tactical allocation into commodity futures appealing and return predictability across
commodity futures might make active allocation among individual commodity futures
attractive.xxvii Cochrane (1999) refers to findings of stock, bond and foreign exchange return
predictability as “new facts in finance”, and there is no reason why predictability should not
extend to commodity futures returns. Predictability enhances the appeal of a commodity futures
overlay strategy, since, as Litterman (2004) points out, overlay strategies are the most capital
efficient way to produce alpha.
Previous research has suggested a tactical role for commodity futures. Jensen, Johnson and
Mercer (2000, 2002) found that the GSCI commodity index outperformed stocks and bonds when
their (now discontinued) measure of Federal Reserve monetary policy rose. Strongin and Petsch
(1996) found that GSCI commodity index returns were tied to current economic conditions and,
when inflation rose, had above average returns and performed well relative to stocks and bonds.
Nijman and Swinkels (2003) find that nominal and real portfolio efficient frontiers can be
improved by timing allocation to the GSCI commodity index in response to variation in a number
of macroeconomic variables (bond yield, the rate of inflation, the term spread and the default
spread). Vrugt, Bauer, Molenaar and Steenkamp (2004) find that GSCI commodity index return
variation is affected by measures of the business cycle, the monetary environment and market
sentiment. These analyses suggest that commodity futures returns respond systematically to
changes in state variables. Yet the low cross-correlation of commodity returns with one another
and the message of Tables 4, 5 and 6 suggest that these systematic influences have at best a weak
ability to explain the time series variation of commodity excess returns.
One alternative might be to consider a short-term momentum based strategy. The economic
interpretation is as follows. We expect a positive average return for commodities that provide
insurance. The “insurance providing” role is probably persistent in the short-term. Hence, a
momentum based strategy says: ‘if the commodity has provided insurance in the past period, it is
likely to provide insurance in the next period.
While there is a considerable literature on momentum in equity markets (e.g. Jegadeesh and
Titman (1993), Carhart (1997), Conrad and Kaul (1998)), there is no simple explanation as to
why momentum works. Barberis, Shleifer and Vishny (1998) suggest that momentum is a

34

behavioral artifact due to investor underreaction to news. Johnson (2004) argues that momentum
returns are just payoffs for taking risk. However, for commodity futures, momentum could be a
simple result of the short-term persistence of the realized pay-off to providing insurance.
A momentum strategy typically goes long an asset after prior returns have been positive and
goes short an asset after prior returns have been negative. Figure 14 shows the pay-off to a
strategy of going long the GSCI for one month if the previous one year excess return has been
positive or going long the GSCI if the previous one year excess return has been negative. This
result is stable over time. While the momentum effect is strongest in the first 13 years of the
sample, the effect is robust in the more recent period.

We also consider some portfolio strategies. One commodity futures momentum strategy
might be to invest in either cash collateralized commodity futures or cash, depending upon which
strategy had the highest prior return for some time period. Alternatively, the strategy could be to
invest in equity collateralized commodity futures or stocks, or bond collateralized commodity
futures or bonds.

35

Table 8 illustrates the pay-off to an investment strategy that invests 100% of portfolio assets
in one of four strategies: cash, bonds, cash collateralized commodity futures or bond
collateralized commodity futures. The decision rule is to invest in the strategy that has the highest
previous twelve month return. During this time period, bond collateralized commodity futures
outperformed cash collateralized commodity futures by over 2.3% per annum. In turn, the
momentum portfolio outperformed bond collateralized commodity futures by over 2.9% per
annum. In this case, tactical allocation raises portfolio efficiency as reflected by the momentum
portfolio’s Sharpe ratio of 0.70.
There is no reason to limit the momentum exercise to just commodity futures, bonds and
cash. Table 8 shows that historically equity collateralized commodity futures outperformed bond
and cash collateralized commodity futures. The simple momentum portfolio had a return of
20.5% per annum, over 3% higher than the commodity futures, bond and cash momentum
portfolio. The Sharpe ratio of this strategy is 0.72.

Trading strategy is to invest in the asset class with the highest previous 12-month return. In panel A, we consider

4.3 Active allocation of the constituents of a commodity index
Many momentum strategy analyses look at the value-added of the strategy within an asset class,
such as going long the best performing stocks and going short the worst performing stocks.
Figure 15 examines the pay-off to investing in an equally-weighted portfolio of the four
commodity futures with the highest prior twelve month returns, a portfolio of the worst
performing commodity futures, and a long/short portfolio fashioned from these two portfolios.
Consistent with many prior momentum studies, the winner portfolio has a high excess return
(7.0%), the loser portfolio has low excess returns (-3.4%) and the long/short portfolio achieves
higher excess returns (10.8%) and an even higher Sharpe (0.55) ratio than either the winner or the
loser portfolios. The long/short portfolio Sharpe ratio is more than twice as high as the Sharpe
ratio of the long-only GSCI.

Trading strategy sorts each month the 12 categories of GSCI based on previous 12-month return. We then track the four
GSCI components with the highest (‘best four’) and lowest (‘worst four’) previous returns. The portfolios are rebalanced
monthly.

37

The tactical strategy in Figure 15 is a pure momentum strategy. We now consider a variation
of the strategy that uses the sign of the previous 12-month’s return. We create an “insurance
providing” proxy portfolio by buying commodities that have had a positive return over the past
12 months and selling those that have had a negative return. We use the insurance term because
going long a backwardated commodity provides price insurance as does going short a contangoed
commodity. It is possible that in a particular month that all past returns are positive or negative.
Figure 16 shows that an “insurance providing” portfolio had an excess return of 6.5% and a
Sharpe ratio of 0.85. Note the pure “insurance providing” portfolio had higher returns and a
higher Sharpe ratio than the long-only GSCI. Conceptually this makes sense. The GSCI is a long
only portfolio that is a mix of “insurance providing” and “insurance buying” portfolio positions.
A long only commodity futures index ends up providing insurance for backwardated commodity
futures, a potential source of positive return, and buying insurance for contangoed commodity
futures, a potential source of negative return.

Trading strategy is an equally weighted portfolio of twelve components of the GSCI. The portfolio is rebalanced monthly.
The ‘Providing Insurance’ portfolio goes long those components that have had positive returns over the previous 12 months
and short those components that had negative returns over the previous period.

38

4.4 Tactical asset allocation using the term structure of futures prices
We now consider an investable strategy that considers the term structures of futures prices as a
tactical input for a trading strategy. We examine the overall GSCI as well as the components of
the GSCI.

4.4.1 Term Structure and GSCI Tactical Asset Allocation
When the price of the nearby GSCI futures contract is greater than the price of the next nearby
futures contract (when the GSCI is backwardated), we expect that the long only excess return
should, on average, be positive. Nash (2003) finds that GSCI total returns are positive when the
GSCI is backwardated. Furthermore, when the price of the nearby GSCI futures contract is less
than the price of the next nearby futures contract (when the GSCI is in contango), we expect that
the long only excess return should, on average, be negative. Since inception of GSCI futures
trading, the GSCI has been backwardated as often as it has been in contango. The annualized
payoff from buying the GSCIxxviii when the term structure is backwardated is 11.2%. However,
when the term structure is contagoed, the annualized excess return is -5.0%. The payoffs are
illustrated in Table 9. A strategy going long the GSCI when backwardated and short when
contangoed, and therefore always having an exposure to the GSCI, generates an excess return of
8.2% per annum compared to the average long-only excess return of 2.6% and a much higher
Sharpe ratio. The term structure seems to be an effective tactical indicator. The economic
interpretation is that today’s commodity term structure gives an indication of the future price for
commodity insurance.

Exhibit 17 shows the results of a trading strategy based on the term structure of
individual commodity futures.xxix Two portfolios are created: a long portfolio consisting
of the six commodities with the highest ratio of nearby futures price to next nearby
futures price, and a short portfolio consisting of the six commodities with the lowest ratio
of nearby futures price to next nearby futures price. The Sharpe ratio of this long/short
portfolio was 0.47, almost twice as high as the Sharpe ratio of the long-only GSCI and
over four times higher than the equally weighted portfolio of twelve individual
commodity futures. The term structure of commodity prices seems to be a valuable tool
for allocation across individual commodity futures.

5. Conclusions
Historically, a long-only investment in cash collateralized commodity futures has produced
impressive average returns – somewhat like equity returns. Our paper analyzes the case for a long
only commodity futures position in asset allocation. Central to the case for long-only commodity
futures investment is a belief in normal backwardation. Normal backwardation suggests that all
long positions in commodity futures should provide a positive excess return, i.e. there is a risk
premium. Historical experience casts doubts on this belief.
The term structure of commodity prices provides valuable information about how investors
should allocate capital to commodity futures. Going long backwardated commodity futures and
short contangoed commodity futures seems more likely to provide positive excess returns than
going long both backwardated and contangoed commodity futures.
Understanding what drives commodity futures returns provides a subjective framework with
which to assess the prospective long-run pay-off from commodity futures investment. Roll
returns should vary over time as the supply of and demand for commodity futures “price
insurance” capital varies. The diversification return should vary as commodity futures volatilities
and correlations change over time. It is an open question as to whether historical roll returns and
diversification returns are a guide to the future.
We analyze both the time-series and cross-sectional properties of individual commodity
futures. We find that the conventional wisdom that commodities are a good inflation hedge
garners only modest support in the data. We also analyze commodity futures within the context of
a multifactor risk model.
Our analysis of tactical asset allocation suggests three results. First, we show that adding a
collateralized commodity futures index to a momentum strategy across asset classes improves the
risk-reward profile. Second, using two active strategies, we provide evidence that momentum
applied to the 12 components of the GSCI leads to a portfolio return that dominates the overall
GSCI. Third, we show that the term structure of commodity prices provides a valuable signal for
tactical allocation at the aggregate GSCI level as well as active allocation among the components.
Overall, it is our sense that the strategic case for long only commodity futures depends upon
subjective beliefs about the long-term return potential of select commodity futures and the
appropriate portfolio weighting scheme to apply to these commodity futures. Our results suggest
that the traditional rationales for passively including these assets as a long-only holding in a

41

diversified portfolio are suspect. Focusing on the role that commodity futures play in providing
commodity price insurance, our research suggests that commodity futures are an important
tactical source of alpha in the investment manager’s arsenal.

Notes
i

During this time period, the correlation of returns between the S&P 500 and the GSCI was -0.03. This low correlation drives the lower
standard deviation for a rebalanced portfolio. The standard deviation is: (0.52 *0.15642 + 0.52 *0.18352 + 2*0.5*0.5 * 0.1564* 0.1835
)1/2 which equals 0.1180.

Keynes (1925) stated “it is dangerous…to apply to the future inductive arguments based on past experience, unless one can distinguish
the broad reasons why past experience was what it was.” Carol Loomis, "Warren Buffett on the Stock Market", Fortune, December 10,
2001, volume 144, issue 12, pages 80-87.

Fama and French (1993) present evidence that stock and bond returns vary over time in response to changing levels for five risk factors:
the term premium, the default premium, an equity market book-to-price measure, a measure of equity market capitalization and the
equity risk premium.

Crude oil futures were added to the GSCI in 1987, Brent crude oil in 1999, unleaded gasoline in 1988, gasoil in 1999 and natural gas in
1994.

In "Diversification Returns and Asset Contributions" (1992), David Booth and Eugene Fama define the diversification return as:
Dj

E(Rj) ln[1+E(Rp)]

=

E(Rp)

-

bjpsp2
2[1+E(Rp)]2

where
E(Rj) = the expected (average) return on asset j,
E(Rp) = the expected (average) return on portfolio p,
ln[1+E(Rp)] = the average return on p, expressed as a continuously compounded return,
bjp = the covariance of asset j with portfolio p, and
sp2 = the variance of the simple returns on j and p.
Alternatively, in "Stochastic Portfolio Theory and Stock Market Equilibrium" (1982), Robert Fernholz and Brian Shay describe excess
growth as:
1

(

Σπiσ2i - Σπiπjσi,j
i,j

2
where

π = weight given to asset i (Σπ = 1.00),
σ2 = variance of asset i, and
σi,j = covariance of i and j.
This is also similar to the Sharpe and Tint (1990) liability hedging concept where they find that the risk-adjusted return for a security is
Expected return - risk penalty + liability hedging credit = Expected return - (variance - covariance )/2.

Some have argued that only a select number of commodities should have a risk premium. Kaldor (1939) introduced the concept of the
convenience yield as a way to explain normal backwardation. The convenience yield is a function of inventory and it reflects the
market's expectation about the future availability of a commodity. Generally, the lower the level of inventory the higher the
convenience yield, and the higher the level of inventory the lower the convenience yield. A commodity perceived to have abundant
inventory would have a convenience yield of zero. A convenience yield might be a risk premium. However, since not all commodities
face the same inventory situation at all times, not all commodities should have the same risk premium. Till (2000) suggested that
crude oil, gasoline, live cattle, soymeal and copper are commodities that are difficult to store. Assuming that commodities that are
difficult to store are those with relatively low inventories, Table 2 shows that difficult to store commodities have on average had high
historical excess returns. The presence of a convenience yield is usually indicated by a futures price that is lower than the spot price
for a commodity. However, a convenience yield is only a risk premium when the futures price is lower than the expected future spot
price. Unfortunately, while the current spot price is always observable the expected future spot price is never observable.
If the convenience yield is viewed as an inventory insurance premium, there is some appeal to this approach. It is possible to view a
crude oil future as supplying crude oil inventory insurance and a live cattle future as supplying live cattle inventory insurance.

Because these are separate lines of business, the risk of each line of business should determine the price of insurance for each line of
business

Gold futures prices have been interpolated for the months of September 2004, November 2004, January 2005 and March 2005.

There are two components of market backwardation: the market consensus expected future spot price and a possible risk premium.
While it is possible to observe market backwardation, it is impossible to observe normal backwardation because neither the expected
future spot price nor the possible risk premium are observable.

In fixed income, an upward sloping yield curve produces a return attributable to the passage of time known as rolling down the yield
curve.

xviii

The roll return is the difference between a commodity future’s spot return and excess return, and the term structure of commodity
futures prices is the driver of the roll return. If futures prices are the same as spot prices, that is the term structure of futures prices is
completely flat, then excess and spot returns should be the same. If futures prices are higher than spot prices, then excess returns
should be lower than spot returns. If futures prices are below spot prices, then excess returns should be above spot returns.

The GSCI had an excess return of 4.5% driven by a significant exposure to the mostly backwardated energy sector.

In fact from 1969 to 2003 the first order autocorrelation of the annual rate of change of the CPI inflation rate was 0.13.

xxi

This is an univariate regression of excess return on the year-over-year change in the rate of inflation

xxii

Using overlapping data (and correcting for the induced autocorrelation) did not change the overall results of the regression analysis.

The commodity futures information ratio drives the increase in the portfolio Sharpe ratio. The original portfolio Sharpe ratio is .44 and
with the addition of the commodity futures investment this becomes ( .442 + .472 )1/2 = .64
An investor's strategic asset allocation is driven by static expectations about average future returns. However, there are few investors
whose expectations for future returns do not change over time The nineteenth century German tactician Moltke is purported to have
said “no battle plan survives its first contact with the enemy”. In a similar vein, it is possible to say that no strategic asset allocation
plan ever survives its first contact with reality.

Since the inception of actual trading of the GSCI futures in 1992.

Till and Eagleeye (2003) quotes Nash and Smyk (2003) in which they find that the term structure of commodity prices is a predictor of
total returns.
