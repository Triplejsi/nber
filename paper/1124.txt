SBRVICES IN THE DOHESTIC ECONO#fY AND IN WORLD TRANSACTIONS

Irving B. Kravis

A new

generated

interest

in the role

of services in world transactions has

been

by the current efforts of the U.S. Government to reduce barriers to

international trade in services. The services that are the focus of this
attention are not the same as those often spoken of in discussions of the

"service economy". Yet generalizations based on definitions of services in
the

domestic context are sometimes drawn upon to support policy proposals in

the international area.

This paper has two obejctives. One is to sort out these various
congeries of services and. to assess their importance in the domestic economies

of various nations and iii international transactions. The second is to
examine the implications of the empiricaJ. findings for current U.S. policy
with regard to international trade.

I Introduction
It seems like a natural extension of the concept of an evolving service
economy to conceive of a relative expansion of international transactions in

services. Yet when an effort is made to assess these prospects in the trade
of nations, a large stumbling block is posed by the uncertainty that clouds

the identity of the "services" involved. There are different congeries of
services, each based on a different cross cut of economic activity. In the
domestic economy there is a difference between services defined as final—
demand products (e.g., public passenger transport)** and service industries in

is that incomes from factors of production operating abroad, particularly
capital in the case of the U.S., are often grouped with services in

international classifications, regardless of the type of output produced by

these factors. Another difference, recently emphasized in U.S. trade

policy, is that the concept of trade in services is extented to
include services rendered within foreign host countries by affiliates of U.S.

We take as our working definition of services, goods that are
nonstorable, but this definition like others, such as intangibility, has its
margins at which

it fails to make clear cut distinctions. (E.g., Bauinol's

question whether messages taken

by telephone answering service should be

regarded as storable.) The difficulty of definition arises because by almost
any

characteristic

that can be selected, services, whether viewed from the

standpoint of final—product services, service industries, or internationally

transacted services, are very heterogeneous.* Any statement made about the
average characteristics of services — such as the labor intensity of service

course, the other side of the output coin; services involve little piiysical
tangibility at either end.

The expansion of spending on final demand services
A hypothesis that is frequently advanced is that the demand for services

is income elastic —

that

is, that at any relative price of services the

quantity absorbed rises more than the quantity of commodities as real income

per capita increases. Sometimes this notion is at the root of the perception
that services may be expected to expand rapidly in international
tranSactiOll8. The appropriate concept of services for considering the
underlying economic propostion is in terms of service categories of final
demand (e.g., haircuts, medical care).

The ist important final—product or final—demand services are government,
housing and education; they account for roughly 60 to b5 percent of service

spending in both poor and rich countries. (See Table 1, columns I and 2.)
The addition of medical care and hotels and restaurants raises the proportion

of service spending accounted for to 80 to 854. Other services that come to
mind, including communications and personai. care, add relatively little, but

the importance of some as contributors to international transactions may be
greater than the domestic figures imply.

The similarities of the aggregate proportions in low and high income

countries do not extend to the individual components. For example, public
transport absorbs a higher share in poor countries and housing a lower

share. There is a difference also in that the share of aggregate service
*

In the U.S. in 1972, 9 percent of the value of service industries' output
was accounted for by commodity inputs and 19 percent by service inputs with
the other 72 percent representing value added. The corresponding percentages
for commodity industries were 44, 16, and 40 respectively. i(ravis, 1{eston,

However, this

is

due to much lower service prices in the low income

be drawn from these similarities and differences in

GD? for the provision of final demand services in poor and rich
(1) For the aggregate of services in GD?, the cross—country income

elasticity of demand is near unity. (2) For individual kinds of final—demand

services, income elasticities can

be

very different.

On the first point, earlier work (Kravis, eston, and Summers, l933,
Table 7) produced an income elasticity for the aggregate of final—demand
services of .99, virtually identical with the elasticity of 1.00 for aggregate

commodity finaL demand. On the second point, Suuuner& paper in the present
volume shows, income elasticities for six major

subdivisions

of services

ranging from 0.79 (recreation and education) to 1.46 (medical care).*
The reasons for this combination of overall unitary elasticity and
component diversity, it has been suggested (Kravis, lieston, and Summers,

1983), is to be found in the evolution of technology. Changes in technology
continually shift the modes through which

the age—old basic wants of people

are satisfied. Broad categories of wants tend to be satisfied by mixtures of
services and commodities that vary at different times, places and income

levels. This is true for a want like recreation

for the view that the physical quantities of services as a whole will on

The contribution of service industries to GDP
Another and more common way to identify and classify service activities

is in terms of the industries which produce them. A more or less standard
classification of the main service industries in these terms is set out in

Table 2. In this classification the key is the intangibility or
nonstorabi.Lity of the output without regard to the oature or motive of the

purchaser; intermediate as well as final—demand services are included.
The table shows the contribution the main service industries make to
total production in developing countries, developed countries, and the

U.S. In these terms the service industries are of even larger importance in

*

Uowever, a systematic element may operate in these changes. It arises out
of the probable tendency for technological changes to reduce costs wore in
commodity production than in service production. See Kravis, Fleston, and
Summers 1983. As Robert Lipsey has pointed out, national. accounting
conventions also have an effect. If consumer durables were treated as capital
goods and their services imputed as those for housing are now, final
expenditures on commodities would be reduced and those on services increased,
particularly in the U.S.
**

The underlying figures doubtless suffer from serious incomparabilities for
the two sets of countries and even for countries within each set, but the main
outlines of the service sector are probably correctly reflected.

and similar differences in the compensation or employees in other labor—

intensive services probably increase shares of other service sectors in the
industrialized countries relative to those in the developing countries. The
large role of wholesale and retail trade in the developing countries
accounting for nearly one—fifth of gross production and over one—third of

service output, despite low wages, raises questions about the efficiency of
this sector in these countries.
The relative roles of price and quantity changes in changing the share of
service industries in domestic production over time are examined in Table 3.
The table shows that for the world" consisting of 49 market ecoclomies** the
share of service expenditures in own—currency current prices rose by 6

percentage points between 1960 and 1975. Half of the increase was

attributable to price increases and the other half to real quantity
increases. Similar changes occurred in the industrial countries, but in the

because the number of countries for which data are available shrinks for

earlier and later years.

Thus the time series data for service industries point to a small

rise in

their shares in the production of GDP. This expansion of service shares over
time seems to be in conflict with

the

stability of final—demand service shares

in the cross section data considered earlier. Each set of service
classifications encounters great difficulties in factoring out price and

quantity

ctianges, and in the time—to—time data these problems are not met in

the same way by all

countries.

There is a high

correlation

.71) between the share of final—

(rZ

demand services in expenditures on G1)P

and the

share of service industries in

the production of GUP (1975 data for 27 ICP countries), but the a priori

grounds for expecting such concordance are not strong. The reason is the
factors affecting the changes in the relative importance of service industries
in the production of GDP are different in some important respects from those

operations of firms whose primary function is to produce some given commodity,

or they may be contracted out to specialized service firms. In this sense,
the relative size of service industries depends not only on the volume of
service (accounting, delivery, etc.) that are necessary to bring a commodity
(or a specific service) to the buyer, but also on how the performance of the
necessary activities will be divided among firms.

In general, the influences that favor contracting out services to

specialized service industries probably have been growing stronger. As tax
laws become more complicated with important acnuai. changes, specialized
externa.L law or accounting firms gain an advantage over in—house lawyers or

accountants. The same effect comes from the growing complexity and
uncertainty of other regulations (e.g., anti—trust, labor, pollution

control). Contracting out services such as delivery, cleaning, and meals for
employees not only involves specialized management for these subordinate
operations but may also bring a degree of employment flexibility that is not

sta.tf are employed to carry out these functions. The
of specialization increase as the technology with which the service

available when in—house
advantages

can be provided becomes more complicated (e.g., computer accounting, food

preparation

techniques).

While it seem plausible to think that these changes are pressing towards
the expansion of specialized service industries, it is possible that they are
operating most strongly in service sectors that are very visible but that
account for only relatively small shares of total service industry output and

employment. (See Table 2.) Even so, the argument if accepted would support
the view that there are growth sectors within the services that may be worthy
of attention from policy makers.

More broadly, the overall time—to—time data for service industry shares

14

(Table 3) do show expansion, and

this finding

should not be set aside because

it is not supported by the cross— section analysis based on final—demand
services.

different average productivity trends as

differences in the response of demand to rising incomes. However, the wide

dispersion of individual, services around these average tendencies must be

borne in mind in considering their implications for the role of services in

world transactions. There are as noted some service activities that are
experiencing rapid growth in both current and constant prices.

IV Services in World Transactions
The classification of services usually presented in statistics of

international transactions includes both factor and nonfactor services. The
former

represent direct services rendered by the
payments for the

factors of production such as

foreign capital or wages to a foreign
laborer, regardless of the nature of the output. Nonfactor services, on the
other hand, are those which require the addition of intermediate inputs to
interest

labor

use of

and/or capital for their production.

*

*

In the domestic economy classifications considered in the previous section,
virtually all services are nonf actor services. Purchases of these services
involve payments for some distinct form of production or output rather than a
payment made solely for the services
even when the service output is measured by the input of the factor, as is

of a factor of production. (This is true

often done in national accounting.) Nonfactor services in balance of payments
classifications include a mixture of categories found in the final—demand and

classifications. For

example, transportation is a standard
industry—of—origin
category in the industry—of—origin classification, where it includes both
final and intermediate purchases. Components such as passenger fees would be
found on a sufficiently detailed list of final—demand expenditures. On the
other hand, some categories found in standard classifications of domestic
service industries are not found in the classifications used for international
transactions. Trade, for example, is an important domestic service industry
but the value of distributive services in international transactions is

services inclusive of direct factor

and nouf actor services accounted for over one—third of the U.S

exports of "goods and services" in 1980 and nearly 257. of U.S. imports (see

Table 4). However, policy—oriented discussions often concentrate on nonfactor

order to obtain the total for nonfactor services. The treatment of royalties
and fees in services does not change the picture very much; if as in the table

they are regarded as (direct factor) services, the share of total exports
counted as services is only a couple of percentage points righer cian would
otherwise be the case.
These classifications, it should be borne in mind, are not without their
arbitrary elements. The same kind of activity may wind up with its
transactions value

in one category or another according to the accounting

convenience of different reporters or the practices of the statistical
authorities. For example, the income derived by a U.S. parent from a foreign
service affiliate may appear in balance of payments statistics as investment

income, as a royalty or fee,* or as a payment for a professional or a
managerial service.
Among the nonfactor services, transport (including freight, passenger

fees and travel) accounts for around 70 percent of the total. Government

included in the value of the commodity or service traded. The difference is

related to the fact that the contribution of service industries to the
production of GDP is measured from a value added approach, while the value of

nonf actor services in international transactions is measured in terms of gross
sales revenue or purchase values.

In the U.S. statistics royalty and fees include compensation of U.S.

Eowever, account must be taken of the important role of U.S.—owned
foreign affiliates in rendering private nonfactor services in order to round

out

the picture of the role of services in U.S. international business

activity. Foreign service revenues earned through majority—owned affiliate
sales are larger than those earned from a U.S. base. Thus, for 1977, the most
recent date for which official data on affiliate sales are available, sales of
U.S. affiliates abroad amounted to close to $280

The service

accounted for over 40 percent of the income of all affiliates and

over 25 percent of their employment. Petroleum related services and trade
accounted for three quarters of service income and nearly 60 percent of

service industry employment. The remlning service sectors, where the service
activities on which U.S. policy efforts seem to be concentrated are found,

Growth of U.S. foreign service transactions
The behavior of service industry shares in domestic transactions,
considered earlier, would lend some support to expectations for above—average
growth rates for trade by service industries, if it could be assumed that

growth in domestic and international transactions are likely to go hand—in—

hand. This does not, however, appear to be the case. The 1980/70 expansion
ratios (i.e., the ratios of the 1980 values to those f 1970), shown in Table

4, are lower for services than for commodities and lower still for nonfactor

services. However, international transactions of the U.S. expanded more
rapidly over the decade than the domestic economy, and trade in both services
**

and in its nonfactor component increased at a faster rate than U.S. GDP.
Comprehensive data for the other and larger component of international
business services, foreign sales by U.S. owned foreign affiliates, are

available for the period 1957—77. The nst reliable data are from major
surveys for 1957, 1966, and 1977. (See Table 6). There are serious
imeomparabilities in the three data sets in the defInitions of the foreign
affiliates covered and in the industrial classifications, the latter bearing
especially

Here

a relationship opposite to that found for exports emerges: the sales of

service affiliates expanded more rapidly than those of commodity producing

affiliates, and this was true in both periods. Trade and finance were the
fastest growing sectors in both periods, while transportation, communications
and public utilities sector had the lowest expansion. Other private nonfactor
services such as lodging places, advertising, engineering, and accounting are

in the "other" service category, which has intermediate expansion ratios. The
"other" service ratios were higher than the commodity ratios, and both sets
were substantially above the expansion ratio for the domestic economy.*
Although as noted above, direct investment in service industries did not
expand more rapidly than in commodity producing industries between 1977 and
1981, it seems clear that at least some sectors in the "other" set expanded
very rapidly. A U.S. International Trade Conunission (ITC) survey that
elicited responses from 143 international service firms in 14 selected service

industries* concluded that between 1980 and 198Z foreign revenues increased
by more than 50 percent, rising from 12.9 to 14.9 percent of the total foreign
and domestic revenues.

By way of summary, the dominant components of U.S. international business
in services are transport in the private nonf actor export category and

trade

and petroleum related services in the foreign sales of service affiliates.
There is evidence that a selected set of private nonf actor services that are

the focus of U.S. trade policy have been growing rapidly in foreign affiliate
sales, but there is not much reason to believe that service exports have

increased relative to commodity exports in any general way. The services to
which most policy attention is being given still constitute modest shares both
of exports and of affiliate sales.

Thus both for the U.S. and the world economy international transactions

case of the US.
Assessment
How then shall we assess the relative importance of private nonfactor
services in the internationa]. busines8 activities of the U.S.? Growth in
service exports and in sales of foreign service affiliates have been greater
than domestic growth, but service exports have not expanded as rapidly as

merchandise trade. Revenues from the sales of foreign affiliates are much
larger than export proceeds. Service industry affiliates accounted for about
40Z of total affiliate sales, but much of this was in trade and petroleum

for policy attention, the classification of an industry as a service or

commodity activity becomes irrelevant. The data we have examined and the
heterogeneity of services stressed earlier suggest that there are some (many?)
private aouf actor services not characterized by rapid growth. On the other
hand, a search into the commodity sectors would doubtless produce some
industries characterized by rapid growth in affiliate sales.

Some types of services may of course warrant special attention for
reasons other than their direct quantitative importance or growth potential.
For example, telecommunications and data transfers are areas to which
importance is sometimes attached not only owing

to

their growth potential, but

to their high technological character and their strategic importance to other
international, business activities. 1ut here again the commodity—service
dichotomy is not the key element.

The kinds of services that are the focus of U.S.

commercial

policy are

represented by the 16 industries found in Table 10*. The industries all fail

under

the heading of private nonfactor services found in balance of

transactions statistics. ilowever, there are two important differences between

the U.S. list and those found in the xre standard balance of payments

classification. For one thing, no effort has been made in the U.S. list to
provide a comprehensive classification of all private nonfactor services.

existence of barriers to foreign service sales. A second major difference is
that the focus is not on exports out on service transactions carried our in a

host country by a U.S. affiliate. The fact that the ITC reported that most of
the foreign service revenue of the responding firms

were produced by foreign

affiliates, joint ventures, and franchising and licsensing suggests that the

The emphasis on the investment—related sales

U.S. is suggested also by a classification of the barriers offered in an

with some

is

as follows:

Sales below cost by govermnentowned service company
Restrictions on availability of foreign exchange

might well include more numerous references to restrictions on exports (I).

The dissimilarities are not inherent in the restrictions per se but
rather in the political, context in which they are found. With respect at
least to restrictions on commodity trade, GATT provides a set of rules and a
surveillance

mechanism (although that may be coo strong a term) which is

entirely absent for services.* When it comes to investment (II and III),
there is no worldwide code like GAT] either for commodities or services. The
disagreements among countries about the investment provisions of the Charter
for an International Trade Organization (ITO) were among the main causes that

33

led to the failure of that document to receive ratification. It is hardly
likely that it will be easier today than it was then for capital exporting and
capital importing countries to reach a meaningful agreement on an investment
code.

The other important difference between commodity and service restrictions
is the extensive degree to which restrictions on foreign service activities
are bound up with social, political and economic objectives that transcend the

merely protective motivations of the restrictions. In a number of service
industries domestic firms are subject to various restraints and regulations
designed to protect the public from monopoly power, fraud, deception or the
invasion of privacy. The regulation of banking and of foreign exchange markets

to promote financial stability are almost universal. Similar motivations,
particularly those related to the protection of public health and safety, lead
to regulation of some commodity producing industries (e.g., drugs, electric
applicances), but they are probably less pervasive.

Not only is it to be expected that foreign controlled firms will also be
subject to such regulations and restrictions, but foreign ownership often
raises special fears and problems. The concentration of financial power iii
foreign hands and the foreign control of advertising stereotypes are

illustrations. A crude and rather arbitrary classification of the lb service
industries

firms

according to the extent

may be

to which discrimination against foreign

based on or reinforced by such social motivations is presented in

Table 10. The classification is meant to be suggestive; it is not based on
any effort to assess the nature and strength of foreign attitudes. Nor is it
intended to deny that a protective motivation may often enter into barriers

that are justified on social grounds. What seems very likely, however, is
that strongly held positions in support of barriers to foreign control in

34

certain services are deeply embedded in the domestic values and institutions

of many countries (not excluding the U.S.). It
objections

is

important to add that these

to foreign control do not necessarily apply to the same industry in

each actual. or potential host country. The inference for negotiations is that
an industry by industry, country by country approach is called for. (The

efforts

to resist protective pressures in the commodity field have pretty much

returned us to such an approach in that sector.)

VI. Conclusion
In considering the policy implications of the findings of the previous
sections, due regard has to be caien of our concentration on the empirical

aspects of a very complicated subject. Only limited attention has been
devoted to the political and diplomatic context in which the U.S. service

initiative must be placed. With this caveat, the following points emerge from
our considerations:

1. Services probably represent a relative growth sector in the domestic

economies. Measurement problems abound, but as a rough approximation it may
be

taken that something like half of the growth in service industry shares in

the production of GD? tends to reflect a relative increase in prices and only
the other half an increase in real quantities.
2.

There is little evidence of rapid growth in private non.f actor services

relative

to world trade

in

commodities or as a share of trade in commodities

and services. This may represent inadequate measurement. Also, trade in both
commodities and services has expanded more rapidly than the world GD? of
marKet

economies. However,

a policy based on a sweeping view of the entire

category of private rionf actor services as an area of great future trade growth

35

relative to commodity trade does not seem warranted. If growth prospects are
to be the criteria for special negotiations of trade barriers, the couiniodity—

service dichotomy is not very relevant.

3. Trade in many services does not have characteristics that provide any

justification for their exclusion from the GA11 regime. Trade in nonfactor
services, amounting to something liie 10 or 15 of world trade in commodities

and services appears to have been omitted from the GA1 rules more by
oversight and lack of knowledge than for any compelling reason. An effort to
extend the GATT rules to trade in nonf actor services seems warranted.

4. In the case of U.S.firms, nonf actor service sales by affiliates,
branches, etc. in host countries are much more important than service sales

made from the U.S. (i.e., exports). Thus, though much of the language of U.S.
policy statements is cast in terms of trade, what is really at staI.e is the

treatment of U.S. direct investment in foreign host countries. Service
activities do not seem to warrant special treatment related to direct foreign

investment. The

general

case for the removal of restrictions on the right of

establishment and on the business operations of a foreign affiliate is not
different for commodity— and service—producing industries (unless it is argued
that restrictions on direct investment should be more lenient for services
because they cannot be exported).

5. With the exception of a general extension of the GATT suggested in
paragraph 3, there appear to emerge strong reasons for industry by industry,

country—by—country negotiations. One set of reasons rests in the often deeply
embedded objections to equal treatment for foreign suppliers of services in
certain industries particularly ones that are domestically regulated in

pursuit of nationally accepted objectives. The strength of these attitudes
and the industries upon which they focus vary from one country to another. An

36

produce

effort to include all countries in a broad coverage negotiation might

a very low common denominator. Also, a more selective approach will enaole

the U.S. negotiators to concentrate on situations (industries and countries)
where the pay—off from the relaxation of restrictions would be high.
6. The evaluation of the prospects of a program that is based on so many

unknowns and so many uncertainties is hazardous. However, the size of the
industries included, the subset for which

a

large expansion in U.S. exports

could be expected even with the relaxation of barriers, and a realistic
appraisal

of the extent to which

ail suggest

that

barriers are likely to be negotiated down,

the potential gains to the

U.S. balance of

payments

from the

present program are not liKely to be large. A similar evaluation seems
appropriate for U.S. sales of services from foreign based affiliates and

branches. The prospects for gains

are

enhanced by the greater importance of

such sales and by the rapid growth of some sectors, but the difficulty of

reducing obstacles to direct investment is an offsetting factor. However,

particular industries and firms may benefit substantially. (This would appear
to be the case whether a selective strategy suggested in the previous
paragraph was purposefully adopted or not.)
