THE SUBSTITUTABILITy OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

Abstract

This paper investigates empirically the degree of substitutability
between debt and equity securities in the United States during 1960—1980.
The analysis first applies fundanental relationships connecting portfolio
choices with expected asset returns to infer key asset substitutabilities
directly from the observed U.S. asset return experience. It then compares
these implied substitutabilitjes with the observed portfolio behavior of
U.S. households.
The resulting evidence provides little ground for any conclusion
about even the sign, much less the magnitude, of the substitutability of
short-term debt and equity. Although the implied optimal behavior indicates
that these two assets are substitutes, the observed behavior indicates that
households have treated them as complements. By contrast, the evidence
consistently indicates that long—term debt and equity are substitutes.
Moreover, with a few exceptions the empirical estimates of the associated
substitution elasticity are quite closely clustered around the value —.035.
The conclusion that long-term debt and equity are substitutes with
elasticity - .035 bears mixed implications for broader economic and
financial questions. At one level, the finding that the two assets are
indeed substitutes validates the standard assumption underlying a variety
of familiar models in monetary economics and finance. At the same time,
if the elasticity is only -.035, then many of these models' more important
substantive conclusions do not follow.

THE SUBSTITUTABILITy OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

Benjamin

M. Friedman*

Harvard University

The substitutability of debt and equity securities in investors'

portfolios is an old and important issue both in monetary economics and in

the theory of finance. More than two decades ago, Tobin (1961) emphasized
that the structure of macroeconomic models of the asset markets depends
fundamentally upon investors' willingness to substitute debt and equity
claims, with consequent strong implications for such familiar questions as
the financing of capital formation, the economic impact of government

deficits, and the potential efficacy of monetary policy. At the same time,
following Modigliani and Miller (1958) the theory of corporate finance
has focused heavily on the distinctions between debt and equity claims,
and on the implications of the fact that corporations issuing these claims
confront a competitive market in which investors price these forms of
ownership according to their own, rather than the issuing corporations',
objectives.
The basic reasons why debt and equity may be either close or distant

substitutes are well known. Perhaps the most obvious distinction is that
(non—indexed) debt is a claim on a fixed nominal payment stream, while
equity is not, so that the two assets' risk properties with respect to

changes in the economy's overall price level differ sharply) Similarly,
because of the residual nature of equity claims, the two assets also have
different risk properties with respect to changes in relative prices

or equivalently, in a world in which not all markets are perfectly
competitive, changes in supply-demand conditions in specific product and

—2—

factor markets.2 In comparison with money and other short—term instruments,
however, debt and equity claims have much in common with one another.

To the extent that both debt and equity represent claims to long-lived
payment streams, their shared risk properties with respect to interest
rate changes hold them apart from money and other short—term claims.
Also, unlike money (and some money substitutes), conventional debt and
equity claims are not normally acceptable as a means of payment.3
All of these factors affecting investors' willingness to substitute

debt and equity

securities

are familiar enough at the qualitative level,

but the actually prevailing debt-equity substitutability and its consequences
for important issues of economic behavior remain questions that can only

be resolved empirically. It is simply not possible, on the basis of
a priori considerations alone, to say which risks or other factors are
foremost in investors' minds, and hence how investors resolve the tug—of—

war that pits the distinctions between debt and equity claims against

their similarities. Moreover, because objective circumstances differ
from one time and place to another, there is no reason to assume that the

relative weights investors place on even the most important of these

considerations are universal constants. As changes in the nonfinancial
structure of an economy or in the posture of economic policy alter the character of the risks investors face, or as financial market practices and institu—

tions evolve, debt and equity securities may become either closer or more
distant substitutes.
The object of this paper is to investigate empirically the degree
of substitutability between debt and equity securities in the United States,
and to see whether the recent evidence indicates stability or change in

this relationship. Section I applies fundamental relationships connecting

—3—

portfolio choices to expected asset returns, based on the maximization of
expected utility, to infer key asset substitutabilities from the experience

of asset returns in the United States during 1960-1980. Section II compares
these inferred substitutabilities with the observed portfolio behavior of

U.S. households over this period. Section III performs analogous comparisons
for two further alternative systems for grouping financial assets into the
broad aggregates (debt, equity, etc.) that are necessary for formal analysis.
Section IV focuses on whether there is reason to believe that asset sübsti—

tutabilities have changed since 1960 —to anticipate, the answer is yes —

and examines an extended model in light of this finding. Section V briefly
summarizes the paper's principal conclusions and offers some concluding
comments.

I. Implications, of Asset Returns

The substitutability or complementarity of one asset for another
is a way of describing how investors' portfolio choices respond to changes

in expected asset returns. Because the data available for empirical
applications necessarily indicate the composition of investor's portfolios
only at specific intervals, it is useful to derive a discrete—time model
of this aspect of portfolio behavior.

Following the familiar theory of expected utility maximization,4 the

investor's single—period objective as of time t, given initial wealth W, is

is constant, and if the investor perceives asset returns i to be distributed
as

(6)

then the resulting optimal asset demands exhibit the convenient properties
of homogeneity in total wealth and linearity in the expected asset returns..5

If no asset in vector A bears a risk—free return, so that the variancecovariance matrix 2 is of full rank, then solution of the first-order
condition for the maximization of (1) subject to (2) yields

Alternatively, in the presence of a risk—free asset bearing return r, it
is necessary to partition the asset demand system. The resulting solution,

(11)

and the optimum portfolio share for the risk-free asset is just (l_*'1).
In either case, if the time unit is sufficiently small to render

a good

approximation to E(t+1) for purposes of the underlying expansion, then the
scalar term within brackets in either (8) or (11) reduces to the reciprocal

—6—

of the constant coefficient of relative risk aversion p.6
Because this system of asset demands provides the basic vehicle for
the analysis that follows, it is useful at the outset to note explicitly

several of its properties. First, because of the assumptions of constant
relative risk aversion and normally distributed return assessments,
the respective asset demands are each proportional to the investor's
wealth, and they depend linearly on the associated expected returns.
Second, as Brainard and Tobin (1968) have emphasized, the effect of
the constraint (2) is to render the asset demands linearly dependent, so
that matrix B (or B) and vector ir satisfy the "adding up" constraints

o , all

=

j

and

=

where vectors . are the columns of B. Third, because

(13)

is a variance-

covariance matrix and therefore symmetrical, B (or B) indicates symmetrical

asset substitutions associated with cross—yield effects.7 Fourth, B

(or )

is

strictly proportional to a straightforward transformation of

the variance—covariance matrix, with the factor of proportionality
equal to the reciprocal of the coefficient of relative risk aversion.

Each of these four properties figures importantly in the analysis presented
below.

The primary focus of interest here is the specific off—
diagonal elements (or, depending on the asset aggregation scheme employed,
element)

of B that describe the substitutability or complementarity of

debt and equity securities — that is, the response of the demand for debt

—7—

to changes in the expected return on equity, and vice versa. Following
Brainard and Tobin, the standard assumption (at least in the macroeconomic
literature) is that all assets are gross substitutes, so that the only

question left to be resolved empirically is the absolute magnitude of
the

elements measuring debt-equity

presumably negative off-diagonal

substitutability. The ii in (8) and (11) are marginal responses, so that

(15)

In general, however, assets may or may not he gross substitutes.

From (8) and (11) it is clear that not just the magnitude but also the
sign of each asset demand response to variations in expected yields

depend on the variance—covariance structure describing perceived asset

returns. In the presence of a risk—free asset, Blanchard and Plantes
(1977) have shown that a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for

asset, as is typically assumed here, no such straightforward

apparent, and the most straightforward way to assess the question

of gross substitutability is simply to inspect the elements of B directly.
In financial markets as well developed as those in the United States,

most investors confront a rich, and at times bewildering, variety of

—8—

financial

instruments. Different securities represent claims structured

in sharply different ways, and therefore bear returns subject to different

risks. Government securities differ from private securities. Even among
private securities, claims against some obligors can differ importantly from

identically structured claims against others. For purposes of the questions
addressed here, however, it is important to focus on broadly defined asset
categories, thereby disregarding much of this variety and implicitly
treating as perfect substitutes many distinct claims among which investors
are presumably not entirely indifferent.
Some aggregation among assets, therefore, is clearly necessary.

Table 1 indicates an aggregation of the many forms of financial claims
typically held by households in the United States into five broad categories:
money, time and saving deposits, short—term debt, long—term debt, and
equity.
the

The table also indicates the amount of

each asset category in

portfolio of the U.S. household sector as of yearend 1980.11

The analysis here ignores entirely all nonfinancial assets, both because
the

available rate—of—return data are weak (nonexistent in

many cases)

and because a careful treatment of investment in nonfinancial assets lies
beyond the scope of this paper.
The object of the aggregation shown in Table 1 is to preserve the

fundamental distinctions among assets while at the same time reducing
the number of separate categories to within manageable range for purposes

of empirical analysis?2 "Money," including currency and demand deposits,
distinguishes assets that bear zero nominal rates of return and that

provide means—of—payment services. "Time and saving deposits" distinguishes
assets that bear (nonzero) nominal rates of return subject to fixed legal

ceilings. "Short-term debt," including all other deposit instruments and

all open-market debt instruments maturing in less than one year, distinguishes
assets that bear market—determined nominal rates of return but that

are subject to little interest-rate risk. "Long—term debt," including
all other debt instruments, distinguishes assets that bear nominal rates

of return and that are subject to substantial interest-rate risk. "Equity"
distinguishes assets that bear residual ownership risk.
The first column of Table 2 shows the annualized mean real returns
observed on these five aggregate assets on a quarterly basis during

1960—1980. The nominal returns associated with these real returns are
zero for money; a weighted—average yield for time and savings deposits;
the four-to—six month prime commercial paper yield for short-term debt;
the Moody's Baa corporate bond yield, plus annualized percentage capital

gains or losses inferred by applying the consol pricing formula to changes
in the Baa yield, for long-term debt; and the dividend-price yield, plus
annualized percentage capital gains or losses, on the Standard and Poor's

500 index for equity. In each case the real return is just the respective
nominal return minus the annualized percentage change in the consumer
13
price index.

The second column of Table 2 shows the corresponding after-tax
returns on these five aggregate assets, computed by applying the marginal
tax rates shown in Table 3 to each quarter's before-tax returns before

subtracting the consumer price index change.14 The marginal tax rates
applied to interest and dividends are values estimated by Estrella and
Fuhrer (1983), on the basis of Internal Revenue Service data, to reflect
the marginal tax bracket of the average recipient of these two respective

kinds of income in each year. The marginal tax rate applied to capital
gains is an analogous estimate, including allowances for deferral and loss

offset features, due to Feldstein et al. (1983).
As is clear in (7)-(1l), the substitutability or complementarity
among assets in investors' portfolios depends upon the variance-covariance
structure of the returns that investors associate with those assets.
Hence what matters in this context is not necessarily the actual experience
of returns but investors' perceptions and expectations, which may or may

not closely approximate the corresponding ultimate outcomes. Because
expectations are not directly observable, arriving at values to use in
their place for purposes of empirical analysis is always problematical.
One solution to this problem, which is applicable in some isolated cases

in which data are available, is to rely on survey information.15 The most
plausible alternative, which rests on the assumption of at least some form
of "rationality" in investors' perceptions, is to infer the distribution of
expected returns at least partly on the basis of the observed experience
of actual returns.
Table 4 shows the variance -covariance

matrix

of the actual return

experience corresponding to the mean after—tax real returns in Table 2.

16

As is familiar, these data show the large variation (even in real terms)

associated with equity and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with long-term

debt. As is also familiar, the variation associated with short-term debt
is the smallest among any

of

the five aggregate assets.

What would these variance—covariance properties imply for the substitution properties among the five assets if they did accurately represent

investors' assessments? Table 5 shows the transformation of Q from the
right-hand side of (8) computed on the basis of the Q matrix in Table 4.

To recall, these values indicate, to within a (positive) constant indicating
the investor's relative risk aversion, the marginal responses of optimal

asset demands to changes in expected returns. For p =

1,

a plausible and

often assumed magnitude, these values are simply identical to the optimal
17
marginal responses.

what immediately stands out in Table 5 is that the implied system
of optimal asset demands does not render all assets gross substitutes.
Money is a complement for all assets except time and saving deposits,
while short-term and long-term debt are complements for one another.

Debt and equity securities are clearly substitutes, however. On the
assumption that p =

.. in

1,

so that the values in Table 5 represent the elements

(8), the corresponding elasticities of substitution follow as in

(15). Table 6 shows the 1960—1980 mean asset shares which, together with
the mean after-tax asset real returns in Table 2, facilitate calculating

elasticities from the optimal marginal responses in Table 5. The results
of such calculations are likely to be misleading in many cases, however,
because fouz of the five

mean net

returns are negative. On the basis of the

mean values as shown, the marginal response of the demand for short—term
debt to the expected return on equity (which has a positive mean) implies an

elasticity of substitution CSE = —.025, while the corresponding elasticity
for equity and long-term debt is

=

_.037)8

Although both of these

elasticities are negative, both are quite small in absolute value.
It is also useful to examine whether the assumption that no risk—

free asset exists, as is implicit in using the values in Table 5 to imply
whether assets are substitutes or complements, importantly affects these

conclusions. In brief, the answer is no. The signs of all elements in
(11) are identical to the corresponding signs shown in Table 5, except

for that relating money and short-term debt. The respective elasticities

Once again, even in the presence of a risk—free asset, not all of the five
risky assets would be gross substitutes. As Table 7 shows, the partial
correlations among the risky assets' after—tax real returns include a

negative value and hence fail to satisfy the Blanchard-plantes necessary
condition.
Section II goes on to examine how the observed portfolio behavior

of U.S. households has corresponded with the optimal behavior indicated

in Table 5. Even before turning to the observed asset choices, however,
it is helpful to focus on one aspect of the historical asset return
experience that presents particular challenges for explaining investors'

behavior. The optimal portfolio shares of the five asset aggregates,
computed from (7) using the historical after—tax return means and variance—

covariance matrix, indicate positive holdings of only two assets —time

and

saving deposits, and equity)9 These two assets did have the largest

shares of households' actual portfolios during this period, as Table 6
indicates, but holdings of the other three assets were of course positive

as well. Hence the actual asset choices made by households clearly
differed from the optimal choices implied by the simple model developed

above from the basics of expected utility maximization. Either households'
perceptions of returns systematically differed from the actual experience
during this period, or else households were incorporating other factors

in their portfolio decisions. The analysis that follows attempts to
consider each of these possibilities.

Household Sector Portfolio Behavior
The model of portfolio behavior developed in Section I takes the

maximization of expected utility as the sole objective guiding investors'

asset choices. When one of the assets under consideration is money,
however, the need for means—of-payment services constitutes another

factor influencing asset selection. Following Tobin (1969), among other
writers, a convenient way to represent the demand for such services in
a model with asset demands homogenous in portfolio wealth is by the flow

of transactions relative to wealth. In the linear model (7), the implied
generalization is accordingly
=

B(r

+ 1) + (S(

)+

(16)

where Y is the investor's transactions, (S

is

a vector of coefficients,

and all other terms are as before.2° Because money provides means—of—

payment services, the usual presumption is that M >

0.

Moreover, (S

must satisfy an "adding up" constraint analogous to (17), so that this
presumption also implies (S.

< 0 for at least some asset i

M.

Table 8 presents results for the estimation of (16) by ordinary

least squares, using quarterly U.S. data for 1960—1980. Data used for
ci. are seasonally adjusted shares of the U.S. household sector's aggregate

portfolio during 1960—1980. As Lintner (1969) has explicitly shown, the linearity
of asset demand relationships like (7)

or (16) readily admits of aggrega-

tion across investors with diverse preferences (p), endowments (w) and

assessments (re2)

The intended end result here of empirical analysis

based on aggregate data is therefore an estimate of the relevant parameters
describing the behavior of the collectivity of investors that together
play a

large

role in determining the overall substitutability of debt

—14—

and equity securities inthe United States. Data for the household
sector consist for the most part of the portfolio holdings of individual

investors, and the household sector is the dominant holder of securities —

and the ultimate holder of all wealth —

in

the U.S. economy.21

The data for c are respective shares, and for W the aggregate level,

of the household sector's portfolio of financial assets, constructed
for each asset by decrementing backward from the reported 1980 yearend
value using the corresponding seasonally adjusted quarterly flows.

22

In addition, for equities (the only financial asset for which the asset
stock data are at market value), quarterly valuation changes are included

without seasonal adjustment. As the discussion in Section I explains,
the data used here omit holdings of nonfinancial assets, in part to avoid
data inadequacies and in part simply to limit the scope of the analysis.
The data also omit the household sector's outstanding liabilities, since
the great bulk of household borrowing is tied to the ownership of nonfinancial

assets.23 The data for re are actual real return data for money, time

values are predominantly smaller in absolute value than are the implied
optimal values, as would ordinarily be the case in the presence of errors

in measuring the unobservable expected returns. Nine of the estimated
values differ in sign from the implied optimal values, however, although
in only four cases are the differences statistically significant at the
.05 level. 1mong the ten pairs of off—diagonal coefficients that (13)
implies should be identical, four differ in sign; three of the four conflicting pairs are in the row and columns corresponding to money and its expected
return.

On the key issue of substitutability of debt and equity securities,
the estimated values indicate (without contradiction in signs of paired
values) that short—term debt and equity are complements and that long—term

debt and equity are substitutes — results that are, respectively,
inconsistent and consistent with the solution in Table 5. Once again,
it

is necessary to base the corresponding elasticities of substitution

on the short—term or long—term debt demand and the equity return in order

to

avoid sign changes due to negative mean net returns. Here, however,

there are two separate estimates of each marginal response fB.. (-

because the matrix of estimated coefficients is not symmetric. The
respective pairs of implied elasticity estimates are

and

= (-.0004, -.006). Although both

= (.039, .116)

values are negative, both

are small in absolute value in comparison with

=

-.037

implied by

the solution in Table 5.

One immediately noticeable aspect of the summary statistics shown
in Table 8 is the uniformly low Durbin-Watson statistics, indicating
residuals in all five equations that unambiguously display significant

serial correlation at the .01 level. This result is hardly surprising in a

—16—

quarterly model, in light of the well known sluggishness of household
portfolio behavior in the presence of (broadly defined) transactions costs.
Especially in the context of occasional large moves in equity prices,

which suddenly shift the relative portfolio shares of all assets, it is
implausible to expect full re-alignment of asset holdings to expected

returns within a calendar quarter.26 Some model of portfolio adjustment
out of equilibrium is therefore appropriate.
The most straightforward and familiar model of portfolio adjustment
under

transactions costs found in the asset demand literature is the

multivariate partial adjustment form
=

ec -

(17)

where A* is the vector of equilibrium asset holdings corresponding to
in (16) and 0 is a matrix of adjustment coefficients with columns

satisfying an "adding up" constraint analogous to (12).27 applying (17)

to (16) yields
=

+t+tt't_1

(18)

where

so that the columns of matrix

(21)

constraints analogous to (12) while that for vector i

is

analogous to

(13).

described above. Because each term in (18) takes the dimension of nominal

dollars, however —

unlike

the homogeneous form (16) —here care is

necessary to avoid spurious correlations due to coimnon time trends. Hence
for purposes of estimation all nominal magnitudes (AA, W, Y and A) are

rendered in real per capita values.28 In addition, both AAt and W exclude
the current period's capital gains or losses (although the vector of lagged

asset stocks Ati reflects previous periods' gains and losses), so that the
estimated form focuses strictly on the household sector's aggregate net
purchases or sales of each asset associated with the sector's net saving.
Defining the asset flows in this way is equivalent to assuming that investors do not respond within the quarter to that quarter's changes in their
holdings due to changing market valuations, but do respond to market
valuations as of the beginning of each quarter.
The top panel of Table 9 reports summary statistics for each equation,

and estimated values and t—statistics for the matrix

of immediate marginal

responses of asset demands to expected returns. Not surprisingly, the
use of the partial adjustment form sharply improves the overall fit

properties of all five equations. Serial correlation remains significant
in only two equations, and the standard errors, after conversion from real
dollars per capita to portfolio shares as in Table 8, are uniformly smaller

— in some cases by almost an order of magnitude.29
Although the immediate marginal portfolio responses

may be

useful for some purposes, what primarily matters in the context of the
questions raised at the outset of this paper is the matrix of equilibrium

marginal responses B, solved following (19) as B ®.

The lower panel

of Table 9 shows the implied matrix B, together with associated t—statistics
found by using the full-information maximum likelihood method to re-estimate

In addition, so as to derive t-statistjcs comparable to those shown in
Table 8, in which the equivalent of an identity matrix is imposed a priori

in place of the adjustment matrix 0, for purposes of the maximum likelihood
estimation the estimated 0. values were taken as given.3'

responses

to the expected return on that asset. among the ten pairs of off-diagonal
all four pairs in the row and column corresponding to money and its

uniformly agree in sign. In light of the ample (but troubled) literature
on the demand for money, it

is

hardly surprising that the "pure portfolio"

approach followed here should meet only limited success in explaining
money demand and/or the

response of other asset demands to the expected

Because the five equations comprising (18) have identical sets of

Once

again,

it is interesting that the

value not only agrees in sign but also cones close in magnitude

to the corresponding optimal elasticity implied by the solution in Table 5,

although in this case the underlying estimated ..

not significantly

different from zero. As is to be expected, imposition of the symmetry
constraint enlarges the standard error of each equation, and the appropriate
test of the symmetry constraint itself yields x2(]0) =
rejection

43.8,

warranting

of the implie.d restrictions at any plausible significance level.

In addition to symmetry, the theory summarized in Section I implies

that the matrix of equilibrium portfolio responses also be proportional
to the transformation of the asset return variance—covariance matrix shown
in

(8),

with the constant of proportionality (approximately) equal to the

reciprocal

of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Nevertheless,

estimating (18) by the same nonlinear maximum-likelihood method, subject to
the further constraint that matrix B be proportional to the implied optimal
2

response matrix in Table 5, yields X (9) =

19.2,

warranting rejection

at the .05 level (but not the .01 level) of the further restrictions
imposed in addition to the symmetry restrictions.35
In sum, estimates for neither equilibrium model (16) nor partial

adjustment model (17) yield a representation of the U.S. household sector's
observed 1960—1980 portfolio behavior that is fully satisfactory in terms

of the theory summarized in Section I. Moreover, these models do allow
(albeit in a simple, though standard, way) for two potentially important

influences on portfolio choice that the straightforward theory of expected

utility maximization omits — the demand for means-of—payment services, and
the transactions costs associated with portfolio adjustments. Sections
III and IV therefore turn

to

examine whether it is plausible to assume that

accurately reflects the perceptions that guided investors' asset selection
during this period.

III. Two Alternative Asset Aggregation Systems
As the discussion in Section I emphasizes, any scheme for reducing
to analytically manageable terms the number of assets from which investors

choose their portfolios is bound to be highly arbitrary. A possible
explanation for the unsatisfactory estimates summarized in Tables 9 and
10, therefore, is that the five—asset aggregation system introduced in
Table 1 either over- or under-states the important distinctions on which
investors actually focus in making asset choices.

Tables 11 and 12 show the basic properties of realized asset returns,
and the corresponding estimation results for asset demand system (18),
under an alternative aggregation system that distinguishes only three

separate asset categories: money plus time deposits, including all
instruments bearing nominal returns subject to (zero or nonzero) fixed legal
ceilings; short-term plus long—term debt, including all instruments bearing
market—determined

underlying

nominal rates of return; and equity,

this alternative is simply to group together assets bearing

non-market nominal returns without

of payment

as before. The idea

distinguishing those that provide means

services, and to group together assets bearing market—determined

nominal returns without distinguishing those subject to substantial interest

rate risk. The returns associated with each composite asset category are
just those of its two components, as described in Section I, weighted by
their respective dollar magnitudes in each quarter.
According to the implied optimal portfolio responses shown in Table 11,

the composite debt asset and equity are clearly substitutes, with elasticity

of substitution ESLE =

-.044.

If anything, however, the estimated portfolio

responses shown in Table 12 are less satisfactory than those shown in Tables

9 and 10 for the five—asset classification. In the absence of the symmetry

the two estimated values corresponding to the substitutability

debt and equity are complements with elasticity SL,E 3.62, but the loss
of fit associated with the restriction is clearly large, and the test
statistic value x2(3) =

significance level.
Tables 13 and 14 present analogous asset return properties and

estimation results for a second alternative aggregation scheme, again

distinguishing only three asset categories: money plus time deposits plus
short—term

debt; long-term debt; and equity. The idea underlying this

alternative is to group together all assets bearing nominal returns that

are

with the composite liquid asset category is a weighted average of the
returns associated with its three components.38

for the symmetry restriction is x2() =

which warrants rejecting the

restriction at the .05 level but not at the .01 level.
Comparison of these results with those presented in Sections I and
II on the basis of a five-asset scheme hardly settles the question of which

arbitrary asset aggregation system provides the best representation of how

investors perceive the menu of assets confronting them. Nevertheless, it
is instructive that the estimate of

alternative and

in the first three—asset

in the second are not all that different from the

estimates — or the implied optimal c — reported in Sections I and
II. More broadly, however, on the basis of these results there is little
ground for attributing the unsatisfactory properties of these models'
empirical estimates in other respects to the asset aggregation system per se.

IV. Changes Over Time in the Structure of Asset Returns
The variance-covariance matrix exhibited in Table 4 reflects the
stochastic structure of the after—tax asset returns actually realized

during 1960-1980. Hence the portfolio responses to expected return
variations exhibited in Table 5, which are implied from that variance-

covariance matrix using (8) and p =

1,

adequately describe investorst

optimal behavior Only to the extent that investors actually knew that
the stochastic structure of asset returns was as it turned out to be.

The question that immediately arises is how investors would have acquired
this information.
The rationale for asserting that economic agents (on average)

accurately know the relevant properties of the world in which they live

usually rests on some presumption of stationarity: If the properties in
question are economically relevant, agents will have an incentive to discover

them; if the properties persist, agents will in fact do so. By contrast,
if the relevant properties are changing over time, so that an appeal to
economic incentives and (even sometimes quite astonishing) powers of
observation is insufficient, how the representative agent comes to know
these properties is highly problematical.39

The relevant question here, therefore, is how stable were the 1960—

1980 sample properties of asset returns summarized in Section I. Tables
15 and 16 report mean returns arid variance—covariance structures for the

two sub—samples 1960:1—1979:11 and l970:III—l980:IV.40 As is well known,
investors confronted not only lower mean real returns but also more volatile
real returns on all five categories of assets during the 1970s, and
the data shown here clearly reflect these differences.

More inportantly, Table 17 shows that the changes in the variance—
covariance structure of asset returns that took place between the 19.60s

and the 1970s bore strong implications for optimal portfolio behavior,
including implications for the substitutability of debt and equity

securities. The table shows the implied optimal asset responses corresponding to the respective sub—sample variance—covariance matrices in Table 16,

summary measure for this purpose is the ratio of the covariance of each
asset's return

with

that on the "market" portfolio to the variance of the

"market" return itself—that is, each asset's "beta." Figure 1 shows the
1960—1980 quarterly values of these "betas" computed on a trailing
eight-quarter basis for the five aggregate assets defined in Table 1,

with the "market" portfolio defined in each quarter simply as the total
of the five aggregate assets.43

V. Concluding Comments
Table 19 brings together the respective estimates of the elasticity
of substitution between debt and equity securities developed throughout
this paper, including values implied on the basis of optimal asset demand
behavior in relation to actual asset return properties during 1960-1980,

as well as values estimated on the basis of the observed portfolio behavior

of the U.S. household sector over this period. As is clear from this set
of comparisons, there is little ground here for drawing any conclusion at
all about even the sign, much less the magnitude, of the substitutability

of short-term debt and equity. Although the implied optimal behavior
indicates that these two assets are substitutes, the observed behavior

indicates that households have treated them as complements. By contrast,
the values assembled here consistently indicate that long-term debt

and equity are indeed substitutes. Moreover, with a few exceptions
the various quantitative estimates of the associated substitution
elasticity are quite closely clustered around the value •Ø35•45
For several reasons, it is difficult to know what (if any) broader

economic and financial conclusions to draw from these results. Even for
the one fairly consistent result that runs throughout the paper, the
substitutability of long-term debt and equity, focusing on the sign
leads to different implications than does focusing on the magnitude.

At

one level, the finding that (long-term) debt and equity are substitutes

validates

the standard assumption underlying a variety of familiar models

in monetary economics and finance. At the same time, if the elasticity is
really only —.035, then many of these models' more important substantive
conclusions do not follow.
In addition, the analysis undertaken here indicates several conclusions

at

a more detailed level that also warrant caution: First, while the

observed variance—covariance structure of real asset returns in the
United States during 1960—1980 implies that debt and equity securities
are substitutes, the variance-covariance structure changed between the

1960s and the 1970s, and the resulting differences imply sharply changed
optimal substitution responses of the demand for debt and equity to their

respective expected returns. For the relationship between short-term
debt and equity, even the implied sign of the relevant optimal response
differs between the two sub—samples.
Second, the estimated substitution properties of assets other than

long—term

the

debt and equity do not bear much systematic resemblance to

optimal responses implied by the observed variance—covariance

structure. The system of asset aggregation employed does not appear
to affect this conclusion in an important way, nor does taking explicit
account of the nonstationary stochastic return structure appear to
improve the relevant estimates.
Third, the data consistently warrant rejecting the hypothesis

of symmetrical asset demand responses to variations in expected yields

on alternative assets. This result does not contradict the theory of
portfolio behavior based on expected utility maximization in general, but
it does contradict the familiar specific form of that theory relying on
joint normal (or lognormal) assessments of asset returns and on constant
relative (or absolute) risk aversion.
To be sure, the empirical analysis presented here does not lack
limitations to provide potential explanations for the more perplexing

aspects

of these results. The treatment of the aggregate household

sector as if it were one individual's portfolio, the exclusion of

—31—

nonfinancial assets (and hence of liabilities), the use of actual instead
of instrumented

returns except for capital gain and loss components, and

the simplicity of the approaches taken to allow for means-of-payment
services and transactions costs all constitute potential reasons for
believing that there may well be substantial discrepancies between the
behavioral parameters estimated here and the corresponding actual
properties of household portfolio behavior.
Even so, the troubling possibility remains that the most important
explanation for the problematical aspects of the results found here is
instead that the expected asset returns and the associated variance—
covariance structure inferred here do not closely correspond to the

perceptions that investors actually held. One potential reason for
suspecting descrepancies, of course, is the ever—present need for arbitrary

assumptions in order to proxy unobservable expectations.46 Even more
troubling, however, is the possibility that investors systematically

misperceived the real asset returns they confronted — in other words,
that investors not only lacked perfect foresight about each quarter's
capital gains and losses but, even over a substantial period of time,
failed to understand the basic properties of the distributions generating

real returns. With four of five assets exhibiting negative mean real
returns over the entire two decades, and the implied optimal holdings
consistent with those mean returns positive for only two of the five assets,
it is difficult to reject out of hand the possibility that investors went
through much of this period consistently anticipating more favorable returns

than in fact materialized. That such behavior presents formidable
obstacles to formal analysis, or even that it contradicts fashionable
ideas about the formation of expectations, cannot rule it out.

for research assis-

Patric Hendershott, Vance Roley, and other members of the National

Bureau project, and especially to Gary Smith, for comments on an
earlier draft; and to the National Bureau, the National Science Foundation

(grant SES81-l2673), and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for

research support.
1. Tobin (1961) relied on this distinction in arguing that, if it were
necessary to aggregate debt with either money or equity in a macro-

economic model, the former choice would be superior. Subsequent
empirical work emphasizing the same distinction has included Fama
and Schwert (1977) and Bodie (1982).

2. This line of reasoning also leads to a distinction, which lies beyond
the scope of this paper, between default-free government debt and
defaultable private debt.

3. Exceptions arise, however, as in corporate merger or acquisition
transactions settled by direct exchanges of securities.

4. See, for example, Arrow (1965) or Cass and Stiglitz (1970).
5. For evidence supporting the assumption of constant relative risk
aversion, see Friend and Blume (1975). Although Fama (1965) and
others have shown that individual securities returns are not strictly
normally (or lognornially) distributed, Linther (1975) has shown that

the approximation involved here is close enough for most purposes,
and more recently Fama and MacBeth (1973) have also relied on the

normality assumption. See Friedman and Roley (1979b) for the explicit

derivation of expressions (7)—Cu)

below under

the assumptions of

constant relative risk aversion and joint normally distributed return

assessments. (These two assumptions are not strictly compatible,
because normality in principle admits negative gross returns for
which constant-relative-risk-aversion utility is not defined; but
the approximation involved here is hardly troubling.)

6. The rationale for mean—variance analysis provided by Samuelson (1970)
and Tsiang (1972), for example, suggests that mean—variance analysis
per se is only an approximation that depends on (among other factors)

a small time unit. The time unit used in the empirical work presented
in this paper is a calendar quarter. Although the observed variation
of some asset prices is large over this time unit, it is the expected
variation that matters here.

7. More precisely, under constant relative risk aversion symmetry holds
only as an approximation that is acceptable as the time unit is small;

see again foothote 6. Symmetry would hold exactly in this model only
under the alternative assumption of constant absolute risk aversion.
See Roley (1983) for a thorough analysis of the conditions determining
symmetry in asset demand systems.

8. Here and throughout this paper, elasticities of substitution C
are defined in terms of net returns r as is more typiOal in the
portfolio demand literature, rather than gross returns (1 +

r)

as would be analogous to the consumer demand literature because of
the reciprocal relationship between expected gross returns and asset

prices. Because the marginal responses

distinction, the corresponding gross—return elasticities just equal
the net-return elasticities as shown in (15) but with (1 +

r) in

place of r.
9. Uniformly nonnegative partial correlations imply uniformly nonnegative
simple correlations, of course, so that the latter is also a necessary
(though weaker) condition for gross substitutability of all assets
when a risk—free asset exists.

10. Even in the presence of a risk—free asset, it is just as easy to
inspect the

directly

as to compute the partial correlations on

which Blanchard and Plantes focus.

11. These data, from the Federal Reserve Board's flow-of—funds accounts,
give market values for equity and par values for all other assets.

Because interest rates exhibited an upward secular trend during
1960—1980, the period analyzed here, par-value data presumably overstate

holdings of long-term debt. This problem does not arise for money or
for time and saving deposits, and it is too small to be of consequence
for short—term debt.

12. See Jones (1979) for a careful treatment of the conditions required
for asset aggregation. Section III below briefly considers two further
alternative asset aggregation schemes.

13. Some preliminary experimentation using the respective price deflators
for gross national product and for personal consumption expenditures
indicated that the results presented in this paper are not sensitive
to the choice of specific inflation measure.

14. Because the Internal Revenue service data needed to estimate these
marginal tax rates for 1980 were unavailable as of the time of writing,

the 1979 rates were used to calculate 1980 after-tax returns. No
major tax changes occurred in 1980.
15.

For examples of work based on interest rate surveys, see Friedman
(1979b) and Kane (1983).

16. As Smith points out (see his comments below), Table 4 shows
the

i,incondjtional variance—covariance structure of returns. Hence

it both overstates and understates investors' knowledge. The overstatement comes from implicitly giving investors, within the sample,

knowledge of the full-sample return distribution parameters. The
understatement comes from ignoring investors' use of the serial

correlation properties of returns. Smith's suggestion of using
regressions (perhaps with rolling samples) to derive conditional
estimates is sensible, and I plan to implement it in further work

along these lines. The use of the "beta" values derived in Section
IV below is analogous.

17. The results found by Friend and Blume (1975) suggest a value of p
between I and 2.

More recent work by Grossman and Shilier (1981),

using altogether different evidence, suggest a greater value. Bodie
et al., in this volume, assume p = 4.

18. The corresponding gross—return elasticities are ESE = —.836

= —1.23.

and

Because the gross—return means are positive,

it is also possible to calculate the analogous gross—return elasticities

of

substitution referring to the response of the demand for equity

to the expected return on either short-term or long—term debt.

These elasticities are EBS =

—.124

19. The finding that investors would

and

= —.334,

respectively.

not have held positive amounts of

long-term debt under these assumptions is familiar; see Bodie (1982)

and Bodie et al. in this volume. What is surprising here is that,
in the presence of money and time and saving deposits, as well as
short—term debt, under these assumptions investors would not have
held positive amounts of short-term debt either.

20. Deriving 6

directly

from the underlying expected utility maximization

would require an explicit representation of the transactions process
and the associated role of means—of—payment services.

21. The analysis here includes only the assets that households own directly
and via personal trusts. Pn alternative approach would be to include
as well assets in which households have an interest via pension and

insurance arrangements. Inferring the risk properties of pension and
insurance assets would be highly problematical, however (unless, of
course, the pension or insurance intermediary form were treated simply

as a shell performing no risk—transformation services at all). In
the limit, if all assets in the economy were aggregated together and
imputed to the household sector as ultimate owner, there would be

no basis for distinguishing the resulting "asset demand" equations
from the corresponding "asset supply" equations.

22. The purpose of this procedure is to generate series of seasonally
adjusted end—of-quarter asset stocks without any gaps or inconsistencies
due to splicing of data series. (The Federal Reserve System does not
construct such series.)

23. Out of $1,494 billion of household sector liabilities outstanding
as of yearend 1980, $971 billion consisted of mortgage debt and
$385 billion of installment and other consumer credit.

The expected returns evolve not independently, of course, but by

27. In previous work I have criticized this partial adjustment model for
not adequately reflecting the greater. sensitivity to expected returns

of

the allocation of new cash flows in comparison to the re—allocation

of existing asset holdings under most transactions cost technologies,
and have suggested an "optimal marginal adjustment" model as an

alternative; see, for example, Friedman (1977). Applying the optimal

below

is an object left here for future work.

The price and population variables used to deflate the nominal
magnitudes

are the consumer price index (1967 =

1.00) and the total

U.S. population (in millions). For purposes of comparison with the
magnitudes shown in Tables 1 and

1960-80

228.6

6,

their respective 1980:IV and

mean values are 2.658 and 1.322 for the price index, and

and

204.9

for population. Using the current period's price

(and population) to deflate the vector of lagged asset stocks in (18)
represents a multivariate generalization of the "nominal—adjustment"
model suggested by Goldfeld (1976).

29. In terms of shares of the 1960—1980 mean portfolio, the five standard
errors (in the order used in the tables.) are .00136, .00377, .00482,

.00187, and
30.

.00061.

Because the five equations being estimated all share identical sets
of regressors, full-inform&tion maximum likelihood is equivalent to

ordinary least squares. As a check, the equations were actually

estimated twice, once using each method. The corresponding sets of
results were identical.

31. More precisely, each equation was. estimated three times: twice as

values estimated (identically) the first two times. Fixing the
0.. in this way does not affect the estimated values of the other
coefficients, but does affect the associated t—statistics.

32. The literature associating an implicit nonpecuniary return to holding
money balances is potentially instructive here; see, for example,
Barro and Santomero (1972) and Klein (1974).

33. As is the case for the .

. coefficients

shown in Table 9, the

t—statistics

reported in Table 10 are derived by taking the

values as given. Here the system of equations was first estimated
by the nonlinear maximum-likelihood method, subject to the symmetry

restriction on B but no restriction on 0. The resulting 0.. values
were those imposed on the final estimation. Once again, this
procedure does not affect the estimated values of the coefficients,

but it does affect the associated t-statistics. The summary statistics
shown in Table 10 are comparable to those in Table 9, in that they

refer to the initial joint estimation of the 0 along with the
other coefficients.

34. Roley (1983) also rejected the symmetry restriction. From an inspection of the pattern of signs among the off-diagonal

values shown

in Table 9, it appears as if only the coefficients in the ow and

its

35. The implied coefficient of relative risk aversion is —1.68, with
t—statistic —4.3.

36. This alternative aggregation scheme is the one proposed by
Smith; see his comments in this volume.

37. See 1ndo and Shell (1975) for a theoretical justification for this
two—part strategy. Several authors have investigated empirically
the allocation of the household sector's liquid asset portfolio;
see, for example, Fortune (1972).

40. A break at mid 1970 not only represents the sample midpoint but also
roughly corresponds to several familiar changes in the objective

circumstances determining real asset returns, including the Federal
Reserve System's adoption of a monetary aggregate target in February
1970 and its suspension of Regulation Q interest ceilings on large

time deposits in June 1970. More broadly, but also a qood deal more
roughly, the l970s were a decade of slower real growth, more frequent

business recessions, faster price inflation, less capital formation,

and larger federal government deficits than in the 1960s. There is also
substantial evidence of a further break associated with the Federal

Reserve's further change in operating procedures in October 1979 —

see, for example, Friedman (1982) —but splitting the 1960—1980
sample

at that point would serve little purpose here.

41. All implied substitution elasticities shown in Table 17 have unchanging
sign across the two sub—samples except that between short—term

debt and

debt

in

equity,

and money

but the elasticities of substitution between long-term

and

between

long-term debt and

time

deposits differ

sign from the corresponding implied elasticities for the full

sample shown in Table 5

42. Friedman (1980) and Friedman and Roley (1979a) dealt with this problem
by selectively including moving-average variances (but not covariances)
in estimated asset demand equations.

43. Hence the "market" portfolio excludes nonfinancial as3ets; see again

th M iiitn in SI-ion T
44.

Programming the nonlinear estimation package to solve directly for
the y.., analogously to
the

nonlinear

the s..,

would make proper convergence of

maximum likelihood estimation problematical.

45. On the basis of the mean equity return of 3.13%, used in calculating
all of the full—sample elasticities shown in Tabl 19, a mean—return
elasticity of - .035 corresponds to a gross—return elasticity of
—1.15.
