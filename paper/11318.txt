Measuring the Impact of Crack Cocaine

NBER Working Paper No. 11318
May 2005
JEL No. J00
ABSTRACT
A wide range of social indicators turned sharply negative for Blacks in the late 1980s and began to
rebound roughly a decade later. We explore whether the rise and fall of crack cocaine can explain
these patterns. Absent a direct measure of crack cocaine’s prevalence, we construct an index based
on a range of indirect proxies (cocaine arrests, cocaine-related emergency room visits, cocaineinduced drug deaths, crack mentions in newspapers, and DEA drug busts). The crack index we
construct reproduces many of the spatial and temporal patterns described in ethnographic and
popular accounts of the crack epidemic. We find that our measure of crack can explain much of the
rise in Black youth homicides, as well as more moderate increases in a wide range of adverse birth
outcomes for Blacks in the 1980s. Although our crack index remains high through the 1990s, the
deleterious social impact of crack fades. One interpretation of this result is that changes over time
in behavior, crack markets, and the crack using population mitigated the damaging impacts of crack.
Our analysis suggests that the greatest social costs of crack have been associated with the
prohibition-related violence, rather than drug use per se.

I. Introduction
Between 1984 and 1994, the homicide rate for Black males aged 14-17 more than
doubled and homicide rates for Black males aged 18-24 increased almost as much, as shown in
Figure 1. In stark contrast, homicide rates for Black males 25 and older were essentially flat
over the same period. By the year 2000, homicide rates had fallen back below their initial levels
of the early 1980s for almost all age groups.1
Homicide was not the only outcome that exhibited sharp fluctuations over this time
period in the Black community. Figure 2 presents national time series data by race for fetal
death rates, low birth weight babies, weapons arrests, and the fraction of children in foster care.2
All of these time series exhibit noticeable increases for Blacks--typically followed by offsetting
declines—starting in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The fraction of Black children in foster care
more than doubled, fetal death rates and weapons arrests of Blacks rose more than 25 percent,
and Black low birth weight babies increased five percent.3 Among Whites, there is little
evidence of parallel adverse shocks. The poor performance of Blacks relative to Whites
represents a break from decades of convergence between Blacks and Whites on many of these
measures.4
The concurrent rises and declines in outcomes as disparate as youth homicide, low birth
weight babies, and foster care rates presents a puzzle, especially when many standard economic
1

Homicide rates for young white males (with Hispanics included as whites) followed a similar pattern, although the
fluctuations were far more muted. Homicide rates for white males over age 25 have steadily fallen since 1985.
2
We describe the data sources, definitions, sample availability, and precise construction of these variables and
others used in the paper in the data appendix.
3
Neal (2004) provides further evidence of a downturn in black educational outcomes.
4
Over the past thirty years, for instance, the black-white ratio of median earnings for male full-time workers
increased from .5 to .73 (Welch 2003), the black infant mortality rate fell by two-thirds (Almond, Chay, and
Greenstone 2003), the fraction of blacks between the ages of 25-29 with four-year college degrees has increased
nearly 3 fold (Blank 2001), and Black academic achievement (as measured by NAEP scores) has increased 0.6
standard deviations relative to whites (Grissmer, Flanagan, and Williamson 1998). The number of black
entrepreneurs has more than doubled (Boston 2001). The number of blacks in congress has increased five-fold.4
Similar advances have been made among high-level executives, professors and administrators at elite colleges and
universities, and the fraction of blacks living in middle class neighborhoods.

3

and labor market measures for Blacks show no obvious deviations from trend over the same
period (Blank 2001). In this paper, we examine the extent to which one single underlying factor
– crack cocaine – can account for the fluctuations in all these outcomes.5
Crack cocaine is a smoked version of cocaine that provides a short, but extremely intense,
high. The invention of crack represented a technological innovation that dramatically widened
the availability and use of cocaine in inner cities. Virtually unheard of prior to the mid-1980s,
crack spread quickly across the country, particularly within Black and Hispanic communities
(Bourgois 1996, Chitwood, et al. 1996, Johnson 1991). Many commentators have attributed the
spike in Black youth homicide to the crack epidemic’s rise and ebb (Blumstein 1998, Cook and
Laub 1998, Cork 1999, and Grogger and Willis 2000). Sold in small quantities in relatively
anonymous street markets, crack provided a lucrative market for drug sellers and street gangs
(Bourgois 1996, Jacobs 1999). Much of the violence is attributed to attempts to establish
property rights not enforceable through legal means (Bourgois 1996, Chitwood, et al. 1996).
With respect to other outcomes, the physiological evidence regarding the damage that crack
cocaine does to unborn babies suggests that crack usage might explain the patterns in fetal death
and low birth weight babies (Frank et. al. 2001, Datta-Bhutatad 1998), although there is no
consensus (Zuckerman 2002). The highly addictive nature of crack, combined with relatively
high crack usage rates by women (Bourgois 1996, Chitwood, et al. 1996), could contribute to
dysfunctional home environments leading to placement of children into foster care.
In spite of the general appreciation of the potential role that crack may have played in
driving the patterns observed in the data (e.g., Bennett et al. 1996, Wilson 1990), especially with
respect to the Black youth homicide spike (Cook and Laub 1998, Blumstein and Rosenfeld 1998,
5

Other competing explanations have also been proposed. Ferguson (2001) argues that the rise in popularity of hiphop music is to blame for the divergence in black-white test score gaps in 1988. McWhorter (2003) makes a similar
argument.

4

Levitt 2004), there has been remarkably little rigorous empirical analysis of crack’s rise and its
corresponding social impact. The scarcity of research appears to be due in part to the great
difficulty associated with constructing reliable quantitative measures of the timing and intensity
of crack’s presence in local geographic areas. Baumer et al. (1998), Cork (1999), and Ousey and
Lee (2004) use cocaine-related arrests as a proxy for crack. Ousey and Lee (2002) supplement
arrest data with the fraction of arrestees testing positive for cocaine. Grogger and Willis (2000)
use breaks from trend in cocaine-related emergency room visits in a sample of large cities, as
well as survey responses from police chiefs in these cities to measure the timing of crack’s
arrival. Corman and Mocan (2000) use drug deaths, but the data do not specify which drug is
responsible.
In this paper, we take a somewhat different approach to measuring crack cocaine. Rather
than relying on a single measure, we assemble a range of indicators that are likely to proxy for
crack. These include cocaine arrests and cocaine-related emergency room visits as in the
previous literature, but also the frequency of crack cocaine mentions in newspapers, cocainerelated drug deaths, and the number of DEA drug seizures and undercover drug buys that involve
cocaine. While each of these proxies has important shortcomings, together they paint a
compelling story for capturing fluctuations in crack. As demonstrated in Figure 3, the national
time-series aggregates for these variables tend to follow a similar pattern, rising sharply around
1985, peaking between 1989 and 1993, and in most cases declining thereafter. In spite of the
aggregate similarities, using just one of the proxies does not appear to be sufficient for describing
crack: the average cross-city correlation in the measures is only about .35. By combining the
various measures together into a single factor, however, we are able to generate a crack cocaine
index that is not particularly sensitive to any one of the individual measures and corresponds

5

well to the ethnographic and media accounts of crack cocaine’s spread and prevalence. Our
measure captures the intensity of crack’s presence in a particular place and time and can be
constructed for a wide variety of geographic areas. We estimate our crack index annually for
large cities and states over the period 1980-2000, and are making these data available to other
researchers.6
We find that crack rose sharply beginning in 1985, peaked in 1989, and slowly declined
thereafter. Our estimated crack incidence remains surprisingly high over time – in the year 2000
crack remains at 60-75 percent of its peak level. Crack is concentrated in central cities,
particularly those with large Black and Hispanic populations. The cities experiencing the highest
average levels of crack are Newark, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and New York.
Although crack arrived early to the West Coast, the strongest impacts were ultimately felt in the
Northeast and the Middle Atlantic States. The Midwest experienced relatively low rates of crack.
Our index of crack is strongly correlated with a range of social indicators. We find that
the rise in crack from 1984-1989 is associated with a doubling of homicide victimizations of
Black males aged 14-17, a 30 percent increase for Black males aged 18-24, and a 10 percent
increase for Black males 25 and over, and thus accounts for much of the observed variation in
homicide rates over this time period.7 The rise in crack can explain 20-100 percent of the
observed increases in Black low birth weight babies, fetal death, child mortality, and unwed
births in large cities between 1984 and 1989. In contrast, the measured impact of crack on
Whites is small and statistically insignificant. We estimate that crack is associated with a 5

Victimization data are used instead of offender data because the identity of some offenders is unknown. Among
homicides with a known offender, there is a high correlation between the race and age of the victim and offender.

1989.8
The link between crack and adverse social outcomes weakens, however, over the course
of the sample. Even though crack use does not disappear, the adverse social consequences
largely do. Thus, by the year 2000, we observe little impact of crack, which accounts for much
of the recovery in homicide rates and child outcomes for Blacks over the period. We
hypothesize that the decoupling of crack and violence may be associated with the establishment
of property rights and the declining profitability of crack distribution. The fading of adverse
child outcomes may be attributable to the concentration of crack usage among a small, aging
group of hardcore addicts (MacCoun and Reuter 2001, page 123).
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a brief history of
crack cocaine. Section III describes the data we use. Section IV presents our methodology for
combining the crack proxies into a single index, presents the results of that exercise, and assesses
the determinants of the timing and intensity with which crack hits a city or state. Section V
analyzes the extent to which crack can account for the observed fluctuations in social indicators
since 1985. Section VI concludes. The appendix outlines the sources of data used and the
precise construction of the variables and crack cocaine index.

Section II: A Brief History of Crack Cocaine
Cocaine is a powerful and addictive stimulant first extracted from the coca plant in 1862.
During the 19th century, cocaine had a variety of medical uses and could be purchased over the
counter, including in the original version of Coca-Cola (Bayer 2000). In the 1970s, inhaled

All of these conclusions regarding the relationship between crack and social outcomes must be qualified
with the important caveat that we are describing correlations in the data, rather than clear causal links.

cocaine emerged as a popular but high-priced recreational drug. The street price of pure powder
cocaine was roughly $100 to $200 per gram (which is equivalent to $300-$600 per gram in 2004
dollars). The high price of cocaine had two important implications: (1) cocaine use was
concentrated among the affluent, and (2) retail cocaine purchases required hundreds of dollars
because it was impractical to transact in fractions of grams.9
Crack cocaine is a variation of cocaine made by dissolving powder cocaine in water,
adding baking soda, and heating. The cocaine and the baking powder form an airy condensate,
that when dried, takes the form of hard, smokeable “rocks.”10 A pebble-sized piece of crack,
which contains roughly one-tenth a gram of pure cocaine, sells for $10 on the street and provides
an intense high, but one that lasts only fifteen minutes.
Crack is an important technological innovation in many regards. First, crack can be
smoked, which is an extremely effective means of delivering the drug psychopharmacologically.
Second, because crack is composed primarily of air and baking soda, it is possible to sell in small
units containing fractions of a gram of pure cocaine, opening up the market to consumers
wishing to spend $10 at a time. Third, because the drug is extremely addictive and the high that
comes from taking the drug is so short-lived, crack quickly generated a large following of users
wishing to purchase at high rates of frequency. The profits associated with selling crack quickly
eclipsed that of other drugs. Furthermore, unlike most other drugs, crack is often sold in openair, high-volume markets between sellers and buyers who do not know one another.
There are three primary reasons why crack may have been so devastating to the Black
community. First, street gangs, which already controlled outdoor spaces, became the logical
sellers of crack (Venkatesh and Levitt 2000). Gang violence, primarily as a means of

establishing and maintaining property rights, grew dramatically, and potentially accounts for the
sharp rise in Black youth violence. Second, the increased returns associated with drug dealing
attracted young Black males to gangs and may have reduced educational investment. Third, a
large fraction of crack users were young women. Prostitution was common among female crack
addicts, potentially accelerating the spread of AIDS and the unwanted birth of low birth weight
“crack babies.”11 Crack addicted mothers and fathers are unlikely to provide nurturing home
environments for their children (and often ended up incarcerated), leading to the relinquishment
of parental rights.

Section III: Data
We analyze data separately at the city-level and the state-level. The city-level analysis is
carried out on the 144 cities with population greater than 100,000 in 1980. These cities are of
particular interest because anecdotal evidence suggests that the problems associated with crack
were concentrated in large urban areas. In addition, a number of the variables we use are
collected at the city-level, making it a natural unit of analysis. Focusing on the state-level allows
us to analyze outcome variables that are not available at the city level, and facilitates a linkage
between our work and the large empirical literature carried out using state-level data. In all
cases, annual data are used for the period 1980 to 2000.
As noted earlier, we utilize a range of measures to proxy for the prevalence of crack.12
At the city-level, these outcomes are crack-related emergency room visits, cocaine-related

11

Note, however, that the consensus in the recent medical literature is that there are few long term effects of crack
exposure in utero after controlling for the mother’s alcohol and tobacco consumption. (Frank et. al. 2001,
Zuckerman, Frank, and Mayes 2002).
12
The exact data sources, definitions, and construction of each of the variables are described in greater detail in the
appendix.

arrests, the frequency of crack cocaine mentions in newspapers, DEA drug buys and seizures
involving cocaine, and cocaine-related deaths. The emergency room data are based on
information from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). These data initially covered 14
cities, with that number growing to 19 by the end of the sample. In later years, these data
distinguish between crack and powder cocaine, but for consistency over the whole period, we do
not exploit this variation.13 The proxy we use is cocaine-related emergency room visits per
capita in the metropolitan area. Arrest data are collected by city police departments and are
available through the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. Because of incomplete reporting, we
follow Levitt (1998) and define our cocaine arrest measure as cocaine arrests as a fraction of
total arrests in the city.14 Our measure of crack cocaine mentions in newspapers is the number of
news articles in Lexis-Nexis with a city’s name and the words “crack” and “cocaine,” divided by
the total number of articles with the city's name and the word “crime.” By constructing the
variable as a ratio, we avoid obvious problems associated with the fact that large cities and those
with local newspapers included in Lexis-Nexis will appear much more frequently in the
database. The frequency of DEA drug buys and seizures per capita is taken from the System to
Retrieve Drug Evidence (STRIDE) data base, which catalogs undercover drug buys and seizures
carried out by DEA agents and informants, typically in support of criminal prosecutions. These
data include approximately 274,000 cocaine transactions. The city in which the transaction
occurred is recorded in the data set. STRIDE does not allow one to definitively distinguish
between powder and crack cocaine.15 The final proxy for crack that we use is the rate per capita

13

In an earlier version of this paper, we presented estimates in which we did attempt to differentiate between powder
and crack cocaine, obtaining similar results.
14
Arrests for powder versus crack cocaine are not reported separately in the FBI data.
15
The data set includes separate drug codes for cocaine, cocaine hydrochloride, and a variety of cocaine salts. There
does appear to be a pattern of classifying crack cocaine, which has the hydrocholoride portion of the molecule
removed, as cocaine. It seems, however, that powder cocaine is also sometimes classified under the code “cocaine.”

of cocaine-related deaths, drawn from the annual Mortality Detail File produced by the National
Center for Health Statistics. The death data include accidental poisonings, suicides, and deaths
due to long-term abuse for which cocaine use was coded by physicians as a primary or
contributing factor. We cannot distinguish between crack cocaine and powder cocaine drug
deaths in these data.
Each of these proxies suffers from important weaknesses. First, with the exception of the
newspaper citations, the measures are unable to clearly differentiate between powder and crack
cocaine. Second, both the cocaine arrest and DEA drug buy data are affected not just by the
prevalence of crack usage, but also by the intensity of government enforcement efforts (see, for
example, Horowitz 2001). Third, the DAWN emergency room data covers only a small set of
metropolitan areas and the sample of hospitals that participates changes over time (Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2003 Appendix B). Both the emergency
room data and the drug death data are potentially affected by the subjective nature of physician
determination of the contribution of cocaine to an emergency room visit or a death. Finally, the
newspaper citation measure is the output of a relatively crude algorithm and suffers both from
the criticism that in the early years of the epidemic there were other terms such as “rock cocaine”
that were sometimes used to describe the product before crack cocaine became the agreed upon
nomenclature, and also that the newsworthiness of crack-related stories may have declined over
time, while consumption continued to rise.
The number of observations, means, and standard deviations for all of these city-level
crack proxies are presented in the top panel of Table 1. Values are reported separately for the
period prior to and after 1985, the year when crack use is believed to have become widespread.
All of these indicators are much higher in the post-1985 period, even for those measures that do

11

not directly distinguish between powder and crack cocaine. Crack mentions in newspapers are
extremely low prior to 1985; these instances likely represent false positives in our Lexis-Nexis
algorithm.16 Note that the number of observations available varies dramatically across measures
due to differences in the cities covered by the data, as well as the years in which data are
collected. The data appendix describes the statistical corrections that are done to account for
missing values in the construction of our crack index.
When conducting our analysis at the state level, we drop the emergency room and crack
citation variables since these measures are available only for a limited number of large cities.
The rest of our city-level measures are available at the state-level. The state-level crack proxies
are shown in the second panel of Table 1. The absolute levels of the crack proxies are generally
lower in states than in large cities, but the patterns are otherwise similar.
The final two panels of Table 1 report the criminal, social, and economic outcomes that
we are trying to explain using our crack index at the city-level and state-level respectively.
These outcomes include age specific homicide rates, the full set of violent and property crimes
tracked in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, fetal death, low-birth weight babies, teen births and
unwed births, death rates of children aged one to four, weapons arrests, the number of new
admissions to prison, the per capita number of children in the foster care system, the
unemployment rate, and the poverty rate. When the data are available we analyze these variables
separately by race. Some of the variables are available at the state-level only.

Section III: Identifying Crack

16

For instance, a newspaper story that reported a cocaine addict, while in the process of committing a crime, got
cracked over the head by a police baton, would erroneously register as a crack mention using our methodology.

12

The prevalence of crack cocaine is not directly observable. Instead, we must rely on
noisy proxies in an attempt to measure crack. The primary approach that we take for extracting
the information available in these proxies is to construct a single index measure of crack using
factor analysis.17 In particular, we estimate an equation of the form:
Yist = β i Crack st + ε ist

(1)

where the subscripts i, s, and t correspond to particular proxy measures, geographic units, and
years respectively. The left-hand-side variables are the proxy measures all of which are stacked
into a single vector. The variable Crack is not directly observed, but rather estimated along with
the β ' s . One could also include covariates on the right-hand side of equation (1) – indeed we

allow for city-fixed effects in our baseline estimates – but for simplicity we omit these covariates
from the formal discussion.
Estimation of equation (1) generates predicted values both for a set of factors (Crackst)
and a set of coefficients (also known as loadings) βi. We focus our analysis on the single factor
that has the greatest explanatory power. Because our proxies are highly correlated, our data are
well-described by a one-factor model – capturing roughly 50% of the variation in the proxies.18
Additional factors contribute little in terms of explaining the observed variation in our data.
The factor with the greatest explanatory power is what we will call “crack,” but more accurately
it is the single index that explains the largest share of the variation in our crack proxies. The
loadings tell us the degree to which each estimated factor influences the different outcome

17

This is similar to how psychometricians measure “intelligence” (g) – taking the results of several individual
aptitude tests and determining the single factor that best explains the covariance in these related proxies.
Mathematically, factor analysis identifies the eigenvectors (the factors) and corresponding eigenvalues (the
loadings) of the variance-covariance matrix of the Y variables.
18
We follow standard practice of normalizing proxy measures included on the left-hand side to have mean zero and
variance one whenever we do factor analysis.

13

variables. The crack index we obtain is a weighted average of the proxy variables underlying it,
with weights given by the squares of the loadings on each proxy.
There are three advantages to combining our multiple measures into a single index. First,
we are interested in describing the observed patterns of crack’s arrival and fluctuations. Having
one summary measure of crack rather than five separate proxies greatly simplifies this task.
Second, because each of our individual proxy measures is quite noisy, combining them into a
single index substantially increases the signal-to-noise ratio. For instance, in the simplest case
where βi =1 for each proxy, the share of the variance in a given measure that is attributable to a
2
2
2
true signal is σ crack
/(σ crack
+ σ ε2i ) , where σ crack
and σ ε2i are the variance of the latent crack factor

and the measurement error in proxy i respectively. Under the assumption that the measurement
errors across proxies are i.i.d, the signal-to-total variance ratio of an equally-weighted index of N
proxies is

2
σ crack

N

A third possible benefit of using a single crack index arises when we turn to estimating
the impact of crack on outcomes such as low-birth weight babies or crime rates. Although it
might seem that putting each of the individual proxies directly on the right-hand side of such
regressions would be preferable (see, for example Lubotsky and Wittenberg 2004), in the
plausible scenario in which one or more of our individual proxies may be endogenous to a
particular outcome of interest (e.g. when Black youth homicide is on the rise, police departments
may respond by intensifying enforcement against drug sellers, holding constant overall crack
use), use of an index provides potential benefits by imposing the restriction that each of the
proxies has an identical impact on the outcome variable. If the proxies were each entered
19

If measurement error is positively correlated across proxies, then the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio is
less pronounced. The opposite is true if the measurement error is negatively correlated across proxies.

14

separately as explanatory variables, one might greatly overstate the role of crack in explaining
fluctuations in social outcomes.
In estimating the impact of crack on social outcomes, an attractive alternative to
constructing a single index is to instead use the various proxies as instrumental variables for one
another. To the extent that the proxies are correlated with the underlying latent variable crack,
but the measurement error in the proxies is uncorrelated, the various crack measures are
plausible instruments for one another. We present results both using our single index proxy and
using an instrumental variables approach.20
One unique feature of our data that we have not yet emphasized, but proves extremely
valuable in our analysis, is the fact that crack cocaine was a technological innovation which was
virtually unknown until around 1985. This provides us with a well defined pre-crack period. To
the extent that our proxies/index are truly reflecting crack, they should have values near zero in
the pre-1985 period. In addition, variation in the proxies prior to 1985 is likely to be almost
purely measurement error. Comparing the variation in the proxies before and after crack arrives
will provide useful insights into the extent to which fluctuations in our proxies after 1985 can
plausibly be viewed as signal rather than noise.21

Section IV: The Prevalence of Crack Across Time and Space

Table 2 presents correlations across the various crack proxies we use in the analysis. The
top panel of the table reports correlations across time for the national aggregates of the proxies.
20

Note, however, that this instrumental variables strategy is a possible solution to the measurement error problem,
but not to any possible endogeneity in the crack measure, as we discuss later.
21
The existence of a pre-crack period also allows us the opportunity to estimate our factor analysis on the pre-period
data only, isolating any common factors that are moving the crack proxies before crack arrives. One can then
remove these pre-existing factors in constructing a crack index. In practice, this has little impact on our results. An
earlier version of this paper, available from the authors, describes this exercise and the underlying assumptions in
detail.

15

Given how similar the time-series patterns are for these variables in Figure 3, it is not surprising
that these correlations are high, ranging from .225 to .951. The mean of the off-diagonal
elements is equal to .71. The middle panel of the table presents correlations using either the cityyear or the state-year as the unit of analysis. City-fixed effects and state-fixed effects have been
removed to eliminate systematic and persistent reporting differences across areas. The
correlation across the proxies falls, but remains substantial. For both the city and the state
sample, all the pairwise correlations remain positive and the mean of the off-diagonal elements is
.32 for cities and .36 for states. In other words, when a city or state is high relative to its usual
value on one of the proxies in a given year, it tends to be high on all of them – consistent with
the hypothesis that a single factor is driving the increase. The bottom panel of the table reports
correlations at the city-year and state-year level after removing not only city or state fixedeffects, but also all of the aggregate time series variation using year dummies. Consequently, the
correlations in the bottom panel reflect whether a city-year or state-year observation that is high
relative to the rest of the sample in that year on one proxy also tends to be high on the other
proxies. These correlations are much lower than the others shown in the table. The mean offdiagonal element in the city sample falls to only .07; in the state sample it is .15. The DEA
cocaine busts and the newspaper citation index perform particularly poorly. These results
highlight the fact that the co-movement of our proxy variables is due in large part to the fact that
across many areas, all the proxies tend to be high in some years and low in others.
Table 3 presents our baseline estimates of the loadings obtained using factor analysis.
The greater is the value corresponding to a particular proxy, the more influence it is given in
constructing the crack index. 22 The factor loadings can be negative, although that is not the case

22

The scaling of the loadings is arbitrary; we follow the standard normalization which is to make the square of the
loadings sum to one. In constructing a crack index that is a weighted average of the underlying proxies, the weights

16

for any of our analysis. We report five sets of estimates corresponding to the correlation
matrices in Table 3: national aggregates (column 1), city-level data (columns 2 and 3), and statelevel data (columns 4 and 5). At the city and state level, we report results before and after yearfixed effects have been removed. For the national aggregates, the loadings are relatively equal
across the five proxies. The same is true at the city level before removing year-fixed effects
(column 2), except that the DEA cocaine busts proxy receives less weight than the others. When
year-fixed effects are taken out, more weight is given to cocaine deaths at the expense of
cocaine-related ER visits and, to a lesser extent, crack-related newspaper citations. At the state
level, cocaine arrests and cocaine deaths both get high weight and DEA drug busts are given
more influence after year-fixed effects are removed.
Figure 4 presents population-weighted crack indexes that correspond to the factor
analysis loadings for the national-level, city-level and state-level analysis in Table 3. We show
results for the specifications without year-fixed effects; the patterns are similar for the other
specifications. The crack index is identified only up to a scale of proportionality, so the absolute
units of the crack measure are not directly interpretable, nor can they be directly compared across
the three figures.
Our results regarding the time-series pattern of crack are not particularly sensitive to the
level of aggregation used in the analysis. In all three cases, the crack index is low but rising
slightly until 1985, at which point there is a sharp increase to a peak in 1989. The timing of
crack’s rise that we estimate corresponds nicely with the anecdotal evidence regarding the
introduction of crack cocaine in the mid-1980s and its rapid proliferation. Our estimation
technique in no way constrains the estimated crack prevalence to be low in the early years of the

one would use are the square root of the loadings we report in the table. After taking the square root of these values,
the sum of the weights would add to one.

data; this result is driven purely by the data. The one noticeable difference between the three
indexes is the pattern from 1989-2000. In the top figure using national aggregate data, the index
falls almost 50 percent between 1989 and the end of the sample. In the city-level and state-level
samples the decline is about 25 percent, with much of the decline coming in latter half of the
1990’s. Regardless of the index, one perhaps surprising result is that our crack index remains so
high in 2000, a time in which many casual observers had declared the crack epidemic to have
faded. Survey measures of crack usage, however, reinforce our conclusion that crack has not
disappeared. The percentage of high school seniors reporting having used crack in the last
twelve months fell roughly 30 percent (from 3.1 to 2.2 percent) between 1989 and 2000
(Johnston et al 2004). Eighth and tenth graders in the same survey, who were not asked about
crack usage until 1990, reported the highest incidence of annual crack usage in 1999. There is
also evidence that sharp declines in the price of crack have led those who use crack to consume it
in greater quantities (MacCoun and Reuter 2001).
Existing evidence suggests that the impact of crack has been much greater on Blacks and
Hispanics than on Whites. Because most of our proxy variables are not available separately by
race, we are forced to take an indirect approach to identifying a race-specific crack index. Under
the assumption that the loadings on the crack proxies are the same for Blacks and Whites, using
the available data we can estimate a model in which the impact of crack varies by race. The
overall per capita impact of crack in a city (or state) and year can be decomposed into
(2)

Crackst = λtBlack PstBlack + λtHispanic PstHispanic + λtWhite PstWhite + ε st

where the P variables represent population shares by race and the λ coefficients are race- and
city-specific crack estimates. λ captures how our crack index varies across cities at a given point
of time as a function of the racial composition of the city; λ is the value the crack index would

18

take in a hypothetical city all of whose residents were of the race in question. That coefficient
does not necessarily directly reflect the relative rates of crack usage across individuals of
different races if, for example, the presence of more Blacks in a city is associated with higher
crack use by Whites. To estimate the relative impact of crack by race, we run a separate crosssectional regression for each year with the crack index as the left-hand-side variable and race
proportions as the right-hand-side variables, omitting a constant.
The results of this estimation are reported in Figure 5. For both city- and state-level
analyses, crack among Blacks rises until 1989 and then remains relatively steady thereafter. In
large cities, the estimated crack index for Whites is consistently 5-10 times lower than Blacks.
In the state-level sample, Blacks are again much higher than Whites, and in both samples
Hispanics appear roughly comparable to Blacks.
Figures 6 and 7 present crack estimates by region and size of central city respectively. In
Figure 6, the Northeast experienced the greatest crack problem, followed by the West. In Figure
7, the time series pattern for crack in cities above and below 350,000 residents is quite similar,
except that the crack levels are more than twice as high in the larger cites.23
Table 4 reports the cities and states in our sample with the highest and lowest estimated
average crack prevalence over the period 1985-2000.24 Because our estimates are noisy at the
city-level and the state-level due to substantial measurement error in our proxies, precise
rankings must be viewed with the appropriate caution. The set of cities with the greatest crack
problem includes cities one might expect: Newark, Philadelphia, New York, and Oakland, for
instance. Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle, however, are perhaps surprising. Other cities one

The patterns observed in Figures 5-7 continue to hold if we simultaneously control for racial composition and the
other factors like region and city size.

would expect to rank high such as New Orleans, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles
also rank highly, but are not in the top ten. Among states, Maryland and New York head the list.
The cities with the least evidence of crack tend to be smaller, geographically isolated cities, but
not exclusively cities with low Black populations. Huntsville and Jackson, two of cities with the
very low crack estimates, for example, are thirty and seventy percent Black respectively. The
states with low crack tend to have large rural populations and few minorities.

Section V: The Impact of Crack Cocaine

In this section, we attempt to measure the impact that crack had on society by regressing
a variety of outcome measures on our estimated crack index and varying combinations of
covariates:
(3)

Outcome st = β * CrackIndex st + ZstΓ + λ s + γ t + εst

where CrackIndex is one of the crack indices we estimated above, and s corresponds to a
geographic area (either national, state, or city), and t represents time. One important point to
note is that our crack index is a measure of the severity of crack in an area as a whole. This
severity can represent both the composition of the population as well as the intensity of use per
person. For instance, since crack use appears to be more prevalent among Blacks than Whites, if
two cities have the same value on the crack index, but one city has a higher proportion of Whites,
the implication is that crack use per Black and crack use per White are likely to be higher in that
city than the other city. Consequently, when we examine socio-economic outcomes as
dependent variables, the logical specification involves defining outcomes in terms of rates per
overall city population. For example, when we examine Black youth homicide, the dependent

20

variable we use is Black youth homicides per 100,000 city residents, not Black youth homicides
per Black youth.25
There are two obvious shortcomings associated with the simple OLS approach that we
adopt. The first is that our crack index may suffer from measurement error, which will bias the
estimates of crack’s impact, most likely in a downward direction. The second weakness of this
approach is that the estimates we obtain reflect correlations, rather than true causal impacts. It is
possible that omitted variables such as the erosion of social networks or the decline of two-parent
households affects both crack and outcomes like homicide or children in foster care.
Instrumenting one proxy using the others provides a means of dealing with the issue of
measurement error, under the assumption that the measurement error in the different proxies are
uncorrelated (conditional on the other controls included in the regression). It is important to
note, however, that this instrumenting strategy is unlikely to help in providing estimates that are
directly interpretable as causal in nature. To the extent that omitted variables or reverse causality
lead one of the crack proxies to be correlated with the error term in equation (3), it is likely that
all of the crack proxies will suffer the same weakness.
Table 5 shows results from estimating equation (3) on our city-level sample using the
city-level crack index. Each row of the table corresponds to a different outcome variable. The
first column of the table reports the mean of the dependent variable in the sample; because our
outcomes are denominated by the entire city population (not just Blacks or Whites depending on
which race we are looking at), the reported means for both races are less than if the variables
were per member of the group. Because Blacks make up a smaller percentage of the population,
25

Imposing the further assumption that the ratio of crack’s incidence across Whites and Blacks is constant across
areas in a given year, we have also constructed an index of the crack intensity in a city controlling for racial
composition. This measure of intensity more closely corresponds to the crack variable that one would use as a righthand-side variable when using individual-level data, and is available for download at our website. The results we
obtain are quite similar.

21

the reported means are particularly small relative to a rate per capita for Blacks. We allow the
estimated coefficient on the crack index to vary by time period; columns 2-5 of the table report
the coefficients for the periods 1985-1989, 1990-1994, and 1995-2000 respectively.26 All
specifications include city-fixed effects, year dummies, and controls for percent of the population
that is Black and Hispanic, log population, and log per capita income. Standard errors, shown in
parentheses, take into account AR1 serial correlation within cities over time.
The top panel of Table 5 reports outcomes for Blacks. The crack index is positively and
significantly associated with seven of the nine outcomes we examine in the 1985-1989 time
period. The estimates are statistically significant at the .01 level for five of the nine positive
outcomes, but for neither of the negative point estimates. A similar pattern of estimates is
present in the 1990-1994 period. After 1995, however, the link between the crack index and
these social outcomes for Blacks disappears--more than half of the point estimates become
negative in the last period, and only the male age 18-24 homicide rate has a positive and
significant coefficients. The middle panel of Table 5 shows city-level estimates for Whites.
Although the crack index is generally positively correlated with these outcomes after 1985 (22 of
the 27 point estimates are positive), only 5 of the 27 coefficients are statistically different than
zero. The bottom panel of the table analyzes results for overall crime rates, which are not
separately available by race. The crack index is positively and significantly correlated with all of
the crime categories from 1985-1989 and seven of the nine categories from 1990-1994, but the
estimated coefficients decline in magnitude and statistical significance in the final period for all
categories of crime.

26

The crack index is close to zero and exhibits little variation prior to 1985, leading to unstable, imprecisely
estimated coefficients in the early part of our sample. Thus, we do not report results for 1980-1984.

22

To aid in interpreting the magnitude of the effects implied by the coefficients in Table 5,
we report graphically the fraction of the observed variation in the outcomes that can be
accounted for by the crack index over the period in which crack rose sharply (1984-1989) in
Figure 8, and from the peak of crack to the end of the sample (usually 1989-2000) in Figure 9.
In these figures, we compare the observed percent changes for the crime and birth-related
outcomes over these time periods to the implied impact of crack calculated in one of two ways:
(1) using the crack index as in Table 5, and (2) instrumenting for cocaine arrests using the other
crack proxies as instruments.27 The implied impact of crack from the OLS specification in a
particular year is the product of the regression coefficient in Table 5 multiplied by the average
value of the crack index in that year. The impact of crack between 1984 and 1989 is simply the
difference between the measured impact of crack in 1989 and in 1984. Calculating the impact of
crack in the instrumental variables regressions is done in a similar manner, with the added
complication related to measurement error in the cocaine arrests proxy.28 The corresponding
standard error bands are shown in the figure as well.

27

One could also instrument with each of the remaining crack proxies individually, but because of missing data in
some of our proxies, the index approach is preferable in our setting. The results are not sensitive to using a different
one of the crack proxies as the right-hand side variable.
28
More specifically, only a portion of the observed variation in cocaine arrests is attributable to variation in crack
usage if there is measurement error in cocaine arrests. Assume that cocaine arrests are determined by a latent
variable crack and noise, and that our estimated crack index using all of the proxies except cocaine arrests also
reflects a combination of movements in crack and noise. Further assume that the error terms in these two measures
are uncorrelated, and that these errors are also uncorrelated with the error term in equation (3). Then a consistent
estimate of the impact of cocaine arrests can be obtained from two-stage least squares using the index as an
instrument. In the standard application, one would then compute the overall impact of a change in cocaine arrests as
the product of the change in cocaine arrests multiplied by the estimated coefficient from two-stage least squares. In
computing the impact of crack (as opposed to cocaine arrests per se) in equation (3), however, we only wants to use
the portion of the variation in cocaine arrests driven by crack. It can be shown that algebraically this equates to
scaling down the full variation in cocaine arrests by the signal to signal- plus-noise ratio in cocaine arrests. This
signal to signal-plus-noise ratio can be computed from the variance-covariance matrix of the crack proxies,
combined with a scaling adjustment across proxies that can be inferred from the ratio of the IV estimates when one
proxy is used as the instrument and the other variable is instrumented versus when the roles of the two variables are
reversed.

23

A number of important points emerge from Figure 8. First, comparing the columns
shaded white (OLS estimates) and the columns shaded black (instrumental variables estimates),
in most cases the IV estimates are larger than the OLS estimates, although less precisely
estimated. These generally larger IV estimates are consistent with the presence of measurement
error in our index, leading to attenuation bias in our OLS results. Second, the magnitude of the
actual percentage increase in homicide rates among young Black males is far greater than for the
other variables considered. Our measure of crack cocaine explains a substantial part of this
increase, particularly in the instrumental variables specifications. According to our estimates,
crack can account for a 100-155 percent increase in Black male homicides among those aged 1417, and a change of 40-105 percent for Black male homicide among those aged 18-24. In
contrast, our crack measure accounts for only small changes in older Black male homicide and
White homicide. Third, for the birth/childhood outcomes, the impact of crack is larger for
Blacks than for Whites, but the results are not as stark as for homicide. We estimate that the rise
in crack between 1984 and 1989 accounts for roughly one-third of the increase in low birth
weight Black babies, less than one-third of the Black rate of unwed births, much or all of the
increase in Black child mortality and fetal death. For Whites, there is some apparent positive
association between crack and low birth weight babies and child mortality. Finally, we find a
positive relationship between crack and a wide range of crimes, although the magnitude is small
when compared to the impact on Black youth homicide. In the OLS specifications, violent crime
and property crime are both estimated to have increased by roughly 4 percent due to crack over
the period 1984-1989; in the IV specifications the increase is approximately 10 percent, but very
imprecisely estimated.

24

Figure 9 shows the estimated impact of changes in crack on the same set of outcomes for
the period 1989-2000. One-half to three-fourths of the decline in homicide by Black males aged
14-17 can be attributed to the combined impact of a decline in the level of the crack index, and
more importantly, the weakening of the link between crack and violence. By the year 2000,
most of the crack-related spike in youth homicide in the late 1980s was gone--because the
baseline level of youth homicide is almost three times higher in 1989 than in 1984, a 34 percent
decrease in the latter period is equal and opposite to almost a 100 percent increase in the earlier
period in terms of number of homicides. For older criminals and Whites, the impact of receding
crack does not consistently explain a substantial fraction of the observed homicide declines in the
1990s. For Blacks, the adverse effects of crack on birth outcomes in the 1980s are essentially
undone in the 1990s. The impacts on White birth outcomes are small and carry mixed signs. For
city-level crime measures, the reductions attributable to crack in the 1990s erase much, but often
not all, of the crack-driven increases in the 1980s. The notable exception to this pattern is the IV
estimate on violent crime, which suggests that violent crime rose (although not statistically
significantly) in the 1990s as crack receded (because the estimated impact of crack on violent
crime is negative in the 1990s).
Table 6 replicates the analysis of Table 5, but using states as the unit of analysis rather
than our sample of large cities. The regression results in Table 5 are quite similar to what we
found for large cities; crack has the greatest impact on Black youth homicide, tends to be
positively related to adverse birth outcomes for Blacks and is not significantly related to most
outcomes for Whites. The impact of crack once again weakens over time. One important
difference relative to the city sample is that overall crime is not positively and statistically related
to crack in the state sample. In addition, there is less evidence of a strong impact of crack on

25

Black birth outcomes outside of the large cities. A number of additional outcome measures are
available at the state level: foster care rates, new prison commitments, unemployment rates, and
poverty rates. None of these outcomes reveals a pattern suggestive of an important impact of
crack in the expected direction. The negative relationship between crack and new prison
commitments, while perhaps surprising given the enormous increase in drug-related
incarceration over this period, hints at the possibility that aggressive punishment of drug sellers
may have reduced the severity of the crack epidemic. In other words, the negative coefficient in
the prison regression may primarily reflect reverse causality running from imprisonment to
crack, rather than vice versa.
Figures 10 and 11 report the fraction of the observed variation in the outcomes at the state
level that can be explained by the crack index for the periods 1984-1989, and 1989-2000. Not
surprisingly given that crack was concentrated in large cities, the rise and fall of crack has less
explanatory value at the state level. For instance, the crack index explains less than one-third of
the overall rise in young Black male homicide at the state level, and only one-fifth of the increase
in Black low birth weight babies. Overall, comparing the results in Figures 8-11, and noting that
about 16 percent of the U.S. population resides in cities included in our city sample, we estimate
that about 70 percent of the adverse impact of crack was felt in large cities, implying that the
rates per capita were at least 10 times higher in large cities than in the rest of the country.

Section VI: Conclusion

A number of social, criminological, and economic variables experienced negative shocks
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly among Blacks. We find evidence consistent with
the hypothesis that the rise of crack cocaine played an important contributing role. To overcome

26

the absence of a reliable quantitative measure of crack, we construct a crack index based on a set
of imperfect, but plausible proxies. This crack index reproduces many of patterns described in
journalistic and ethnographic accounts including the timing of the crack epidemic and the
disproportionate impact on Blacks and Hispanics. We find a strong link between our measure of
crack and increased homicide rates by the young, especially among Blacks, in the late 1980s.
During that time period, our crack index is also associated with adverse outcomes for babies –
especially Black babies. By the early 1990s, however, the relationship between crack and
unwelcome social outcomes had largely disappeared. Thus, though crack use persisted at high
levels, it did so with relatively minor measurable social consequences. This finding is consistent
with an initially high level of crack-related violence as markets responded to the changes in
distribution methods associated with the technological shock that crack represented. After
property rights were established and crack prices fell sharply reducing the profitability of the
business, competition-related violence among drug dealers declined.
One explanation for the weakening relationship between the crack index and birth
outcomes is the changing composition of crack users. Following its introduction, crack use was
overwhelmingly a drug of adolescents and young adults, and its use was widespread. For
instance, 7.2 percent of respondents in the National Household Survey on Drug Use and Health
(SAMHSA 2003b) who were 18-22 in 1985 report lifetime crack usage, compared to only 2.8
percent of those who were 33-37 years old in 1985. Later cohorts also use crack at much lower
rates than the first cohorts exposed to crack. In 2002, 0.6 percent of the age group that was 1822 in 1985 (and by 2002 was 35-39 years old) had used crack in the last month. In stark contrast,
less than 0.2 percent of the 18-22 year olds in 2002 report using crack in the prior month. As
crack addicts aged, fewer were in the high fertility age group. Presumably, as the dangers of

27

crack to the fetus became clear, women intending to get pregnant may have avoided crack and
those using crack may have been less likely to take a pregnancy to term.
If the rise of crack indeed exerted an important influence on social outcomes over the last
two decades, then an obvious concern is that studies examining these outcomes which fail to
adequately control for crack may generate misleading conclusions. Ayres and Donohue (2003),
for instance, conjecture that the findings of Lott and Mustard (1997) and Lott (2000) regarding
the impact of concealed weapons laws are spurious, driven by the omitted variable crack cocaine.
Sailer (1999) and Joyce (2004) level the same charges at Donohue and Levitt’s (2001) analysis
of the impact of legalized abortion on crime. An important application of the crack index we
construct is as a control variable in future research.

* Cocaine deaths include accidental poisonings, suicides, and other deaths for which cocaine use was coded as a primary or contributing factor. Prior
to 1989, deaths were classified using the International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9); starting in 1999 deaths were coded using the
10th revision. Cocaine death entries under ICD-9 include ICD codes 8552, 3042, and 3056 as well as ICD codes 8501-8699, 9501-9529, 9620-9629,
972, 9801-9879, 3050-3054, 3057-3059 with a secondary code of 9685. Cocaine deaths under ICD-10 include codes F140-F149 and F190-F199,
X42, X44, X62, X64, X85, Y12, and Y14 with secondary code T405. For more information on counting drug-related deaths see Lois Fingerhut &
Christine Cox, "Poisoning mortality, 1985-1995", Public Health Reports 113:3, 1998.
** Cocaine busts were defined as busts with primary drug code 9041 and secondary drug codes L000, L005, L010, L269, L900, and L920

Estimating the Crack Index

The procedure for estimating the crack index is:
1. Remove city or state fixed effects from each of the crack proxies. Readjust each proxy to have
a grand mean of 0 during the period from 1980-1984.
2. Normalize each of the proxies to have unit variance. This eliminates differences in units of
measure across proxies.
3. The factor loadings (Γi) and scores (Zst) satisfy the relationship:
Yist = ZstΓi + εist

(1)

Here i indexes a proxies, s a location, and t a time period. We require a scale restriction to
separately identify the loadings and scores. In our analysis, we impose that the sum of the
squared loadings is one.
4. Select an initial value for the loadings.
5. Stack each of the available proxies at a particular location/time. Use least squares regression
across the proxies to estimate the value of the crack index (score) at each location/time. These
regressions are within a location/time, across measures.
6. The squared loadings measure the extent to which each of the proxies contributes to the
overall crack index. To account for missing data, at each location/time, multiply the scores
2
calculated in step 5 by ∑ γ i , where γi represents the loading associated with proxy i and the
i

summation is made over all available proxies at that location/time.
7. Regress each proxy on the scores calculated in step 5 to generate a new estimate of the loading
associated with that proxy. These regressions are within a particular measure, across
locations/times.
8. Re-normalize the estimated loadings to satisfy the scale restriction.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 until the loadings converge.29
10. Test multiple initial choices for loadings to ensure that the convergent result is optimal in the
sense of minimizing the sum of the squared residuals in (1).
It is important to note that constructed in this manner the absolute mean and variance of the
crack index are arbitrary.

29

Although the paper reports estimates of a single factor model, for verification purposes we also estimated models
allowing for multiple factors (i.e. Γi and Zst are vectors). With multiple factors the estimated loadings and scores are
unique only up to a rotation. The algorithm described will not converge unless a specific rotation is imposed at each
stage of estimation.

The national correlations are the correlations across time of national aggregate annual values of the five crack proxies. The city correlations are
correlations across location and time for the 144 U.S. cities with population above 100000 in 1980. The state correlations are correlations across
location and time for the 50 U.S. states. The data spans the years 1980-2000.

The table reports results of factor analysis to extract the first principle component of the five crack proxies. Each of the proxies was standardized
to have unit variance over the period 1980-2000 and a grand mean of zero from 1980-1984 prior to estimation of the loadings. The loadings are
restricted to have a squared sum of 1. The "% of Variation" row reports the percentage of the total variance in the transformed variables that can
be explained by the first principle component. The city sample includes U.S. cities with a population above 100000 in 1980. The city and state
estimates remove city or state fixed effects prior to factor analysis. Columns 3 and 5 also remove year fixed effects from each of the measures
prior to factor analysis.

The “Coefficient” columns report estimated coefficients from OLS regressions of the outcome measures on the crack index interacted with indicator variables for the
years 1985-1989, 1990-1994, and 1995-2000. The regressions include controls for percent of the population Hispanic, percent of the population Black, log population,
and log per capita income as well as city and year fixed effects. Standard errors are in parenthesis. * denotes significance at the 5% level; ** denotes significance at the
1% level. The OLS estimates were corrected to allow AR(1) serial correlation in the error terms. The coefficient on crack in the 1980-84 period is imprecisely
estimated due to the small amount of variation in crack during this period and is omitted from the table.

The “Coefficient” columns report estimated coefficients from OLS regressions of the outcome measures on the crack index interacted with indicator variables for the
years 1985-1989, 1990-1994, and 1995-2000. The regressions include controls for percent of the population Hispanic, percent of the population Black, log population,
and log per capita income as well as state and year fixed effects. Standard errors are in parenthesis. * denotes significance at the 5% level; ** denotes significance at
the 1% level. The OLS estimates were corrected to allow AR(1) serial correlation in the error terms. The coefficient on crack in the 1980-84 period is imprecisely
estimated due to the small amount of variation in crack during this period and is omitted from the table.

calculating the implied impact of crack using IV, only the portion of the observed variation in cocaine arrests attributable to variation in crack is
relevant. It can be shown that algebraically this equates to scaling down the full variation in cocaine arrests by the signal to signal- plus-noise
ratio in cocaine arrests. This signal to signal-plus-noise ratio can be computed from the variance-covariance matrix of the crack proxies,
combined with a scaling adjustment across proxies that can be inferred from the ratio of the IV estimates when one proxy is used as the
instrument and the other variable is instrumented versus when the roles of the two variables are reversed. OLS and IV regressions include
controls for percent of the population Hispanic, percent of the population Black, log population, and log per capita income as well as city and
year fixed effects. The whiskers display 95% confidence intervals for the OLS and IV estimated effects. To facilitate comparison of effect sizes
across social outcomes, in some cases confidence intervals were permitted to extend beyond the bounds of the plots. The OLS estimates were
estimated allowing AR(1) serial correlation in the error terms; IV standard errors were obtained via the bootstrap.

† indicates that data are available from 1980 to 1998 only and †† indicates that data are available from 1983 through 1995 only. The leftmost bar
(“Actual Change”) plots the actual percent change in the outcome of interest between 1984 and 1989 with 1984 as the base year. . To obtain the
“OLS Predicted Change Due to Crack” (middle bar), let
the mean crack index in 1989, and

denote the mean value of the outcome of interest in 1989. The predicted change is constructed as

. The IV predicted changes are constructed similarly, except that the coefficients are based on an instrumental

variables strategy in which cocaine arrests are used as the right-hand-side variable in equation (3) and a crack index constructed using the other
crack proxies is used as an instrumental variable. In calculating the implied impact of crack using IV, only the portion of the observed variation
in cocaine arrests attributable to variation in crack is relevant. It can be shown that algebraically this equates to scaling down the full variation in
cocaine arrests by the signal to signal- plus-noise ratio in cocaine arrests. This signal to signal-plus-noise ratio can be computed from the
variance-covariance matrix of the crack proxies, combined with a scaling adjustment across proxies that can be inferred from the ratio of the IV
estimates when one proxy is used as the instrument and the other variable is instrumented versus when the roles of the two variables are reversed.
OLS and IV regressions include controls for percent of the population Hispanic, percent of the population Black, log population, and log per
capita income as well as state and year fixed effects. The whiskers display 95% confidence intervals for the OLS and IV estimated effects. To
facilitate comparison of effect sizes across social outcomes, in some cases confidence intervals were permitted to extend beyond the bounds of
the plots. The OLS estimates were estimated allowing AR(1) serial correlation in the error terms; IV standard errors were obtained via the
bootstrap.
