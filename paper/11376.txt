Does Corporate Ownership Matter? Service Provision in the Hospital Industry

NBER Working Paper No. 11376

JEL No. I1, L3, L2
ABSTRACT
Three types of firms

nonprofit, for-profit, and government

own U.S. hospitals, yet we do not

know whether ownership results in the specialization of medical service provision. This study of
over 30 medical services in urban, general hospitals (1988-2000) shows that ownership types
specialize in medical services according to the profitability of those services. The paper examines
three theories to explain the differences: 1) objectives, 2) capital prices, and 3) market
characteristics. The findings are best explained by differences in the objectives adopted by hospital
types rather than differences in capital constraints faced by them. Preliminary evidence suggests that
hospital behavior depends on the ownership form of neighboring hospitals.

I. Introduction
The question of whether nonprofit firms differ from their for-profit counterparts has
presented a persistent puzzle for law and economics. The hospital industry, in which for-profit,
nonprofit, and government owned organizations operate side by side, has proved fertile ground
for study. Though the empirical evidence has been mixed, much of the research on hospitals has
found behavioral similarities. This is not surprising. Given that these organizations have so
much in common – they all offer medical care, use similar resources, operate under the same
healthcare regulations, employ doctors and nurses who are trained in the same institutions – one
would expect a convergence of behavior, if not firm types.
The empirical results presented here are both new and surprising. Like previous studies,
this paper asks whether hospital types behave differently. Yet, previous research has focused
primarily on financial measures such as differences in costs, profits, billing, the value of
uncompensated care, and responsiveness to financial pressure (for review see Sloan, 2000).
Studying financial behavior yields an incomplete picture of hospital ownership. Scholarship on
medical care and ownership has generally considered single medical interventions. Here, I
examine whether and how organizational ownership is correlated with offering over thirty
hospital services (see Table 1 for service list). I find strikingly large behavioral differences.
The results can be profitably used to examine economic theories on legal ownership.
Here I explore three categories of theories: 1) “objectives theories” that maintain objective
functions differ by ownership; 2) “capital prices theories” that maintain differences in capital
sources constrain firm types to behave differently; 3) “market theories” that suggest firms
respond to the ownership form of their competitors in the same market.

1

I conclude that differences in firm objective functions better explain the behavioral
differences identified here than do differences in capital costs. For-profit hospitals are more
profit-seeking than either nonprofit or public hospitals. Government hospitals aim to provide
needed, but unprofitable, goods to a greater degree than the other types. Nonprofit hospitals are
often in the middle. To some extent, like for-profits, they pursue profits through offering
profitable services and avoiding unprofitable services; to some extent, like public institutions,
they provide for the public need by offering unprofitable, undersupplied services. Further, the
results suggest that nonprofit objectives may not be robust to competitive pressures since the
ownership status of a hospital’s neighbors is correlated with its own medical service offerings.
Identifying differences among ownership types is of practical consequence, both because
of their potential relationship to health outcomes and the money at stake. Expenditures on
hospital care were $486.5 billion dollars (almost 5 percent of GDP) in 2002, and the average
annual percentage growth rate is back on the rise (Heffler et al., 2004). To justify -- or condemn
-- the billions of public dollars that are spent on nonprofit tax-exemptions and other subsidies we
need to know how these public resources are used. While policymakers care a great deal about
corporate ownership, taxation regimes and regulatory approaches have been mixed (for summary
see Horwitz, 2003).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes contending
models of firm ownership. Section III presents the data and the empirical framework. Results
are presented in Section IV, and alternative explanations and sensitivity tests are presented in
Section V. Section VI concludes.

II. Nonprofit Hospital Behavior: Theories and Evidence
Economists, health services researchers, and legal commentators have long debated the
question of whether corporate ownership results in behavioral differences and why. Ownership
models can be categorized into three groups – objective function theories, capital constraint
theories, and market interaction theories.

A. Objectives
The primary theory of ownership status is that for-profits are profit-maximizers.
Compared to other firm types, they are most likely respond to incentives (Danzon, 1982). For
example, they may avoid low-paying patients by differentially locating near hospitals of last
resort (Barro, 1998) or up-coding to generate higher reimbursements (Silverman and Skinner,
2000). There is some evidence that for-profits have had the most success at profit-making. At
least during the 1990s, for-profit hospital margins were greater than those of government and
nonprofit hospitals (Frank and Salkever, 2000). On the contrary, some have claimed no
difference in objectives (Malani and Choi, 2004). Empirical studies have found little difference
regarding hospital costs (Sloan et al., 2001, Snail and Robinson, 1998), the exercise of market
power (Gaynor and Haas-Wilson, 1999), the adoption of technology (Sloan, Picone, Taylor Jr.
and Chou, 2001), or responsiveness to legislation rewarding charity care (Duggan, 2000).
At least relative to for-profits, nonprofit and government hospitals may prioritize goals
other than profit-making. (but see Danzon, 1982). Government hospitals, many of which
descend from almshouses, are required by the agencies that control them to serve the poor
(Altman and Henderson, 1989). Duggan (, 2000), for example, has found few barriers between

3

government hospitals in California and controlling public entities, which reduced public
subsidies in response to hospital revenue increases.
According to most objectives theories, nonprofits, despite being private entities like forprofit firms, are more likely than for-profits to adopt public goals. For example, they may
differentially respond to private (Salamon, 1987) and public (Weisbrod, 1988) market failures in
serving the needy, or maximize quality and quantity over profits (Newhouse, 1970). Rather than
specifying the content nonprofit objective functions, however, most theorists have identified the
mechanisms that cause nonprofits to adopt unique objectives. First, legal constraints, such as the
non-distribution constraint imposed by federal and state tax law (Hansmann, 1980) or charitable
trust and corporations law (Horwitz, 2003), may both encourage, or even force, nonprofit
hospitals to maximize non-financial ends, and signal those ends.
Second, managerial behavior may differ among organizations. Perhaps because they are
not evaluated according to the profits they generate, managers guide firms in seeking rewards
based on criteria like quantity and quality (Newhouse, 1970). Alternatively, the form may attract
special kinds of people. These could be managers who wish to commit to donor preferences for
non-contractible aspects of quality (Glaeser and Shleifer, 2001) or those who hold particularly
altruistic goals (Rose-Ackerman, 1996), such as a desire to cross-subsidize (James and RoseAckerman, 1986). Others suggest that the nonprofit form allows consumers to control the
mission of the institution directly (Ben-Ner, 1983, Ben-Ner and Gui, 1993, James and RoseAckerman, 1986). Young (1981) outlines models in which physicians sort into different
hospitals, types of hospitals, or regions according individual preferences for philanthropic
behavior, among other preferences. That total monetary compensation of top hospital employees
is substantially higher in for-profit than not-for-profit hospitals lends support to this theory

4

(Roomkin and Weisbrod, 1999). A third and less benign theory of nonprofit objectives suggests
that employees, through physician cartels, capture nonprofit hospitals and meet their personal
interests through them (Pauly and Redisch, 1973).

B. Capital Price Constraints
It may be that external financial constraints, rather than objectives that are adopted by
special kinds of organizations or the type of managers who choose to constrain themselves, cause
firm behavior. Because hospital types raise capital from different sources, they face different
capital costs (Gentry, 2002). The simple capital price theory that I consider follows from this
observation. One variant is that for-profit hospitals face lower costs of capital than do nonprofit
hospitals. The idea is that for-profit hospitals can respond to demand for services more quickly
than other corporations because equity financing is more readily available and less cumbersome
to manage than debt financing (Hirth, 1999). In the 1990s, over $100 billion was invested in
health care stocks (Manning, 1997), suggesting that it was easy for for-profit hospitals to raise
capital (Blecher, 1997). Further, for-profit hospitals may have more flexibility in timing
expenses because they may reinvest capital in hospital operations rather than paying interest. In
fact, some hospitals that have converted from nonprofit to for-profit form explain the change as
an attempt to obtain needed capital for operations as well as new equipment and buildings
(Cutler and Horwitz, 2000). An implication of this view is that for-profit hospitals should show
greater response to demand for capital-intensive services than other types of hospitals and,
therefore, should have higher levels of investment in such services.
A contrary variant of the capital price theory proposes that for-profit firms are constrained
in investment relative to nonprofits because they face higher costs of capital. Nonprofit hospitals

5

have several advantages unavailable to for-profits. For example, they may issue more forms of
tax-exempt debt than for-profits1 and may receive tax-exempt, tax deductible donations. In
addition, for those nonprofit hospitals with endowments, borrowing tax-exempt debt and some
amounts of taxable debt2 generates a tax arbitrage unavailable to for-profit hospitals (Gentry,
2002, Wedig et al., 1996). Empirical evidence demonstrates that nonprofit hospitals had a lower
cost of capital than did for-profit hospitals during the 1970s, although the relationship reversed
during the early 1980s (Wedig et al., 1989). An implication of this view is that for-profit
hospitals should show greater response to demand for capital-intensive services than other types
of hospitals and, therefore, should have higher levels of investment in such services. Regardless
of which view is correct, if capital prices drive investment decisions, hospitals types should show
different patterns of investment in expensive technology.

C. Market Effects
A third theory explaining differential firm behavior is that firms are influenced by the
ownership status of their neighbors, either through influencing the choice of objectives or
constraining behavior through competition, though the direction of the influence has been
debated. Hansmann (1980) reasons that the presence of nonprofit firms will deter profiteering
among for-profit health firms, while Cutler and Horwitz (2000) hypothesize that nonprofit and

1

The relative cost of capital is a complicated issue. For example, for-profit hospitals borrow more than do nonprofit
hospitals and, after accounting for tax deductions, taxable debt can represent a less expensive source of capital than
tax-exempt debt (Frank and Salkever, 1994).
2
Regulations limit the uses of tax-exempt debt available to nonprofit firms. Nonprofits, for example, must use taxexempt debt proceeds on physical assets. Between 1986 and 1997 there was a $150 million limit on outstanding
non-hospital, tax-exempt debt. (Gentry, 2002)

6

government hospitals copy the behavior of new for-profit entrants in a hospital market. Others
contend that there should be no influence of for-profits on nonprofits or vice versa because, with
higher operating costs and no endowments, for-profits are the marginal firm and, therefore, are
the only institutions responding to market changes (Lakdwawalla and Philipson, 1999).
There are few empirical studies that test the market effects theories. Silverman and
Skinner (2000) show not only that for-profit hospitals up-code to generate revenues more than
other types, but that in heavily for-profit markets, nonprofit hospitals up-code at similar rates as
for-profit hospitals. Duggan (2000) demonstrates that nonprofit hospitals that faced for-profit
competition were more likely than other nonprofits to respond to financial incentives to treat
Medicaid patients under the California Disproportionate Share Program. In a case study, Cutler
and Horwitz (2000) find that nonprofit hospitals adopt the billing procedures of for-profit
hospitals in the same markets.

III.

Data and Methodology

A. Data
Hospital data are from the American Hospital Association’s Annual Surveys of Hospitals
(AHA), years 1988 – 2000. Demographic data are from the 1990 U.S. Census. The sample
includes all non-rural, acute-care hospitals that operate in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)
with at least two general medical and surgical hospitals, excluding military, uncategorized
federal, and prison hospitals. I excluded rural hospitals because there are relatively few rural,
for-profit hospitals and they provide a limited range of services. In 1995, for example, of the
roughly 2,500 rural hospitals, only slightly more than 8 percent were for-profit and only a handful
provided open-heart surgery.

7

As Table 3 shows, over the study period slightly fewer than two-thirds of all hospitals
were nonprofit, with for-profit and government hospitals making up roughly equal shares of the
remainder. These shares were relatively stable over time. While there were conversions of
hospitals from one form to another, the net flows were much smaller than the gross flows. The
total number of hospitals fell over the time period.
I included all acute care services in the AHA surveys, with the exception of a small
number for which the data were incomplete or the definition was too imprecise or inconsistent
over the relevant time period to make valid comparisons. (See Table 1). The AHA data include
variables for services provided, number of beds, ownership status, teaching status, admissions,
and location. (See Table 4).
The AHA data have limitations. First, the data are self-reported and not independently
verified. However, there is no a priori reason to suspect that data reliability is correlated with
ownership. Second, the format of the survey changed slightly over the years. Hospitals were
asked to choose whether a specific service (e.g. emergency department) was offered at the
hospital, another hospital, or not available (1988-1993) or to answer “yes” if the service was
offered at a hospital or subsidiary, as opposed to another location in the system, network, or joint
venture (1994-2000). Because I am interested in hospital-based activities, I recoded the first
category in each year as “yes,” all other categories as “no,” with a separate category for nonrespondents.
Finally, the data suffer from missing-values, particularly in the later years. Almost 20
percent of hospitals did not respond to the AHA survey and the non-respondents were
disproportionately for-profit. Of the sample used in this study, in 1988 approximately 3 percent
of nonprofit, 4 percent of government, and almost 18 percent of for-profit hospitals did not report

8

whether they offered emergency services. By 2000, those percentages were about 14 percent for
nonprofit, 20 percent for government, and 26 percent for for-profit hospitals.
When hospitals did not report whether they offered a service, I imputed the values using
data from the years before and after the missing year. For the end years (1988 and 2000) I
imputed a value based on whether the hospital offered the service for the next or previous two
years. Where several years of values were missing, I excluded the observation from the analysis.
Generally, fewer than 4 percent of observations were imputed for each service.

B. Methodology
I examine over thirty medical services singly to test whether individual service offerings
differ by hospital ownership. To assess the alternative explanations for offering patterns, I group
the services. First, to test the objectives theory, I examine whether hospital types differ in their
likelihood of investing in profitable services, unprofitable services with high public need, and
services with variable profits. Second, to test the capital prices theory I examine whether
different hospital types are more or less likely to offer services with high start-up costs and
whether those differences narrow over time. Finally, I investigate whether hospital types behave
differently in markets with high for-profit hospital penetration. Table 2 illustrates the behavior
predicted by each of the theories.

i. Objectives and Constraints
To test my predictions, I estimated the following model:3

where FORM is a dummy variable for nonprofit, for-profit, or government ownership; Year is a
year dummy variable; H are hospital characteristic variables including hospital size (measured as
quartiles of admissions), teaching status (measured by teaching association membership), and a
dummy variable for location by region in the country; D are demographic variables of the
hospital’s vicinity (including percentages of the population by sex, white or African-American
race, ln household income, age categories (<1, 1-18, 18-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-65, >=65, >=80)).
These were compiled from 1990 Census data arranged by aggregating census block groups that
fell within a 10-mile radius of the center (by longitude and latitude) of the zip-code where the
hospital operated. This distance is commonly used in the literature, and 10.4 miles is the mean
distance radius that captures 75 percent of discharges from acute care hospitals in urban settings
(Gresenz et al., 2004).
Because the probability of a hospital offering a service is not independent from one year
to the next, I allowed for an arbitrary covariance matrix within each hospital over time. I also
adjusted the models for heteroskedasticity. By varying only the corporate form of the hospital
while holding the independent variables constant (at 1994 or next closest year levels), I predicted
the probabilities that each hospital in each year would offer a given service. Then I averaged the

3

One might think about using fixed effects to examine ownership, but doing so makes the estimation depend only on
the experience of hospitals that switch form. The sample of switching hospitals is small and likely to be biased in
ways that are correlated with service offerings. For example, money-losing hospitals are more likely to change form
and also to forgo investment in services, plant, and equipment.

10

individual predicted probabilities to obtain the probability that a hospital type offers a service
each year. Using the Probit model, I have assumed that the binary variable follows a binomial
distribution.
Determining what observed behavioral differences demonstrate about corporate intention
is more difficult than establishing these differences. Finding differences in behavior regarding
one or two services, for example, would not provide enough evidence to infer motivation.
However, by looking at many services, grouped by characteristics such as profitability, I am able
to infer differences in objectives. If, for example, one type of hospital differentially offers many
of the most profitable services and systematically avoids the services that are relatively
unprofitable (e.g. those that are often provided to an underinsured patient pool) that hospital’s
behavior is more consistent with profit-seeking than the behavior of hospitals that provide
money-losing services.
Profitability, however, is not an inherent attribute of medical services, but depends on
institutional-specific factors such as management skills, case mix, and local input costs. Further,
within a single hospital, costs and charges differ, discounts vary by individual payer, and
allocation of joint costs blur the profitability picture. Despite these complications one can,
however, reasonably compare the relative profitability of services defined as bluntly as they are
in the AHA data.
I sorted the medical services into three profitability categories (those with high, low, and
variable profitability) and then re-sorted the services according to the level of required initial
investment. Categories, reported in Table 1, are based on an exhaustive study of the relevant
peer-reviewed, academic literature (medical, business, finance, statistics, sociology, and public
policy), interviews with hospital administrators, doctors, and policy-makers, and analyses of the

11

socioeconomic or insurance status of patients likely to demand various services. Because
Medicare payments are the largest single source of hospital revenues, I also analyzed the
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPac) and Prospective Payment Assessment
Commission (ProPAC) reports to Congress for the relevant years. Further, because this project is
concerned primarily with hospital behavior and motivation, I checked the published, scientific
literature with a comprehensive review of trade publications, business magazines, and newspaper
reports. The qualitative evaluation of relative service profitability was critical to the project
because perceptions of whether a service would be profitable were likely as, possibly more,
important determinants of service investment choices than whether services turned out to be
profitable. Regardless, there was little disagreement among these sources. A full report is
available online (Horwitz, 2005).
Highly Profitable Services Many of these services, such as cardiac care, are
predominantly provided to older patients, patients who are insured through Medicare; during the
early to mid-1990s, Medicare had a generous payment schedule relative to other types of
insurance (Grossman, 2002). By testing whether hospital types differentially provide services
according to relative profitability, I am able to determine the relative degree to which the
hospitals pursue profitability and, therefore, offer support for or against the objectives theory.
The highly profitable services include angioplasty, birthing rooms, cardiac catheterization,
diagnostic imagining equipment (computed-tomography scanner -- CT, diagnostic radioisotope
facility, magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI, positron emission tomography -- PET, single
photon emission computed tomography -- SPECT, and ultrasound), extracorporeal shock-wave
lithotripter (ESWL), fitness center, neonatal intensive care, open heart surgery, pediatric
intensive care, sports medicine, and women’s centers.

12

Relatively Unprofitable Services for Needy Patients The services in this category often
answer public need, yet they are expensive to provide compared to available reimbursement or
patient payments. With the exception of emergency care,4 hospitals are not required to offer
these services. I examine these services to determine whether hospital types differentially offer
services that provide community benefits without the prospect of high profit. Analyzing this
group of services also helps evaluate one form of the objectives theory, one under which
nonprofit and public hospitals have goals of altruism or meeting public need. In this category, I
include AIDS/HIV services (outpatient, testing, general services, special unit), alcohol and
substance abuse inpatient and outpatient care, burn treatment, child and adolescent psychiatric
services, emergency rooms, obstetrics services (measured by beds and deliveries), inpatient adult
psychiatric care, psychiatric emergency services, and trauma centers.
Services with Variable Profits This category of services, services for which the
opportunities for profit-making changed over the study period, includes the post-acute services
skilled nursing and home health. This category is particularly useful for testing relative
objectives since it shows how service provision tracks changes in profitability.
Capital Intensive Services The final group of services is those for which capital costs are
relatively high. These include some diagnostic imaging equipment, cardiac services, birthing
rooms, burn treatment, emergency rooms, ESWL, neonatal and pediatric intensive care,
orthopedic surgery, and trauma centers. If capital constraints are operating on for-profit
hospitals, nonprofit hospitals should invest in capital-intensive services more than do others.

4

Approximately half of the states require hospitals to have emergency care facilities as a condition of licensure or
funding (Showalter, 1999). And, hospitals must provide emergency care as a condition of participating in the

To test whether the mix of hospital types in a market affects individual hospital
operations, I test the interaction between corporate form and market.

where the market dummy variable identifies for-profit markets, defined as those metropolitan
statistical areas (MSAs) in which for-profits represent more than a given percentage of
admissions. As in model 1, the observations were clustered according to hospital identification
number, and I have assumed that the binary variable follows a binomial distribution.
IV. Results
This section presents the findings for services that are representative of the four types –
consistently profitable (open heart surgery), consistently unprofitable (psychiatric emergency),
variably profitable (home health), and those with high capital costs (MRI and ESWL).

A. Objectives Theories
i. Consistently Profitable Service: Open Heart Surgery
Although I focus on open-heart surgery in this section, the results for cardiac
catheterization labs and angioplasty are remarkably similar. Open heart surgery (coronary artery

14

bypass graft or CABG) refers to one of two revascularization procedures used to improve blood
supply to the heart after a patient suffers a heart attack by splicing a piece of vein or artery from
another part of the body around the blocked artery. Cardiac services -- including cardiac
catheterization, angioplasty, and open-heart surgery – are, and are widely known to be, hospital
profit centers (Stout, 2001, Wagner, 1991). During the study period, for-profit corporations
opened single-service cardiac surgery centers, while neighboring hospitals expected to lose
profitable business (Dang, 2002, Devers et al., 2003, Gallagher, 1998, Ginsburg, 2000, Meyer,
1998, Romano, 2004, Winslow, 1999).
There is considerable evidence that cardiac care’s reputation as a money maker is
justified. As surgical services, heart attack treatments are typically well-reimbursed by insurers
(Brennan, 2002, Cutler et al., 2000). Since most are Medicare beneficiaries, patients receiving
open-heart surgery are unusually well insured. Insurers typically reimburse heart attack
treatments at high rates; patients receiving CABG are unusually well insured since most are
covered Medicare; and, there is high and increasing spending on cardiac care (Cutler, McClellan
and Newhouse, 2000). From 1984 to 1994, the real price for bypass surgery among Medicare
patients increased by 2.3 percent annually from $29,176 to $36,564 (1991 dollars) while the
share of patients receiving the treatment increased by one percentage point annually from 5 to 15
percent (Cutler et al., 2001). The costs of supplying CABG in real terms were either flat or fell
during the same period (Cutler and Huckman, 2003). In 1991, because spending on bypass
surgery was so high, the Health Care Financing Administration ran a pilot program in which
hospitals and physicians negotiated bypass surgery prices (Cromwell et al., 1997).
Appendix A reports estimates from the basic specification of the probability of offering
open heart surgery by ownership type, controlling for hospital and demographic characteristics.

15

These results demonstrate that for-profits are more likely to offer open heart surgery than
nonprofits, which in turn are more likely to do so than government hospitals. Specifically, the
null hypotheses that for-profit, nonprofit, and government provision of open heart surgery are
jointly equal5 to each other (the coefficients on the corporate form and corporate form * year
interaction variables for one form are jointly equal to those of another form) can be rejected at
the .01 level.
The magnitude of these differences is large. The differences can be seen best in Figure 1,
which plots the Probit predicted probabilities of service offerings by hospital type, controlling for
the hospital and demographic characteristics discussed above. For-profits are, on average, 13
percentage points more likely than government hospitals (40.9% v. 27.9%, P<0.001) and 7.3
percentage points more likely than nonprofit hospitals (40.9% v. 33.6%, P<0.001) to offer openheart surgery (See Table 7 for hypothesis tests).
Over the study period, the probability of offering open heart surgery increased for all
three types of hospitals. Again, this is easiest to see in Figure 1. The relationship can also be
seen by the positive, significant, and increasing coefficients on the year dummies, and the mostly
small and insignificant coefficients on the year*gov and year*fp interactions, which indicate that
the relationship between the forms remained stable over time (See Appendix A).
The pattern of service provision for open heart surgery supports the theory that the
hospital types have different objectives. This evidence alone, however, does not help

5

I conducted two sets of hypothesis tests: 1) tests on whether the coefficients on the corporate form and corporate
form * year interaction variables for one form (e.g. for-profit) are jointly different those of another form (e.g.
nonprofit) and 2) tests on whether the average of these coefficients are different among forms. These hypothesis
tests, which I refer to as the Joint Tests and the Average Tests, are presented in Table 7.

16

differentiate among two possible goals. For-profits may be more interested than other types in
offering either all medical services or profitable services.

ii. Consistently Unprofitable: Psychiatric Emergency
Conversely, hospital-based, psychiatric emergency services are relatively unprofitable for
several reasons. First, the emergency room is generally an unprofitable setting, which attracts
patients whose admissions are relatively expensive (Deloitte & Touche, 1990, Gentry and
Penrod, 2000, Melnick et al., 1989). During the study period, many providers believed that
emergency care was unprofitable, in part, because public reimbursement did not include
additional payments for emergency care that precedes inpatient care and, therefore, did not cover
costs such as licensing and standby costs (Eisenberg, 1990). Whether reimbursements are
actually sufficient to cover the costs of emergency care prior to admission, however, depends on
the total level of reimbursement for the admission.
Second, psychiatric care reimbursement is uncertain and often low relative to cost
(Woodward et al., 1997). Psychiatric emergency patients are dominated by two groups of
patients characterized as “bad payers” – the Medicaid population and the uninsured (Gottlieb,
2002). During the 1990s, both private and public payers sought methods to control mental health
costs. State Medicaid programs facing budget shortfalls often cut mental health services,
including services previously available in state psychiatric hospitals, to balance budgets (BNA
Health Care Daily, 1995). The rapid expansion of mental health carve-out programs and other
cost-control methods also led to low provider payments in private settings.
Third, mental health services attract a poor, poorly insured, sick, and difficult to manage
population (Woodward, Epstein, Gfroerer, Melnick, Thoreson and Wilson, 1997). The patients

that use psychiatric emergency care, for example, are particularly underprivileged (Dhossche and
Ghani, 1998). Young adults, who are disproportionately uninsured are overrepresented as mental
health patients, while the elderly, who are insured by Medicare, are underrepresented (Ellison et
al., 1986). One studied demonstrated that mental health patients are disproportionately sick,
uninsured, and difficult to manage (Shwed, 1980, Tye, 2001). Further, approximately 7 to 18
percent of psychiatric emergency patients and one-third of the visits are difficult-to-treat, repeat
visitors with chronic conditions (Ellison, Blum and Barksy, 1986).
Finally, not offering psychiatric emergency capacity may protect hospitals from liability
under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). EMTALA requires
hospitals that both have emergency rooms and serve Medicare beneficiaries to stabilize
emergency patients, including emergency psychiatric conditions,6 before transferring them to
another hospital.7 Emergency rooms, however, are only required to screen and stabilization
patients with conditions that fall within the emergency room’s capabilities. If a hospital does not
offer psychiatric treatment or have mental health professionals on staff, EMTALA does not
require it to stabilizing emergency psychiatric patients before transferring them,8 thus making it
easier to transfer a class of poorly insured, high-risk patients.
Appendix A contains estimates from the basic specification. These results demonstrate
that, unlike open heart surgery, for-profits are less likely than nonprofits, which in turn are less
likely than government hospitals to offer this unprofitable service (See Figure 2). Specifically,
the null hypotheses that, for all thirteen years, 1) for-profit and government hospitals and, 2)

Psychiatric disturbances may constitute an emergency condition. 42 C.F.R. § 489.24(b)(i) (2000).

18

nonprofit and government hospitals are equally likely to offer the services can be rejected at the
.001 level. The null hypothesis that the for-profit and nonprofit hospitals are jointly equal cannot
be rejected (See Table 7).
On average from 1988 to 2000, 41 percent of for-profit hospitals were predicted to offer
psychiatric emergency services, compared to 48 percent of nonprofit hospitals and 56 percent of
government hospitals. The null hypotheses that these averages are equal can be rejected at the
.001 level (See Table 7 for details). The magnitude of these differences is large – for-profits are
15 percentage points more likely to offer psychiatric emergency services than are government
hospitals. This can be seen best in Figure 2, which plots the Probit predicted probabilities of
offering psychiatric emergency care by hospital type.
In addition, the probability of offering psychiatric emergency services remained flat over
time, and the relationship among types remained approximately constant. It is easiest to see this
in Figure 2. The relationship can also be seen by the mostly small and insignificant coefficients
on the year dummies and on the year*gov and year*fp interaction terms in Appendix A, which
indicate that the relationships among hospital types remained stable over time.
The investment patterns for psychiatric emergency care also lend support to the objectives
theory. Government hospitals appear relatively more willing to invest in a service that is needed
by the public than are nonprofits which are, in turn, more willing to provide the service than are
for-profit hospitals. This evidence, coupled with the evidence from open heart surgery, supports
the view that hospital types differ according to their interest in pursuing profits rather than the

19

view that hospital types differ according to their interest in pursuing more or fewer services per
se.

iii. Service with Variable Profitability: Home Health Care
Changes in the profitability of post-acute services, such as home health and skilled
nursing,9 make them particularly useful services to test the relative responsiveness of hospitals to
financial incentives in their service investments and, therefore, to infer the goals they pursue.
With the implementation of the prospective payment system in 1984, post-acute services became
very profitable. Unlike acute services payments for which hospitals receive a single per-episode
payment for each patient, Medicare paid a cost-related reimbursement for post-acute services.
For example, home health services were reimbursed according to cost, up to 112 percent of the
national mean cost per visit (Newhouse, 2002b). In addition, the payment system was
particularly generous to entrants, exempting skilled nursing facilities and home health services
from cost limits for the first three to four years of operation (Newhouse, 2002a).
These generous reimbursements coupled with the fixed payment built into the Medicare
payment system made post-acute services particularly valuable for acute care hospitals. Rather
than receiving a single payment for an inpatient, hospitals could increase reimbursements by
unbundling the services and transferring a patient to a post-acute bed at the end of their hospital
stay. There is considerable evidence of these transfers. Between 1988 and 1996 acute care
lengths of stay fell 27 percent for Medicare patients and only 15 percent for all patients; during

9

I have eliminated rehabilitation services from the analysis because the AHA survey does not specify the
rehabilitation unit type, which strongly affects service profitability.

20

the same period post-acute service usage and payment rose rapidly (Newhouse, 2002b). Finally,
the hospital could allocate joint costs to these units, increasing the total reimbursement to the
hospital. The rapid increase in Medicare spending on and utilization of post-acute services
reflects response to these incentives. Home health payments grew from $3.9 billion to over
$18.3 billion between 1990 and 1996 (Liu et al., 1999). Although the incentives for providing
post-acute services were in place in the early-1980s, it was not until the late 1980s that eligibility
and coverage guidelines were clarified in federal court decisions.10
The potential profitability of these services was widely understood by hospital
administrators, consultants, and regulators alike (Geriatric Health Ventures Incorporated, 1992,
Helbing and Cornelius, 1992, Helbing et al., 1992, Scharmach, 1990, Wagner, 1989). One article
in the trade press, for example, urged hospital administrators to view skilled nursing facilities as
a “higher reimbursement category, not necessarily a geographic location” (Deangelis, 1987). In
the early 1990s, regulators searched for solutions to contain post-acute service spending, which
they believed was unnecessary (Vladeck and Miller, 1994). Observers predicted that these
services would remain profitable even if capitated (1993, Fowler, 1992, Lutz, 1992, O'
Donnell,
1993).
The profit-making opportunities of post-acute care plummeted with the 1997 Balanced
Budget Act (BBA). Medicare payments were reduced, the Health Care Financing Agency
developed a prospective payment system for post-acute services, and spending on home health
care fell by a factor of two.

10

Duggan v. Bowen 691 F.Supp. 1487 (1988), effective 1989, made patients who would be stabilized by home
health services, in addition to patients who would be improved by the services, eligible for the services.

21

Appendix A contains estimates from the basic specification. Not only did the
probabilities of offering home health care vary by ownership, the relative differences among
types varied over time. The probabilities of offering home health services when the service was
profitable increased for all three hospital types. As can be seen in Figure 3, however, the growth
of home health care when profitable and the decline when unprofitable among for-profit hospitals
were particularly dramatic. From 1988 to 1996, the probability of a for-profit hospital offering
home health services more than tripled (17.5 percent to 60.9 percent). During the same period,
the probability of offering home health care only grew slightly over 10 percentage points (40.9
percent to 51.7 percent) for nonprofit and 14 percentage points (38.1 percent to 51.9 percent) for
government hospitals.
From 1997 to 2000, as home health care became relatively unprofitable with the BBA’s
implementation, the probability of offering it fell a striking 37.5 percentage points among forprofits, 7.7 percentage points among nonprofits, and 1.5 percentage points among government
hospitals. All relevant null hypotheses can be rejected at the 0.01 level. This finding provides
important evidence regarding the magnitude (large) and speed (fast) of for-profit responsiveness
to incentives.

B. Capital Prices Theory
This section discusses two representative services, Extracorporeal Shock Wave
Lithotripsy (ESWL) and Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI), to test the capital constraint
theory. In 1984, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Extracorporeal Shock
Wave Lithotripters, machines that uses shock waves to shatter kidney stones or gallstones.
Because the typical lithotripter costs about $1 million, only approximately 240 hospitals in the

22

country had them in the early 1990s but, in 1991, there were reports that a new, much less
expensive machine was being developed (1991).
MRI allows technicians to determine tissue types by looking at a map of how hydrogen
nuclei in different parts of the body respond to the magnetic field generated by the machine. Like
all diagnostic imaging equipment, magnetic resonance imaging technology is very expensive; a
typical machine, excluding installation and licensing fees, costs approximately $1.5 million
(Anonymous Interviewee, 2002).
Appendix A contains estimates from the basic specifications. Consistent with theories
about technology diffusion, all types of hospitals were more likely to have MRIs and ESWLs
over time. The patterns of adoption, however, were quite different. As can be seen most easily
in Figure 4, for-profit hospitals were always more likely to offer ESWL services during the years
studied. On average, 22 percent of for-profit hospitals, 17 percent of nonprofit hospitals, and 13
percent of public hospitals were likely to offer ESWL. These differences are significant at, at
least, the 0.003 level (Table 7).
On the other hand, for-profits were only slightly more likely than nonprofit hospitals to
have MRIs. On average, 51 percent of for-profit hospitals and 48 percent of nonprofit hospitals,
controlling for hospital and demographic characteristics, were predicted to have MRIs. The
difference is insignificant (See Table 7). Further, the relative probability of offering the service
changed over time. Between 1988 and 1992, nonprofit hospitals were predicted to be more likely
than for-profit hospitals to have MRIs; between 1993 and 1998, for-profits were more likely than
nonprofits to offer the service. Government hospitals were, on average, approximately 7 to 10
percentage points less likely than either of the other types to offer MRI (See Figure 5). Neither
of these services demonstrated either hypothesized pattern of the capital constraint theory -- a

23

pattern of investment in which either for-profit or nonprofit hospitals consistently invest more in
these services.

C. Looking Across all the Technologies
Table 5 summarizes the results for all tested services. Although for-profit hospitals were
only somewhat more likely than nonprofits to offer profitable services, both for-profit and
nonprofit hospitals were considerably more likely than government hospitals to offer profitable
services. For-profits were less likely than nonprofits, which in turn were less likely than
government hospitals, to offer unprofitable services. The objectives theory is further supported
by the patterns of offering services with variable profits. As can be seen in Table 6, for-profits
exhibited dramatic responsiveness to financial incentives, particularly in terms of investing in
post-acute services as they became profitable and divesting from them as they became
unprofitable.
The services examined in the study demonstrated neither pattern predicted by the capital
prices theory. For-profits were less likely than nonprofits to have birthing rooms, a capital
intensive service, during the early years of the study (in 1988 F=64% v. N=70%), but by 2000
that gap shrank (F=75% v. N=77%). Government hospitals were less likely than the other types
to have CAT scanners, another capital intensive service, during the early years of the study (e.g.,
in 1988 F=88%, G=80%, N=87%), but by 2000 they were more likely to have them (F=93%,
G=96%, N=95%). From these results it appears that access to equity capital did not lead forprofit hospitals to consistently make greater investments in expensive technology than
nonprofits. (See Table 5, services with high initial capital needs in italics). Nor did access to

24

tax-exempt debt, endowment, or tax arbitrage opportunities lead nonprofit hospitals to
consistently make greater investments in expensive technology than for-profits.

D. Market Results
To appraise the market theory, I asked whether hospital types offered different services
depending on the for-profit penetration in the local markets. To do this, I tested the interactions
between ownership form and a dummy variable for for-profit markets, defined as metropolitan
statistical areas with greater than or equal to 20 percent for-profit admissions. I chose this
breakpoint because few hospitals operate in markets with higher for-profit penetration, though
tests of markets with greater than or equal to 10 percent for-profit admissions on a more limited
data set yielded similar results. Measured by the share of hospital admissions in an MSA, the
mean for-profit share market share was 0.115, the median was 0.045, and the standard deviation
was 0.149.
The market regressions support the theory that hospitals, particularly for-profit and
nonprofit hospitals, learn from or compete with neighboring hospitals. The results also support,
albeit with limited evidence, the idea that nonprofit hospitals copy the profit-making techniques
of their for-profit neighbors. Again, I focused on three representative services to determine
whether hospital types offered different services in for-profit and other markets.
All hospital types were more likely to offer open heart surgery, a very profitable service,
in markets with at least 20 percent for-profit market share than in other markets (See Appendix B
and Figures 6, 7, 8). Nonprofit hospitals, for example, were on average 5.4 percentage points
more likely to offer open heart surgery in markets with at least 20 percent for-profit penetration
than in other markets (differences significant at 0.05 percent level, See Table 8 for hypothesis

25

tests). For-profit and government hospitals followed a similar pattern, offering open heart
surgery at a greater rate in for-profit markets than in other markets (See Figure 6). Although the
results for for-profit hospitals were not statistically significant for the full study period, excluding
the most recent two years of data (1999 and 2000), there were large and significant differences.
At least for this profitable service, having for-profit neighbors matters.
The results for home health were similar for nonprofit hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals
were more likely to offer home health in for-profit markets than in other markets during almost
the entire period (See Figure 7). These results, coupled with open heart surgery, might seem to
suggest that hospitals are more likely to offer all services in for-profit markets than in other
markets. However, there is reason to reject this theory. First, though nonprofits were more likely
to offer home health in for-profit markets throughout the study period, the largest gap came
during the particularly profitable period for investment from 1993 through 1996. Further, forprofit hospitals were only more likely to provide home health in for-profit markets than in other
markets during this profitable period (See Figure 8). There was no statistically significant
difference between government hospitals in for-profit and other markets during this period.
On the contrary, on average over the thirteen years studied, for-profit hospitals were
equally likely to offer psychiatric emergency services in both types of markets (See Figure 8).
However, government hospitals were 4.6 percentage points more likely to provide psychiatric
emergency care in for-profit markets than in others, although the difference was not statistically
significant. Nonprofit hospitals were also 4.5 percentage points more likely to offer this
unprofitable service and the results were statistically significant at the 0.10 level. Interestingly,
during the later years of the study period, nonprofits in for-profit markets seem to be exiting the
psychiatric emergency business. While from 1988 to 1993 there was little difference in the

26

probability of offering the service in each type of market, from 1994 to 2000, nonprofits in forprofit markets were approximately 7.1 percentage points less likely to have the service than those
in other markets. The null hypothesis that the probabilities were equal was rejected at the 0.05
percent level.
These results, coupled, with the results for open heart surgery, support the claim that
nonprofit hospitals are influenced by the behavior of their for-profit neighbors. They are more
likely to offer profitable services and less likely to offer unprofitable services in markets with
relatively higher for-profit penetration.

V. Alternative Explanations and Sensitivity Tests
A. Alternative Explanations
There are two alternative explanations to the results, both raising potential endogeneity
concerns with the model. First, as Wennberg (1999) and others have observed, medical service
provision varies considerably by small geographic region. Norton and Staiger (1994) have
further shown that relatively low uncompensated care provision at for-profit hospitals can be
explained, in part, by location. Using a case study approach for three markets, McClellan and
Staiger suggested that for-profit hospitals locate in areas with low hospital quality (McClellan
and Staiger, 2000). One might think, therefore, that firm types pick small areas in which to
operate based on the character of demand in those areas, such as patient demand or physician
preference for open heart surgery or medical management. Where demand for profitable services
is greatest, therefore, one would expect more for-profit firms than in other areas.
I tested this alternative explanation for the results by using a fixed-effects approach,
including an indicator variable for the year 2000 Hospital Referral Regions (HRR) in which each

27

hospital operates. The coefficient implications produced by additional analyses of the three
representative services described above (open heart surgery, psychiatric emergency care, and
home health care) remained the same. The relevant differences remained significant at the one
percent level with one exception. The average difference between nonprofit and for-profit
hospitals offering open heart surgery was significant at the one percent level, however tests for
the joint difference lost significance.
These results are not only quantitatively reassuring; they make sense. First, medical
services differ in important ways from uncompensated care, the good studied by Norton and
Staiger in 1994. It is likely easier for hospitals to avoid locations in which there is likely to be
considerable demand for uncompensated care than demand for a bundle of unprofitable medical
services. In fact, the early wave of hospital purchases by for-profit chains were in relatively
wealthy suburban areas, where there are comparatively few uninsured patients. To predict the
demand for a large number of services, potential hospital purchasers would need to know details
about patient population risk and insurance characteristics that are hard to find and, moreover,
change over time. A much easier strategy for a hospital wishing to earn profits would be to limit
offerings of unprofitable services. Second, based on how hospital conversion markets work, the
objectives explanation is more plausible than the geographic selection story. For-profit chains
have typically bought hospitals that were for sale, often because they were failing financially
(Picone et al., 2002).
A second alternative explanation is that individual hospitals choose ownership form
based on their financial status. Profitable hospitals choose for-profit status, unprofitable
hospitals choose nonprofit status. This explanation, however, is at odds with conversion
experience. Failing hospitals, not profitable hospitals, typically convert from nonprofit to for-

28

profit status (Picone, Chou and Sloan, 2002). In addition, hospital reimbursement and financial
margins are uncertain and fluctuate considerably over relatively short time periods (See, e.g.,
Commission, 2004). Even if hospitals could reasonably predict reimbursement and profitability,
changes in ownership are costly in several respects. Legal permissions are difficult to secure and
challenges likely, professional legal and consulting costs are high, and reputational effects can be
large.

B. Propensity Scores and Other Sensitivity Tests
The results were robust to several other sensitivity tests on the three representative
services. Because size is the best predictor of offering any service, I restricted the regressions to
the observations in the top two quartiles, bottom two quartiles, and middle two quartiles of
hospitals measured by number of admissions to the hospital. Restricting the tests to the smallest
hospitals, those in the bottom two admissions quartiles, the finding that nonprofit hospitals were
more likely than government hospitals to offer open heart surgery was not significant. This result
is not surprising because so few small hospitals offer open heart surgery at all. Like open heart
surgery, among the smallest hospitals, the finding that nonprofit hospitals were more likely than
for-profit hospitals to offer psychiatric emergency services was not significant.
To test the sensitivity of the results to demographic characteristics, I added age-squared
categories for percentage of the population over 65 years and over 80 years. Because state
payment policies for mental health services vary considerably, I included state dummies and
state-year interactions for the psychiatric emergency service probit estimations. To test variation
within the government hospital category, I excluded veterans’ hospitals. The probability that
nonprofit and non-veteran government hospitals were equally likely to offer psychiatric

29

emergency services could not be rejected at the 0.10 level. In addition, because firm types tend
to cluster in different regions I altered the region variable to account for areas of high for-profit
penetration (e.g. south11 and southwest12) and included dummy variables for all nine regions
listed in the AHA dataset.
Finally, I reanalyzed the three services using propensity scores, a method used to make
causal inferences when assignment to a group, such as corporate ownership, is not random
(Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983, 1984). This method allowed me to ensure that I had compared
hospitals that differed primarily by ownership and not other characteristics such as hospital size.
More specifically, I determined the conditional probability of corporate ownership (nonprofit v.
for-profit; nonprofit v. government, government v. for-profit) given the observed characteristics
used in the Probit estimates (the propensity scores), created five subcategories defined by the
estimated propensity score, and predicted the probability of a hospital type offering a service in a
given year controlling for the propensity grouping. These tests did not change the results
reported above in any meaningful way.13 The null hypothesis that nonprofit and government
hospitals were equally likely to offer open heart surgery could not be rejected at the 0.05 level
(p=0.078).

12

13
The predicted probabilities of offering a service were slightly different than those produced by the Probit tests
because the predictions were generated only from subsets of the data (e.g. only nonprofits and for-profits; only
public and nonprofits). The relationships among the hospitals, however, were consistent with the Probit results.

30

VI. Conclusion
The empirical findings – that different hospital types offer different services, varying
systematically with their profitability – challenge an emerging view that there are few differences
among the nonprofit and for-profit forms (Sloan, 2000). The magnitude and robustness of the
findings are striking in themselves, particularly given the blunt nature of the dependent variables
and hospitals’ regulatory context.
Plausible ownership theories should account for all three firm types. These results
undermine two reasonable hypotheses about behavioral differences. Neither (1) the divide
between government and private (both for-profit and nonprofit) institutions, nor (2) the divide
between profit-distributing and non-distributing (both nonprofit and government) institutions can
explain the differences described here. Although nonprofits are similar to for-profit hospitals
because they are both private entities, they differ in their responsiveness to incentives. Although
nonprofits are similar to government hospitals because they are legally prohibited from
distributing profits to owners, nonprofits are not substitutes for government hospitals in the
provision of unprofitable services that are disproportionately demanded by needy patients.
The results also undercut the simple capital prices theory. There is no clear pattern that
relative access or costs of capital constrain hospitals by type. More work on the question,
however, is needed. These results may be because there are many factors that contribute to the
decision and ability to invest in technology, capital costs only representing one. Licensing
requirements under certificate-of-need programs, for example, could prevent hospitals from
investing in a service despite easy access to low cost capital. Or, differences in the sources of
capital may be over estimated. With increasing hospital consolidation and the growth of hospital
chains, nonprofit hospitals may operate internal capital markets that make them more similar to

31

for-profit capital markets than this theory suggests. Likewise, the greater flexibility of equity
capital may also be overestimated since, for example, for-profits may issue certain forms of taxexempt debt and nonprofits have access to flexible funds such as endowment (Frank and
Salkever, 2000, 1994).
In light of this evidence, the objectives theories seem more plausible than the capital
prices theories. Although specifying non-financial objective functions is difficult, the evidence
bolsters the theory that government hospitals are hospitals of last resort. They are more likely
than other types to offer unprofitable services that are generally needed by poor, underinsured
patients. Nonprofit hospitals are the intermediate type. They are less responsive to financial
incentives than for-profit and mores so than government hospitals, both in offering profitable and
avoiding unprofitable services. They are also less likely than government hospitals to offer
unprofitable, undersupplied services.
The results shed some light on the content of the nonprofit objective function as well.
While profit-making must be in the objective function of all hospitals, it is likely lower on the list
for nonprofits than for-profits. Controlling parties – be they managers, directors, doctors, or
consumers – are making different choices that vary systematically by ownership. Further, the
evidence presented here challenges the capture models, at least in their extreme forms, of
nonprofit organizations (see, e.g., Pauly and Redisch, 1973). If doctors or other powerful
nonprofit hospital employees were effectively maximizing their incomes, nonprofit hospitals
would not offer unprofitable services. Perhaps hospital directors or regulations constrain
employee capture, but the evidence presented here is consistent with a story of employee
altruism.

32

Interestingly, despite notoriously weak enforcement mechanisms, the results are
consistent with law which requires nonprofits to act in the public interest (for detail on nonprofit
law see Horwitz, 2003). More concretely, nonprofits are not required to offer unprofitable
services but they choose to do so. Aside from the few jurisdictions in which attorneys general
had and used their power to control hospital behavior during the study period, nonprofit and forprofit hospitals had the same opportunities to open and close units, and they faced the same
public relations problems in doing so.
The results raise two further puzzles that need more attention. First, why do for-profits
offer any unprofitable services? Businesses trying to maximize profits should not offer
unprofitable product lines. For-profit hospitals, unlike other businesses however, maximize
profits subject to a series of constraints having to do with the goods they provide. In addition,
there are important, perhaps life-saving complementarities among health services. Institutions
that provide surgical services, for example, need expensive and, often unprofitable, emergency
support systems. In fact, opponents of single service specialty hospitals, such as freestanding
cardiac centers, argue that specialty hospitals with limited emergency facilities jeopardize patient
safety (Devers, Brewster and Ginsburg, 2003). Also, offering some unprofitable services such as
obstetrical care is necessary to signal to doctors, patients, and insurers that the hospital is a fullservice institution. Finally, some services are loss-leaders. Unprofitable obstetric care, for
example, attracts female patients who bring their families’ profitable business to the hospital.
Second, why don’t nonprofit hospitals offer all the profitable services as well as some
unprofitable services? After all, nonprofits must value profits to some degree, even if less than
for-profit hospitals, and they could use the proceeds to cross-subsidize. There are several
plausible answers. For example, nonprofit hospitals may stick to core services like obstetrics and

33

emergency care. The evidence here is mixed, showing that although nonprofits are less likely
than for-profits to have a women’s center or home health care, they are also more likely to have
peripheral services like fitness centers.
Another plausible answer, following Newhouse’s model, is that nonprofits differentially
value quality. The evidence presented here is consistent with the quality explanation. It is
unlikely that the most profitable mix of services is the most medically appropriate mix. Public
payment rates are set through a complex and changing process based on, among other factors, the
evolving judgment or reacting to past errors of rate-setters, imperfect adjustments for
demographic and geographic characteristics of hospital markets, and the political strength of
interested parties. Private payment rates also result from complex negotiations and relative
bargaining power. This messy process does not inspire faith that regulators have found the right
price in terms of medical quality. For these reasons, the rapid and large responses to changes in
post-acute care profitability raise doubts that those changes were initiated for quality reasons.
We need more study on how and, indeed, whether these processes produce incentives for
hospitals to provide a medically appropriate service mix.
The preliminary results also suggest that hospital behavior depends on the ownership of
its neighbors. Nonprofits and for-profits are both more likely to offer a profitable service and
less likely to offer an unprofitable service in for-profit markets than in other markets.
Government hospitals, however, appear to be relatively robust to outside influence; while they
were more likely to offer a profitable service in for-profit markets than other markets, the results
did not extend to unprofitable or variable profit services. The sensitivity tests related to
geography, particularly the HRR fixed effects tests, suggest that there is a neighboring hospital
effect rather than a market demand effect. And, given the breadth of services tested, an

34

alternative theory based on market demand heterogeneity would require the unlikely scenario that
an entering hospital could to gather information on and make choices about complex bundles of
good. With only these results, however, it is difficult to differentiate between causal
explanations such as isomorphism, local culture, competition, or market segmentation.
These results have practical implications for tax policy and health care regulatory policy
which are worth noting, though are discussed in detail elsewhere (Horwitz, 2003). First, theory
supports subsidizing nonprofit organizations on efficiency grounds based on the positive
externalities they create (e.g. medical research, education, and disease control) or the agency
problems they solve (e.g. they are more trustworthy decision-makers), which could be tested in
many ways (Gentry and Penrod, 2000). These findings suggest that in measuring community
benefit, policymakers should consider more than the provision of uncompensated care.
For example, in addition to public goods such as relatively unprofitable care for the poor,
nonprofits provide private goods such as the availability of medically appropriate services for
insured patients. To the extent that well-insured or wealthy patients want unprofitable services,
they may not be able to buy them because of distortions caused by regulations forcing hospitals
to take all comers. Well-insured patients, for example, may want and be willing to pay for a
local trauma center. Under normal market conditions, a for-profit hospital would meet this
demand. But, because hospitals must stabilize nonpaying, emergency patients before transferring
them to other hospitals, trauma centers can become big money losers. Nonprofits and
government hospitals can address this allocative inefficiency because they decide which services
to provide on grounds other than profit maximization.
Finally, ownership might be used helpfully to regulate. When purchasing goods such as
healthcare, where payers cannot specify the goods they want to buy nor monitor their supply,

35

payment incentives should be low-powered to avoid under-serving needy patients (Newhouse,
2001). Complicated reimbursement systems have been developed to combat the risks of
contracting under these circumstances, namely selection and skimping. With evidence that the
responsiveness to financial incentives differ by form, payers could adjust rates by or selectively
contract with different firm types.
