What Are the Determinants of Delayed Childbearing
and Permanent Childlessness in the United States?

ABSTRACT

This paper presents estimates of delayed childbearing and permanent
childlessness in the United States and the determinants of those phenomena.
The estimates are derived by fitting the Coale—McNeil marriage model to survey
data on age at first birth and by letting the parameters of the model depend
on covariates. Substantively, the results provide evidence that the low first
birth fertility rates experienced in the 1970's were due to both delayed
childbearing and to increasing levels of permanent childlessness. The results
also indicate that (a) delayed childbearing is less prevalent among black
women than among non—black women, (b) education and labor force participation
are important determinants of delayed childbearing, (c) the influence of education and labor force participation on delayed childbearing seems to be
increasing across cohorts, (d) education is positively associated with heterogeneity among women in their age at first birth, (d) the dispersion of age at
first birth is increasing across cohorts, (f) race has an insignificant effect
on childlessness, and (g) education is positively associated with childlessness, with the effect of education increasing and reaching strikingly high
levels for the most recent cohorts.

I. Int-roduction and Backound
During the 1970's, the first birth rate of American women reached its lowest

level since the Great Depression. At the same time, the number of women having
first births in their late twenties and early thirties showed a dramatic increase

over the previous decades' experience. Some researchers attempted to explain
these somewhat paradoxical facts by suggesting that they reflected a tendency of
recent cohorts to delay their childbearing relative to that of older cohorts

(see, for example, Skiar and Berkov, 1975; and Blake, 1979). In other words,
they advanced the view that these facts were primarily due to a change in the
timing of first births —— and not to a change in their completed level. This
seemed to be a reasonable view since the most plausible alternative hypothesis ——

an increase in permanent childlessness —— could not explain the increasing
numbers of first births experienced by older women. In addition, it carried an
important and reassuring implication, namely, that the first birth rate would
soon begin to rise as the delayers began to reach their desired age at first
birth.

Stimulated by these facts and by a desire to determine whether they were the
result of delayed childbearing, increasing childlessness, or both, a number of
independent research studies were conducted which focused on measuring recent
changes in the timing and frequency of first births (see, for example, Masnick,
1980a; Bloom 1982; Morgan and Rindfuss, 1982; Morgan, 1982; and Mosher and

• Bachrach, 1982). Although these studies vary greatly in terms of the data they
analyze (e.g., vital statistics data, retrospective survey data, or fertility
expectations data), their analytical framework (e.g., period or cohort analysis),
their statistical approach (e.g., simple examinations of age—specific first birth
rates, complex parametric models, etc.), and the populations to which they refer
(e.g., all women or ever—married women), their results are remarkably consistent:

—2—
they all provide evidence of either increasing childlessness, an increasing tendency to delay childbearing, or both.

The purpose of this paper is to further the analysis of age at first birth

in the United States in two ways. First, we shall present new evidence on the
tendency of recent cohorts of American women to delay their childbearing or to

remain forever childless. This evidence is derived from fitting the Coale—McNeil
marriage model to survey data on age at first birth. Because of its parametric
nature, the Coale—McNeil model is extremely useful in this application since many
of the cohorts whose first birth fertility patterns are of interest have yet to
complete their childbearing years; when fit to incomplete data, estimates of the
model permit one to project the remainder of a cohort's first birth fertility and

thereby its mean age at first birth and proportion forever childless. Moreover,
recent studies have established that the Coale—McNeil model provides a good fit
to first birth data derived from vital registrations statistics both in the U.S.

(Bloom, 1982) as well as in other countries (Bloom, 1983). Recent studies have
also developed statistical methods and computer software for fitting this model
to individual and household survey data on age at first birth (Rodriguez and

Trussell, 1980). In addition, illustrative analyses demonstrating the application of these methods to survey data on age at first birth have been prepared for
many of the countries in which World Fertility Surveys were conducted (Casterline
and Trussell, 1980; Hobcraft and Trussell, 1980; Trussell, 1980) .

However, the

• Coale—McNeil model has yet to be applied to survey data for the U.S. In this
study we remedy this deficiency by fitting the Coale—McNeil model to data on age

at first birth from three recent surveys of American women: (1) Cycle II of the
National Survey of Family Growth (conducted in 1976); (2) the young women sample
of the National Longitudinal Survey (conducted in 1978); and (3) the Census
Bureau's Current Population Survey (conducted in June 1980).

—3—
The second objective of this paper is to estimate

-first

determinan-ts

birth in the United States. Most previous work has approached this problem

by estimating the parameters of first birth schedules constructed separately for
individual classifications of one or more different variables (e.g., the mean age
at first birth by race group and years of education; see Trussell, 1980; Wilkie,

1981; and Bloom 1982). However, because cell sizes rapidly diminish as the
number of variables and classifications increase, such attempts are severely lim-

ited by the availability of data. Multiple regression analysis has also been
used to estimate the determinants of age at first birth (see Hirschman and Rind—
fuss, 1980; Masnj.ck, 19801,; and Rindfuss, Bumpass, and St. John, 1980). Trussell

and Bloom (1983) have shown, however, that regression analysis yields biased

results if applied to a sample of women who have yet to complete their childbear-

ing years. Moreover, regression analysis is less than fully satisfactory because
it fails to incorporate existing knowledge about the age pattern of women at
first birth (see Trussell, Menken, and Coale, 1982; Bloom, 1982; and Bloom,

1983). To effectively deal with these problems, Trussell and Bloom have
developed a model which combines elements of both the Coale—McNeil model

of

regression analysis. It does this by assuming that the Coale—McNeil model
describes the underlying pattern of age at first birth but that its parameters
depend on covariates in a regression—like manner.
In this paper we apply the Trussell—Bloom extension of the Coale—McNeil

model to first birth data contained in the three surveys named above. The vari-

ables whose effects on age at first birth we estimate are: race, religion,
rural—urban childhood residence, education, and labor force participation prior

to first birth. We test various hypotheses about the effects of these variables
both within and across cohorts and compare the results derived from the different
data sets.

Section II provides a brief description of the Coale—McNeil marriage model,
its application to survey data on age at first birth, and its extension to

include covariate effects. Section III describes the three data sets used in
this study. Section IV presents and discusses the results of fitting various
specifications of the extended Coale—McNeil model to cohort data on age at first

birth in each of the three survey data sets. Section V summarizes the results of
the paper and comments on them in relation to results presented in other studies

of age at first birth. This section also speculates on the implications of the
results for the evolution of American fertility as well as for future research on
the subject of American fertility.

Covar-iates of Age at First Birth

the

1

The Coale—McNeil marriage model is based on the observation by Coale (1971)

that a common structure underlies age distributions of first marriages in dif-

ferent populations. As shown by Coale and further supported by numerous other
studies inspired by Coales work, this distribution is smooth, u.niinodal, skewed

to the right, and is close to zero below age fifteen and above age fifty. Furthermore, Coale observed that the differences in age—at—marriage distributions
• across female populations are almost entirely accounted for by differences in
their means, their standard deviations, and their cumulative values at the older

ages, e.g., age fifty. To facilitate the application of this finding, Coale

Coale and McNeil (1972), Trussell, Menken, and Coale (1982), Bloom (1982,
1983), Rodriguez and Trussell (1980), Casterline and Trussell (1980),
Hobcraft and Tmussell (1980), Trussell (1980), and Trussell and Bloom
(1983).

constructed a standard schedule of age at first marriage using data for Sweden,

1865—1869. In later work, Coale and McNeil (1972) developed a closed—form
expression which closely replicated this Swedish standard (and many other

observed marriage distributions, after suitably transforming their means, stan-

dard deviations, and cumulative values at age fifty). The mathematics leading to
this expression also provided an appealing behavioral interpretation of the

social process underlying entry into first marriage. According to this interpretation, age at marriage is viewed as the sum of a series of random variables, the

first describing the age at which a woman first becomes marriageable (assumed to
be normally distributed) and the others measuring the successive delays between
becoming marriageable and meeting one's first spouse, meeting one's first spouse
and becoming engaged, and becoming engaged and getting married (with these random
variables all assumed to be exponentially distributed with parameters in arithmetic sequence).
Subsequent research has done little either to confirm or deny the behavioral

interpretation of the Coale—McNeil model. However, the interpretation does suggest that the marriage model can also be applied to distributions of age at first

birth. This conclusion hinges essentially on the assumption of an exponential
delay between first marriage and first birth, which would be true if there were
no childbearing outside of marriage, if all women were equally fecund, and if
fecundability did not decline with age.2 Recent empirical studies have confirmed
• the ability of the Coale—McNeil model to replicate first birth distributions and

have demonstrated its usefulness in their analysis (see Trussell, Menken, and
Coale, 1982; Bloom, 1982, 1983; Rodriguez and Trussell, 1980; Casterline and

2. The conclusion follows because the convolution of a normal and four
exponential variables can be very closely approximated by the convolution
of a normal and three exponential variables (see Coale and McNeil, 1972).

—6—
Trussell, 1980; Hobcraft and Trussell, 1980; and Trussell, 1980)
In formal terms, the Coale—McNeil model can be expressed as:

g(a) =

1.2813 exp [—1.145 (- + .805) — expll.896 (- + .805)11

where g(a) is the proportion of women having their first birth at age
observed population and ii,

a,

(1)

in the

and E are, respectively, the mean and standard

deviation of age at first birth (for those who ever have a first birth), and the
proportion ever having a first birth.4 Rodriguez and Trussell (1980) have derived

the likelihood function associated with this model and have developed a computer
program to estimate its parameters from survey data drawn either from a sample of
all women or from a sample of women who had a birth prior to the survey date.5 In
the latter case, only the parameters ji and a are estimated; E must be set at
unity.

Trussell and Bloom extend this formulation by deriving the likelihood function which allows each of the (two or) three parameters to depend on covariates.
For simplicity, they assume a linear relationship.

3. All of these studies conclude that the marriage model provides a good fit
to first birth data, with the exception of the studies by Casterline and
Trussell and Bobcraft and Trussell. However, it is likely that the
"negative" results reported in those two studies were caused by age
misstatement, sampling error, and period—related irregularities in the WFS
data analyzed. Since similar problems may plague the present analysis we
shall proceed cautiously and compare our results across data sets and with
results based on aggregate data (which are less subject to such problems).
4. This form of the marriage model is a reparameterization of the original
form presented in Coale and McNeil (1972). It was derived by Rodriguez
and Trussell (1980) and is used here because it expresses the model in
terms of parameters that are intuitively easier to understand than Coale's
a0, K, and C (although E = C).
5. The program is entitled NUPTIAL and is available from the World Fertility
Survey (in London) at a nominal cost.

covariate vectors may or may not be different; however, in all cases, standard

mates of the parameter vectors , 'y, and a. The program uses the routine DFP in
the numerical optimization package GQOl'T.6 For computational ease, the program

requires the covariates to be categorical in nature.7 ,8

III. The- Data

As noted in Section I, this study uses three independent data sets to esti-

mate the age patterns of American women at first birth and their covariates. The
use of multiple data sets is prompted by the fact that no one data set is

uniquely well—suited to the tasks at hand. In addition, we feel that the

package GQOPT is available from the Econometric Research Program,

7. A program to estimate the extended Coale—MoNeil model is available from
the authors upon request (and at cost). It is a modified version of
NUPTIAL which is much easier to use than the program used to compute the
estimates in Trussell and Bloom (1983).
8. Trussell and Bloom (1983) also propose and investigate the use of a
proportional hazards model in estimating the covariates of age at first
birth. However, that model is not used in this study because (a) it can
only be fit to data from an all—woman sample, (b) it cannot be used to
project, and (c) empirically, it performed no better than the extended
Coale—McNeil model in illustrative analyses presented in Trussell and
Bloom (1983).

—8—
consistency of results derived from different sources of information is an impor-

tant indication of their strength. The remainder of this section provides a
brief description of each of the three data sets.

A. National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)-, Cycle II
Cycle II of the NSFG was conducted in 1976 by the National Center for Health

Statistics through personal interviews with 8611 women aged 15—44 years. To be
eligible for interview the women had to be either currently married, previously
married, or never—married mothers with offspring living in the same household.
Thus, the NSFG is a representative sample of ever—married women and never—married

women with children present in their household. It is not a representative sample of never—married women who have had no children or of never—married mothers
whose children do not live in their household.
For the purposes of this study, the NSFG is useful because it contains
information on age at first birth along with several other retrospective socio-

economic variables that presumably influence the age at first birth. These variables and the coding scheme adopted for them are: race (black or not—black),
religion (Catholic or non—Catholic), childhood residence (rural or urban), education at time of survey (less than high school, high school, greater than high
school), and employment history prior to first birth (did or did not ever work).

All women aged 25—44 at the time of the survey who had a first birth between ages

12 and 44 are included in our data file. Because we do not have information on
women who never had a first birth, we cannot estimate the parameter E (i.e., the
proportion ever having a first birth) from this sample; nor can we estimate its

covariates. Observations were counted more or less heavily depending on their
9. A comprehensive publication detailing the design of the NSFG (Cycle II) is
provided by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1981).

sample weights, with the weights adjusted to have mean unity.

13.

National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Young Women, 14—24

10

This NLS survey has been conducted yearly since 1968 when it started with

5159 women aged 14—24. The main purpose of this survey is to gather information
on the labor market experiences of young women. As a result, it is primarily
oriented toward questions on a wide range of socio—economic variables. However,
in 1978, a complete reinterview of the original sample of women was conducted and

a question on age at first birth was asked. Thus, we have used the 1978 NLS tape
to construct a data set on age at first birth for women aged 24—34 in 1978.11
Sample weights were used in the creation of this data set after adjusting the

weights so they average to one.
In comparison to the NSFG data, the NLS data are more useful because the

sample refers to all women and because the data are more recent. On the other
hand, the NLS data have a smaller sample size, they refer to a narrower group of
ages, and they contain information on fewer socio—economic variables relevant to

a study of age at first birth. The variables used are race (black or non—black),
childhood residence (rural or urban), and education at time of survey (less than

high school; equal to high school; greater than high school). In addition, the
NLS data may be somewhat nonrepresentative because of sample attrition, although
the 1978 reinterview includes 76 percent of the original participants.

10. For further details on the NLS, see Center for Human Resource Research
(1982).
11. A few observations on women aged 35 in 1978 are also included in our
sample.

C.

Current Population Survey (CPS)

12

The CPS is a nationwide sample survey conducted monthly by the Bureau of the

Census. It involves detailed personal interviews in about 60,000 households in
which information on a variety of demographic, social, and economic variables is

recorded. The unit of observation is the individual; the sample universe consists of all persons living in the surveyed households.

In the June, 1980 CPS, the normal set of questions was supplemented with a

set of retrospective marital and fertility questions. Included on the supplementary survey instrument was a question on age at first birth which was asked for
all women aged 18—75. lJnfortunately, there are few retrospective covariates in

the CPS which could sensibly be hypothesized to affect age at first birth. However, we have constructed the following two variables: race (black, not black)
and education at time of survey (less than high school, high school, greater than
high school)

13

Although the CPS data set only permits estimation of two covariate effects,
it is extremely useful in this study because (a) it refers to all women, (b) it

includes an exceptionally large number of observations which permits parameter
estimation for single—year cohorts, and (c) it is the most recent of the three

data sets used in this study. As with the two other sets of data, sample weights
were used in creating this data file after adjusting them so they average to one.

12. For further details see U.S. Bureau of the Census (1980).

13. With the exception of education, all of the covariates used in this study
measure individual characteristics at the time of first birth. We define
education on the basis of years completed prior to the survey rather than
years completed prior to the first birth because we believe the former
measure is a (marginally) superior social indicator and because it can be
constructed for all three data sets. However, empirical results differed
insignificantly when we experimented with the two alternative measures on
the NLS data.

IV. Results
A. Estimates Computed Without Covariates
Table I presents the results of fitting the Coale—McNeil model to the three

sets of first birth data described in the previous section. Note that these
results treat the estimated parameters p and e (and E) as constants, i.e., they

are not allowed to depend on covariates. Note also that, in order to facilitate
the detection of changes over time, separate estimates were computed for each of

the age groups indicated. For the sake of comparability with the results dis—
cussed in Section IV.B, these age groups were chosen to satisfy sample size

requirements for estimation with covariates. In addition, we were, in some
cases, able to compute estimates for younger cohorts than those included in Table

I. However, because those estimates suggested the data were truncated below the
mean age at first birth, we have chosen not to report them.14
Substantively, the results in Table I exhibit three interesting patterns.

First, all three data sets show an upward trend in the mean age at first birth
(g) across recent cohorts, with the increase ranging from about .3 years in the

NLS

data

to about 1.5 years across a wide range of cohorts in the NSFG and CPS

data sets. This trend provides some evidence of delayed childbearing among
recent cohorts although the mean age at first birth is not necessarily the best

indicator of that phenomenon (see Bloom, 1982, pages 365—6). However, examination of a better indicator (not reported in Table I) ——

the projected proportion

of women who have a first birth between ages 25 and 34 expressed as a fraction of
those who ever have a birth ——

also

reveals an increase across cohorts from about

.23, .26, and .25 to about .32, .28, and .32 for the three data sets, respec-

tively. These trends provide somewhat stronger confirmation of the increasing
14. Bloom (1982, p. 355 and n. 10) concludes that such estimates are likely to
be seriously misleading.

— 12 —

tendency of recent cohorts to delay childbearing.
Second, the results from all three data sets show an upward trend in the

standard deviation of age at first birth across cohorts. This finding reflects
increasing heterogeneity in the age at which women experience their first birth.

Third, the results computed for the NLS and CPS data provide strong evidence
of an increase across cohorts in the level of permanent childlessness, i.e.,
1.0 — E.

More specifically, according to these results, the incidence of child-

lessness among the most recent cohorts of women included in this analysis will

reach 20 to 25 percent, which represents a substantial increase over the 10 percent rate which prevailed (or is projected to prevail) among the older cohorts.
Before we turn to the next sub—section's discussion of covariate effects,

two additional points deserve mention. First, the parameter estimates reported
in Table I are remarkably consistent across data sets, both in terms of their

levels and their trends (see Figures 1 and 2). This finding provides considerable support for the external validity of these estimates. Second, the estimates

of i and a (and E) computed from the three survey data sets are also remarkably
similar to estimates reported in Bloom (1982) which were based on aggregate vital

statistics data. This observation provides support for the results presented in
that earlier study and also enhances our confidence in the results presented
herein.

• B. Estimates Computed With Covariates
The results of fitting the extended Coale—McNeil model to survey data on age

at first birth are presented in Tables II, III, and IV. The results we present
are representative of the broader set of results we computed in the process of

conducting this research. In order to facilitate hypothesis testing, the results
presented also refer to specifications which are successively nested in each

— 13 —

other.

In addition, since the covariates entered are, in all cases, categorical,

their effects must be interpreted relative to the appropriate reference category.

Depending on the data set and specification, these reference categories are
always, when appropriate (1) non—black, (2) Catholic, (3) urban childhood

residence, (4) completed education less than high school, and (5) did not work

prior to first birth. The covariates all have linear effects on the Coale—McNeil
parameters although their effect on age at first birth is highly nonlinear.

At the outset it should be noted that aggregate trends in age at first birth

can be affected by the covariates in two ways. First, the model can remain the
same across cohorts but values of the covariates can change. For example, it
might be found that one year of increased education always increases age at first

birth by 1.25 years. If educational attainment increases for each successive
cohort, age at first birth will, as a consequence, increase in the population.

Alternatively, the model may change across cohorts. For example, the effect of
an additional year of education on age at first birth may increase across cohorts

from 1.0 years to 1.5 years. Such a change in the model will also affect the
aggregate age at first birth. This effect is independent of the effect of changing educational attainment and can be discerned by estimation of the model we

propose. Of course, in practice, it is likely that the two effects operate
simultaneously although it is useful to disentangle them, which is what we do
below.

In choosing variables for inclusion as covariates, we were limited by the

nature of the available data. Nevertheless, of those variables that were available in each data set, we chose covariates whose effect on fertility has been
either suggested or demonstrated in other studies (see, especially, Waite and
Stolzenberg, 1976; DeJong and Sell, 1977; Veevers, 1970; Westoff and Jones, 1979;
Masnick, 19801,; Rindfuss, Bumpass, and St. John, 1980; Wilkie, 1981; Bloom 1982;

— 14 —

Bloom and Pebley, 1982; Mosher and Bachrach, 1982; Morgan and Rindfuss, 1982.)
Thus, over a priori expectations are (1) that i

is

negatively related to being

black and having an urban childhood residence, but positively related to years of
education and participation in the labor force,15 and (2) that E is negatively
related to education, labor force participation, and urban childhood residence,
but positively related to being Catholic and being black.

16

We begin our discussion of substantive results with the estimates presented

in Table II for the NSFG data. The first set of columns presents the estimates
computed when & and a are both modeled as linear functions of a constant and

variables which measure race, religion, childhood residence, education, and labor

force participation prior to first birth. The second set of columns presents
estimates of the same model except that the covariate effects on a are con-

strained to be zero. Both of these specifications are generalizations of the
model whose estimates are reported in Table I in which covariate effects are constrained to be zero for both

and a.

The most notable result of Tables I and II is that the incorporation of
covariates into the model adds significantly to the model's explanatory power.

As can be easily verified by performing the appropriate likelihood ratio tests,
this statement holds true for all cohort groupings when covariate effects are

allowed for both the mean and the standard deviation. Moreover, the pattern of
covariate effects is basically consistent with our a prioxi expectations,

15. We have no a priori prediction of the effect of being Catholic on i since
the contraceptive practices of Catholics suggests a negative effect while
the prohibition on sex before marriage suggests a positive effect.
16. Our statistical procedure makes no correction for simultaneity bias which
may be introduced by the reciprocal effect of age at first birth on the
covariates in equations (2), e.g., on education. However, we believe this
limitation of our procedure is mitigated by the use of broad educational
categories and y the findings of Waite and Stolzenberg (1!'76) and Masnick
(1980b) which provide little evidence of such reciprocal effects.

— 15 —

although there are some surprises. First, education and labor force participation prior to first birth have positive and statistically significant effects on
ji.

These results indicate that more educated women and childless women who work

(and ultimately bear children) are more likely to delay childbearing. In addition, the effect of labor force participation is greater for more recent cohorts.
When coupled with the fact that labor force participation rates for (young)
females have risen over time, this finding suggests that labor force participation is becoming an increasingly important factor underlying the aggregate trend

to delay childbearing. Education appears to be another important determinant of
this trend. Since the parameter estimates do not change much across cohorts,
education influences age at first birth in the population because successive
cohorts have higher levels of educational attainment.
Second, the effects of race, religion, and childhood residence on ji

all

tend

to be small in magnitude, i.e., less than 1 year, and are often statistically

insignificant. Of all these effects, perhaps the most surprising is the small
race effect which is contrary to the significant negative effect found in most
other studies (e.g., Wilkie, 1981; Bloom, 1982, and Morgan and Rindfuss, 1982).

However, keep in mind that the race effects reported in those other studies are
based on models that are univariate in nature, unlike the race effects reported
in Table II, which hold other variables such as education and labor force parti-

cipation, fixed. In fact, in comparison to the results in Table II, estimates
(not reported here) of the race effect for specifications in which no other
covariates are included are always larger and are often statistically signifi-

cant. Thus, in contrast to other studies, the NSFG results suggest that the
independent effect of race on age at first birth is small, although it appears

that race does have an indirect effect on age at first birth which operates
through its effect on other covariates which influence age at first birth, e.g.,

— 16 —

education.17
Third, the standard deviation of age at first birth appears to be relatively
high for blacks, for women who work prior to their first birth, and for Cathol—

ics. Although these results are somewhat difficult to assess, they do suggest
that women with these characteristics (who ultimately bear children) are (or will

be) more heterogeneous in the timing of their first births than women without

them. In addition, the effect of labor force participation on the degree of
heterogeneity appears to be growing across cohorts.
Let us now consider the estimation results in Table III for the NLS data.

The organization of this table is similar to that of Table II except that we now
report estimates of the parameter E and its covariates although the number of
covariates is reduced.

In general, the results presented in Table III strongly support the inclu-

sion of covariates. The value of the log likelihood is significantly increased
when we allow for covariate effects on .t

or

on ji

and E.

18

Moreover, tests of sig-

nificance performed for individual estimates suggest that race and education are
important determinants of the mean age at first birth while residence and education are important determinants of the proportion ever having a first birth.
More specifically, the effect on z of being black is negative and significant,

holding education and residence constant. Furthermore, the estimated race

17. On the basis of a jnultivariate regression analysis, Masnick (1980b) also
finds that the negative effect on age at first birth of being black is
attenuated by the inclusion of other variables, and especially by
including an education variable.

18. Although we do not report the results here, we were also not able to
reject the hypothesis that all three parameters depend on covariates. The
results are not reported because including covariates for 0 generally had
little effect on estimates of the covariate effects for t and E, and
because the pattern of results for the covariates of a are less
interesting than the results for j and E and were, in fact, similar to
those computed from the NSFG data.

— 17 —

effects

are about one year greater than those estimated from the NSFG and they

are attenuated less by the inclusion of other covariates (although fewer covari—
ates are actually included).19 The race effects also increase across the two
cohort groups, suggesting that the tendency to delay childbearing is less characteristic of black women than of non—black women (since the intercept also

increases a little). Also increasing across cohorts are the effects of education
which are positive and greater in magnitude than those computed for the NSFG

data. Thus, the NLS results suggest that education, i.e., increasing educational
attainment combined with the increasing education effect, is an (increasingly)
important factor in the delay of childbearing.

The NLS results also provide interesting estimates of a and of the deter-

minants of E. First, the estimates of a increase across the two cohort groups,
providing evidence of increasing dispersion in age at first birth within covari—

ate cells. Second, the effect of race on E is small and insignificantly different from zero while the residence effect is significant and operates to
increase E by three to four percentage points for women with rural backgrounds.

On the other hand, education has a negative effect on E, with the effect being

small for women who do not continue their education past high school. However,
women who do continue their educations past high school have substantially lower

probabilities of ever having a first birth. Thus, education appears to be an
important determinant of childlessness.

Finally, let us turn to the results computed from the June, 1980 CPS that

are reported in Table IV. Like the results presented for the NLS data in Table
III, the CPS results are for two separate specifications, one in which it and E

19. These findings are essentially unchanged when we compare race effects
estimated from identical specifications in the two data sets, i.e., when
we drop the labor force participation variable and the religion variable
from the NSFG model.

— 18 —

depend on covariates (i.e., a is treated as a constant) and one in which only p
depends on covariates (i.e., a and E are constants). Although the nature of the
PS data limits us to the estimation of just two covariate effects ——
education ——

race and

the sample sizes are large enough to permit an analysis of results

for single year cohorts. Thus, we may focus our attention more closely on
cross—cohort changes in covariate effects.
The CPS results are similar to the NSFG and NLS results in several ways.
First, likelihood ratio tests do not permit us to reject the hypothesis that ji

separately,

or p and E together, depend on covariates. On the other hand, for

about one half of the cohorts we were able to reject the hypothesis that a
depends on covariates (when p and E both allow for covariate effects).2° Second,
the CPS results show that being black has a significant negative effect on p,

with the estimated effect being closer in magnitude to the effect estimated from
the NLS data than to the effect estimated from the NSFG data (even when compar-

able models are estimated). Moreover, the negative race effect seems to be
increasing in absolute value across cohorts, a finding which provides further
evidence that delayed childbearing is primarily a phenomenon that is associated

with non—black women (since the intercept also increases slightly). In addition,
results not reported here show that the race effect is attenuated by the inclu-

sion of education as a covariate. Third, the CPS results show that education has
a significant positive effect on p with the magnitude of the estimated effect

being roughly similar to that estimated from the NSFG and NLS data. However, the
increase across cohorts in the magnitude of the education effect is particularly
striking and provides strong evidence that education is an important determinant
of delayed childbearing (see Figure 3).

20. We computed, but do not report, the estimates necessary to confirm this
statement.

— 19 —

The final results of interest in Table IV relate to the covariates of E. In
general, the results provide little evidence of a race effect with the coeffi-

cient on the race variable usually being small in magnitude and statistically

insignificant. Thus, like the NLS results, the CPS results also provide no evidence that race is an important determinant of permanent childlessness. On the
other hand, education does appear to be an important determinant of childless-

ness. The coefficients on education are generally negative and significant with
magnitudes that are particularly large for women who continue their educations

beyond high school. Moreover, the education effects show fairly dramatic
increases across cohorts, ranging from essentially zero in the cohorts aged 35
and over to nearly twenty—five percent in the youngest cohorts (see Figure 4).

Thus, not only is education an important determinant of childlessness, it is also
a determinant whose importance appears to be growing.

V. -Summary and Conclusions
This paper has presented estimates of delayed childbearing and permanent
childlessness in the United States and of the determinants of those phenomena.

The estimates of delayed childbearing and permanent childlessness were derived by
fitting the Coale—McNeil marriage model to survey data on age at first birth.

The determinants of those phenomena were derived by estimating the extended version of the model proposed by Trussell and Bloom (1983) in which the parameters

of the model are allowed to depend on covariates. The covariates of the parameter E (i.e., the proportion of women ever having a first birth) are interpreted

as covariates of permanent childlessness (after reversing their signs). The
covariates of the parameter i

(i.e.,

the mean age at first birth) are interpreted

as covariates of delayed childbearing. We also discuss the covariates of a

— 20 —

(i.e.,

the standard deviation of age at first birth) since that parameter also

relates to the phenomenon of delayed childbearing.

Estimates are computed for cohorts of women covered by three sets of data:
the National Survey of Family Growth (1976), the National Longitudinal Survey of

Young Women (1978), and the Current Population Survey (June, 1980). The first
set of estimates refer only to women who ever have a first birth (i.e.1 we do not

estimate E or its covariates) while the second and third sets of estimates refer

to all women. Since the underlying pattern of age at first birth is represented
by a parametric model, we are able to compute consistent estimates of parameters

and covariates even for cohorts that have not yet completed their childbearing

years. This is an important feature of our study since existing folklore on
delayed childbearing and increasing childlessness suggest that they are both
phenomena which refer primarily to the fertility of recent cohorts.

The results of this study provide new evidence that the fertility behavior
of recent cohorts of American women is characterized by both delayed childbearing

and increasing childlessness. Because our results are based on survey data, they
complement those presented in Bloom (1982) which support similar conclusions

using comparable methods, but with aggregate data. The results also provide
strong support for the extension of the Coale—McNeil model to include covariate

effects. In virtually every specification we estimated, the explanatory power of
the model was significantly increased by adding covariates. Moreover, estimates
of the effects of different covariates reveal that (a) delayed childbearing is
less prevalent among black women than among non—black women, (b) education and
labor force participation are important determinants of delayed childbearing, (c)

the influence of education and labor force participation on delayed childbearing
seems to be increasing across cohorts, (d) education is positively associated
with heterogeneity among women in their age at first birth, (e) the dispersion of

— 21

—

age at first birth is increasing across cohorts, even after controlling for the
effect of different covariates on

and E, (f) race has an insignificant effect

on childlessness, and (g) education is positively associated with childlessness,

with the effect of education increasing across cohorts and reaching strikingly
high levels for women in recent cohorts who continue their educations beyond high
school.

Before concluding this paper, we comment briefly on the significance and

implications of these findings. First, the results presented provide strong evidence of changing cohort fertility patterns and determinants. This finding
highlights the importance of adopting a cohort approach to the study of initia-

tion of childbearing. In addition, it suggests that attempts to project incomplete cohort fertility by reference to the completed fertility of older cohorts
may be misleading because of the likelihood that substantially different models
are generating the two patterns.

Second, the results of this study are consistent with some of the results of
other studies of the determinants of delayed childbearing and permanent child-

lessness. For example, our results are consistent with the results of Masnick
(1980b) and Willie (1981) on the direction of the effects of education and race

on age at first birth. Our results also conform to Masnick's (1980b) finding on
the insignificance of childhood residence. On the other hand, our results suggest that being Catholic has an insignificant effect on age at first birth,

unlike the result in Masnick. Finally, our results on the determinants of childlessness are similar to those of DeJong and Sell (1977) who conclude that education and labor force participation have positive effects on the incidence of
childlessness, and to those of Mosher and Bachrach (1982) who find an important
education effect.

Finally, the results of this study strongly suggest that cohort fertility

— 22 —

patterns

are becoming increasingly heterogeneous. For example, recent cohorts

show much greater differences in the incidence and timing of their first birth

fertility than do older cohorts. Moreover, the differences are not solely the
result of the changing distribution of individual characteristics across cohorts,

e.g., increasing educational attainment and labor force participation for a sub-

stantial fraction of the cohort. Rather, the differences also seem to be the
result of particular characteristics having greater effects on first birth fer-

tility. Thus, it appears that women's fertility patterns will, to a greater
extent than ever before, be differentiated on the basis of observable charac-

teristics. Certainly, the results of this study provide evidence that race, education, and labor force participation are important indicators of those differ-

ences. Nevertheless, it seems apparent that other variables which we do not control for are also having an impact. Thus, we recommend further application of
the models used here to data sets which will permit richer covariate specifica-

tions. We also recommend that demographic surveys include more retrospective
questions relating to social, economic, demographic, and attitudinal variables

which may be related to first birth decisions. Greater use of longitudinal survey designs is also desirable. We already have suitable analytical constructs
and some indication that fertility decisions will increasingly depend on observ-

able information. What we need now are richer data sets so that future research
can explore the determinants of age at first birth more fully.
