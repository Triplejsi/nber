Ethnic Identification, Intermarriage, and Unmeasured Progress by Mexican Americans

NBER Working Paper No. 11423
June 2005
JEL No. J12, J15, J62
ABSTRACT
Using Census and CPS data, we show that U.S.-born Mexican Americans who marry non-Mexicans
are substantially more educated and English proficient, on average, than are Mexican Americans who
marry co-ethnics (whether they be Mexican Americans or Mexican immigrants). In addition, the
non-Mexican spouses of intermarried Mexican Americans possess relatively high levels of schooling
and English proficiency, compared to the spouses of endogamously married Mexican Americans.
The human capital selectivity of Mexican intermarriage generates corresponding differences in the
employment and earnings of Mexican Americans and their spouses. Moreover, the children of
intermarried Mexican Americans are much less likely to be identified as Mexican than are the
children of endogamous Mexican marriages. These forces combine to produce strong negative
correlations between the education, English proficiency, employment, and earnings of
Mexican-American parents and the chances that their children retain a Mexican ethnicity. Such
findings raise the possibility that selective ethnic “attrition” might bias observed measures of
intergenerational progress for Mexican Americans.

I. Introduction1
One of the most important and controversial questions in U.S. immigration research is
whether the latest wave of foreign-born newcomers (or their U.S.-born descendants) will
ultimately assimilate into the mainstream of American society, and whether the pace and extent
of such assimilation will vary across immigrant groups. In terms of key economic outcomes such
as educational attainment, occupation, and earnings, the sizeable differences by national origin
that initially persisted among earlier European immigrants have largely disappeared among the
modern-day descendants of these immigrants (Neidert and Farley 1985; Lieberson and Waters
1988; Farley 1990). There is considerable skepticism, however, that the processes of
assimilation and adaptation will operate similarly for the predominantly non-white immigrants
who have entered the United States in increasing numbers over the past thirty years (Gans 1992;
Portes and Zhou 1993; Rumbaut 1994). In a controversial new book, Huntington (2004) voices a
particularly strong version of such skepticism with regard to Hispanic immigration.
Mexicans assume a central role in current discussions of immigrant intergenerational
progress and the outlook for the so-called “new second generation,” not just because Mexicans
make up a large share of the immigrant population, but also because most indications of relative
socioeconomic disadvantage among the children of U.S. immigrants vanish when Mexicans are
excluded from the sample (Perlmann and Waldinger 1996, 1997). Therefore, to a great extent,
concern about the long-term economic trajectory of immigrant families in the United States is
concern about Mexican-American families.
Several recent studies compare education and earnings across generations of Mexican

Americans (Trejo 1997, 2003; Fry and Lowell 2002; Farley and Alba 2002; Grogger and Trejo
2002; Livingston and Kahn 2002; Blau and Kahn 2005; Duncan, Hotz, and Trejo 2005). Table 1
illustrates the basic patterns that emerge for men.2 Between the first and second generations,
average schooling rises by almost three and one-half years and average hourly earnings grow by
about 30 percent for Mexicans. The third generation, by contrast, shows little or no additional
gains, leaving Mexican-American men with an educational deficit of 1.3 years and a wage
disadvantage of about 25 percent, relative to whites. Similar patterns emerge for women, and
also when regressions are used to control for other factors such as age and geographic location
(Grogger and Trejo 2002; Blau and Kahn 2005; Duncan, Hotz, and Trejo 2005).
The apparent lack of socioeconomic progress between second and later generations of
Mexican Americans is surprising. Previous studies have consistently found parental education to
be one of the most important determinants of an individual’s educational attainment and ultimate
labor market success (Haveman and Wolfe 1994; Mulligan 1997). Through this mechanism, the
huge educational gain between first- and second-generation Mexican Americans should produce
a sizable jump in schooling between the second and third generations, because on average the
third generation has parents who are much better educated than those of the second generation.
Yet the improvement in schooling we expect to find between the second and third generations is
largely absent.
The research summarized in Table 1 suggests that intergenerational progress stalls for
Mexican Americans after the second generation. As noted by Borjas (1993) and Smith (2003),
2

These averages are calculated from March 1998-2002 Current Population Survey data, with standard errors shown in
parentheses. The samples for the earnings data are limited to individuals who worked during the calendar year preceding the
survey. The “white” ethnic group is defined to exclude Hispanics, as well as blacks, Asians, and Native Americans. The first
generation consists of immigrants: foreign-born individuals whose parents were also born outside the United States. The second
generation denotes U.S.-born individuals who have at least one foreign-born parent. The so-called “third generation,” which
really represents the third and all higher generations, identifies U.S. natives whose parents are also natives.

3
however, generational comparisons in a single cross-section of data do a poor job of matching
immigrant parents and grandparents in the first generation with their actual descendants in later
generations. Indeed, Smith (2003) finds evidence of more substantial gains between second- and
third-generation Mexicans when he combines cross-sectional data sets from successive time
periods in order to compare second-generation Mexicans in some initial period with their thirdgeneration descendants twenty-five years later. Yet even Smith’s analysis shows signs of
intergenerational stagnation for Mexican Americans. In his Table 4, for example, five of the six
most recent cohorts of Mexicans experience no wage gains between the second and third
generations. Moreover, all studies conclude that large education and earnings deficits (relative to
whites) remain for third- and higher-generation Mexicans.3
These findings—that the economic disadvantage of Mexican Americans persists even
among those whose families have lived in the United States for more than two generations, and
that the substantial progress observed between the first and second generations seems to stall
thereafter—raise doubts whether the descendants of Mexican immigrants are enjoying the same
kind of intergenerational advancement that allowed previous groups of unskilled immigrants,
such as the Italians and Irish, to eventually enter the economic mainstream of American society.
Such conclusions could have far-reaching implications, but the validity of the intergenerational
comparisons that underlie these conclusions rests on assumptions about ethnic identification that
have received relatively little scrutiny for Mexican Americans. In particular, analyses of
intergenerational change typically assume, either explicitly or implicitly, that the ethnic choices
made by the descendants of Mexican immigrants do not distort outcome comparisons across

different national origin groups, including Mexicans.

4
generations.
Ethnic identification is to some extent endogenous, especially among people at least one
or two generations removed from immigration to the United States (Alba 1990; Waters 1990).
Consequently, the descendants of Mexican immigrants who continue to identify themselves as
Mexican in the third and higher generations may be a select group. For example, if the most
successful Mexicans are more likely to intermarry or for other reasons cease to identify
themselves or their children as Mexican, then available data may understate human capital and
earnings gains between the second and third generations. In other words, research on
intergenerational assimilation among Mexican Americans may suffer from the potentially serious
problem that the most assimilated members of the group under study eventually fade from
empirical observation as they more closely identify with the group they are assimilating toward.4
For other groups, selective ethnic identification has been shown to distort observed
socioeconomic characteristics. American Indians are a particularly apt example, because they
exhibit very high rates of intermarriage, and fewer than half of the children of such
intermarriages are identified as American Indian by the Census race question (Eschbach 1995).
For these and other reasons, racial identification is relatively fluid for American Indians, and
changes in self-identification account for much of the surprisingly large increase in educational
attainment observed for American Indians between the 1970 and 1980 U.S. Censuses (Eschbach,
Supple, and Snipp 1998). In addition, Snipp (1989) shows that those who report American
Indian as their race have considerably lower schooling and earnings, on average, than the much
larger group of Americans who report a non-Indian race but claim to have some Indian ancestry.

4
Bean, Swicegood, and Berg (2000) raise this possibility in their study of generational patterns of fertility for Mexicanorigin women in the United States.

5
To cite another example, Waters (1994) observes selective ethnic identification among
the U.S.-born children of New York City immigrants from the West Indies and Haiti. The
teenagers doing well in school tend to come from relatively advantaged, middle-class families,
and these kids identify most closely with the ethnic origins of their parents. In contrast, the
teenagers doing poorly in school are more likely to identify with African Americans. This
pattern suggests that self-identified samples of second-generation Caribbean blacks might
overstate the socioeconomic achievement of this population, a finding that potentially calls into
question the practice of comparing outcomes for African Americans and Caribbean blacks as a
means of distinguishing racial discrimination from other explanations for the disadvantaged
status of African Americans (Sowell 1978).
Using microdata from the U.S. Census and from recent years of the Current Population
Survey (CPS), we begin to explore these issues for Mexican Americans. In particular, we
investigate what factors influence whether individuals choose to identify themselves (or their
children) as Mexican-origin, and how these ethnic choices may affect inferences about the
intergenerational progress of Mexican Americans. To date, analyses of ethnic responses and
ethnic identification employing large national surveys have focused primarily on whites of
European descent (Alba and Chamlin 1983; Lieberson and Waters 1988, 1993; Farley 1991), and
therefore much could be learned from a similar analysis that highlights ethnic choices among the
Mexican-origin population.
Existing studies (Stephan and Stephan 1989; Eschbach and Gomez 1998; Ono 2002)
demonstrate that the process of ethnic identification by Mexican Americans is fluid, situational,
and at least partly voluntary, just as has been observed for non-Hispanic whites and other groups.
These studies, however, do not directly address the issue that we will focus on: the selective

6
nature of Mexican identification and how it affects our inferences about intergenerational
progress for this population. Though previous research has noted the selective nature of
intermarriage for Hispanics overall (Qian 1997, 1999) and for Mexican Americans in particular
(Fu 2001; Rosenfeld 2001), this research has not examined explicitly the links between
intermarriage and ethnic identification, nor has previous research considered the biases that these
processes might produce in standard intergenerational comparisons of economic status for
Mexican Americans.
Ideally, if we knew the family tree of each individual, we could identify which individuals
are descended from Mexican immigrants and how many generations have elapsed since that
immigration took place. It would then be a simple matter to compare outcomes for this “true”
population of Mexican descendants with the corresponding outcomes for a relevant reference
group (e.g., non-Hispanic whites) and also with those for the subset of Mexican descendants who
continue to self-identify as Mexican-origin. Such an analysis would provide an unbiased
assessment of the relative standing of the descendants of Mexican immigrants in the United
States, and it would show the extent to which selective ethnic identification distorts estimated
outcomes for this population when researchers are forced to rely on standard, self-reported
measures of Mexican identity.
Following the 1970 Census, unusually detailed information of this sort was collected for a
small sample of individuals with ancestors from a Spanish-speaking country. After each
decennial U.S. Census, selected respondents to the Census long form are reinterviewed in order
to check the accuracy and reliability of the Census data. The 1970 Census was the first U.S.
Census to ask directly about Hispanic origin or descent, and therefore a primary objective of the
1970 Census Content Reinterview Study (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1974) was to evaluate the

7
quality of the responses to this new question. For this purpose, individuals in the reinterview
survey were asked a series of questions regarding any ancestors they might have who were born
in a Spanish-speaking country. Among those identified by the reinterview survey as having
Hispanic ancestors, Table 2 shows the percent who had previously responded on the 1970 Census
long form that they were of Hispanic “origin or descent.”5
Overall, 76 percent of reinterview respondents with ancestors from a Spanish-speaking
country had self-identified as Hispanic in the 1970 Census, but the correspondence between
Hispanic ancestry in the reinterview and Hispanic identification in the Census fades with the
number of generations since the respondent’s Hispanic ancestors arrived in the United States.
Virtually all (99 percent) first-generation immigrants born in a Spanish-speaking country
identified as Hispanic in the Census, but the rate of Hispanic identification dropped to 83 percent
for the second generation, 73 percent for the third generation, 44 percent for the fourth
generation, and all the way down to 6 percent for higher generations of Hispanics. Interestingly,
intermarriage seems to play a central role in the loss of Hispanic identification. Almost everyone
(97 percent) with Hispanic ancestors on both sides of their family identified as Hispanic in the
Census, whereas the corresponding rate was only 21 percent for those with Hispanic ancestors on
just one side of their family. Given the small number of Hispanics in the reinterview sample
(369 individuals reported having at least one ancestor from a Spanish-speaking country), the
percentages in Table 2 should be regarded with caution, especially those for the very small
samples of Hispanics who are fourth generation or higher. Nonetheless, these data do suggest
that self-identified samples of U.S. Hispanics might omit a large proportion of later-generation
individuals with Hispanic ancestors, and that intermarriage could be a fundamental source of

8
such intergenerational ethnic “attrition.”
Unfortunately, the microdata underlying Table 2 no longer exist, so we cannot use these
data to examine in a straightforward manner how selective ethnic attrition affects observed
measures of intergenerational progress for Mexican Americans.6 Out of necessity, we instead
adopt much less direct strategies for trying to shed light on this issue. First, we use the presence
of a Spanish surname as on objective, though imperfect, indicator of Mexican ancestry. Second,
we analyze the extent and selectivity of intermarriage by Mexican Americans. Third, we study
the links between Mexican intermarriage and ethnic identification, focusing on the children
produced by these intermarriages. Finally, we explore how intermarriage and ethnic
identification vary across generations of U.S.-born Mexicans. Throughout, we analyze the same
four outcome variables. The first two—educational attainment and English proficiency—are
important measures of human capital. The other two—employment and average hourly
earnings—are key indicators of labor market performance.

II. Spanish Surname
Our first set of analyses exploits the information about Spanish surnames that was made
available most recently in the 1980 Census. The microdata file indicates whether an individual’s
surname appears on a list of almost 12,500 Hispanic surnames constructed by the Census Bureau.
This information, however, is provided only for those individuals who reside in the following
6

Starting in 1980, the Census has included an open-ended question asking for each person’s “ancestry” or “ethnicity,”
with the first two responses coded in the order that they are reported (Farley 1991). For the purposes of identifying individuals
with Mexican or Hispanic ancestors, however, the Census ancestry question is not a good substitute for the detailed battery of
questions included in the 1970 Census Content Reinterview Study. Indeed, many 1980-2000 Census respondents who identified
as Hispanic in response to the Hispanic origin question failed to list an Hispanic ancestry in response to the ancestry item that
comes later on the Census long form questionnaire, perhaps because they thought it redundant and unnecessary to indicate their
Hispanic ethnicity a second time. Comparatively few respondents listed an Hispanic ancestry after identifying as non-Hispanic

9
five southwestern states: California, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico.
Though the surname list constructed for the 1980 Census is more extensive and accurate
than those used with previous Censuses, as a tool for identifying Hispanics the list suffers from
sins of both omission and commission. Both types of errors are introduced by the common
practice of married women taking the surname of their husbands, as Hispanic women can lose
and non-Hispanic women can gain a Spanish surname through intermarriage. The surname list
also errs by labeling as Hispanic some individuals of Italian, Filipino, or Native Hawaiian
descent who have names that appear on the list (Bean and Tienda 1987; Perkins 1993).
For our purposes, another weakness of the surname list is that it cannot distinguish
Mexicans from other Hispanic national origin groups. This weakness is minimized, however, by
limiting the sample to the aforementioned five southwestern states. In 1980, the Puerto Rican
and Cuban populations in these states were still quite small, and large-scale immigration from
Central and South America had not yet begun. As a result, the overwhelming majority of
Hispanics in these southwestern states are Mexican-origin. Indeed, in the samples of U.S.-born
individuals analyzed below, 88 percent of those who self-report as being of Hispanic origin
indicate Mexican as their national origin, and almost all remaining self-reported Hispanics fall
into the “Other Hispanic” category. Individuals in this “Other Hispanic” category are especially
prevalent in the states of New Mexico and Colorado, where some Hispanics whose families have
lived in these regions for many generations prefer to call themselves “Hispanos,” emphasizing
their roots to the Spaniards who settled the new world over their Mexican and Indian ancestry
(Bean and Tienda 1987).

when answering the Hispanic origin question, so the ancestry question actually produces a lower overall count of Hispanics than
does the Hispanic origin question (Lieberson and Waters 1988; del Pinal 2004).

10
The Spanish surname information provided in the 1980 Census is in addition to the race
and Hispanic origin questions typically employed to identify racial/ethnic groups. Our hope is
that, particularly for men, the presence of a Spanish surname in the five southwestern states
provides an objective, albeit imperfect, indicator of Mexican ancestry that allows us to identify
some individuals of Mexican descent who fail to self-report as Hispanic and who are therefore
missed by subjective indicators such as the Hispanic origin question in the Census. If so, then
perhaps differences in human capital and labor market outcomes between Spanish-surnamed
individuals who do and do not self-identify as Hispanic can reveal something about the selective
nature of ethnic identification for Mexican Americans.
To pursue this idea, we extracted from the 1980 Census five-percent microdata sample all
individuals between the ages of 25-59 who reside in the states of California, Texas, Arizona,
Colorado, and New Mexico. We focus on individuals in this age range because they are old
enough that virtually all of them will have completed their schooling, yet they are young enough
that observed labor market outcomes reflect their prime working years. Given our interest in
ethnic identification, we exclude from our sample anyone whose information about race,
Hispanic origin, or country of birth was allocated by the Census Bureau. To increase the
accuracy of the Spanish surname indicator, individuals whose race is American Indian or Asian
are also excluded, as is anyone else with a race other than white or black who neither has a
Spanish surname nor self-reports as being of Hispanic origin.
In our data, there are two different ways for individuals to be identified as Hispanic.
They can self-report being Hispanic in response to the Hispanic origin question, and they can
possess a Spanish surname. Based on these two Hispanic indicators, we define three mutually
exclusive types of Hispanic identification: those identified as Hispanic both by self-report and by

11
surname, those identified as Hispanic by self-report only (and not by surname), and those
identified as Hispanic by surname only (and not by self-report). Remaining individuals in our
sample are non-Hispanic whites and blacks (i.e., persons of white or black race who do not selfreport as being of Hispanic origin and also do not possess a Spanish surname). We conduct all
analyses separately for men and women.
Table 3 shows the ethnic distribution of our sample separately for U.S. natives and three
different groups of foreign-born individuals: those born in Mexico, those born in another
Hispanic country, and those born in a non-Hispanic foreign country. For now, let us focus on the
data for men in the top panel of the table. As might be expected, almost everyone born in
Mexico is identified as Hispanic and very few men born in non-Hispanic foreign countries are
identified as Hispanic. Just over 85 percent of men born in Hispanic countries other than Mexico
are identified as Hispanic. The Spanish surname indicator does not capture all Hispanics, as
substantial numbers of men born in Mexico and other Hispanic countries are identified as
Hispanic by self-report only. But note that few men born in Mexico and other Hispanic countries
are identified as Hispanic by surname only. Of men identified as Hispanic, only 0.5 percent of
those born in Mexico and 1.2 percent of those born in other Hispanic countries are identified by
surname only. Among U.S.-born men identified as Hispanic, however, the corresponding rate is
about 4 percent; still low, but noticeably higher. The higher-rate of surname-only identification
for U.S.-born Hispanics compared to foreign-born Hispanics is what we might expect if this
group in part captures men of Hispanic descent who are choosing not to self-identify as Hispanic,
because ethnicity is likely to be more fluid and malleable for U.S.-born Hispanics than for
Hispanic immigrants. The patterns are similar for women in the bottom panel of the table, except
that for all countries of birth women show more inconsistency between self-reported and

12
surname-based indicators of Hispanicity than men do, presumably because of errors sometimes
introduced when married women take their husband’s surname.
Henceforth we limit the analysis to U.S.-born individuals, because issues of ethnic
identification are most relevant for this group. Table 3 indicates that, even among the U.S.-born,
men with a Spanish surname usually also self-report being of Hispanic origin. As noted above,
just 4 percent of the U.S.-born men that we label as Hispanic are so identified only by their
Spanish surname. A larger share of Hispanic men, 13 percent, self-identify as Hispanic but do
not possess a surname on the Census list of Spanish surnames. The vast majority, 83 percent,
identifies as Hispanic through both self-report and surname. For U.S.-born Hispanic women, the
corresponding proportions are 13 percent identify as Hispanic by surname only, 21 percent by
self-report only, and 66 percent through both indicators.
For each type of Hispanic identification, as well as for non-Hispanic whites and blacks,
Table 4 displays averages for the following measures of human capital and labor market
performance: completed years of schooling, percent deficient in English, percent employed, and
the natural logarithm of average hourly earnings. Here, we define someone to be “deficient” in
English if they speak a language other than English at home and they report speaking English
worse than “very well.”7 The employment and earnings measures pertain to the calendar year
preceding the Census. We compute average hourly earnings as the ratio of annual earnings to
annual hours of work, where annual earnings are the sum of wage and salary income and selfemployment income, and annual hours of work are the product of weeks worked and usual
weekly hours of work. The samples for the earnings data are limited to those who were

The Census asks individuals whether they “speak a language other than English at home,” and those who answer
affirmatively then are asked how well they speak English, with possible responses of “very well,” “well,” “not well,” or “not at
all.”

employed.8 Standard errors are shown in parentheses.
In general, the top panel of Table 4 shows that men identified as Hispanic by self-report
only or by surname only have more human capital and better labor market outcomes than men
identified as Hispanic by both indicators. Men with inconsistent responses to the Hispanic
indicators have at least a year and a half more schooling and over 10 percent higher wages than
Hispanic men with consistent responses,9 and rates of English deficiency are lower for men with
inconsistent responses. The bottom panel of Table 4 shows patterns for women that are
qualitatively similar but even stronger, with a substantial advantage in the employment rate now
evident for women with inconsistent Hispanic indicators.
The least squares regression coefficients reported in Table 5 illustrate more clearly these
comparisons and also show how the comparisons change after conditioning on the influence of
various controls. The dependent variables are the four outcomes introduced in Table 4. The key
independent variables are dummies indicating the type of Hispanic identification and a dummy
identifying non-Hispanic blacks, so that the reference group consists of non-Hispanic whites.
The first regression specification—the columns labeled (1) in Table 5—includes only the ethnic
dummy variables, and therefore these coefficients reproduce the mean comparisons from Table 4.
The second specification—the columns labeled (2)—adds controls for geographic location and
age. The controls for geographic location are dummy variables identifying the five states
included in the sample and whether the individual resides in a metropolitan area. The controls
for age are dummy variables identifying five-year age intervals. Finally, for the employment and
8

In addition, observations in the 1980 Census data with computed hourly earnings below $1 or above $200 are
considered outliers and excluded.
9

For expositional convenience, throughout the paper we will treat log wage differences as representing percentage
wage differentials, although we recognize that this approximation becomes increasingly inaccurate for log differences on the

14
earnings outcomes, there is a third specification—the columns labeled (3)—that also conditions
on the human capital variables that measure educational attainment and English proficiency.
Table 5 indicates that, for both men and women, and for all outcomes, controlling for
geographic location and age has little effect on the patterns just described. The coefficients
change only slightly as we move from specification (1) to specification (2). For the labor market
outcomes, however, controlling for human capital has a large effect. Moving from specification
(2) to specification (3) dramatically shrinks the employment and earnings differences associated
with the type of Hispanic identification, and it also reduces the labor market disadvantage of
Hispanics relative to non-Hispanic whites.10 These findings reveal that differences in labor
market outcomes across Hispanic groups and between Hispanics and whites are largely driven by
the corresponding differences in schooling and English proficiency.
How should we interpret these patterns? If the group of Hispanic men identified by
surname only captures some Hispanics who are choosing to loosen their ethnic attachment, then
we have found evidence that such individuals are positively selected in terms of human capital
and labor market outcomes. The small size of this group, however, argues against regarding
these results as anything more than suggestive. Note that we also found evidence of positive
selection for Hispanic men identified by self-report only. These men may be Hispanics who lost
their Spanish surname through intermarriage, as could occur if they have an Hispanic mother or

order of .25 or more in absolute value. In such instances, one can calculate the implied percentage wage differential as ex -1,
where x represents the estimated log wage difference.
10

One surprise in Table 5 is that the specification (3) earnings regression for women yields a positive and statistically
significant coefficient for the dummy variable indicating deficient English. This counterintuitive result arises from the strong
correlation, for Hispanics, between education and English proficiency, and from the fact that the regression restricts the returns to
education to be the same for Hispanics and non-Hispanics. Either dropping education from this regression or allowing its effect
to vary by ethnicity produces the expected negative coefficient for deficient English. Allowing the impact of education to differ
for Hispanics and non-Hispanics does not, however, alter the pattern of earnings differences by type of Hispanic identification or
the conclusion that most of these earnings differences derive from human capital differences.

grandmother who married a non-Hispanic man and took his surname. Therefore, the results for
the “Hispanic by self-report only” group are consistent with the results on the selectivity of
Mexican intermarriage that we present in the next section. Finally, the patterns for women are
similar to those for men but cannot necessarily be interpreted in the same way, because the
“Hispanic by surname only” group includes some non-Hispanic women who acquired a Spanish
surname through marriage.

III. Mexican Intermarriage
Intermarriage has always been a fundamental source of ethnic flux and leakage in
American society (Lieberson and Waters 1988). For Mexican Americans, Rosenfeld (2002,
Table 1) shows that intermarriage increased substantially between 1970 and 1980 and even more
sharply between 1980 and 1990. Indeed, Perlmann (2003) argues that the proclivity for
intermarriage by second-generation Mexicans today is similar to what was observed for secondgeneration Italians in the early 1900s. This argument has potentially provocative implications for
intermarriage by future generations of Mexican Americans, because intermarriage became so
commonplace for subsequent generations of Italian Americans that Alba (1986) characterized
this group as entering the “twilight of ethnicity.” Accordingly, our second set of analyses
examines the extent and selectivity of Mexican-American intermarriage.
Because intermarriage is probably the predominant source of leakage from the population
of self-identified Mexican Americans (through the ethnic choices made by the children and
grandchildren of these intermarriages), knowing the magnitude of Mexican-American
intermarriage is important for evaluating the potential bias that such leakage could produce in
intergenerational comparisons. One important limitation, however, of Census (and CPS) data for

16
investigating the frequency of intermarriage is that these data measure prevalence rather than
incidence. In other words, these data show the marriages that exist at a given point in time,
rather than all marriages that took place over a given span of time. Prevalence measures of
intermarriage may differ from incidence measures if, for example, intermarriages are at a higher
risk of divorce than are endogamous marriages. For our purposes, prevalence measures of
intermarriage that capture both marital incidence and duration may actually be preferable, since
longer-lasting marriages are more likely to produce children and have the influence on ethnic
identification in succeeding generations that is the focus of our interest.
For these analyses, we employ microdata from the 2000 Census. The sample includes
marriages that meet the following conditions: both spouses are between the ages of 25-59, the
couple currently lives together, and at least one spouse is a U.S.-born individual identified as
Mexican by the Census question regarding Hispanic origin. Furthermore, we exclude marriages
in which either spouse has allocated information about Hispanic origin. These restrictions yield a
sample of 62,734 marriages.
For the U.S.-born Mexican husbands and wives involved in these marriages, Table 6
shows the nativity/ethnicity distributions of their spouses. Intermarriage is widespread in our
samples of Mexican-American husbands and wives. The first column indicates that just over
half (51 percent) of U.S.-born husbands of Mexican descent have wives of the same nativity and
ethnicity, and another 14 percent are married to Mexican immigrants. Therefore, the remaining
35 percent of Mexican-American husbands have wives that are neither Mexican nor Mexican
American, with the bulk of these wives (27 percent) being U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites. The
nativity/ethnicity distribution of Mexican-American wives is quite similar, except for a
somewhat higher rate of marriage to Mexican immigrants and a correspondingly lower rate of

17
marriage to U.S.-born Mexicans.
Table 6 suggests that, in terms of nativity and ethnicity, the marital choices of U.S.-born
Mexicans can be classified into three main categories of spouses: U.S.-born Mexicans, foreignborn Mexicans, and non-Mexicans. Based on this simplification, Table 7 proposes a typology of
marriages involving U.S.-born Mexicans that also indicates, for marriages in which only one
spouse is a U.S.-born Mexican, whether the other spouse is the husband or the wife. Note that
the unit of analysis in Table 7 is the marriage, rather than the U.S.-born Mexican husband or wife
as in Table 6. This shift in focus is consistent with our interest in how Mexican intermarriage
may impact the ethnic identification and observed socioeconomic characteristics of subsequent
generations, because children are a product of the marriage. Table 7 demonstrates the potential
for ethnic leakage among the children of Mexican Americans, as almost half (48 percent) of
Mexican-American marriages involve a non-Mexican spouse.
Using this same typology of Mexican-American marriages, Table 8 presents averages of
the human capital and labor market variables for the husbands and wives in each type of
marriage.11 These calculations include all husbands or wives in the relevant marriages, not just
the Mexican-American husbands or wives. Therefore, we can observe not only the selectivity of
U.S.-born Mexicans who intermarry, but also the characteristics of their spouses. For example,
wife outcomes for the marriage type “Husband non-Mexican” provide information about
Mexican-American women who marry non-Mexicans, whereas husband outcomes for this same
marriage type provide information about the spouses of these women. For both husbands and

11

As before, the samples for the earnings data are limited to employed individuals. In addition, observations in the
2000 Census data with computed hourly earnings below $2.50 or above $500 are considered outliers and excluded. Beginning in
1990, the Census questions about educational attainment were changed to ask specifically about postsecondary degrees obtained
rather than years of schooling. We follow Jaeger’s (1997) recommendations for how to construct a completed years of schooling
variable from the revised education questions.

18
wives, outcomes for the marriage type “Both spouses U.S.-born Mexican” provide information
about Mexican Americans involved in endogamous marriages.
Table 8 reveals striking differences in human capital and labor market outcomes between
Mexican Americans married to Mexicans and those married to non-Mexicans. U.S.-born
Mexicans married to non-Mexicans have much higher education, English proficiency,
employment, and earnings than those with spouses that are also U.S.-born Mexicans, 12 whereas
U.S.-born Mexicans married to Mexican immigrants have lower outcomes than any other group
of Mexican Americans. Table 8 also shows that non-Mexican spouses of Mexican Americans
have the best outcomes of any group considered, and that Mexican immigrant spouses of
Mexican Americans have the worst outcomes.
The magnitudes of these differences are easier to see in Table 9, which displays
regression-adjusted outcome differences constructed in a similar fashion as those shown
previously in Table 5. Here, the key independent variables are dummies indicating the type of
marriage, with the reference group consisting of endogamous marriages in which both spouses
are U.S.-born Mexicans. In addition, the controls for geographic locations are now dummy
variables identifying the nine Census divisions, the individual states of California and Texas, and
whether the respondent resides in a metropolitan area.
Among Mexican-American husbands, for example, those with non-Mexican wives
average a year more schooling than those with U.S.-born Mexican wives. Compared to their
counterparts in endogamous marriages, intermarried Mexican-American men also have a 9
percentage point lower rate of English deficiency, a 3 percentage point higher rate of

Consistent with our results, White and Sassler (2000) find that Mexican Americans married to non-Hispanic whites
tend to live in neighborhoods with higher socioeconomic status than do endogamously married Mexican Americans.

19
employment, and a 15 percent wage advantage. These unadjusted differences, from regression
specification (1), narrow only slightly after controlling for geographic location and the husband’s
age in specification (2). The non-Mexican husbands of intermarried Mexican-American women
have even better outcomes than intermarried Mexican-American men, particularly in terms of
education and hourly earnings, but these differences are not nearly as great as the corresponding
differences just described between Mexican-American men in endogamous versus exogamous
marriages. Similar patterns are evident for women, except that employment differences
associated with intermarriage are larger than they are for men, and outcome differences between
Mexican-Americans with non-Mexican spouses and non-Mexicans with Mexican-American
spouses tend to be smaller for women than for men.
For both husbands and wives, a comparison of specifications (2) and (3) shows that
controlling for education and English proficiency dramatically shrinks employment and earnings
differences across marriage types. Evidently, the human capital selectivity associated with
intermarriage generates most of the labor market differences observed along this same
dimension.
Our finding of positive educational and economic selectivity for intermarried Mexican
Americans is not unexpected (Qian 1999). First of all, opportunities for meeting and interacting
with people from other racial/ethnic groups are better for more educated Mexican Americans,
because highly-educated Mexican Americans tend to live, study, and work in less segregated
environments. Second, given the sizeable educational deficit of the average Mexican American,
better-educated Mexican Americans are likely to be closer in social class to the typical nonMexican. Third, attending college is an eye-opening experience for many students that may work
to diminish preferences for marrying within one’s own racial/ethnic group. Finally, the theory of

20
“status exchange” in marriage formulated by Davis (1941) and Merton (1941) predicts that
members of lower-status minority groups (such as Mexican Americans) would tend to need
higher levels of socioeconomic attainment to attract spouses who are members of higher-status
majority groups.

IV. Mexican Identification of Children
We next investigate the link between intermarriage and ethnic identification by
examining what determines whether the children of Mexican Americans are identified as
Mexican.13 We start with the same sample of Mexican-American marriages from the 2000
Census used in the intermarriage analyses of the preceding section, but henceforth we further
restrict the sample to those marriages that have produced at least one child under age 19 currently
residing in the household. We continue to exclude marriages in which either spouse has
allocated information about Hispanic origin, and we now impose this condition for the relevant
children as well. Finally, to the extent possible with the information available in the Census, we
exclude families in which any of the children are suspected of being stepchildren. These
restrictions produce a sample of 37,921 families.
Using the same typology of Mexican-American marriages introduced earlier, Table 10
reports for each type of marriage the percent in which the youngest child is identified as Mexican
by the Hispanic origin question in the Census.14 Of primary interest for our purposes is how this
13

Along the same lines, Xie and Goyette (1997) use 1990 Census data to study the determinants of Asian identification
among children produced by intermarriages between an Asian and a non-Asian.
14

Because Mexican identification varies little across children within a given family, we report results using only
information for the youngest child. Instead using information for the oldest child produces similar results, as would using
indicators for whether any or all of the children in the family are identified as Mexican. In Census data, note that parents are
likely to be responding for their children. An important question is how these children will respond to survey questions about
ethnic identification when they become adults and answer from themselves. See Portes and Rumbaut (2001, Chapter 7) for a
discussion of parental and other influences on the evolving ethnic identities of second-generation adolescents.

21
percentage varies with the nativity and ethnicity of the parents. Overall, the youngest child is
identified as Mexican in 84 percent of these families, which raises the possibility of substantial
ethnic attrition among the children of Mexican Americans. The crucial determinant of a child’s
Mexican identification is whether both parents are Mexican-origin. In marriages between two
U.S.-born Mexicans or between a U.S.-born Mexican and a Mexican immigrant, Mexican
identification of the child is virtually assured (i.e., the relevant rates are 98 percent). In marriages
between a U.S.-born Mexican and a non-Mexican, however, the likelihood that the child is
identified as Mexican drops to 64-71 percent, with the precise figure depending on which parent
is non-Mexican, the father or the mother.15
Tables 11 and 12 show how measures of the human capital and labor market performance
of parents correlate with whether their youngest child is identified as Mexican. Table 11 presents
mean outcomes, by the Mexican identification of the child, and Table 12 reports regressionadjusted differences relative to the reference group consisting of parents whose youngest child is
not identified as Mexican. In these marriages involving at least one Mexican-American spouse,
parents with children not identified as Mexican average about a year more schooling and have
approximately a 10 percentage point lower rate of English deficiency than do their counterparts
with children designated as Mexican. Parents with children not identified as Mexican also
exhibit advantages in employment (2 percentage points for men and 3 percentage points for
women) and earnings (16 percent for men and 8 percent for women). Conditioning on
geographic location and the parent’s age reduces these outcome differences, but modestly
(compare the estimates in specifications (1) and (2) of Table 12).
15

In regressions not reported here, we find that the impact of intermarriage on the Mexican identification of children
does not change when controls are included for the age and gender of the child, the number of additional children in the family,
geographic location, and various characteristics of the parents (age, education, and English proficiency).

22
Specification (3) of Table 12 adds as regressors the dummy variables indicating the type
of marriage, and this change has a dramatic impact on the results, eliminating the outcome
disadvantages previously associated with the youngest child’s Mexican identification. To
understand what this means, recall from Table 10 that virtually all families with two Mexicanorigin parents identify their children as Mexican. Therefore, in specification (3), the dummy
variable for the youngest child’s Mexican identification essentially becomes an interaction term
between the child’s Mexican identification and a dummy variable identifying marriages
involving a non-Mexican spouse. Because the type of marriage dummies capture the main effect
of intermarriage (i.e., marriages involving a non-Mexican spouse), the estimated effect of the
child’s Mexican identification now represents outcome differences between intermarried parents
whose youngest child is identified as Mexican and intermarried parents whose youngest child is
not identified as Mexican. The generally small and statistically insignificant coefficients
estimated on the child’s Mexican identification dummy in specification (3) reveal that, within the
group of marriages involving a non-Mexican spouse, parents’ outcomes do not vary with the
Mexican identification of their children.16 In other words, intermarriage is the crucial link
between the ethnic identification of Mexican-American children and the human capital and labor
market performance of their parents. The strong correlation observed between parental skills and
whether the child is identified as Mexican arises because of the intense selectivity of MexicanAmerican intermarriage, especially in terms of human capital, and the powerful influence of
intermarriage on the ethnic identification of children.
Despite the apparent strength of intermarriage selectivity and its close link to the Mexican
identification of children, one could use our data to argue that these factors ultimately produce
16

Not surprisingly, this same conclusion emerges from comparing mean outcomes for the relevant groups.

23
little bias in observed outcomes for Mexican Americans. For example, Table 11 shows that, in
families with at least one Mexican-American parent, fathers average 1.1 years more schooling
(and mothers average 0.8 years more schooling) if their youngest child is not identified as
Mexican. This pattern reflects the educational selectivity of Mexican intermarriage, but the
impact of such selectivity is attenuated by the small overall incidence of non-Mexican affiliation
among children with at least one Mexican-American parent (i.e., from the bottom row of Table
10, just 16 percent of these children fail to identify as Mexican). As a result, in Table 11,
restoring to our samples the potentially “missing” families with children not identified as
Mexican only raises the average schooling of fathers from 12.1 to 12.3 years (and of mothers
from 12.3 to 12.4 years). Moreover, estimates of intergenerational correlations suggest that less
than half of any educational gains for parents get transmitted to their children (Couch and Dunn
1997; Mulligan 1997; Card, DiNardo, and Estes 2000). Therefore, our Census analyses can
directly substantiate only a tiny amount of “hidden” progress for these children of Mexican
Americans: less than 0.1 years of education, and similarly small amounts for the other outcomes.
We think it premature, however, to conclude that the measurement issues and potential
biases which motivated this paper can be safely ignored. In our Census samples, for us to know
that a child is of Mexican descent, at least one of his U.S.-born parents must continue to selfidentify as Mexican. We therefore miss completely any Mexican-origin families in which the
relevant Mexican descendants no longer identify as Mexican. Data from the 1970 Census
Content Reinterview Study, presented earlier in Table 2, indicate that we could be missing a
large share of later-generation Mexican-orign families (e.g., well over half of Mexican
descendants beyond the third generation). For this reason, we believe that our results show the
direction, but not the magnitude, of measurement biases arising from selective intermarriage and

24
ethnic identification by Mexican Americans. Estimating the magnitude of such biases would
require either microdata with more detailed information about ancestors’ national origins (such
as that collected in the now-extinct 1970 Census Content Reinterview Study), or a complicated
simulation model that starts with a cohort of Mexican immigrants and analyzes how selective
intermarriage interacts with the parent-child transmission of skills and ethnic identification to
produce the joint distributions of outcomes and Mexican identity across generations.17 The
Census and CPS results reported here could provide some of the inputs for a simulation model of
this type.

V. Generational Patterns
Our final set of analyses use recent CPS data to explore how patterns of intermarriage and
ethnic identification vary by generation for U.S.-born Mexicans. To the extent that Mexican
intermarriage and/or the selectivity of such intermarriage increases with generation, or that ethnic
attachment declines with generation, the potential becomes greater for existing data to give an
inaccurate representation of the intergenerational progress of Mexican Americans.
Beginning in 1980, the decennial Census stopped asking respondents where their parents
were born. Starting in 1994, the CPS began collecting this information on a regular basis from
all respondents. As a result, the CPS is currently the best large-scale U.S. data set for
investigating how outcomes vary by immigrant generation. Using the CPS information on the
nativity of each individual and his parents, we define three broad categories of immigrant
generation for Mexicans. The first generation consists of immigrants: foreign-born individuals
whose parents were also born outside of the United States. The second generation includes U.S.17

Brito (2004) provides an initial attempt at using simulation techniques to analyze this problem.

25
born individuals who have at least one foreign-born parent. The designation “third and higher
generation” applies to U.S. natives whose parents are also natives. For ease of exposition, we
will often refer to this last group as the “3rd+ generation” or simply the third generation.
Compared to the Census data analyzed earlier, the main advantage of the CPS is this ability to
distinguish between the second and higher generations of U.S.-born Mexicans. For our purposes,
important drawbacks of the CPS data are the smaller sample sizes and the absence of information
about English proficiency.
We analyze microdata from the March CPS files for the years 1996, 1998, 2000, and
2002.18 Our CPS samples and variables are created using the same procedures that we employed
with the 2000 Census data. In the CPS data, these procedures yield a sample of 4,407 marriages
for our intermarriage analyses.
Table 13 shows the nativity/ethnicity distributions of the spouses of the U.S.-born
Mexican husbands and wives in our CPS sample of marriages. This table is comparable to Table
6 presented earlier for the 2000 Census data, except that the current table distinguishes between
second- and third-generation Mexicans. Intermarriage by Mexican Americans rises between the
second and third generations, driven by increased marriage to U.S.-born, non-Hispanic whites.
Among Mexican-American husbands, the proportion married to non-Mexicans grows from 31
percent for the second generation to 34 percent for the third generation. Among MexicanAmerican wives, the corresponding increase is from 28 percent to 34 percent. The biggest
difference between generations, however, is in the composition of endogamous Mexican
marriages. For both husband and wives, the rate of marriage to third generation Mexicans

18
The CPS sample rotation scheme implies that about half of the households will be the same in any two March
surveys from adjacent years, so to obtain independent samples we skip odd-numbered years.

26
doubles between the second and the third generation, and simultaneously the rate of marriage to
Mexican immigrants is cut to a third of its initial level. All told, around half of secondgeneration Mexican husbands and wives have spouses who are first- or second-generation
Mexicans, whereas the same is true for only about a fifth of third-generation Mexicans. In this
sense, intergenerational assimilation in marriage occurs for Mexican Americans not just through
increased intermarriage with non-Mexicans, but also through sharply higher rates of marriage to
later-generation Mexicans.
For our CPS sample of marriages, Table 14 applies the typology introduced previously in
Table 7. In Table 14, the column labeled “2nd Generation” shows the distribution by type for all
sample marriages that involve a second-generation Mexican, and the “3rd+ Generation” column
reports the same distribution for all marriages that involve a third-generation Mexican.
Consequently, there exists some overlap between the two columns, because marriages between a
second-generation Mexican and a third-generation Mexican will be counted in the first row of
both columns. Between the second and third generations, Table 14 shows that MexicanAmerican marriages undergo a marked increase in the involvement of non-Mexicans and a large
decline in the involvement of Mexican immigrants. Given our earlier finding that marriages to
non-Mexicans are particularly susceptible to ethnic leakage (see Table 10), the increased
prevalence of intermarriage across generations raises the potential for intergenerational attrition
of Mexicans in standard data sources.
For the CPS data, Table 15 replicates the Census analysis presented earlier in Table 8. In
terms of the outcome variables available in the CPS—education, employment, and hourly
earnings—the patterns of intermarriage selectivity are similar to those found in the Census data.
Moreover, the CPS data show these patterns to be similar for second- and third-generation

27
Mexicans. Although the extent of intermarriage selectivity for Mexicans does not appear to
increase between the second and later generations, neither does it appear to diminish. Given this
stability in intermarriage selectivity, the rising rate of Mexican intermarriage across generations
could by itself produce biased intergenerational comparisons for this population.
Finally, Table 16 reproduces with CPS data the analysis from Table 10 of how the
youngest child’s Mexican identification varies with intermarriage. Once again, we find that a
child is almost certain to be identified as Mexican when both his parents are Mexican-origin.
Moreover, this pattern does not weaken across generations. Overall, the rate at which the
youngest child is identified as Mexican in the CPS data falls from 82 percent for marriages
involving a second-generation Mexican to 73 percent for marriages involving a higher-generation
Mexican. This decline arises primarily from the changing composition of marriage types across
generations; in particular, the increased prevalence in later generations of intermarriage between
Mexican-Americans and non-Mexicans.

VI. Conclusion
In this paper, we look for evidence on whether selective intermarriage and selective
ethnic identification might bias observed measures of socioeconomic progress for later
generations of Mexican Americans. Ideal data for this purpose would allow us to identify which
individuals are descended from Mexican immigrants and how many generations have elapsed
since that immigration took place. We could then simply compare outcomes for this “true”
population of Mexican descendants with the corresponding outcomes for the subset of Mexican
descendants who continue to self-identify as Mexican-origin. Unfortunately, we do not have
access to microdata of this sort, so we instead adopt much less direct strategies for tyring to shed

28
light on this issue.
We begin by examining 1980 Census data that provide an indicator for Spanish surnames
in addition to the information about Hispanic origin typically used to identify Mexican ethnics.
Our hope is that, particularly for men, the presence of a Spanish surname in the five southwestern
states provides an objective, albeit imperfect, indicator of Mexican ancestry that allows us to
identify some individuals of Mexican descent who fail to self-report as Hispanic and who are
therefore missed by subjective indicators such as the Hispanic origin question in the Census. If
so, then differences in human capital and labor market outcomes between Spanish-surnamed
individuals who do and do not self-identify as Hispanic might reveal something about the
selective nature of ethnic identification for Mexican Americans. We find that U.S.-born men
identified as Hispanic by surname only have more human capital and better labor market
outcomes than U.S.-born men identified as Hispanic by both self-report and surname. The same
pattern holds for women, though in this case interpretation is clouded by the common practice of
married women taking the surname of their husbands. Overall, the results are consistent with the
notion that individuals of Mexican descent who no longer self-identify as Hispanic are positively
selected in terms of socioeconomic status. Relatively few individuals with Spanish surnames fail
to self-identify as Hispanic, however, so it would be unwise to regard these results as anything
more than suggestive.
Using data from the 2000 Census and recent March Current Population Surveys, we then
investigate the extent and selectivity of Mexican intermarriage and how such intermarriage
influences the Mexican identification of children. We show that U.S.-born Mexican Americans
who marry non-Mexicans are substantially more educated and English proficient, on average,
than are Mexican Americans who marry co-ethnics (whether they be Mexican Americans or

29
Mexican immigrants). In addition, the non-Mexican spouses of intermarried Mexican Americans
possess relatively high levels of schooling and English proficiency, compared to the spouses of
endogamously married Mexican Americans. The human capital selectivity of Mexican
intermarriage generates corresponding differences in the employment and earnings of Mexican
Americans and their spouses. Moreover, the children of intermarried Mexican Americans are
much less likely to be identified as Mexican than are the children of endogamous Mexican
marriages. These forces combine to produce strong negative correlations between the education,
English proficiency, employment, and earnings of Mexican-American parents and the chances
that their children retain a Mexican ethnicity.
Despite the apparent strength of intermarriage selectivity and its close link to the Mexican
identification of children, our analyses cannot directly substantiate significant biases in
measuring the intergenerational progress of Mexican Americans. The data used here are
inadequate, however, because they overlook families descended from Mexican immigrants in
which neither parent self-identifies as Mexican. Indeed, data from the 1970 Census Content
Reinterview Study indicate that we could be missing a large share of later-generation Mexicanorign families (e.g., well over half of Mexican descendants beyond the third generation). For this
reason, we believe that our results show the direction, but not the magnitude, of measurement
biases arising from selective intermarriage and ethnic identification by Mexican Americans.
Estimating the magnitude of such biases would require either microdata with more detailed
information about ancestors’ national origins (such as that collected in the now-extinct 1970
Census Content Reinterview Study), or a complicated simulation model that starts with a cohort
of Mexican immigrants and analyzes how selective intermarriage interacts with the parent-child
transmission of skills and ethnic identification to produce the joint distributions of outcomes and

30
Mexican identity across generations. The empirical results reported here could provide some of
the inputs for a simulation model of this type.

Note: Standard errors are shown in parentheses. Sampling weights were employed in these calculations. The
samples include men ages 25-59. The samples for the hourly earnings data are further limited to individuals who
worked during the calendar year preceding the survey. The “white” ethnic group is defined to exclude Hispanics, as
well as blacks, Asians, and Native Americans. The first generation consists of immigrants: foreign-born individuals
whose parents were also born outside the United States. The second generation denotes U.S.-born individuals who
have at least one foreign-born parent. The third generation identifies U.S. natives whose parents are also natives.
Excluded from the samples are foreign-born individuals who have at least one U.S.-born parent, as well as
individuals for whom generation cannot be determined because birthplace data are missing for themselves or either
parent.

Note: The reported figures are estimated coefficients from ordinary least squares regressions run separately for husbands and wives. Standard errors are shown
in parentheses. The samples include husbands and wives in marriages that meet the following conditions: both spouses are between the ages of 25-59, the couple
currently lives together, and at least one spouse is a U.S.-born individual identified as Mexican by the Census question regarding Hispanic origin. The samples
for the hourly earnings regressions are further limited to individuals who were employed at some time during the calendar year preceding the Census. The sample
sizes are 62,734 husbands and 62,734 wives for the full samples, and 58,003 husbands and 45,857 wives for the employed samples. For the dummy variables
indicating the type of marriage, the reference group consists of endogamous marriages in which both spouses are U.S.-born Mexicans. The controls for
geographic location are dummy variables identifying the nine Census divisions, the individual states of California and Texas, and whether the individual resides in
a metropolitan area. The controls for age are dummy variables identifying five-year age intervals.

Note: The reported figures are estimated coefficients from ordinary least squares regressions run separately for fathers and mothers. Standard errors are shown in
parentheses. The samples include fathers and mothers in marriages that meet the following conditions: both spouses are between the ages of 25-59, the couple
currently lives together, at least one spouse is a U.S.-born individual identified as Mexican by the Census question regarding Hispanic origin, and the marriage
has produced at least one child under age 19 that resides in the household. The samples for the hourly earnings data are further limited to individuals who were
employed at some time during the calendar year preceding the Census. The sample sizes are 37,921 fathers and 37,921 mothers for the full samples, and 35,496
fathers and 27,227 mothers for the employed samples. The dummy variable “youngest child Mexican” indicates parents whose youngest child is identified as
Mexican by the Census question regarding Hispanic origin; the reference group consists of parents whose youngest child is not identified as Mexican. The
controls for geographic location are dummy variables identifying the nine Census divisions, the individual states of California and Texas, and whether the family
resides in a metropolitan area. The controls for age of the parent are dummy variables identifying five-year age intervals.
