ABSTRACT
This paper shows evidence of positive effects in the economic development of sending communities
in Mexico due to migration. The principal hypothesis of this study is that remittances, knowledge
and experience acquired by migrants during their migratory cycle, can be translated into larger
economic growth in the out migration municipalities. This result presupposes that Government could
create complementary incentives to take advantage of profitable activities. Economic and migration
data for each municipality is used which allows to associate characteristics of communities,
migratory flows and the effects in profitable activities. There are three sections. A first section
describes the sending municipalities according to migratory intensity and their urban /rural nature.
The second section analyzes the relation between remittances and socioeconomic conditions of the
communities. In a third section the effect over time is estimated, relating per capita income growth
and migratory flows intensity. The most relevant results are the existence of income convergence
over time between high and low migration municipalities in the North and South of Mexico. As well,
we find a positive and significant relation between per capita income growth and the percentage of
households that receive remittances across communities, both at the country level and for the
northern and southern regions separately.

Introduction
The debate on how migration experiences may effect the development of sending
communities is still heated and far from being settled. One may find two basic extremes in
the argument, one in favour of the positive contributions to development in the regions of
origin as in the subscribers of the new economics of labour migration –NELM (for instance
Durand 1996 and Taylor 1999); the other side insisting on a full and permanent dependency
relation expressed in migration remittances used merely for basic consumption purposes,
the classical ´self-perpetuating´ argument in most of the earlier literature (for instance
Cornelius 1990 and Díaz-Briquets 1991).
The real world may rather stay somewhere in between these two extremes, so it is still
important to refine the analysis. We may distinguish different situations at one point in time
and also in their evolution over time. This is the main task here, focusing in the relation
between migration and the development of sending regions in Mexico during the recent
decade, while reviewing other relevant experiences in other parts of the world2.
Many of the development benefits anticipated for Mexican migration were probably
overestimated. Given the substantial backwardness observed in most of the out – migration
areas from Mexico during the XX century, remittances acted primarily as a subsidy to the
basic needs of the very poor. Lately, however, the spread of Mexican sending communities
obscures that picture because now migration includes urban areas and new states virtually
from all parts of the country, including states others than the traditional ones in the central
western part of Mexico (Jalisco, Michoacan, Zacatecas, Guanajuato and the like). In
support of the positive argument, however, the opening up of the economy under
globalizing trends as with Nafta, may bring with migration new and wider benefits of

For an introduction to the debate, centered on remittances effects, see Taylor 1999, p.63-86. Earlier,
Appleyard (1992) expressed “... Although remittances are frequently cited as one contribution, .. their value or
role in the development process is by no means concurred by scholars... Scholars remain divided in their
judgments concerning the effect of the use of remittances in the development process” (p.261). And also
Martin in a more challenging vein (1990, p.657): “.. if remittances are to be the external pump which primes
an area for economic take-off, they need to be coordinated to provide the infrastructure necessary for
development or sending governments must find additional funds to invest in infrastructure”.

integration and modernization, even if they remain controversial as experienced through
both the Asencio study of the eighties and the Binational Study of the late nineties3.
Timing has always been important to the success of proposals with a policy orientation.
Sydney Weintraub made the argument some years ago with respect to migration initiatives
in the United States changing in accordance to the political and economic context of the
country and its international concerns (1990, p.1166-7). For instance, at the beginning of
the new millenium there was open optimism in favour of larger migration needs for the US
economy to continue growing (Greenspan, among other influential opinions), though the
events of 2001 changed the agenda back to the stand-still observed today.
Our task here is to estimate the impacts of migration for the communities of origin,
showing the positive effects of remittances in those communities. The comparison is for
communities in different regions and with different characteristics, according to migration
intensity, their urban – rural nature, their economic orientation (manufacturing, services or
agriculture activities), and size in population. Of major significance will also be to account
for the evolution of impacts over time. The expectation is to capture the relation of
remittances (proportion of households receiving them as estimated in the Conapo index) as
an indication of both current and past migration activity, to economic improvement in the
point of origin4. The impacts anticipated include gains in productivity, wages and earnings,
through some investment efforts that may be associated to remittances from migration in
the various regions of Mexico.
3

Development goals have always been a prime in these initiatives. These were already well stressed in the
mandate to the Asencio Commission: “... (among) the key issues the Commission was asked to address: ... b)
economic development initiatives that could be undertaken cooperatively to alleviate pressures for emigration
in the sending countries” (Weintraub and Díaz-Briquets, 1990, p.i).
4
The index of Conapo (2002) is a very ambitious estimate of migration intensity based in the 2000 Population
Survey’s sample. It includes four components aiming to capture both current and past migratory activity, as
follows:
• 1st) Percentage of households that receive remittances, defined as households in which at least one of its
members reported receiving monetary transfers from abroad.
• 2nd) Percentage of households with migrants in the US in the last five years, defined as households in
which at least one member changed its residency to the US.
• 3rd) Percentage of households with circular migrants in the last five years, defined as households in
which at least one member migrated in the last five years, but came back.
• 4th) Percentage of households with returning migrants, defined as households in which at least one
member used to live in the US, but came back.

Anticipating the most important results we find a general trend towards income
convergence at the level of municipalities5, for which migration acts positively over the
product per capita indicator. The result, however, is better in some regions in the North and
South of Mexico, but not in the Central region which encompasses many varying
development situations. In respect of promoting convergence, a previous review (Unger
and Verduzco 2000) has highlighted other international experiences and actions to
maximize benefits from migration. These complementary actions may have to do with
maximizing remittances, stimulate their productive use, design labour market initiatives to
the best use of skills at both sides of the migrant experience, plus an adequate management
of the migration exchanges. If successfully implemented, migration could then be foreseen
as a temporary event, much in line with proposals advanced elsewhere (Athukorala 1993;
Russell 1992 and Taylor 1999).
There are three sections besides this introduction. A first section describes the sending
regions in numbers, migration intensity and the urban / rural nature of the municipalities.
The second section introduces regression analysis of migration with respect to
socioeconomic characteristics such as size of the municipality, wages, productivity of
industries in the municipality, and production per capita. In a third section the effect of
migration over time is estimated, relating migration experience with regional incomes
convergence. Finally, some brief conclusions emphasize the role of policy to improve the
local benefits of migration.
I. The Sending Out – Migration Regions: a description
Migration between Mexico and the US has been important for many years given its large
effects on social, economic and political matters at both sides. From the Mexican
perspective, the integration of the North American economic region during most of the
eighties and nineties, and certainly highlighted in the subscription of NAFTA, enhanced the
Our exercise is based only on remittances, which are more closely related to the economic estimates intended.
The positive trend towards convergence has also been reported at the level of Mexican states, as in
Rodríguez-Posé and Sanchez Reaza 2002, but a few others found the contrary as shown in the third section.

expectations for increased and wider economic progress related to such integration in many
aspects, including migration exchanges.
Until the early nineties, out migration was mostly restrained to certain areas in México. The
traditional sending states, undisputed for most if not all observers, were concentrated in the
Central West region of the country including Jalisco, Michoacan, Zacatecas, Guanajuato,
San Luis, Durango and Oaxaca. The Mexican Census of 1990 confirmed these states
accounting for most of the Municipalities with high migration participation (Unger and
Verduzco 1998, p.5). However, during the nineties the migration spread reached to virtually
all of México, moving beyond its rural origin and giving raise to many urban areas as newcomers to the migration experience, even if predominantly at a lower – partial scale6. The
2000 Population Survey’s sample, used in the construction of the migratory intensity index,
identifies also some major causes and effects of international migration7.
The migratory intensity index of Conapo (2002) was constructed ambitiously aiming to
capture both current and past migratory activity. It includes both economic and
demographic issues related to migration. In this paper we retain only the estimate of
households receiving remittances as an explanatory variable, which is expected to show
closer ties to economic effects.
Our results are shown more significant and straight if the municipalities are grouped into
two major sets according to migration (remittances) activity: high and low proportion of
households receiving remittances. These two groups are obtained through cluster analysis,
which defines 11.2% of households as a threshold separating the high and low migration
municipalities. Their distribution according to the level of migration is still quite skewed
towards lower migration participation: 79.2% at low levels of migration (1934
municipalities, including about a hundred with no migration involvement at all, mostly in
6

The 2000 Population Survey’s sample used for the construction of the migratory index, helps to identify
international migration patterns throughout all the 2443 Mexican municipalities.
7
The 2000 Population Survey’s information was compiled using two questionnaires: a basic one and an
extended one. The second one was applied to a household probabilistic sample while the first one was applied
to the rest of the households. The extended questionnaire includes the same topics as the basic one, but adds
some information, including a section on international migration.

the southern states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, Yucatan, Veracruz and Puebla); but there are also
20.8% at high levels of migration intensity (509 municipalities) (Table 1).
Most relevant now is the very high importance of urban communities, a total 58.6% of
municipalities engaged in migration (1432 out of 2443). The other 1011 municipalities are
considered rural by the importance of agricultural activities; all municipalities of this kind
are small with less than 150,000 population8. The urban representation is also much larger
in the high migration group: 67.2% of the group (Table 1).
The description of municipalities at the state level is also quite relevant for policy purposes,
even if federal involvement is always required for migration policy9. There is a common
cause now for all states since the 32 Mexican states are now engaged, at some level, in
international migration (Table 2). Most important are still the traditional migration states of
the past, but there are some noted additions as we show below.
In Table 2 the remittances index ranks very high for five states: Zacatecas, Michoacan,
Durango, Nayarit and Guanajuato; others follow closely, such as San Luis, Guerrero,
Jalisco, Colima y Aguascalientes, all of them in the Central Western regions of the country.
With the exception of Colima and Guerrero where the intense migration experience is
concentrated in less than one third of the municipalities, for the other states the event is
more disseminated usually into more than 60% of the municipalities (Table 3). The ranking
in number of high migration municipalities for each state shows Oaxaca (92
municipalities), Jalisco (80 municipalities), Michoacan (68), Puebla (45), Zacatecas (35),
Durango (28), San Luis Potosi (26), Guerrero (25) and Guanajuato (24) at the top. In other
words, the important traditional migrating states rank high in all accounts, while others like
Oaxaca, Puebla and San Luis Potosi show well in the number of high migration
municipalities but these still are not a majority in the state.
8
Rural municipalities are those where half or more of the working population (EAP) is in agriculture. Several
alternative definitions of rural communities are available for research; many of them consider as rural the
small population areas. In this case we use the employment intensity in agricultural activities, which also
leads to smaller population municipalities. This measure of rural nature allows to relate them to their
productive activities, important in the study of economic development impacts.

6

II. Characterizing economic variables effecting migration
This section aims to identify the key socio-economic variables that may have an impact on
out migration. Among these, we anticipate the influence of size of the towns and cities, as
well as local employment conditions, namely wages, productivity and local competitiveness
in general.
It is common sense to assume that migration occurs from places where individuals estimate
to reap larger benefits moving across the border than staying at home. Undoubtedly, many
of the municipalities that exhibit higher migration are those with a larger gap in economic
development, living conditions, and infrastructure with respect to other better developed
localities. In this respect, working opportunities, salaries, and general economic conditions
are perceived better abroad before migrating .
To establish the relation between migratory intensity and economic indicators, however, it
is important to characterize the high migration conditions. Our basic equation relates the
Conapo index which measures the proportion of households with remittances as a
dependent variable while population (size), per capita income, labour productivity and
wages per worker are used as explanatory variables. In order to obtain finer and more
specific results, the municipalities are analyzed according to their economic nature into
urban and rural municipalities.
The results are shown in Table 4. First of all, when the municipalities engaged in migration
are taken as a whole there are significant results in the direction anticipated, that is, a
negative relation of population (size) to migration and a negative relation of per capita
income to migration. There is also a negative effect of urban wages on migration. The latter
effect of wages remains significant only for the urban municipalities. Nonetheless, for both
the urban and rural groups the results can be interpreted in that more migration tends to

In Unger and Verduzco (2000) was shown that state and federal public expenditures in Mexico have not
been related to migration activity. In fact, migration states seem to be discriminated against (p.216).

7

occur from small municipalities where it is difficult to find a steady job in the modern and
most productive activities, and younger workers migrate given that local options of higher
wages are not at hand. In the rural side, the only significant effect is the negative relation of
size of towns to migration. Later on, however, some other more specific effects will be
shown of significance for the poorer rural areas in the South, including the positive result of
per capita income to migration, as an indication of the importance to finance the costs of
migrating (what others have termed, “overcoming the poverty trap line”).
The urban group coefficients in Table 4 are significant for size and wages, both negatively
as expected. In this case population keeps the negative relation with migratory intensity,
probably due to the same employment constraints in small cities explained above. The
negative coefficients for both variables in urban communities indicate a clear expulsion
effect due to the gap in the economic conditions related to size and lower wages in those
high migration cities. In other words, migration occurs from the poorest and smaller urban
municipalities where high productivity activities will hardly exist and individuals prefer to
migrate to the US to obtain a higher salary per hour than staying home, probably doing
similar activities but more badly paid at home.
In rural municipalities the inverse relation between migratory intensity and size in
population is maintained, as expected and noted earlier. There are not other effects on
migration for the group as a whole. However, according to the literature10, migration
requires a minimum amount of wealth to occur and individuals who live in the poorest rural
municipalities may not have the opportunity to finance their migration movement. This
seems to be the case of rural municipalities in the Southern region, as we show below. For
other rural sites, other typically urban variables such as labour productivity and wages per
worker are not significant, probably because there are no real differences in the economics
of these sites. For rural municipalities, other variables closer to their agricultural conditions
ought to be used, but the lack of relevant statistics on agriculture is a well documented
obstacle in studies of the Mexican rural sector.
10

It has been shown that rural municipalities have in general worst economic conditions than urban cities
(Unger and Verduzco 1998). It is in these rural areas where one may find clearer evidence about the poverty
trap argument.

8

Breaking the analysis into the three regions in Table 5 reveals substantial regional
differences. The Central region shows significant results much in accordance with trends
for the country, and also for the urban and rural groups separately. In other words, small
communities in the Center with less per capita income are more migration intensive, and
for urban municipalities the negative effect of wages is also significant. Migration from
Northern municipalities, on the other hand, does not show any relation to the size and
income variables found significant for the country as a whole. In this region the only
significant effect is for urban wages, negatively related to migration as expected. And for
the Southern region, perhaps the most interesting result beyond the common negative
relation of urban wages to urban migration, is the positive effect of income on migration
from the rural municipalities. The latter may be taken as evidence of financial conditions to
jump the poverty trap impeding migration from the very poor communities.

III. Migration over time: Regional Convergence
A most relevant exercise when studying international migration is to look at the dynamics
of economic performance among migration communities, in order to anticipate the
conditions that may define migration as a temporary event11. One way to analyze this is to
determine if there exists a trend to convergence in per capita income among rich and poor
communities engaged in migration. It is expected that economic performance will be
different but converging in favour of the lower income / high migrating municipalities.
In the economic literature convergence is addressed in many different ways. In the Mexican
context, convergence analysis has been widely used with mixed results. Over the last
decade, most studies observed income convergence at the level of Mexican states (see for
instance, Sanchez Reaza and Rodríguez-Posé 2002; Cermeño 1999; Esquivel 1999 y
Navarrete 1997). A few others obtain different results. Aguayo finds divergence at the level
11

This is economic performance at the point of origin of migration in Mexico. A complementary analysis
may be conducted at the US side, considering the effects of both the savings due to Mexican migration and
the preference / aversion to consumption in the US. See for instance Cuecuecha 2004.

9

of Mexican states after 1985 (Aguayo 2004); while Cermeño et.al. (2004) argue at the most
trends of stratified growth and conditional convergence at the level of Municipios
(Cermeño, Martinez and Mayer, 2004). Many of their differences arise from the data and
the level of aggregation applied in each exercise, and to try to reconcile them would require
a study by itself12. Our results, for the most part, will show convergence in relating initial
levels of income to income growth rates, both referred to per capita GDP. This information,
as we have seen in previous sections, is available for each municipality and for a reasonably
extended period during recent years. But most important for us and specific to our purpose
will be to relate the trend to convergence with local migration characteristics.
In this study, we utilize the β-convergence regression analysis, in its most standard version.
The measure of convergence is based on a log-linear version of the Ramsey model
according to Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), of the form:

pcGDPit
1
× ln
= α + β ln( pcGDPi 0 ) + u i 0,t ,
T
pcGDPi 0
where T is the number of years within the period; pcGDPi0 is the initial per capita income
of the i-th municipality; pcGDPit is the per capita income of the i-th municipality at the end
of the period. For convergence to exist, there must be an inverse relation between the
income variables, that is, the

coefficient must be negative. The economic implication is

that municipalities with lower initial levels of per capita income exhibit higher growth rates
than richer ones, eventually narrowing the income gap and reducing the pressure on
economically based migration.
To test for the convergence of Mexican municipalities, the economic Census data for the
extended period from 1988 to 1998 is considered. Census data for each municipality are
collected every five years for the activities of manufacture, commerce and services (figures
for agriculture are not available). These years include the possible effects of migration due
12

A very concise comparison shows major differences in the sources of data. Most of them use Economic
Census data or annual GDP estimates of INEGI. The exceptions are Aguayo who relied on Household data

10

to NAFTA and its related global trends during the latter part of the decade. In search of a
finer and complementary analysis, once again the country is grouped according to three
variables: the three geographical regions (see Map A), the economic nature of the
municipalities (urban / rural) and their level or intensity of migration.
The basic and stronger convergence result is for all the municipalities during 1988 – 1998,
indicating the existence of income convergence; the

coefficient is negative and significant

for all the breakings in Table 6. There convergence shows regardless the region, the
economic status and the migration intensity of the Municipalities13. This means that low
income communities have higher growth rates than richer ones within each of the groups
(each row in Table 6). The same holds when comparing the two five years periods
separately, but it may be statistically safer to restrict the analysis to the full decade.
The results associating migration intensity (remittances) to income growth are more
revealing. Regression results in Table 7 show a positive relationship of these two variables
at very high significance for all the Municipalities in the country and also for the regions in
the North and South separately. The relation for Municipalities in the Center is uncertain,
though the income differences may explain a more intense migration activity from certain
areas, as we show below.
The same results apply when comparing income growth for two groups of Municipalities:
high migration Municipalities in the Northern and Southern regions show better income
dynamics (larger growth rates in Table 8 and Figs. 2-4), though the income levels are still
much in favour of the low migration places in the North and Center14. The Central region
has a more obscure pattern due to both, the larger number of municipalities (1199) and also
a more heterogeneous composition due to many of them in the newer group of high
from a sample in the Population Census, and Cermeño et.al. who use the same Municipio sources that we use.
We also find convergence at the state level aggregating the same Municipios data, but on condition of
excluding Municipalities (and consequently cities) larger than 200,000 inhabitants. These are the 87 larger
Municipalities which tend to be richer and of lower propensity to migrate internationally (in fact being
attractive to domestic migration), while they dominate the figures of their own state. If included, the estimate
for convergence remains (coefficient negative) but is not significant.
14
The Southern region, both high and low migration localities, shows much lower income levels in average
than other regions (see columns 2 and 5 in Table 9).
13

11

migration and urban municipalities (252). For this Central region income growth is the
same regardless migration intensity (Fig.3), though the expulsion force to migrate remains
in the income differences: three times lower in the high migration sites (Table 8).
A conclusion from this exercise is that there is convergence in per capita income of the
Mexican municipalities regardless of their nature and their migratory propensity, though
there is also a positive relationship of income growth and migration activity for all the
Municipalities in the country and also for the regions in the North and South separately.
Nevertheless, the results on convergence have to take into account substantial differences in
the income levels of the different groups of municipalities compared.

Conclusions

We have described migratory activity from Mexican communities, associating its intensity
to local economic development. In order to characterize the nature and effect of migration
some economic features of municipalities were considered, mainly to relate migratory
intensity and their urban – rural nature.
Three main characteristics on migration are highlighted. First, about 96% of the
municipalities present migratory activity, and 509 of them at a high migratory intensity.
This implies that migration has become a generalized phenomenon to practically all the
Mexican states. Second, the number of urban communities engaged in migration is larger
than the rural group. The urban origin is becoming more important in the high migration
group (nearly 70%). Thirdly, migration originating from the traditional states of migration
in the past, those in the Central Western region (Zacatecas, Michoacan, Guanajuato,
Durango, Aguascalientes, Jalisco and San Luis Potosi), remains very high. Given these new
features of migratory activity, policy at the state level is now probably more relevant than
in the past, even if the federal involvement is still required for macro migration policy.

12

Then we estimated a differentiated impact of out migration in relation to the size, wealth,
wages and productivity figures of each municipality. Regression analysis showed a
negative and significant effect of size for all the municipalities, and also when urban and
rural municipalities are treated separately. Urban municipalities show a negative relation
between wages and migratory intensity, indicating that migration occurs from small
communities where economic conditions are worst. Differing from urban, rural
municipalities in the Southern region have a positive relation between income and
migratory intensity, suggesting the ruling of a “poverty trap” where there is not the
minimum wealth for migration to occur. Other indicators are only significant for urban
communities, indicating that migration takes place from the poorest municipalities with
lower wages and individuals prefer to migrate in order to obtain higher salaries than staying
at home.
Finally we approached the dynamics of economic performance among communities. The
presence of convergence in per capita income among rich and poor communities over time
is one important conclusion. The high migration group have a higher convergence rate than
the low migration municipalities. The results of migration intensity (remittances) for the
high migration municipalities in the North and South show better income dynamics than for
lower migration sites, though the income levels are still much in favour of the low
migration places. The Central region shows a less clear pattern in the relation of income
and migration, which probably would need to separate the region into subregions of closer
similarities. On the whole however, the main results are suggesting the contribution of
migration to the catching up of poorer communities.
