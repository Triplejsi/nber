Wage Contracts with Incomplete
and Costly Information

Abstract

Optimal wage indexation, as derived by Gray, was subject to criticism due
to a lack of efficient use of information; failure to clear the market which

resulted in non—optimal contracts; and the lack of an explicit use of welfare

criteria. The purpose of this paper is to derive a wage contract scheme that
is free from the above criticism, but is capable of preserving the insight of

Crayts analysis. In so doing the analysis reveals the role of costs of
information collection in a world characterized by incomplete information.

The analysis focuses also on the interaction between wage indexation and
costly information collection as alternative adjustment schemes.

It is shown

that the first depends only on relative variances, whereas the second also

depends on aggregate volatility. The justification for labor contracts hinges
on the cost of information collection and last minute wage negotiation.

I. Introduction
It is well appreciated that an understanding of the structure of labor
contracts is a precondition for understanding adjustment to various macro—

policies. A labor contract that sets the money wage for a given period
introduces a short—run nominal wage rigidity. This rigidity implies that
price level changes affect real wage, inducing real effects in the short

run.1 In order to mitigate these effects, the contract might specify a
partial degree of wage indexation, and possibly also the conditions under

which wage re—negotiation would occur. The literature on wage contract
schemes has benefited from contributions by Gray (1976, 1978), Fischer (1977),

and others. However, their work has been subject to criticism due to a lack
of efficient use of information; failure to clear the labor market which
resulted in non—optimal contracts; and the lack of an explicit use of welfare
criteria.

As Barro (1977) and Karni (1983) have pointed out, these models were

presented in the context of complete current information. They failed to use
all available information, and as a result were challenged by the literature

on ratIonal expectations. Once a contract scheme uses all avaIlable Information it will, as Barro (1977) and Karnl

(1983)

have indicated, dominate Gray's

scheme. These models also assumed that employment is demand determined, and,

as Cukierman (1980) has pointed Out, this assumption is arbitrary. Gray's
analysis derives optimal indexation from a loss function given by the output

volatility around its full information level.2 This is a useful shortcut, but
it is open to criticism due to the lack of explicit welfare justification.
The purpose of the current paper is to derive a wage contract scheme that
does not incur the above criticism, but is still capable of preserving the

insight of Gray's analysis. In deriving the scheme, the paper reveals the

—1—

role of incomplete and costly information.3 The framework for this analysis

is a monetary economy subject to random shocks. Observed prices provide only
partial information regarding the nature of those shocks. The current in-

formation set can be improved by costly data gathering. Suppose that at the
end of period t—1, a labor contract specifies the wage applied for period t.
It specifies also the degree of wage indexation, which will update the
contract wage according to the information provided by the price signal at

period t. Because the price signal provides incomplete information, we might
benefit by allowing wage re—negotiation under certain conditions.

The re-

negotiation will allow us to rewrite the contract for period t using improved

information. Such information was nota known in the previous period (t—l),
and can be obtained only by costly information collection (surveys, etc.).
The problem analyzed in this paper is to decide ex—ante (at the end of period
t—1) what weight the contract will allocate for each option.

Such a decision

should involve cost—benefit considerations. The presumption is that the
administrative cost of wage indexation is small relative to the cost of
current information collection and wage re—negotiation.

The paper applies

expected welfare criteria to designing the desired contract scheme. The
analysis does not address the role of risk sharing and information asymmetry

in deriving the contract scheme. These factors have been investigated by
Azariadis (1975), Baily (1977), Townsend (1982) and others. The current paper
does not negate the importance of these factors, rather demonstrates that
information collection and negotiation costs suffice to derive wage contracts
in a welfare maximization setup.

Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 derives the desired degree of
wage indexation and wage re—negotiation.

Section

summarizes the findings.

The Appendix provides the notation used in the paper.

Throughout the paper it is assumed that the information set at time

t(I) consists of the structure of the model, all variables dated t—1 and
earlier, and the current price level.

To simplify notation, let us neglect trends in all the variables, assum-

ing that m and v are uncorrelated random variables, generated by white noise
processes:

x N(O, 2) for x

m,v.

As a reference point, we start with the 'non—stochastic equilibrium,"
i.e. ,

the

equilibrium in the economy if the value of all the random shocks is

zero (v =

m

0). Let us denote by a lowercase variable the percentage

deviation of the uppercase variable from its value in the non—stochastic

equilibrium. For example, for a variable X, x

=

(X

—

X0)/X0 where

is

the value of x if all the shocks are zero. To facilitate discussion, it is
useful to take a log—linear approximation of the model around its non
stochastic equilibrium, writing the model in terms

of

percentage deviations.

This is equivalent to the use of a first order approximation of a Taylor

is

expansion around the equilibrium.4 From eq. 2 we get that output at time t
given by

a flexible, full information economy we get that a competitive labor

we get that

(8)

Employment and real wage depend positively on the productivity shock, and

are free from monetary considerations in a flexible, full information

equilibrium. The case of such an economy is used as a yardstick for the
analysis of a contracting economy. Under the labor contract, the wage for
period t is pre—set at the end of the previous period. The contract wage is
set at its expected money level in a flexible regime, given here by

E(WIIi). 1t1 stands for the information set at the end of t—1, which is
assumed to reflect known shocks (v_1, me_i). The contract we consider
contains two provisions that allow limited wage flexibility. First, it allows

partial indexation, at a rate of b, 0 < b < 1. Thus:

log W log E(WII_i) + b[P —

(9)

or

in a shorter notation

(9')

wb 'Pt

where we denote by x' the value of x if the wage contract binds (x

w,p,

etc.). The case b1 corresponds to a full indexation (real wage rigidity).

The case of bO

corresponds

to zero indexation (nominal wage rigidity). In

general, we expect 0 < b < 1, providing limited wage flexibility in the
contract scheme.

—5—

Second, the contract specifies conditions under which re—negotiation will

occur. The purpose of re—negotiation is to update the contract according to
information that was unknown when the contract was set and is not reflected in

the current price level. A re—negotiation is costly.

First, there might be

direct negotiation costs associated with last minute wage revisions, denoted

by C. Next, there might be the real cost of collecting the information
needed for the re—negotiation, denoted by C.

To idel this case, suppose

that the current information set at t(I) includes only the price level, the
past shocks and the structure of the model. At a real cost (Ci), the current
information set can be improved to include the value of contemporaneous shocks
(nit,

vt).
—

Let us denote the improved information set by

{'' v}). If a decision is made to re—negotiate, it will imply

that resources are to be devoted to improving the information set, and the renegotiated wage will be based upon that set

In

the case where the labor market does not clear, employment is assumed

to be demand determined. As Cukierman (1980) has shown, this assumption is
arbitrary. The current paper demonstrates that under an optimal wage scheme
the labor market clears. Thus this assumption is not restrictive, in the
sense that alternative rules proposed by Cukierman would yield the same
optimal wage contract scheme, resulting in clearing the labor market. Let us
denote by x' the value of x if the wage contract binds, and x the value if
there is re—negotiation .

To complete the description of the labor contract, we should specify the

conditions under which re—negotiation is agreed to occur. A possible measure
describing the pressure towards re-negotiation is the perceIved real shock.

specifies two channels of adjustment: the degree of wage indexation (b) and
re—negotiation (k). The next section derives the optimal values of each.

3.

The Optimal Contract Scheme

In order to derive the desired contract scheme, let us find the welfare
deviation from the reference case of a full information flexible economy under

a given contract. We denote this measure by WL. Because welfare in the case
of a full information, flexible economy is independent of the contract scheme,
we can derive optimal (k,b) by minimizing expected WL.

Under full information, the production of the contract output introduces
a welfare loss given by the triangle between the supply and demand of labor.
This loss can be approximated by

This equation can be broken down into three components. The first term
represents the loss in expected welfare due to the non—clearing labor market

that results from the contract. The second term is the welfare loss due to
the lack of full information. Both terms apply for those circumstances in

which the wage contract binds. (I8I < k). The third term represents the
expected welfare loss due to adjustment costs in the case of re—negotiation,
and it applies for those circumstances in which

frequent re—negotiation (dk < 0) reduces the first two terms, increasing the
third.

represent the demand and supply of labor in a "non—stochastic" equilibrium.

Re—negotiation is desirable if the expected gain exceeds the cost
involved. Increase in aggregate volatility (a uniform increase in the
variance of all shocks) implies that the potential benefit more frequently

justifies re—negotiation (eq. 33b). This is because the cost of lack of full

information increases monotonically

with aggregate volatility. This works as

to increase the benefit of re—negotiation, which sets the wage according to

the improved information set. Naturally, a higher cost of information

negotiation. Notice that if the adjustment cost Cc) is small relative to the

insight into the determination of

optimal information collection and re—contracting, let us consider how
increasing the frequency of re—negotiation

affects expected welfare. This is

done by deriving the expected marginal cost

and benefit of lowering

information collection and re—negotiation. Higher cost c results in an upward
shift of the marginal cost curve, implying less frequent re—negotiation.

Higher aggregate volatility (dVm > 0 for a given VmIVv) shifts the marginal
benefit up, encouraging re—negotiation.

Starting with an economy where wage indexation is prohibited, allowing a
limited indexation has the effect of reducing g0.

In terms of figure 2, it

shifts the marginal benefit curve to the right, which in turn reduces the
frequency of re—negotiation. In this sense, wage re—negotiation and wage
indexation

are substitutes for each other. Allowing for unregulated wage

indexation will result in setting optimal indexatlon at b*, which in turn
implies that the marginal benefit curve is given by the flat dotted line in
figure 2.

Consequently, in a covarlance stationary economy free from regulations
regarding wage indexation, re—negotiation agreements and contracts with

optimal indexation are mutually exclusive regimes. Wage contracts with
optimal indexation dominates re—negotiation if and only if the cost of
information collection and re—negotiation is large relative to a volatility
measure:

The relevant volatility measure is the variance of the real shock

forecast error (V). If the above condition does not hold, continuous renegotiation will dominate a contract regime. In such a case the labor market
behaves as a spot market. In both regimes, the labor market clears
continuously. If eq. 36 is satisfied, any regulation which prevents the use
of optimal indexation (b*) gives rise to the simultaneous use of re—

—15—

negotiation and wage contracts; and will occasionally imply disequilibrium in
the labor market.

Notice that an unexpected change in the covariance

structure can result

in a transitory period in which we use a wage indexatlon that was optimal in a

previous regime. In such a case, we might get a transitory disequilibrium in
the labor market, resulting from an unstable

covariance structure. It should

be noted, however, that allowing for the adjustment costs of learning the new
structure might preserve the market clearing

structure in an extended model.

Its formulation is left for future study.

4. concluding Remarks
This paper has focused on how costly information collection and costly
last minute wage negotiation affect the flexibility

of wage contracts. It

considers the case where a wage contract allows for limited flexibility by

specifing partial wage indexation and the conditions under which wage re-

negotiation will occur. The economy is subject to random shocks. Observed
prices provide only partial information

regarding the nature of those

shocks. The current information set can be improved by costly data gatheridg

(surveys, research, etc.). Indexation makes use of the information embodied
in the price signal, whereas wage re—negotiation
that can be obtained only by costly research.

make use of the information

The analysis derives the

contract scheme which will minimize the welfare loss due to imperfect
information at the time of the contract negotiation.

A higher volatility in

the shocks affecting the economy has the effect of increasing wage renegotiation, whereas a higher cost of

information collection reduces it. Wage

indexation proves to depend on measures of relative (and not absolute)

volatility of the various shocks. It is not affected by the cost of

—16—

information collection. Wage indexation increases with the importance of
monetary, relative to real, disturbances. It is the same as the indexation
scheme proposed by Gray, but it is derived in a setup which uses all available

information, resulting in a clearing labor market. The final justification
for labor contracts with optimal wage re—negotiation hinges on the cost of
information collection and last minute wage negotiation.
tn a covariance stationary economy, free from regulation regarding wage

indexation, re—negotiation agreements and contracts with optimal indexacion

are mutually exclusive regimes. Wage contracts with optimal indexation
dominates re—negotiation if (and only if) the cost of information collection
and re—negotiation is large relative to a volatility measure.

If this

condition does not hold the labor market behaves as a spot market. If this
condition is satisfied, any regulation which prevents the use of optimal
indexation gives rise to the simultaneous use of re—negotiation and wage
contracts.

For studies that emphasize these effects see, for example, Fischer
(1977) and Taylor (1979).

Flood and Marion (1982) and Marston (1982) use such a loss function to

derive optimal wage policy in an open economy. Aizenman (1982) applies
this loss function to derive optimal wage re—negotiation. The above
studies use a modified version of models used by Gray (1976) and Fischer
(1977).
3.

In some respects, this paper can be viewed as extending Barro's (1977)
analysis for the case of costly and incomplete information.

It is assumed that the variances of the shocks are small enough to make

an approximation useful.

To simplify exposition, it is assumed that investment in improving the
information set is found in conjunction with re—negotiation. Modifying
this assumption will not change the nature of the results reported in

the paper. This is because the only observable current information is
the price level. Optimal indexation allows us to use this information
efficiently. Therefore, re—negotiation can improve

welfare only if it

is based upon information that is not contained in the price signal.
Thus, investment in information must accompany

re—negotiation. If the

costs of re—negotiation are high relative to the costs of information
collection, we expect investment in information to precede the decision

related to re—negotiation. Modeling such a sequence can be added
without difficulty and without affecting the main results.
