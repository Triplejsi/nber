Real Determinants of Corporate LeveraL-:

Abstract

The U.S. corporate tax distorts the behavior of both real and
financial

decisions. With respect to the former, the variation in

depreciation allowances and investment tax credit provisions across types
of investments leads to widely vazying effective tax rates, especially

since 1981. Financial policy is distorted by the differential treatment

debt

and equity. The wrpose of this paper

is

of

to examine, using firm-level

panel data, the relationship between real and financial decisions by
corporations, in part to determine the extent to which these biases offset

or

reinforce each other.

Our results are tentative and suggest that patterns of real and
financial behavior are only partially consistent with predictions of
various capital structure models (e.g. bankruptcy/agency cost, limited tax
shield)

and that

there

is no obvious offset on the financial side to the

tax bias against investment in structures.

I. Introductior
This study presents empirical estimates of the importance of different characteristics of corporations in influencing the propensity of such

corporations to finance their investments by borrowing. It also considers
the determinants of the type of borrowing finns do, by estimating jointly

the

determinants of short—term and long—term borrowing. Such analysis is

important because there are several competing hypotheses about the deter-

minants of corporate borrowing that are difficult to choose among on the
basis of economic theory alone.
Our task

is facilitated by a rich data panel based on information

on nearly 200 corporations gathered from several sources, including information on the composition of the capital stocks of individual firms. The

large number of variables representing firm characteristics facilitates the
evaluation of different models of leverage, while the availability of at
of data on each firm allows us to distinguish between short

and

determinants

of borrowing.

The tax law plays a central role in most models of corporate

leverage,

and it is

recent changes in the tax law that

motivate some of the

current interest in the cjuestion of what determines corporate borrowing.

One important issue to which ouch recent attention has been devoted is the
apparently

large bias built

into

the Accelerated Cost Recovery System

(ACES) for depreciable assets introduced by the Economic Recovery 'lhx Act
of

1981. According to most

calculations, the combination of the investment

credit and either three—year or five—year write—off gave investments in
business equipment deductions and credits that exceeded in present value
tax

the benefits conveyed by immediate expensing. As is well—known, a cor-

porate tax with expensing (and without interest deductibility) is "neutral"

—2—

in the sense that it does not distort corporate investment decisions. Put
another

way, the effective corporate marginal tax rate on investment is

zero. The presence of tax benefits in excess of expensing therefore
implies the existence of a marginal subsidy, i.e. a negative tax rate.
Indeed, the ACRS benefits are so generous that

the

aggregate effective tax

rate on equipment investment is now essentially zero, after the
introduction in the 1982 tax act of a 50 percent basis adjustment for
investment credits received.1
Under the current law, structures do not receive this effective

tax exemption offered to equipnent. Though the tax lifetime for most
business

structures (15 years) is now imich shorter than before, structures

typically receive no investment tax credits. As a result, estimates
suggest that the effective tax rates on structures now lie below the
statutory rate of I6 percent (i.e., depreciation allowances are more
generous

than economic depreciation) but ziuch closer to this rate than

zero.2 Frther, nondepreciafle assets, such as land, do not qualify for
any

investment

investment

facing

incentives comparable to accelerated depreciation or the

tax credit.

This suggests that there exists a potentially serious distortion
the choice of investment mix by- corporations.3 However, such a

conclusion is necessarily valid only if a separation prevails between real
and financial corporate decisions. Under some models of debt—equity
choice,

there nay be a tax advantage to the use of debt finance which is

dissipated by other costs to the firm as leverage increases. If these
costs relate systematically

to the firm's investment mix, one wou1d expect

—3—

debt—equity ratios to differ for this reason. For example, one could
inagine a case in which leverage costs are lower for structures, wi.th the
additional

leverage this would make possible acting to offset the tax

is an example of the type of issue we seek to resolve in the

follows.

We begin, in Section II, with a brief review of the

literature on optimal financial structure in the presence of taxation, with

particular emphasis on the choice of debt—equity ratio. Section III develops the different variants of the model of corporate borrowing that will

be estimated. The

model shares with its predecessors the weakness of being

model, rather than one derived rigorously from a firm's dynamic

optimization

problem. However, this seems unavoidable in the current

context, and the model contains enough flexibility to be compatible with

different underlying behavioral hypotheses. Section IV presents a
description of the construction of the data set and the definitions of the
variables used in the regressions, and Section V presents the regression
results.

II. Theories of Corporate Leverage
Most theories of corporate leverage begin with the twin observations that corporate taxation appears to bias the choice of financial
policy completely toward debt, and that corporations typically finance
perhaps only one quarter of their accumulations of capital by actually

issuing debt.b The challenge is to explain why

treatment of equity income (because of the partial exclusion and deferral
advantage associated with capital gains taxation) would lead to an equili-

this equilibrium, the tax advantage to debt would just be offset by a lower
before—tax return to equity holders. This model implies that in

characteristics of firms.
Certain fundamental problems with the Miller result have been

pointed out by a number of authors. For example, the implicit tax rate on
municipal debt does not appear to be anywhere near the corporate rate sug-

gested by the model.S Moreover, the portfolios of individual investors
contain both equity and taxable debt, rather than exhibiting the segmenta-

tion

that Miller's hypothesis would predict. Thus, it seems that certain

additions nnst be nade to Miller's model to explain observed behavior.

Several of the models we consider have in common the property of
there being certain costs faced by firms that increase with leverage,

making

interior

debt—equity ratios optimal in spite of the presence of a

partial tax advantage to debt finance. We consider these models next, discussing their empirically testable implications.

—5—

A.

Bankruptcy/Agency Cost Models

The most basic explanation for interior debt—equity ratios is

costly bankruptcy.6 It is important to emphasize that the bankruptcy event
must not simply be costly to some security holders in the sense of causing

a redistribution of resources among different classes. The possibility of
such redistributions could be allowed for adequately by an adjustment of

the normal coupon rate on debt. For potential bankruptcy to discourage the
issuance of debt, there mist be costs to the firm as a whole, such as legal

fees,

court costs, or the loss on disposition of fixed assets (under

liquidation). tbreover, these costs must be sufficiently large to be
important relative to debt' a tax

advantage when bankruptcy is

Thipirical evidence tends to refute this,? if we take

the observed

In models of imperfect infornation, or dynamic models in which

financial

and investment decisions occur at different times, additional

costs associated with bankruptcy can arise because of the inability of

bondholders to constrain the behavior of corporate managers. In a static
model, it nay be difficult for creditors to monitor the behavior of firms

(Ross, 1977). In

dynamic models,

managers may have the incentive to choose

socially inefficient investment plans, because they do not internalize the
effects of such plans on the value of outstanding long term debt (Jensen

and Meckling, 1976). For example, firms with high levels of outstanding
long—term debt can choose to undertake very risky projects that increase

the probability of

—6—

sufficient extent that risky projects with low total payoffs will dominate
(from the equity—holders' viewpoint) safer projects with higher total present value. The inefficency induced by this moral hazard is a social cost

the firm

and its owners exante in the

of higher coupon payments to holders of long—term debt.

It would

clearly be in the stockholders' interest to constrain the firm's behavior
in order to avoid such costs. While niechanisins to achieve this do exist

(e.g., bond covenants restricting future borrowing), it would be costly if

in the level of such costs. For example, Myers

that the moral hazard problem is more acute for firms whose

value derives from the anticipated rents from future investment opportunities rather than from existing assets or assets which the firm is com-

mitted to purchase. Presumably, there would also be less of a problem for
firms with a narrow range of investment opportunities from ihich to choose.
A second determinant of the level of agency costs should be the firm's
bankruptcy

risk, holding debt level constant. One can idel this using an

assuming that bankruptcy will occur if the
value of the firm as a whole drops below the level of claims against the
option—pricing

framework by

firm. The cost of such a "bankruptcy option" depends, following the
standard option—pricing results (Black and Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1973) on

the firm's value as wefl as the variance of its value over time.
Myers

also suggests that

the

agency problem may give rise to

maturity—matching of financial claims and real assets • although he also

—7—

points out that the problem could be alleviated if firms engaged only in
short—term borrowing, since debt would always be fully redeemed before the

making of decisions about future projects. One could imagine the occurrence of either of these practices, but it is more difficult to derive a

model that produces them. One purpose of our empirical analysis is to
determine whether such behavior can actually be detected in practice.

B. Limited Tax Shield Models
The U.S. corporate income tax treats gains and losses asym-

metrically. Thsses ny be carried back up to three years to obtain a

of past taxes, but the excess of' any remaining losses mast be
carried forward, without interest, and subject to expiration after fifteen
refund

years (seven years during this paper's sample period). Firms without taxable income need not be in financial distress or on the verge of bank-

ruptcy. However, the prospect of not being able to use the future tax
deductions provided by interest payments nakes debt less attractive, and
may cause

firms to limit their leverage. This is the essence of the

explanation offered by De Angelo and I4asulis (1960). It is attractive as
an explanation of debt policy because, unlike bankruptcy or agency costs,

tax costs are easily measured.
The hypothesis also has

a

number of testable implications. First,

firms with substantial loss carryforwards should, ceteris paribas, choose
to issue less debt. Second, firms investing in assets with a greater
fraction of their total after—tax returns generated by investment tax
credits and depreciation deductions should also use less debt finance.
This is seen most simply if we imagine a project which costs one dollar and

—5—

lasts for one period, yielding a gross return f subject to taxation at rate

r, after a depreciation deduction equal to a fraction d of gross rents. If
r is the required after—tax rate of return required by the firm (in
addition to the return of the initial one dollar investment), then the
after—tax return satisfies:

(l—r)f +

(i)

This implies that

the

f(1—d) =

firm's taxable income is:

decreases with d. This result carries over directly to a multiperiod

model if capital decays geometrically and depreciation deductions exceed
actual depreciation by a given fraction of income, say a. In this case,

taxable

income as a fraction of capital is a function only of a and not the

asset's depreciation characteristics.5 t.bre realistically, effective tax
rates on assets differ not through variations in a but through differences
in the timing of depreciation deductions and

tax credits. Thus,

price.9

On

the other band, this same asset iould receive no deductions at

after five years. Because acceleration of this sort (though not as

extreme) has been present for many

years, the fraction of a fin's income

—9—

sheltered by deductions and credits will generally increase with the rate

at which the firm

accumulates capital,

given the firm's capital stock

composition.

A final implication of this model

that

of

the firm's riskiness, this time as measured by the fluctuations

earnings

of

before interest but after taxes1° should also discourage borrowing

because the asymmetric tax treatment of gains and losses will lower the
expected tax savings from any given level of debt.

C. ¶1x Clientele !'bdels
If the Miller equilibrium holds, each firm will be completely

indifferent in its choice of debt—equity ratio. The foregoing models
suggest that asymmetries in the legal treatment of gains and losses, either

through

limited corporate liability under bankruptcy or the lack of a loss

offset in the tax law, may cause the Miller result to break down. An
additional

reason why this may happen concerns the issue of whether

investors can obtain the same patterns of returns holding either only debt

or only equity. If they cannot, then a firm's financial policy will
generally matter, and will affect the welfare of different individuals

differently (Anerbach and King, 1983). In this case, the choice of
financial policy by a firm acting "in the interests of its shareholders"

depends on who these shareholders are. !tx

different

clienteles may develop for

firms, with investors in hier personal tax brackets having a

greater relative preference for the firms they own to finance through
retentions rather than borrowing (Auerbach, 19814). Put another way, such
investors would prefer to borrow on their own account, rather than have

— lU —

firms

do it for them, if their personal tax rate is sufficiently high.

Since rst equity finance cones through retained earnings, this suggests
that a corporation facing increasing costs to leverage will use less debt
finance, the higher is the tax rate of its clientele.

D. Summary
There are several empirical inlications of the foregoing models
about overall debt—equity ratios. Risky firms should borrow less, whether

risk is measured by fluctuations in valuation or in earnings. Fst growing
firms should borrow less, because of their higher ratio of growth
opportunities to existing capital, and because of their greater tax shield
front depreciation deductions and investment tax credits. Firms investing
in assets receiving generous tax treatment, such as equipment, generally,
relative to structures and land, should use less debt for the same reason.

Firms with high—tax clienteles should use less debt than others.

We have more limited predictions about the maturity structure of
debt

that firms will choose. If firms engage in maturity matching, we

would expect to see a smaller fraction of long—term debt used to finance
equipment, which typically depreciates more rapidly. We might also expect
that firms eschewing long—term debt for agency reasons would shift to

short—term debt rather than equity finance. Particularly with respect to

the question of maturity structure, it is Important that the model we
estimate has the capacity of separating long—term determinants of leverage
from those that msy dominate borrowing decisions in the short run.

firms as a continuous process. That is, our model attempts to

as those in our sample. We also

all variables in real terms, corrected for inflation. The process
by which such variables were obtained from book value data is described in
the next section. .ir model is similar in some respects to that estimated
express

by Taggart (1977) using quarterly aggregate time series data. However,
there are several important differences and allowances for the ability to

distinguish effects across firms as well as over time. We estimate both a
single equation model for all debt and a two—equation model to explain
short—term and long—term debt.

The basic model is intended to capture three characterizations of
firm borrowing behavior.

(i) a long run target debt—equity
outlined in Section II;

ratio based on the factors

(2) a lag in adjustment to changes in this desired ratio; and
(3) the short—run importance of cash flow constraints.

To illustrate the interaction of these points, consider a firm tth a najor
tax loss carryforward that wishes to undertake an investment project. This
firm nay wish

to use

only retained earnings, but sufficient earnings may

not be available, particularly as the loss carryforward probably indicates
low cash

flow

as

well

as

low taxable income.

Hence, we might observe this

—it—

firm borrowing more in the short run than would be predicted by the

underlying attractiveness of debt finance. It is important that our model
allow such borrowing to be distinguished from borrowing based on

longer—term considerations. A simple cross—section regression would not be
capable of separating such factors.

We outline first the model of aggregate firm borrowing. The
long—run desired debt—assets ratio b* is taken to be a linear function of

several variables. These variables vary over time,

both

over

firms, or over

time and firms. We assume that firms borrow to close part of the gap

between the current ratio of debt to assets and the desired one,l1 but also
are influenced by current cash flow needs. We define this cash flow
deficit

as the change in the firm's debt—assets ratio that Mould be

required for the firm

to finance its new investment

out of internal funds

and borrowing, while at the same time maintaining dividends at their trend

level and avoiding the issuance of new shares. The motivation for this
variable is that

both

new share issues and dividend cuts are activities

taken to be costly to the firm: the former because of tax
considerations, the latter because of the undesirable signal it my
generally

convey.12

The cashflow deficit variable is constructed by subtracting from
the sum of gross investment and trend

dividendsl3 (uses) the sum of'

after—tax cash flow (after—tax earnings plus depreciation) and the product

of the current debt—assets ratio and gross investment (sources), and

dividing the difference by assets. This variable equals zero when
investment and trend dividends can be exactly covered by internal funds

—13—

plus borrowing at the current debt—assets ratio. If it is positive, an
increase in the debt—assets ratio will be needed if dividend cuts and new

share

issues are to be avoided.

This variable differs from the standard "external deficit"

variable in its inclusion of trend rather than actual dividends. Moreover,
it includes borrowing at the current debt—asset
because

ratio on the sources side

the partial adjustment nodel is expressed in debt—asset ratios

rather than in levels of debt. Fbrimalating the model in this way allows us
to distinguish between increases in the level of debt as the firm grows and

fluctuations araind this trend that result in changes in the incentives to
use debt finance.14
The basic model, then1 is of the form:

(s)

The model that distinguishes between the ratio of long—term debt

to assets (L)

and

that of short—term debt to assets (s) has two equations

The vector

each year (save the last). The former are included to account for
interfirm differences in the desired ratio of debt to assets, while the
latter are intended to pick up year to year differences in the incentive to
borrow that

are

common across firms,

as might be caused by macroeconomic

(e.g., changes in the inflation rate or the term structure).
Indeed, an interesting side result of the estimation procedure is the

Also available are many other measures of firm attributes, but
most of these are either constant or change slowly over the sample period,
making it impossible to include them in regressions along with the
individual

firm effects. Only the firm's tax loss carryforward has

sufficient year—to—year variance to be included in the initial estimation
procedure. The remainder, however, may be used in a second estimation

stage to explain the variation in the individual firm constants, in a
cross—section regression. The need for this two stage procedure would be

obviated if the firm dummies were omitted from the first estimation stage,

and the various firm characteristics included in the vector x directly.

used in this paper come from three sources. The basic
from a copy of the Compustat tape covering the

Worn

years

this tape, we selected those firms for which all obser-

vations of a subset of key variables were available. Long—term debt

corresponds to the Couçustat category of all debt maturing in nre than one
year. &iort—term debt also includes long—term debt maturing within one

year.

Thtal assets equals fixed capital, plus inventories, plus other

current assets net of non—debt current liabilities. (An alternative

approach

to the measuremant of total assets is to use the total market

—16—

value of equity plus debt. This is discussed below in Section V.) Balance
sheet and income statement data on long—term debt, capital, inventories and
earnings were corrected from book value through a series of steps described

in detail in Auerbach (1984). We review these steps briefly below.
Long—term debt was converted, to market value using assumptions

about the initial age structure of such debt in 1958, the maturity of new

issues, and the coupon rate on such issues. From this corrected data
series, we calculated the change in the market value of outstanding long
term debt due to interest fluctuations, adding this plus the inflation gain

on

net financial liabilities (long—term debt plus short—term debt less

financial assets) to book earnings.
Inventories were corrected according to information on the primary method of inventory accounting used by each firm.

The

inventory

valuation adjustment so obtained was subtracted from book earnings to

correct for their inclusion of excess inventory profits.

(If all assets actually were

off, and did depreciate, at a single rate, this calculation would
the correct rate.) Using this estimate of 6, we generated a cor-

written

yield

rected series for capital stocks and depreciation using the perpetual
inventory

method, starting in 1958. As with debt and inventories, the dif—

—17—

ference

between corrected and book depreciation was subtracted from book

earnings. The measure of corrected cash flow entering into the computation
of the cash flow deficit f is simply the sum of corrected after—tax profits
plus corrected depreciation.

After such corrections, all variables were deflated to be

expressed in constant dollars rather than current dollars. hch firm's
earnings

growth rate was estimated

period 1963—1971

by

fitting

a quadratic trend over the

for the firm's corrected earnings, before interest but

after taxes, and taking the growth rate along this trend at the sample
midpoint, 1970. The variance of firm earnings was approximated by the

sample variance around this trend, normalized by the squared trend value in
1970.

A second source of data is the actual 1GC reports filed by the
individual
provided

firms. These reports contain more detailed information than is

by Compustat. In particular, many firms list

separate capital

stocks, depreciation and investment for several classes of capital. The
most detailed common breakdown is transportation equipment, other equipment, structures and land, with sane firms aggregating the first two and

last two of these categories. Firms that did not provide uninterrupted
data between 1969 and 1971, or that did not follow this general asset class-

ification, were omitted from the sample. For the remainder, disaggregated,
corrected capital stocks were created following the perpetual inventory
method described above, using 1968 and 1971 net capital stocks and investment

and depreciation reported for the intervening years. 9ich capital stocks
were not used directly, but were divided by their annual sum to generate

— lb—

capital stock fractions. These fractions were averaged over time for each

firm and used in the second estimation stage as explanatory variables.
Of the 189 firms for which capital stocks by asset category were
conuted, 1149 have separate categories for land and structures, while 140

combine the two into a single category. Forty firms report separate statistics for transportation equipment, while the remaining firms lump all
equipment together. The average capital stock depreciation rates derived
for each category appear realistic, though there is substantial variance in

these rates across firms. The sumnary statistics for these depreciation
rates are reported in Table 1.

The measure of total assets by which we divide measures of debt
to form ratios includes corrected book values of both fixed capital and

working capital, as described in Section IV. However, one could argue that

an

alternative, market value—based measure is preferable, one that simply

adds up the value of all claims against the firm, including common and
preferred stock, long—term debt and short—term debt. The benefit of

using the second method is that it nay more accurately reflect the value of
a firm's than any measure based on book values, even "corrected" ones. For
example, a firm with ener'—intensive plant and equipment would suffer a

loss in value if enerr prices rose unexpectedly, because the discounted

value of the quasi—rents anticipated to flow from its assets would fall.
If measured properly, this would appear as capital stock depreciation, but

such a measure is difficult to obtain except indirectly through narket
valuation. Similarly, a firm with large amounts of income from intangibles
(goodwill,

patents, nnopoly rents, etc.) may have a

income—generating

comprehensive stock of

assets nuch larger than the measured capital stock.

Arguing against the use of the value—based method is the uncertainty about
the equilibriun ratio of market value to the correctly measured value of

assets. This aunts to a question about the long—run

value

of Tobin's q.

For example, under a Miller—type equilibrium with retained earnings serving
as the marginal source of finance, firms

choice

would be indifferent in their

of debt—equity ratio but the value of debt plus equity would

increase

with leverage (Auerbach, 1979) .19 In

addition, it is unclear how

nich firms react to volatile year—to—year fluctuations in value in

determining

desired levels of debt.

Since each of these methods of

Its

-

defining assets has arguments in

favor, we estimated regressions for both the book—based (Method i) and

market—based (Method ii) asset measures. The results for the first
estimation stage were relatively similar, so only those for Method I are

discussed in the text. These are shown in Table 2. (An analogue to 'lble
2 for t&thod II is presented and discussed

in the Appendix.)

The attribute vector, x, includes firm dummies, time dummies, and
the previous year's tax loss carryforward.20 The estimates are for the
period 1969—1977, for which data on all variables described above were
available.

The first column of Th.ble 2 shows the estimates for the single
ecjuation model, while the second and third present the reduced form

estimates for the two equation model. An interesting feature of all three
regressions is the relatively large size of the coefficient on the own
lagged variable ——

the annual adjustment speed. These speeds, 27.4 percent

per year for all debt, 30.4 percent for long—term debt, and 73.8 percent

short—term debt are particularly large given that they relate not to

for

levels of debt but ratios of debt to assets. A second point is that the
cross effects between long—term and short—term debt are both positive and

significant, indicating a substitutability of the two forms of finance.

The cash flow deficit is insignificant in all three equations, a somewhat
surprising

result. It suggests, for example, that a drop in cash flow,

holding investment constant, will not affect borrowing independently of

other factors. This is rather implausible, and suggests that a more
elaborate specification would be useful. The tax loss carryforward is
negative in all three regressions, as predicted, and significant in the
first two.

From the estimates in ¶Ikble 2, we can solve for the annual

desired debt—asset ratios for any

firm. As a representative example, we

consider a firm with no cash flow deficit
with

and

no tax loss carryforward, and

a firm effect equal to the mean of such effects over firms (shown in

Table 2).

trend over the period, and the estimates tend to nov'

together. An indication that the aggregate equation fits reasonably well
relative to the two equation system comes from the fact that the sum of the
estimated values of s and j* is generally very close to b*. The year to
year

movements reflect those actually observed in the aggregate (see, for

example, the statistics in Robert Taggert's paper in this volume), such as
the decline in leverage from 1973 to 1915 and increase thereafter to 1911.
However, the movements from year to year in Table 3

are

larger in

magnitude, since they reflect changes in long—run targets rather than
actually attained values.

We turn next to the second stage of our estimation, that of
explaining differences in the desired debt—assets ratios of different finns

using finn characteristics. We perform cross section regressions for
long—term debt, short—term debt, and all debt, with the dependent variables
in the regression being the estimated structural coefficient of the finn's

dumury variable in the expressions for L, s and bTM, respectively. Because
the two methods of defining total assets (corrected book versus value)
provide somewhat different results, we present both sets, in Tables 4 and

respectively.

5,

The explanatory variables in each table, all described

above, are "unlevered" variances of finn value and earnings, the firm's
"clientele tax rate" estimated from ex dividend day regressions, the
estirated rate of depreciation of the firm's capital stock, and variables

reflecting the composition of the firm's assets. For the first definition
of assets (corrected book value) we include the fraction of fixed capital
accounted for by structures, equipment, and land (which sum to one),

—26-

multiplied by the ratio of fixed capital to total assets. This yields the
fraction that each component of fixed capital accounts for of the firm's

total assets, fixed and current. The coefficients of these fractions may
be interpreted as the optimal debt—assets ratio for the particular type of

asset, relative to that for current assets. When the market value—based
measure of assets is used, we mist adopt some convention for allocating the
difference between market value and the value of assets carried over from
the

first measure. We choose to aflocate the entire difference to

intangible assets previously unaccounted for, and include in the regression
the fraction of the new capital stock measure represented by goodwill (the

remaining three fractions, for structures, land and equipment, are scaled up
or down accordingly). This fraction has a highly significant and negative

coefficient in all three regressions reported in ble 5. The absolute
value of the coefficient on goodwill is nearly as large as that of the
constant in the aggregate regression, indicating that very little debt is
used to finance goodwill, as we have measured it. This nay be interpreted

in at least two ways. One ny take it as an indication that firms finance
intangible assets with less debt, in accordance with the theory of agency
(at least to the extent that the intangibles indicate more discretion on
the part of the finn's managers). On the other hand, this finding nay also
reflect the possibility that managers base their borrowing decisions on
book asset measures (perhaps corrected for inflation) but not on stock
market values.

Except for the asset composition variables, the explanatory
variables have very similar coefficients in the two tables, although they

are not necessarily consistent with the predictions of the various theories

discussed in Section II. The clientele tax rate variable is always

insignificant, perhaps reflecting on its quality as a tax rate prov. The
growth rate and variance of earnings always have positive coefficients,

usually significant. Neither of these results has an obvious explanation.

The rate of capital

depreciation always exerts a positive effect, which also

was not predicted. However, this effect is only significant for short—term
borrowing,

of

consistent with the notion of nturity—matching. The variance

value does perform as predicted, but

all,

never

significantly so. All

in

these results provide rather negative evidence with respect to all of

the theories of leverage presented above.

The coefficients of the capital stock fractions differ
considerably between bles 1 and 5, presumably because of the inclusion

in the

latter table of the goodwill fraction. When

the first,

corrected—book neasure of assets is used, only equipment has a significant
coefficient, which is positive. When goodwill is added both to the ntasure
of assets and to the regression as a fraction of the new asset ntasure, the
coefficient of structures beconts significantly negative, and that
significantly positive.

While there is no indication that

of

land

structures are

financed with greater leverage than equipment, the instability of these

results is quite disturbing. Given that the allocation of the entire
difference between market and corrected book values to goodwill is
arbitrary and not necessarily appropriate, it is quite difficult to draw
conclusions here.

VI. Conclusion
Our

partial adjustment models of borrowing suggest rapid speeds of

adjustment, particularly
and

for short—term debt, and desired ratios of debt,

its long—term and short—term components, to assets during the period

1969—19T7 that, while not constant, exhibit no obvious trend. Some firm

are insignificant in explaining cross—sectional differences

characteristics

in leverage, while others appear to contradict

the prediction of various

theories in their impacts. The effects of firm growth rates on the level
of borrowing is inconsistent with the predictions of "agency" models of

leverage.

The positive effects of earnings variance on borrowing appears

to contradict the "tax shield" borrowing model, but

Appendix
This

appendix presents in Th.ble 2.A the first—stage estimation

results for the alternative definition of firm assets, based on unrket
value rather than corrected book value. The only important difference is
in the significant coefficients in all three equations of the cash flow

deficit, which had insignificant coefficients in all three equations in
Table 2. One suspects that this result is attributable to large short—run
fluctuations in value being ignored by firms. For example, a large decline
in the value of the firm would increase the cash flow gap, since "normal"

debt increases (the current debt to assets ratio multiplied by the change
in assets) would be negative. At the saa time, the observed change in the
debt—assets

ratio would be positive, even if there were no change

because

of the decline in the value of assets. It is

difficult in this undel to distinguish between the hypothesis that firms

simply ignore changes in value, and the hypothesis that the reduction in
desired debt is just offset by the increase in the cash flow deficit. To
sort out this problem, one would need a model that disaggregates different

sources of the cash flow deficit.
