INFLATION AND LABOR-MARKET ADJUSTMENT

ABSTRACT

The implications of downward nominal and exante
and

of wage contracting for the dispersion of relative wage

presence

wage rigidity,

real

changes in the

of price inflation are examined. Rigidity implies that unexpected

inflation will raise the variability of relative wage changes; contracting

implies unexpected inflation reduces variability. Using data on manufacturing industries for 1955—81, and on private nonfarm industries for 1965—81,

these hypotheses are studied. The dispersion in relative wage cnanges is
reduced by greater price inflation. Most of the reduction is a response
to unexpected inflation: Expected inflation has little impact on dispersion.
These findings hold for subperiods within the sample, and are robust to

different choices of measures of price expectations, including those of

the Livingston survey, the Survey Research Center household data, and ARMA

forecasts. They stand in striking contrast to the commonly accepted result
that price inflation is associated with greater dispersion of relative price

changes. They suggest that inflation reduces the ability of relative wages
to signal disequilibria among labor markets.

I. Introduction
A vast array of studies has examined how the labor market affects

inflation. In this study I reverse the process and examine how inflation
affects adjustment in labor markets.

Similarly, a rapidly growing

literature has shown that inflation raises the variability of relative
price changes, and has interpreted this finding as demonstrating the effects
of inflation on the allocative efficiency of the market mechanism. (See
Vining—Elwertowskj, 1976; Parks, 1978; Fischer, 1982; and Cukierman-

Wachtel, 1982.) The major empirical focus of this study is an examination
of how

inflation affects

the variability of relative wage changes.

With rare exceptions (Altonji, 1982, and Brown, 1982, are the best
examples) modern theories of macroeconomic adjustment have not been tested

on the labor market; where they have, the examination has been restricted
to aggregate wage inflation or employment determination.

So too, atheoretical

empirical studies of cyclical variation in inequality in wage levels are
legion (most recently, Wachter, 1970); and one study (Ashenfelter-Layard,
1983) correlated wage inflation with inequality in the rate of wage increases.

has made a study of the determinants of inequality in relative wage
changes comparable to the studies of relative price changes, and none has

empirical work on inequality in rates of wage changes to examine the

validity of theories of macroeconomic adjustment.
In Section II I outline how changes in the rate of price inflation

affect relative wage adjustment under two alternative theories of the

determination of relative wage changes. The first is a simple Keynesian
notion of downward wage rigidity; the second is based on notions of wage

contracting. The implications of these adjustment mechanisms -for the
effects of inflation on inequality of relative

wage changes are drawn out.

In Section III, I test the implications for inequality of relative wage

validity of these theories, the tests provide a new, strongly—supported fact
describing the adjustment of labor markets.

This result stands, moreover,

in surprising contrast to results others have obtained on the effects of

price inflation on the distribution of relative price changes.

II. Theories of Adjustment and Relative Wages
Throughout this section I base the discussion on a standard model of
wage determination:
(1)

w=p+yp+ay.,

where i is an economic subunit; w is

e and

the instantaneous rate of wage increase;

are the instantaneous rates of expected and unexpected aggregate

price inflation; y. is the nominal
sector, deflated by p; and

and

rate of change of excess demand in the i'th
are parameters,

<

1.

This general

model can be modified to analyze the effects of alternative assumptions
about wage determination.

A. A Simple Keynesian Assumption
Perhaps the essence of Keynesian adjustment is the assumption of

downward nominal wage rigidity. How does price inflation affect adjustment
in the labor market under this assumption? Rees (1970) has claimed, "A
gently rising price level will lubricate relative price changes...
Tobin (1972) argues that inflation is beneficial in improving matches

between workers and jobs. These views are consistent with the casual
observation that inflation enables firms to provide real rewards to those
whose productivity is increasing while cutting real rewards to those who
are becoming less productive without reducing their nominal wages. We. modify
(1) by assuming further that y is a random variable with some distribution function, G(y), and density function, g(y), and that:

—3—

w1 = max

(2)

{e + u +

,

This modification means that wage increases are either e +
=

zero, with

if

<_(e + ,rpU)/a =

or

The average wage increase

in the economy is then:

w =

(3)

where A =

e

c;[e +

+ ay] g(y)dy = [l_G(y*)]A + a f*yg(y)dy,

+

The variance in the rate of increase in money wages across subunits
is:

Var w. =

(4)

Letting a

f[A + ay — w}(y)dy + w2G(y*).

1 temporarily to simplify the arithmetic, and differentiating

in (4) with respect to A, one can show that:

Var w./A = 2G(y*) [l_G(y*)]w*,
where w is the mean increase in those subunits with positive (nonzero)
wage changes. Since A increases with both e and p's, the variance of
money wage changes will be increased as price inflation mitigates the effect

of nominal wage rigidity. Moreover, the effect of expected price inflation
will be greater than that of unexpected price inflation, for
If inflation does make labor markets work more efficiently by allowing the
effects of variations in y. to be reflected in wage changes, we should observe

a positive relation between the variance in wage changes and the rate of
price inflation. This positive relation will be greater for expected than
for unexpected inflation.

One might argue that the form of rigidity rn (2) characterized well a
world in which inflation was rare, but is a poor characterization of a world

in which price changes are generally positive. One might modify (2) by replacing the zero with pe; this respecification implies that all workers receive
a wage increase at least equal to the expected rate of price inflation.

—4—

wage rigidity (though

wage

it is in accord with notions of real

rigidity))' Under such a modification of (2) the conclusion about the

effect of expected price inflation on

the variance of wage changes is altered.

Expected price inflation has no effect on the variance of wage increases

in
across economic units (since all workers receive at least e and changes
do not affect the fraction of workers whose wage increases are constrained
to be no greater than

e)

However, as before, increases in u raise the

fraction of workers whose wage changes exceed pe; thus unexpected inflation
increases the variance of changes in relative wages.

Both specifications imply that price

inflation will affect the ability

of relative wages to allocate labor among firms. In the specification
embodied in (2) both unexpected and expected price
effects of differences in excess

inflation increase the

demand among firms on differences in wage

changes. To the extent flows of labor respond to relative wage changes, more

to be greater. Exant real wage

through its effects on relative wage changes.

C. A Contracting Approach
Stated very succinctly, an increase in wage contracting——an increased

reliance upon pos changes in price inflation in setting wages——alters (1)
by increasing y and reducing ct.

In the extreme case of complete indexing with

industry conditions not affecting wage determination at all, l and ci. =

0.

Assuming that greater uncertainty, denoted by u, affects these wage—setting

parameters in this manner, (1) can be rewritten:

U

This derivation is, unfortunately, completely mechanical.

The reason why

y>O is given by Gray (1978), who shows that increased uncertainty about

inflation makes more indexing optimal, The other part of the issue is why
optimizing agents might choose to rely more on wage indexation and less on
the vicissitudes of the market for goods or services they are producing.

One can rationalize this by considering the worker in a typical industry
who must purchase a market basket of goods, the price of which is
increasing at a rate p, but whose wage, according to (1), is partly

determined by y.. Let the average perceived correlation between p and y.
be denoted by r0. At the uncertainty denoted by this correlation, the
average worker will Supply labor to the average industry for combinations
of indexed wages and a risk premium, contingent upon y.,, no worse than
those combinations shown by the frontier U

in Figure 1. The frontier
r0
slopes down because workers require a greater risk premium to forgo
indexation; it is convex because, the less security workers derive from
indexation, the greater the incremental risk premium required to leave the
workers no worse off.
in competitive product markets employers must offer workers a
combination of indexation and risk premiums along U

employer, the best combinations of indexation and

risk

premiums that are

consistent with obtaining workers are shown by the isoutility of profits

curve 10 in Figure 1. Lower curves are more desirable to the employer.
The curves slope downward: Larger premiuTms obviously reduce profits, while
greater indexation reduces profits if it is associated with more frequent,
costly wage adjustments.

One of the effects of increased uncertainty may be to decrease the
correlation workers perceive between p and y.,. The lowered correlation,
to r1, causes the utility frontier U in Figure 1 to become flatter at any

combination of indexation and wage premium. So long as workers are risk
averse, the increased uncertainty reduces their willingness to trade off
indexed wages which protect their purchasing power for additional
contingent risk premiums.
The typical worker's utility frontier rotates to U

Assuming
r1

product markets are competitive and employers are risk neutral, the optimal
contract moves to point B, with a greater reliance on indexing and lessened
reliance on payments based on conditions in the individual product market.-"
This change implies that y in equation (I') will increase and a decrease

as the extent of uncertainty rises.

C. Summary of Implications
The two approaches carry specific and contrasting implications for the
effects of inflation on the variance of relative wage changes. These are

summarized in Table 1. Absent any good definition of what uncertainty
about inflation means, we assume that unexpected inflation is one proxy
for the extent of that uncertainty; another is discussed in Section III.
If we make this assumption, the implications of contracting for the

The Variability of Relative Wage Changes
To capture expectations about inflation I use the Livingston survey of

economists, most of whom were in private industry (Carlson, 1977); the
Survey Research Center survey of a random sample of households (Juster-

Comment, 1980); and ARNA forecasts of inflation. The Livingston surveys are
taken semiannually in June and December, when information about the CPI through
April and October respectively is

available. Accordingly, I let each observa—

tion be a half year, January—June and July—December.

survey asks questions about expectations

of inflation over the next six and

twelve months. I use both sets of data, and compute the p' corresponding to
each series by taking the most recent six or twelve months of changes in the

CPI. Thus, for example, the observation

It is unclear what are the appropriate proxy variables for greater

of this type of uncertainty, I experiment with

alternative proxies. Included

among these are Pu and the variances among the respondents in

Equation (6) suggests that a measure of the dispersion of changes

in output across sectors be included along with measures of inflation or
inflation uncertainty as independent variables in estimating equations
describing the variance in relative wage changes.

Expecting that periods of

incomes policy would produce reductions in the inequality of relative wage
changes, I also add dummy variables for the period of the Kennedy—Johnson
wage—price guideposts and the Nixon controls to these equations. Since the
latter were statistically insignificant and did not affect the other parameter
estimates, they were deleted from the equations. The guidepost
takes the value one from 1962

The equations to be estimated in this section are based on two

The second data set covers twenty two—digit manufacturing
(all of manufacturing except ordinance) for

1955—81. Var w is calculated

as in (8), based on the average hourly earnings of production workers by

industry. The series is listed in column (2) of Table 2; like Var w for
the private nonfarm economy, it too shows no particular trend. The variance
of changes in output is an emp1oyment-weighted average

of changes in the

Federal Reserve Board's index of industrial production.

All the models are

estimated using the maximum likelihood method of adjusting for serially

Table 3 presents the estimates of equations describing

Comparing the estimates in column (1)
in each table to those in

column (2) (or the estimates in column (4) to

those in columns (5), (7) and (9)), one sees clearly that,

wage changes. The adjusted 2 is greater in each

to unexpected inflation. The negative effect of Pu sharply contradicts
the notion that inflation allows wage changes to reflect real factors more

closely: More rapid price inflation compresses wage changes. Perhaps the
only

support for the hypothesis of downward nominal or ex ante real wage

rigidity is that the impact of e

is

more positive than that of U

Since

the

latter's impact is negative, and since e has no effect, this is awfully weak
support.

It seems fair to conclude that, though the results do not (indeed,

could not) disprove the existence of downward nominal or ex ante real wage
rigidity, they suggest very strongly that such rigidity describes wage—setting
since the l950s in the United States very badly.

Estimates of the equations describing the log variance of relative
wage changes that include measures of the dispersion of forecasts
of inflation are presented in columns (3), (6) and (8) of Tables 3

and 4. Only in those equations for manufacturing industries in which
the Livingston expectations data are used does the variance of
inflation forecasts induce a significant reduction in the dispersion
of relative wage changes (though the coefficients are negative in

the other four cases). While providing some support for the contracting hypothesis, these equations clearly are less successful
than those that include the actual rate of inflation or its decomposition into expected and unexpected inflation.

Given the difficulty of

identifying proxies for uncertainty about inflation, one might infer that

both sets of results support the

contracting hypothesis.

The results on the effect of expected and unexpected inflation
stand in sharp contrast to those in the literature that examines the
role inflation plays in affecting variation in relative prices. As

Parks (1978) has shown for relative price variation, I have shown that

—16—

variation in relative wage changes is unaffected by anticipated inflation.
The dispersion diminishes with unexpected inflation in prices, while the
literature suggests relative price variability increases with unexpected

inflation. The diminution in relative wage increases can be viewed as
a reduction in the ability of relative wages to reflect variations in the
relative demand for lab.or by sector. Thus, following Friedman's (1977)

argument that inflation reduces the ability of relative prices to function
as allocative signals, the results here suggest that it does so by
compressing relative variation (in this case, relative wage variation)

rather than by widening it. That studies of relative price variation fail
to find this compression may be due to misspecification——their failure to

include measures o variation in the relative demand for commodities.

An increase in the variance of changes in output produces the expected

positive effect on the dispersion of relative wage changes. This impact
is significantly positive for nearly all formulations of the estimating
equation and

data

sets. It implies that the failure to include changes in

relative demand when examining the effect of price inflation on the
dispersion of wage (or price) changes will produce an incomplete descriptIon
of the underlying process. The other variable in the equations, a dunimy for
the Kennedy—Johnson wage—price guideposts, sharply reduced the variability

of wage changes. The reductions were roughly 50 percent from the rest of
1965—81 in the private nonfarm sector, and were 60 percent in manufacturing

from the rest of 1955—81. That the reduction was greater within manufacturing
than within the nonf arm sector is consistent with the guideposts' focus on
the larger firms in manufacturing.

A number of alternative specifications of the equations in Tables 3
and 4 were estimated, each embodying some alternative variable correlated

As the Tables show, even during the post—OPEC period unexpected inflation

reduced the variability of relative wages. Anticipated inflation had
little effect on the dispersion of relative wage changes in the data for the
private nonfarm sector, but did have significant effects on dispersion

within manufacturing. The results for the period before 1973 are very weak
for the private nonfarm sector, perhaps because of the narrow range of

observations on rates of anticipated and unanticipated inflation between 1965

and 1973. For manufacturing, on which a longer time series of data are
available, the results for the first subperiod are qualitatively similar to
those in Table 4.

inflation (expected and unexpected). The ranges of p'' are quite large.

Applying them to the estimated responses of the dispersion of relative wage
changes demonstrates that they produce effects that are substantial as well as

significant. In the private nontarm sector the dispersion was between 61
and 68 percent lower (depending upon the equation used) at the peak rate
of unexpected inflation compared to the lowest rate; in manufacturing the
comparable range of effects is between 42 and 54 percent.

V. Conclusions
This study demonstrates the existence of a striking relation of the

response of labor markets to price inflation. The variability of relative
wage changes decreases when price inflation accelerates. The decrease is
mainly a response to unanticipated inflation; anticipated inflation has

little impact on the dispersion of changes in relative wages. The results
are quite robust with respect to changes in the sample period, the measures

of anticipated and unanticipated inflation, and the choice of sectors over
which the measures of dispersion are calculated.

The negative relation between unexpected inflation and the dispersion
of relative wage changes is quite inconsistent with the notion that inflation
allows labor markets to work more smoothly by ameliorating the impact of

downward nominal wage rigidity. Rather, the finding can be interpreted as
implying that unexpected inflation reduces the responsiveness of relative

wages to changes in real factors. This implies that unexpected inflation
hinders the ability of wages to allocate labor among industries in response

to changes in relative demands. The finding is consistent with the role of
increased uncertainty affecting workers' desires to minimize risk in implicit

wage

contracts. It is also consistent with workers entering the lab or—

market in response to unanticipated increases in nominal wages (Lucas—Rapping,

1969) and supplying their labor to industries where demand is growing most

rapidly

and thus where relative wages would be rising most rapidly if the

size of the labor force remained unchanged).-'
Inflation does not have the desirable side—effect of enabling employers
to

restructure relative wages more rapidly than otherwise in order to

reflect changes in relative demand. Quite the contrary: Relative wage

rigidity

is increased by inflation. We have attributed this to workers'

seeking to reduce fluctuations in their purchasing power by linking wage
increases more closely to aggregate price changes than to changes in excess

demand in their industry. The increase suggests that one cannot point to
the labor market as a sector of the economy whose functioning is improved
by price inflation.

FOOTNOTES

1. Sachs (1979) presents evidence on the importance of real wage rigidity
during the l970s in a number of industrialized countries.
2. The assumption of risk—averse workers and risk—neutral firms has been
used in the contracting literature by, among others, Azariadis (1975).
So long as the degree of relative risk aversion among workers exceeds that
among employers, the result in the text will hold.
3.

This process implies 2=1/2 years of lagged terms. Experiments ith longer
lags never yielded higher R2.

4. The data used to calculate Var w1 and Var y are taken from the CITIBASE
data file.
5.

To deflate the nominal flows of national income by sector, I use: For
construction and mining, the implicit price deflator for private nonresidential
structures; for services, and for finance, etc., the CPI—U for services,
excluding rent; for wholesale and retail trade, the producer price index
for all commodities; for transportation and public utilities, the implicit
price deflator for personal consumption expenditures on transportation; and
for manufacturing, durable and nondurable, the respective implicit price
deflators for personal consumption expenditures.
6.

Including c e in the equations in columns (2), (5) and (7) in Tables
3 and 4 changesthe results little. The significance of the terms in p
decreases very slightly; that of p declines even further below what is
shown in the Tables; and the dispersion of expected inflation itself produces
the same negative, though generally insignificant effect on the logarithm of
the dispersion of relative wage changes.
7.

Relatively greater reliance on price changes than on unemployment in
wage—setting in unionized industries is demonstrated by, among others,
Hamermesh (1970).

8. Between 1957 and 1981 the fraction of workers in the U.S. who were
covered by a negotiated cost—of—living clause ranged from .027 to .069. The
highest values occurred in 1958—1959, and in 1975—1977; both are periods
that followed an acceleration in the rate of inflation.
9. The small effects on the parameter estimates do not contradict the
of our application of contracting to the determination of
relative wage changes. Only a tiny fraction of workers are covered by
formal indexation. Our argument and, indeed, the whole contracting
literature applies to implicit arrangements. Thus the most one can do by
accounting for the fraction of workers covered by escalator clauses is to
limit the data to the overwhelming majority of the work force whose wages
may be affected by implicit contracting.

10. Also, tests of Granger and Sims causality in each sample and for each
measure of pu could not reject the hypothesis that it is exogenous in the
equations presented in Tables 3 and 4.
11. None of the F—statistics testing the correctness of pooling exceeds 1.6,
and most are below one. With the degrees of freedom implied by the sample
size and the number of regressors, none comes anywhere near to being significant
at even the 10 percent level.
12. While this is possible, the underlying requirement——that workers supply
labor elastically in response to transitory changes in perceived real wages——
is not supported by the data (see MaCurdy, 1981).
