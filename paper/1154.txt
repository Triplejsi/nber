MORAL HAZARD AND OPTIMAL COMMODITY TAXATION

+
The central result of this paper is that when moral hazard
is

present,

competitive equilibrium is almost always (constrained) in-

efficient. Moral hazard causes shadow prices to deviate from market

prices. To remedy this market failure, the government could introduce differential commodity taxation. Moral hazard causes people to

taketoo little care to prevent accidents. The corresponding deadweight loss can be reduced by subsidizing (taxing) those goods the
consumption of which encourages (discourages) accident avoidance.

At the (constrained) optimum, the sum of the deadweight losses associated with moral hazard, on the one hand, and differential commodity taxation, on the other, is minimized.

Moral hazard is a generic phenomenon which occurs whenever the provision of insurance, be it explicit or implicit, affects the probability(ies)
of the insured—against event(s). The classic papers in the literature
include Arrow[l965], Spence and Zeckhauser [1971], Pauly [1974], and
Mirrlees [1975].

Moral Hazard and Optimal Commodity Taxation*

There has

the

been increasing awareness over the past

fifteen years of

importance and. pervasiveness of problems of moral hazard. Risk—averse

individuals purchase insurance which affects their incentives to undertakc
accident avoidance activities. With perfect (costless) information, insurance
contracts would specify the actions to be undertaken and provide complete insurance.

With costly information, however, insurance contracts provide only

partial insurance, balancing at the margin the loss in reduced incentives from
providing

more insurance and the gain from risk—sharing. Moral hazard problems

arise not only in insurance markets, but also in labor, product, and capital markets, in all of which elements of implicit or explicit insurance are prevalent
in contractual relations.

In this paper we establish that, with more than one consumer good and

costless government intervention, competitive eguilibrum is almost always
(constrained) inefficient when moral hazard is present; and to correct the
market failure, differential commodity taxation is necessary.

The rationale for this result is as follows: Consider the extreme
moral hazard situation, in which the insurer can observe only the outcome of
an accident and has no information on either

or

the underlying state of nature

the precaution taken by the individual to prevent the accident. In this
-

case, the insurer can do no better than to provide insurance against the acci—

dent per se (i.e., he cannot make the payout contingent on either the insured's
actions or the state of nature). As a result, the individual will typically

Take as the hypothetical base case, competitive equilibrium with

Relative to this base case, competitive equilibrium with costly monitor—

irig and therefore moral hazard entails a deadweight loss; because individuals'

precautions are not monitored, they take "too little" care. (This in itself
does not imply constrained inefficiency;

all it says is that the unobserva—

bility of accident—prevention activities entails a cost.). Now consider the
effect in the economy with moral hazard of subsidizing those goods that are
complementary to accident—avoidance activities, and taxing those goods that are

substitutable for them. The individual will undertake more accident—prevention
activity, which will reduce the deadweight loss associated with being insuf-

ficiently careful. However, such commodity ta<ation, by causing prices to
diverge from marginal costs, introduces a second source of deadweight loss.
Constrained efficiency obtains when the sum of the .two sources of deadweight

loss is minimized, and we establish that this does involve differential commodity taxation.1

This point is intuitively appealing. It will be desirable to subsi•dize fire extinguishers if the social cost of the additional fire extinguishers
bought from doing so is small relative to the expected reduction in fire damages.
Similarly, it will be desirable to tax alcohol if the direct efficiency loss
from doing so is outweighed by the fall in automobile accident damages.

1.

It appears to be the conventional wisdom that moral hazard does not cause
constrained inefficiency. This belief is based on the results of Pauly
[1974], Stiglitz 11974], Helpman and Laf font [1975], Marshall [1976], and
Shavell [1979 a,b] among others, all of which assume that there is a
single consumer good, a linear production technology, and observability
of an individual's total insurance purchases. In Arnott and Stiglitz
[182c] we showed that constrained efficiency obtains under these assumptions, but not when any one of ilem is relayed.

—3—
The rationale for differential commodity taxation here is different

from that in the conventional optimal tax literature (e.g., Diamond and Nirr—
lees [1971], i1irrlees [1971] and Atkinson and Stiglitz [1976]). There, the tax
authorities would like to tax individuals according to say ability, but this
is presumed to be unobservable and as a result the tax authorities must tax
observable items, which include commodities, on the basis of their correlation

with ability. If individuals were identical, it would be efficient to impose
lump sum taxation; differential commodity taxation would be harmful. Here,
however, even with identical individuals so that lump—sum taxation is possible,
one will want to impose differential commodity taxation.2

Thus far and in the analysis that follows, we ignore the costs of

•

government intervention. These may, however, be substantial and exceed any
possible efficiency gains from different commodity taxation. In this case,
even though shadow prices deviate from market prices, the market allocation,

since it cannot be improved upon, must be said to be constrained efficient.
Hence, the market failures we identify should be interpreted as potential

market

failures, becoming actual market failures only when the benefits of

government intervention exceed the costs. Furthermore, we have assumed that

the market price of each good equals its production cost. But if firms can tie
the

sale of various goods, they can replicate any allocation achievable via a

tax system. For the case where this possibility is admitted (which we ignore

2.

Viewed from another perspective, however, the conventional optimal tax
problem and that considered here are structurally similar. Even though
on
individuals in our model are identical ex ante, they differ
the basis of the state of nature experienced. It is the impossibility
of imposing differential lump—sum taxation on these ax post groups (because of the unobservahility of • the

state of nature) that gives rise to

the desirability of differential commodity taxation.

they provide little guidance concerning

the optimal tax rates on the

various goods. As a consequence, in the next section we treat several special cases, each of which focuses on a different determinant of the optimal tax
structure.

outcomes indexed by

Outcomes are differentiated on the basis of which of a variety of kinds of accidents befall the individual, and the damage associated with each of the acci-

dents. The outcome may affect the individual either directly (giving him

pain

or pleasure and affecting his tastes) or via his gross (of insurance premium

and

payout) income.

3.

Thus, we rule out problems associated with adverse selection, which are
treated in Rothschild and Stiglitz [1976] and Spence [1978], inter alia.

4. AlternativelY, one may interpret the model as applying to an economy with
a large number of ax ante identical individuals whose accident outcomes
are statistically independent.

Taxability is closely related to observability at reasonable cost.

6.

Non—linear taxation of a good is typically possible if its consumption
can be observed. If only the exchange of the good can be observed (so
that an individual's total purchases are unobservable) taxation has to
be linear.

good k purchased by the individual with outcone i.

(b) Linearly taxable exchangeable goods which affect accident probabilities
but not utility and are used before the accident outcome; we refer to
these as accident—prevention goods, index then by , and let f be the
quantity of accident—prevention good 9 purchased by an individual.

Cc) Non—exchangeable, non—taxable goods which affect both utility and accident probabilities directly and are used before the accident outcome;
we refer to these as types of accident—prevention effort, and let e3 be the

anunt of accident—prevention effort of type j expended by an individual.

In' keeping with our assumption of linear taxation, we assume that

the insurer, since he cannot observe an individual's total purchases of a commodity, cannot write his insurance contingent on an individual's purchases.
Thus, the insurer can do no better than choose the net payout (payout minus

premium) for each outcome, some of which may be negative. To simplify the
analysis, we treat a linear production technology, and measure produced goods
in such a way that all producer prices are unity.

A doubling of all consumer prices and net (of net payout) incomes

in this economy has no effect. We therefore require another normalization.

showed that if an insured's total purchases of insurance

observable, insurance contracts specify net incomes for each outcome and

do not allow the individual to purchase as

much insurance as he wants at the

quoted price; if, however, an individual's total insurance purchases are unobservable, then contracts which (essentially) allow the individual to pur-

chase as much insurance as he wishes at a parametric price, will prevail. Thus,
the way we have formulated the problem assumes that the government

or an insurer can monitor individuals' total insurance purchases. We could

have treated the other case; the argument

for taxes and subsidies would be

even stronger.

Thus, (10') confirms our

claim in the introduction that, with the optinal set of taxes, the marginal

excess burden associated with consumer prices diverging from marginal cost

equals the marginal excess burden associated with moral hazard. The optimal
tax system therefore entails some average of Ramsey pricing and pricing to
reduce accident probabilities.

When there is no moral hazard, it can be shown that p=q=1 and full
insurance are optimal.

We bring these results together in
-

Proposition

1: With an interior solution, the optimal tax cum insurance struc-

ture may be characterized in two waYs. First, the change in net
government revenue from a "compensated" unit increase in any tax

rate must be zero. Second, for each tax rate, the marginal excess
burden associated with moral hazard must equal that associated with
the wedges between consumer and producer prices.

Since (9) is not necessarily a conve: problem, equation (10) may

saddlepqints and minima, as well as 'axima, and there may be mul-

tiple local maxima.

Let us briefly consider competitive attainability and decentraliza—

bility of the above optimum. We have assumed that an individual's total insurance purchases are observable, but that his total purchases of goods are not.
Competitive decentralizability of the (constrained) optimum, in the strong sense
that all agents respond only to parametric prices, with no government inter-

vention, is impossible. The most decentralized institutional mechanism consistent with attainability of the optimum is as follows: The government taxes
and subsidizes goods, using this revenue to provide lump—sum subsidies to indi-

viduals or insurance companies. Each insurance company, meanwhile, insists on
being its clients' exclusive agent for all types of insurance; competition,
subject to this government intervention, occurs in both goods and insurance

markets. With p and q fixed at their optimal levels, insurance companies face
the same (actually the dual) maximization problem as the planner. Depending
on the way in which competitive insurance companies adjust their policies out
of equilibrium and on the characteristics of the nonconvexities in the maximiza-

tion problem, the resulting equilibrium might be only locally optimal. In this
event, to achieve the global optimum, the government would have to take over
the provision of insurance, as well as tax

and subsidize goods. We have shown

elsewhere (Arnott and Stiglitz r1982c]) that it is generally necessary for ef-

ficiency that an individual purchase all types of insurance from a single
insurer. If this were not the case, there would be uninternalized externalities. For example, the firm providing fire insurance would neglect in its

calculations that the terms of the contract it provided would affect its
clients' efforts to avoid automobile accidents and hence the profits of firms

— 15 —

providing

automobile,accident insurance. For similar reasons, it would be in-

efficient to have an individual obtain insurance against a particular accident
from more than one insurer.'

The next section examines a few simple situations, so as to provide
some insight into the optimal tax structure.

2. Some Simple Cases

2.1 Accident—prevention effort and equipment, and separable, event—independent
utility
In this subsection, we consider an economy in which there is a single
consumer good, a single accident—prevention good, and a single kind of effort,

and

in which there are only two possible outcomes:

either a fixed—damage

accident occurs or it does not.
As in the previous section, we assume that the individual's accident—
prevention effort and his purchases of the consumer and accident—prevention

goods are unobservable. As a result, insurance is provided against the accident and taxation is linear. We retain the assumption that both goods are produced at constant cost. And we normalize and choose units of measurement such
that the producer price of each is unity. Since expected utility is homogeneous

12

We have implicitly assumed that an individual is perfectly informed concerning all insurance contracts offered. Such an assumption is t)plcally
on the basis of the consumer's shopping around. here, however,
shopping around is inconsistent with exclusivity. It might therefore be
more realistic to assume that consumers have imperfect information about
the avaiable menu of contracts, in which case market equilibrium would
entail a form of monopolistic competition.

of degree zero in consumer prices and income, we are allowed an additional nor-

malization, and assume the consumer price of the consumer good to be unity.'3

Note that, with this normalization, either the accident—prevention good will
be taxed and insurance subsidized or vice versa. We employ the same notation

as in

Thus, the size of the fixed—damage accident is y0—y1. Finally, we

thus, u0

Where ir is the probability of accident, expected utility is

Proposition 2: In the economy treated in this subsection (two outcomes; separable, outcome—independent utility; a single consumer good;

single accident—prevention good which can be taxed linearly; and
accident—prevention effort which is untaxable), the accident—prevention
good should be taxed if it is very effort—retarding and subsidized

otherwise.15

A very

effort—retarding good is roughly analogous to a Ciffen good.

Proposition can be extended straightforwardly to an arbitrary number
of outcomes, accident—prevention goods, consumer goods, and effort types.

2.2 Accident—preventiOn equipment
In this subsection, we treat an economy that differs from that of the

previous subsection in two respects: i) there is no accident—prevention effort;
and ii) the utility function is not necessarily outcome—independent.

For this case, the symmetric information optimum,

in which the planner

can directly control the individual's purchases, is the solution to

(16b)

We now examine the asymmetric information optimum, in which the
planner can only indirectly influence the individual's purchase of f by setting

x0, x1, and p. For reasons that will shortly be apparent, we first treat the

case in which u0 > u for all c0, c1 such that u0 =

u1. We say

that in this

case, the accident is relatively—utility—dereasin;)6 As in the previous subsection, we set the producer price of the consumption and accident—prevention

goods and the consumer price of the consumption good equal to unity.

p—i =

The equation characterizing the individual's choice of how many units of the
accident—prevention good to buy is

= 0.

16. We say that an accident is absolutely-utility—decreasing or simply
utility—decreasing if u([J>u1[], for all >O and marginal—uzility-.
decreasing if u0[]>u;C] for all >0.
The assumption that a accident is relatively—utility—decreasin..
implies, for instance, that an individual who has a limb severed and
has it replaced by an artificial limb, and is compensated to the point
where his marginal utility of income is the same as if his limb had
not been severed, would still have preferred not to have the limb

severed.

(typically negative) collected in lump—sum fashion to insurance companies, and

allows these companies to choose

Because of possible nonconvexities, there may be other (x0,x1) pairs which
solve the pair of equations, in which case the economy could settle down
at an inferior local optimum.

Upon reflection, this result is not surprising. Competitive equilibrium without government intervention fails to achieve the symmetric information optimum only because individuals, if they were provided with full insurance, would purchase an inefficient quantity of accident—prevention goods.

This can be remedied directly by subsidizing or taxing these goods. If, with
full insurance, the individual has an incentive both to purchase and to use the acci-

dent—prevention

goods, then the government can achieve the symmetric information

optimum by providing full insurance and adjusting the price of the accident—

prevention goods so that the individual purchases

units of the good as possible, since doing so, with a negative price, would

when an accident occurs. Thus, with relatively—utility—increasing accidents,

— 22 —

the symmetric information optimum is not attainable under conditions of asymmetric information. The symmetric information optimum could be attained if
individuals were compelled to use all the accident—prevention goods they pur—

chased.'8 The tax system, however, while a form of compulsion, cannot by itself force individuals to use what they purchase. To give individuals the
incentive to use accident—prevention goods, it is necessary that u0 > U1.

With relatively—utility—decreasing accidents, the asymmetric information
optimum is the solution to

where constraint ii), which was absent from the syetric information optimum
problem (see (15)), is binding. The asymmetric information optimum can be decentralized by having the government set the price of the accident—prevention
good arbitrarily low but positive, financing the subsidy from a lump—sum tax

on firms, and allowing firms to choose what exclusive contract to offe. Where

will choose x0 and x1 so that with the

set by the government, the individual

will (via (18)) choose f=f and the individual's expected utility is maximized.

to apply an infinitely large fine for non—compliance and to inspect for

In

this case, by setting the price of the

accident—prevention good arbitrarily low but positive, the planner can move the
economy arbitrarily close to the symmetric information optimum but not all the

way to it. Firms will then have an incentive to provide just short of full in—

surance, choosingx1 andx0 so that individuals will choose arbitrarily close
to the optimal quantity of accident—prevention goods

18a

We summarize the above results in

Proposition 3: In an economy with two outcomes, a single accident—prevention
good which can be taxed linearly, no accident—prevention effort,
and a single consumption good:

is relatively—utility—decreasing, the symmetric
information optimum can be achieved by the government setting p
optimally, and insurance companies choosing x0 and x1.

timum can almost (arbitrarily closely)

but positive price, allowing insurance companies to choose what
contract to offer, and financing the subsidy via a lump—sum tax.
iii) if the accident is strongly relatively—utility—increasing, the
symmetric information optimum cannot be achieved. The asymmetric
information is achieved by the government providing the accident—
prevention good at an arbitrarily low price, allowing insurance
companies to choose what contract to offer, and financing the subsidy via a lump—sum tax.

18a. This case is examined, in a specific context, in Diamond and Mirrlees
[197 8].

— 24 —

The Proposition extends to the case where there is more than one con—
sunier good. If the accident is relatively—utility—decreasing, the symmetric
information optimum can be achieved by taxing only :he accident—prevention

good at the optimal rate; no tax should be applied to the consumer goods.
If, however, the accident is relatively—utility--decreasing, then differential

consumer good taxation is desirable. The Proposition also extends straightforwardly to the case where there are several accident—prevention goods. When
the accident has multiple outcomes, the analog to whether the accident is relatively—utility—decreasing is whether the individual, when he is provided with
full insurance and charged an arbitrarily small positive price for the accident—

prevention good, will purchase it. When the accident has multiple outcomes and
there are several accident—prevention goods, the analysis becomes more difficult

since there may be multiple local optima; as fuller insurance is provided, the
individual will discontinue the use of the first one accident—prevention good,
then another, and for each set of accident—prevention goods employed, there will
be a local optimum.

The complication pointed out in this section, that the interior
first—order conditions of the two—tier maximization problem need not characterize the optimum, was first pointed out in Nirrlees [1975] and applies to

all the optimal tax problems treated in this paper. To simplify, we ignored
the complication in section 1, circumvented it by assumption in section
2.1, and shall assume it away for the rest of the paper.

In this subsection we framed the discussion in terms of the

taxation and subsidization of accident—prevention goods. In so doing, we
implicitly treated the other side of the resource constraint (19) which per-

tains to insurance. When the net revenue raised from taxation is positive

— 25 —

(negative),

insurance companies should be subsidized (taxed) in lump—sum fashion.

2.3 Accident—prevention effort and more than one consumer good
The economy to be treated in this subsection is like that of subsection 2.1 except that instead of one consumer good and one accident—preven-

tion good there are two consumer goods. To simplify the analysis, we treat a
special case in which one of the goods (good a) is separable from effort in
the utility function, while the other (good b) is not. Having set all producer

prices equal to one, we choose good a as the numraire. Utility in state i is then

of (24") concerning the determinants of the sign and magnitude of qb_1 are
far from straightforward.

Table 1 categorizes the circumstances under which good b should be

taxed or subsidized, the entries in the table indicating the sign of qb_1• To
make the analysis more concrete, we treat the example of a painful car accident in which the issue is whether pain—killers should be taxed or subsidized.

Suppose, for example that: i) effort and pain-killers are substitutes

This equation has one interesting implication: when effort is separable from
good b as well as good a in the utility function, good b should be neither

taxed nor subsidized. Thus, the substitutability or complementarity between
effort and good b is an essential determinant of how good b should be taxed.

Unfortunately, it appears that other neat results are not to be had.19
Thus, with moral hazard, the determinants of optimal tax rates
in realistic situations will be complex, and the determination of these rates

will require numerical solution. Nevertheless, the insight that the optimal
tax systems reflects two factors — Ramsey—pricing t.o.reduce the deadweight
loss associated with prices not reflecting production costs, and pricing to
-

reduce accident probabilities and hence the deadweight loss associated with
moral hazard —

is

useful.

interpreting the models of this subsection we have treated outas "no accident" and outcome 1 as "accident". We could just as well,
In

however, have assumed that an accident always occurs, and that the amount of

effort

affects the damage caused by the accident. In this case, instead of

19. The difficulty stems from the fact that (24) contains terms that reflect
global rather than local properties of the utility function.

— 29 —

speaking of accident—yrevention goods and effort, one would want to speak of
damage—reducing goods and effort. Fire extinguishers and seat belts are two
obvious examples of damage—reducing goods. Thus, one wants to subsidize fire
extinguishers as long as doing so does not make the individual much more careless.

To

say that a good should be taxed is equivalent to saying that the

shadow price of the good exceeds its market price. Put this way, however,

this

result points to an interesting

with

moral hazard, pecuniary externalities "matter";2°

implication of our analysis: In an economy
by "matter" we mean

that government intervention is justified to internalize the externality. In
a classic competitive economy, pecuniary externalities do not matter since
the social benefit associated with the marginal unit equals the social cost.
The purchase of the marginal unit causes prices to change throughout the

economy, which induces a string of marginal reallocations. But since the so—
cialbenefit of each of these marginal reallocations equals the social cost,
the pecuniary externality creates no deadweight loss. In an economy with
moral hazard, however, since the social benefit of the marginal reallocations is not in general equal to the corresponding social cost, pecuniary
externalities alter the aggregate deadweight loss in the economy and thus

matter. This result implies that the welfare properties of economies wih
moral hazard are markedly different from those of Arrow—Debreu economies.
For one, the Invisible Hand Theorem usually fails to hold in economies with

moral hazard; other differences are examined at some length in Arnott and

20. This statement needs to be qualified. When the allocation in an economy
with moral hazard coincides with the corresponding syrme:ric information
optimum, pecuniary externalities do not matter.

30 —

Stigiitz

[1983c].

In the previous analysis, we assumed that an individual's total purchases of consumption and accident—prevention goods were unobservable. As a

result, firms could not make (and enforce) the terms of the insurance they offer contingent on individuals' total purchases of these goods. Furthermore,

competitive firms had no choice but to price goods and insurance at cost; any
firm which tried to do what the tax system does, taxing some goods and subsidiz-

ing others, would make a loss since individuals would purchase the subsidized

but not the taxed goods.21 In addition, the government could apply only linear
taxation. What happens if, instead, individuals' total purchases of Consumption
and accident—prevention goods are observable? Firms could then sell total packages to individuals, tieing their purchases of insurance, accident—prevention
goods, and consumption goods, in which case government intervention would be
unnecessary since there is no allocation governments could achieve which firms
could not also.

If this possibility is ruled out, then observability of total

purchases allows the governmei-it to apply non—linear taxation.

ilow does this al-

ter the previous analysis? First, the problem identified in subsection 2.2,
that taxation cannot by itself coerce an individual to use the accident—prevention goods he purchases (nor, for that matter, can packaging by firms), arises

whether taxation is linear or non—linear. Second, linear taxation along with
lump—sum transfers, which is what we treated, can be used to sustain any alloca-

tion that is sustainable using general non—linear taxation. And third, non—

various goods in each bundle are those characterizing the asymmetric information optimum.

— 31 —

linear

taxation can 1e designed to circumvent the possible non—uniqueness of

competitive equilibrium (the tax system fixed) while linear taxation with

lump—sum transfers cannot. Thus, the use of non—linear taxation by governments or packaging by firms, where possible, ay inprove social welfare, but
does not eliminate the deadweight loss caused by the unobservability of effort.

3. Policy Applications
We start out with a fairly lengthy discussion of one application,

optimal taxation vis——vis automobile accidents, and then touch on a variety
of others.

In this paper, we have assumed that individuals are identical in

order to circumvent problems associated with adverse selection. In fact, of
course, almost all insurance is characterized by both moral hazard and ad-

verse selection. The presence of adverse selection will generally affect
the optimal tax structure and in interesting ways. The taxation of commodities will alter the self—selection constraints and therefore the deadweight
loss associated with adverse selection.

22

The reader should keep in mind

22. This is analogous to commodity taxation in an economy with an income tax.
See Atkinson and Stiglitz {1976J and Stiglitz [1982b].
Consider, for instance, a simple faming economy in which everyone
owns his own plot of land. All plots are identical, output is either zero
or one, depending on farming ability and the state of nature. The insurer can observe a farmer's output, but neither his ability nor the
state of nature he experiences. There are high and low abiliy farmers
and farmers know their own ability. The insurer will offer two packages
of insurance, one low—price, low—quantity for high—ability farmers, the
other higher—price, higher—quantity for low—ability farmers. Nigh abi—
lity farmers would like to purchase more insurance, but if the insurer
offers a low—price policy with more insurance, low ability farmers will

— 32 —

that

the discussion which follows, by treating an economy of identical mdi—

viduals, ignores these considerations.

3.1 Automobile accidents
Because of moral hazard, the provision of automobile accident insurance will increase both the probability of accident and the average size

of damage, conditional on an accident occurring. People will tend to drive
too much and too carelessly, and to be insufficiently careful in the maintenance of their cars (all of which cause the probability of accident to be

too high). And they will tend to drive too last, to purchase cars that are
insufficiently safe and excessively expensive, to take inadequate precaution
to be alert, and to neglect wearing seat belts when they should (all of which
cause average damage, conditional on an accident occurring, to be too high).

We have seen that the structure of optimal taxation is complicated
by interdependencies between and within the probability—of—outcome function

and the outcome—contingent utility functions. In the discussion which follows,
we ignore these complications. Then the optimal tax structure will involve:
taxing gasoline (to encourage people to drive less), taxing alcohol (to encourage people to drive more carefully), imposing penalties on careless driving, subsidizing maintenance, taxing cars, with a higher tax on less safe and

purchase it in preference to the policy designed for them. Thus, the
presence of low—ability farmers constrains the set of (separating) contracts that can be offered high—ability farmers. This adverse selection externality entails a deadweight loss. Now suppose that the
government taxes those goods whose consumption makes people less risk—
averse (alcohol, cigarettes?). This will cause farmers to become more
risk—averse and will alter the pairof equilibrium insurance contracts,
thereby altering the deadweight loss associated with the adverse selection externality.

— 33 —
4.

more expensive cars, subsidizing coffee breaks (to encourage people to be
more alert when driving),23 and imposing penalties for not wearing seat belts.

One might also want to tax complements and subsidizc substitutes. This could

involve subsidizing alternative modes of transport. Accidents on these alternative modes are insured against, and this insurance too is characterized

by moral hazard. But one suspects that, per passenger—mile, the deadweight
loss associated with moral hazard is higher for private cars than for other
forms of transportation..

We now turn to some other issues. First, we have not yet stated what
normalization we have made;

we have adopted the nost intuitive, and norma-

lized on those goods the level of consumption of which has no effect on the

probability of accident. Second, if an insurance company can effectively regulate its clients' total purchases of insurance,24 the government does not ne-

cessarily want to tax automobile insurance. If it does, it reduces the probability of accident, but it also exposes the individual to more risk and there

is a welfare cost associated with this. The government through its taxation
wants to increase the level of precaution at every level of insurance, rather

than alter the level of insurance per Se. With the normalization we have made,
whether the government taxes or subsidizes insurance is a residual. It Jim-

poses the appropriate taxes and subsidies on goods; if doing so raises negative
revenue, it imposes lump—sum taxes on insurance coipanies a'id otherwise it pro—

23. This has been done on some highways in Pennsylvania.
24. Insurance companies do this by stating that they will pay a client in
the event of an accident only if he clais from no other company.

—34—
vides them with lump—sum subsidies. Third, there is an important qualification to this line of reasoning. We have treated automobile accidents as if
they involve only the insured. But many car accidents involve at least two
cars. A private insurance company, in deciding on the contract to offer a
client, will neglect to consider that by offering its client more insurance
and hence increasing his probability of accident, it also increases the accident probability of other firms' clients and hence these firms' profitability.

This reciprocal negative externality, which results in over—insurance, would
be internalized if there were only one insurance firm providing insurance

against car accidents. This provides an argument in favor of the socialization of automobile insurance, or alternatively a higher tax rate on insurance.
Fourth,

any outcome the government can achieve via the taxation (not neces-

sarily linear)

of body—work or, more generally, accident damage repair, it can

also achieve via the differential taxation of payouts. Both are essentially
outcome—contingent taxes. Thus, arguments in favor of the taxation of accident damage repair are neither stronger nor weaker than arguments in favor of
the taxation of insurance.

25

Fifth, it has been noted elsewhere in the

literature that experience—rating is a means of reducing the social loss attributable to moral hazard.

3.2 Other policy applications
We shall not attempt an exhaustive survey of policy applications,

25.

There is another important moral hazard phenomenon in this context.
Both the accident victim and the repair company have an incentive to inflate the repair bill (splitting the excess of claimed over
actual repair costs).

— 35 —

but

rather choose a few, each of which illustrates a point of interest.

i) social security
Diamond and Mirrlees [1978] consider an economy in which mdi—
duals are ex ante identical, but some, as they age, develop disabilities which.

make early retirement more attractive. The problem faced by the government is
how to design social security when it cannot ascertain the extent to which a

particular individual is disabled. The more attractive are provisions for
early

retirement, the more insurance is provided the disabled, but at the same

time, the more attractive it becomes for able individuals to retire "too early".
The probability distribution of retirement ages is analogous to the
probability distribution of accident damages in our model (with earlier retireinent corresponding to higher damage). Consumption in different periods

is analogous to different goods in our model, which are, at the same time, consumer goods and accident—prevention goods. Consumption in earlier periods is

damage—reduci:; since it causes the individual to save less, which makes re-

tiring less attractive; and similarly, consumption in later periods is damage—
increasing. Relative to the symmetric information optimum, the provision of

social

security causes too many people to retire at too early an age. . The

deadweight loss associated with this can be reduced by subsidizing consumption
when young and taxing consumption when old, or more straightforwardly by taxing

savings. This discourages saving, which makes an individual less inclined to
retire. Depending on how increasing disability affects the utility function,
since there is no analog to accident—prevention effort, the symmetric information optimum may or may not be achievable.
One could enrich the D—N model to allow for different types of goods.
In such an economy one might want to subsfdize those goods that encourage later

— 36 —

retirement

of the able, and tax those that encourage earlier retirement. One

might therefore want to subsidize companies' attenpts to improve working con-

ditions, and tax goods that are complementary to retirement interests. To reduce the number of early retirees, one might also want to subsidize medical
expenses.

ii) informal insurance
In Arnott and Stiglitz [1982c], we

formal insurance —
times of need —

argued

that the provision of in-

mutual assistance among friends and family members in

that

is supplementary to market insurance may result in in-

efficiency, relative to the case where all insurance is provided through the

market. For example, unemployment is likely to be a less unhappy state if an
individual is helped out by family and friends; such support dampens the individual's incentive to search for a new job. The amount of informal insurance
provided can be influenced by the government through the taxation of complements and subsidization of substitutes, through regulation, or by direct pro-

hibition. In many contexts, however, the costs of uch government intervention, on both economic and moral grounds, are likely to exceed the benefits.

In these cases there is potential but not actual market failure. The "market"
(i.e., spontaneous economic activity, including markets and spontaneous non—
market institutions) is efficient in the sense that it cannot be improved upon
by government intervention, though not in the sense employed by the naive functionalists who argue that where markets are deficient, the non—market institutions which arise will correct all potential "market" failures.

iii) unemployment insurance
The optimal provision of unemployment insurance trades off the dead-

weight losses associated with search and matching externalities, the incom-

plete provision of insurance, and moral hazard. The deadweight loss associated with this form of moral hazard (on the one hand, the provision of unemployment insurance encourages quitting, decreases the costs of poor job

performance resulting in dismissal, reduces search intensity, and increases

the reservation wage; on the other, it nay give rise to better matching) can
be reduced by taxing goods that makes unemployment more enjoyable, and subsi-

dizing those goods that make search and employment more attractive. To make
employment more pleasant, the government could subsidize firms' attempts to

improve working conditions. And to make search more pleasant, the government
could subsidize the operation of employment agencies. One could also argue
that beer should be taxed if it is found that the unemployed drink it in dis-

proportionately large quantities; one suspects, however, that this too is a
case of potential rather than actual market failure.

iv) medical insurance

-

Here the policy prescription is obvious. The government should tax
those goods and activities that are conducive to ill health, and subsidize

those associated with good health. Some such measures are already in effect
in most developed countries. The taxation of alcohol and cigarettes is an
example, though it is doubtful whether the principal aim of these taxes was
the reduction in the deadweight loss from the moral hazard associated with the
provision of medical insurance.

It is not clear whether moral hazard considerations support the

—

taxation

—

or subsidization of non—preventive medical treatment' (tais is analo—

gous to body work in the case of automobile accidents).

v) sharecropping and other

principal—agent

problens

Most economists have a good understanding of what moral hazard is,
but it is our feeling that the importance and pervasiveness of moral hazard

tends to be underestimated. For almost all risks, the probability of acident
or the size of damage conditional on the accident occurring is affected by the

tim's actions, which are only imperfectly observable. As a result, insurance
markets against virtually every risk will be incomplete or absent. And when
an insurance market is incomplete, institutions will develop that provide nc'n—

market insurance, perhaps explicit, perhaps implicit, perhaps formal, perhaps

informal. Thus, moral hazard is present not only in insurance markets, but
in these numerous social institutions as well.

We have given examples of market insurance, informal insurance, and -

government—provided insurance. There is another large class of institutions
which provide (implicit) insurance——principal—agent relationships. An example
which has been extensively discussed is the landlord—tenant contract (Stiglitz
[1974], e.g.).

The basic problem is that the provision of implicit insurance

to the agricultural laborer discourages effort. The deadweight loss associated with this can be reduced by subsidizing complements to effort. Thus,
if a happy worker is a good worker, it might benefit the landlord to construct

entertainment facilities. And

if

there is a problem with workers spending too

much time at the local cafe, he should raise its prices. Since indebtedness
and purchases of inputs may both affect effort, they too should be taxed or

subsidized. The

attempt

to internalize these "externalities" leads to in—

— 39 —

terlinkage

of land, l'abor, credit, and commodity markets (Braverman and Stig—

litz [1982] and Mitra [1982]). Other familiar principal—agent relationships
are those between employer and employee (e.g. Arnott and Stiglitz [1981], and
Arnott, Hosios, and Stiglitz [1983]), borrower and lender (e.g. Stiglitz and
Weiss [1981]), and physician and patient (e.g. Arrow [1965]).

3.3 Some comments
The reader will no doubt have asked himself: i) how significant
is the deadweight loss associated with the various forms of moral hazard we

have discussed; ii) what is the approximate magnitude of taxes and subsidies
based on these considerations; iii) how are the optimal tax and subsidy rates
to be computed; iv) and may not the administrative and other costs of imposing a complex system of taxes and subsidies to reduce the deadweight loss as-

sociated with moral hazard exceed the benefits? The simple answer is that
neither the theoretical nor the empirical work that would be required to an-

swer these questions has been done. Insurance actuaries probably have a good
idea of how responsive the probability of a particular accident is to the

parameters of the insurance contract. But this datum reflects not only moral
hazard, but also adverse selection; as the contract is modified, not only
may each client alter his accident—prevention behavior, but also the client
population may change. Since the welfare properties of economies with both moral
hazard and adverse selection have not yet been investigated, we do not know
what actuarial data would be necessary to compute the deadweight loss associated with moral hazard cum adverse selection nor how to undertake the computation.

Our intuition is that the deadweight loss due to moral hazard is

— 40 —

important

enough in s'ome contexts, most notably health, theft, fire, automo-

bile accidents, social security, and unemploynent insurance, to warrant corrective taxation.

4. Concluding Comments
This paper complements three others we have written dealing with

the pure theory of moral hazard. While each treated different topics, there

was a common theme: The properties of economies with asvretric information
are very different from those of the classic, competitive, Arrow—Debreu economy.

Within this theme, there were several sub—theies:
1.

In the analysis of economies with asymmetric information, one must guard

against making assumptions that are not primitive, but are rather charac-

teristics of the classic, competitive economy. For example, in Arnott and
Stiglitz [1982aJ we showed that moral hazard ay give rise to intrinsic non—
convexities in the relevant parameter space; it would be a mistake to blindly
assume convexity. And in Arnott Sand Stiglitz [19S2b] we demonstrated that
the form of the insurance contract depends on who has what information — contracts may specify not only price, but also the quantity of insurance to be
purchased, and may furthermore be characterized by random premia and payouts;
thus, it would be a mistake to assume the forrn of the insurance contract.

2. The basic theorems of classic welfare economics no longer hold in econo—

mies with asymmetric information. Efficiency is not in general consistent
with decentralized, atomistic behavior, and ay entail large firms (even with
constant returns in the production technology) and/or extensive government

intervention. One of the sources of potential market failure, that shadow
prices generally differ from market prices, was the focus of this paper. Other

— 41 —

sources of market faflure are discussed in Arnott and Stiglitz [1983].
3. Relatedly, considerable care must be taken to ensure that the appropriate
efficiency concept is employed. Efficiency should be defined not only contingent on the information acquisition technology, or more restrictively on
what information is and is not available to whom, but also treating market
structure as endogenous and taking into account the technology of government

intervention. The latter are particularly difficult. In the paper, we pointed
out potential market failures on the assumption that the private sector price goods at production cost. This assumption is appropriate if, as we
assumed, the individual's total purchases of each commodity are unobservable.
But if all an individuals' purchases could be costlessly monitored, there is
nothing in our model per se to rule out the emergence of a super—firm which
produces all goods and sells all insurance. If the market were, contestable,

this super—firm would act efficiently; there is nothing the goverment could

do which it could not. This result in turn is predicated on the assumption
that individuals are perfectly informed concerning all contracts and prices. If
this rather unpalatable assumption were relaxed, one would expect a monopolis—
tically competitive equilibrium to emerge.

The above discussion points to the importance of giving careful
consideration to the information available to firms and to how this affects
the feasible scope of their actions, and to relating government intervention
to those characteristics of governments, notably their coercive powers, that
permit them a broader range of actions than firms.

A final problem is that the cots of government intervention should

— 42 —

include

not only information acquisition and administration costs, but also

the efficiency losses associated with internal incentive problems. Efficiency should be defined contingent on all these, and other, considerations.

In this paper, we have made a simple yet, we believe, important

point. In particular, in competitive equilibrium (with no government intervention) in an economy with asymmetric information, shadow prices will generally

deviate from market prices. There is a welfare loss associated with the informational asymmetries, the size of which depends on individuals' consumption

patterns. If increased consumption of a good reduces this welfare loss, the
good should be subsidized whenever the reduction in welfare loss exceeds the
costs of government intervention.

We investigated a particular case of this general proposition.L&

We

considered an economy with identical individuals, in which

asymmetric

the presence of

information gave rise to moral hazard. And we considered the de—

terminants of the optimal tax structure in such an 'economy. Broadly speaking,
our

records accorded with intuition. The

moral hazard arising from the provi-

sion of insurance causes people to self—protect too little, so
consumption

those goods whose

encourage an individual to self—protect more/less should be sub-

sidized/taxed. Thus, fire extinguishers should be subsidized if having a fire
extinguisher

reduces accident damage, while alcohol should be taxed if

its con—

sumption causes individuals to drive more recklessly. Some of our results, how-

ever, are not immediately obvious. First, we demonstrated that there are cir—

26. The general proposition itself is examined in greater generality in
Creenwald and Stiglitz [1982].

— 43 —

cumstances, albeit i4robable, in which accident-prevention goods should be
taxed.

Second, we showed that, as in the optiial commodity tax problem, the

determination of the optimal tax structure is far from straigh..forward. And

third, we argued that if the probability of accident is dependent on an individual's (anonymous) purchases of accident—prevention goods and not at all

on his accident—prevention effort, that optimal taxation may lead the economy
to the symmetric information optimum.

There are two obviously

treated

worthwhile extensions to our

analysis. We

information as if it were either costless or infinitely costly to

acquire; as a result, something was either perfectly observable or unobservable. One would like to treat explicitly the costs of acquiring insurance—
relevant information,27 particularly since one could then determine the cir-

cumstances under which such information acquisition should be subsidized. The
analysis should also be extended to treat adverse selection and moral hazard

simultaneously. Not only would this alter the optimal tax structure in interesting ways, but also the development of such a model is a necessary condition for both sound, qualitative policy advice, and for the empirical estima-

tion necessary to compute optimal tax rates.28

27. The collection of information has been studied by Holmstrom [1979] and
Shavell [1979a] but for simple economies with moral hazard in which competitive equilibrium is constrained efficient.
The transmission of information, in particular whether firms have an
incentive to share information on their common clients is the focus of
current work by Heliwig [1982].
28. We assumed that it is prohibitively costly to monitor an individual's purchases of commodities. With this assumption, one cannot improve on linear
taxation. There are some commodities, however, for which individual con—
sumption can be monitored. It would be interesting to investigate the op—
timal non—linear taxation (or linear taxation cum rationing) of these commodities.

— 44 —

The belief 'that an unregulated market (and spontaneous non—market
institutions) would provide many forms of insurance in an inefficient manner

is widespread, at least among policy makers and the lay public, and has given

rise to extensive government intervention vis---vis insurance. This paper
and Arnott and Stiglitz [1983] have provided a theoretical basis for this
belief, and have indicated at least some of the factors that should be considered in determining apprppriate corrective action by the government.
