ABSTRACT

This paper examines the determinants of productivity in Japanese manufacturing industries, looking
particularly at the impact of product market competition on productivity. Using a newly available panel data
on around ten thousand firms in Japanese manufacturing for the years 1994-2000, I show that competition,
as measured by lower level of industrial price-cost margin, enhances productivity growth, controlling for a
broad range of industrial and firm-specific characteristics. Moreover, I suggest that market power, as
measured by either individual firm’s price-cost margin or market share, has negative impact on productivity
level of R&D performing firms.

1. Introduction
Does competition improve productivity? There is some theoretical basis that competition
enhances productivity, but the empirical basis is not strong enough, especially in Japan1. There
is nevertheless the growing prevalence of opinions emphasizing the importance of competition
in the policy arena such as deregulation, re-regulation, and antitrust. This paper examines the
determinants of productivity in Japanese manufacturing industries, looking particularly at the
impact of product market competition on productivity.
Using a newly available panel data on around ten thousand firms in Japanese
manufacturing for the years 1994-2000, I provide some additional support for the view that
competition, as measured by lower level of industrial mark-ups, enhances productivity growth,
controlling for a broad range of industrial and firm-specific characteristics. Moreover, I suggest
that market power, as measured by either individual price-cost margin or market share, has
negative impact on productivity level of R&D performing firms.
This paper regards price-cost margin as the main competition indicator. There are
several prior studies which treat price-cost margin as a competition index. Boone (2000)
provides a convincing argument that any parameter increase that would result in raising the
relative profit shares of firms would be a suitable measure of product market competition.
Nickel (1996) defines a competitive measure by average rents normalized on value-added.
Aghion et al. (2002) uses the Lerner Index which is defined by operating profit minus financial
cost divided by sales. Furthermore, Nishimura et al. (1999) shows that there is a negative
correlation between international competitiveness and mark-up. Its sensitivity is uniform within
an industry though skewness may be problematic in estimation. Overall there is a sound
theoretical and empirical support for using price cost margin or other forms of rent as the
measure of product market competition.
Traditional competition measures such as Herfindahl index and market share are
misleading in certain business fields, because these measures are crucially dependent on the
definition of the relevant market and tend to neglect potential as well as international
competition. Therefore, price-cost margin would be, arguably, a more desirable measure to
gauge the extent of competition, especially in certain manufacturing industries which are
confronted with intense international competition.
At first glance, it seems to be obvious that price-cost margin decreases with

There are several prior studies confirming competition effects on the level of productivity, such as
Geroski (1990, 1995), Caves et al. (1992), Nickel et al. (1992) and Torii (2001). On the other hand,
Nickel (1996), Geroski et al. (1997), Nickel et al. (1997), Blundell et al. (1995, 1999), and Aghion et al.
(2002) utilize dynamic panel data models, and suggest that market power reduce the growth of
productivity and/or innovation. Regrettably there are quite few solid empirical studies concerning
Japanese industries.

competitive pressure. However, price-cost margin is apparently affected by not only competition
but also by other various economic conditions, such as demand fluctuation, R&D appropriation,
and technological opportunity. Accordingly, there are serious endogeneity issues on the
relationship between price-cost margin and productivity.
To alleviate endogeneity biases, I utilize a convenient and widely used class of
generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators, i.e. the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data
model (Arellano and Bond, 1991). By using this estimation method, I treat several key
explanatory variables as endogenous. This estimator optimally exploits all the linear moment
restrictions that follow from the assumption of no serial correlation in the error terms. This
method has been widely used in the empirical industrial organization literature (Geroski et al.,
1993, 1997; Nickel, 1996; Nickel et al., 1997; Blundell et al., 1995, 1999; Klette, 1999; Aghion
et al., 2002).
I will basically follow the empirical strategy by Nickel (1996). I utilize his
econometric framework as a basic model in a slightly different specification. Furthermore, I
expand the basic model with a broad range of industrial and firm specific characteristics. As will
be discussed in detail in the following sections, I will try to incorporate various market
conditions as much as possible into empirical formulation to control simultaneity, such as
demand fluctuation, R&D activity, diversification, financial constraint, and technological
opportunity. Furthermore, I will examine whether R&D performing and non-performing firms
may adopt distinct managerial strategies which would result in different productivity dynamics,
reflecting the Schumpeterian dynamics.
This paper uses an exceptionally valuable panel data at the firm level. The Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has conducted the comprehensive survey about
real-world activities of Japanese firms, Basic Survey of Business Structure and Activities
(BSBSA), since 1991. The BSBSA is one of the “specified” statistics, which means that all
relevant respondents have legal obligations to respond to them, as is the case in the National
Census. The BSBSA has been conducted annually by METI since the second survey and I am
able to examine firm level data consecutively since 1994 to the present. The BSBSA covers all
the firms with no less than 50 employees and greater than 30 million yen capitalization in
mining, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade2.
The most valuable character of this survey is that it has been conducted by firm-unit of
observation with a permanent identification code. Establishment data such as Census of
Manufacturers are also available in many countries, but price setting, investment, diversification
and R&D activities, to name a few, are rarely determined by the unit of establishment as

The survey also covers firms in agriculture, construction, and service sectors, as long as they also
engage at least partly in one of mining, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade or restaurant activities.

managerial decisions. In this respect, the BSBSA provides valuable information to accomplish
empirical studies on firms’ competitive behaviors.
The available dataset consists of an unbalanced panel with a large number of
cross-section units of manufacturing (more than 13000 firms which are classified by 59 industry
codes in manufacturing), each observed for a small number of time periods (for the years
1994-2000 at most). This situation is typical of micro panel data, thereby calls for the estimation
method that does not require the time dimension to become large in order to obtain consistent
parameter estimates.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives a theoretical background
concerning the relationship between competition and productivity. Section 3 lays out empirical
formulation. Section 4 explains variable construction and measurement issues. Section 5
presents empirical findings. Section 6 discusses some implications and reservations of the
estimation results. Section 7 concludes the paper.
2. Theoretical Background
There is a broad range of theoretical as well as empirical literatures on the relationship between
competition and productivity. It is almost impossible to negate that a lot of important
manufacturing sectors are subject to imperfect competition (Hall, 1988; Bresnahan, 1989). In
the following, I will review various types of theoretical research which would clarify the
relationship between competition and productivity3.
First, there have been a lot of studies in line with a neoclassical model of firms. If
firms have market power, their optimum size may differ from minimum cost position, and if
economies of scale and/or scope exist, such differences may be more noticeable. Furthermore,
game-theoretic arguments have suggested that the degree to which costs are sunk and the
resulting intensity of potential competition may be important determinants of market structure
(Sutton 1991, 1998). Investment, advertising and R&D are typical examples of such strategic
behaviors that would raise sunk cost, and thereby enhance competitive advantage under certain
circumstances.
Second, contract theory of firms provides various theoretical predictions. The
relationship between competition and efficiency incentive can be described by using models of
moral hazard with multiple agents. Holmstrom (1982), Hart (1983), Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1983),

3

The literature survey hereafter is greatly indebted to Cohen and Levin (1989), Schmalensee (1989),
Scherer and Ross (1990), Cohen (1995), Nickel (1996), Geroski (1995, 1999), Meyer and Vickers (1997),
Aghion and Howitt (1998), Bartelsman and Doms (2000), Klette and Griliches (2000), Aghion et al.
(2001, 2002), and Nishimura et al. (1999, 2003). Obviously the literature review here is not complete and
I neglected many important applications to a variety of other related topics, such as macroeconomic
dynamics.

4

Mookherjee (1984), and Meyer and Mookherjee (1987) present models that demonstrate how
comparative performance information yielded by competition may enhance efficiency
incentives. On the other hand, Scharfstein (1988) and Martin (1993) provide models in which
competition in the product market may raise the sensitivity of profits to manager’s decision.
They find that increased competition tends to be negatively associated with managerial effort.
Furthermore, Meyer and Vickers (1997) show that overall welfare effect of comparative
performance information can either reinforce or weaken efficiency incentives in dynamic
settings depending on underling information structure.
Third, endogenous growth theory (hereafter EGT) provides an alternative theoretical
basis of the relationship between competition and productivity (Grossman and Helpman 1991,
Aghion and Howitt 1992, Caballero and Jaffe 1993, Jones 1995, Aghion and Howitt 1998,
Aghion et al. 2001). EGT generates various predictions as to the relationship between
competition, innovation and productivity. For instance, Aghion et al. (2002) predicts
theoretically and then examine empirically the relationship between product market competition
and the number of successful patents. They find an inverted-U relationship between them as in
line with earlier empirical findings by Scherer (1967) and Levin et al. (1985, 1987).
Joint consideration of the impact of R&D and competition needs additional care about
the Schumpeterian dynamics in market structure, since R&D incentive depends not only on
post-R&D competition, but also on the differences between post- and pre-R&D competition
(Arrow, 1962). A standard industrial organization theory predicts that R&D should decline with
competition, as more competition reduces the monopoly rents that reward successful innovators
(Dasgupta and Stiglitz, 1980). However, a lot of empirical studies show that there is a positive
correlation between product market competition and innovative output (Geroski 1995; Blundell
et al. 1995, 1999; Aghion et al. 2002). Competition may increase the incremental profit from
R&D because it may reduce a firm’s pre-R&D rents by more than it reduces its post-R&D rents.
Competition thereby encourages R&D investments which may lead to higher productivity
growth4.
Fourth, there are a lot of attempts to identify life cycles of firms. Geroski (1999)
describes the literature as stage theories of growth (Jovanovic, 1982; Hopenhayn, 1993; Ericson
and Pakes, 1995; Klepper, 1996). Several case studies using relatively long time-series data
provide appealing empirical findings which are consistent with predictions of the theoretical

4

A recent game theoretic analysis by Vives (2004) shows that increasing the number of firms still tend to
reduce R&D effort, whereas increasing the degree of product substitutability increase R&D effort
provided that the total market for varieties does not shrink. This indicates that it is an important role of
innovation to expand the set of new products, which would change resulting market structure. See also
Klette and Griliches (2000) which give an alternative explanation to new product innovation by using a
quality ladder model.

models (Jovanovic and MacDonald 1994, Pakes and Ericson 1998, Klepper and Simon 2000).
Finally, there is a growing body of the literature concerning Penrosian models of
organizational capabilities (Penrose 1959, Slater 1980, Nelson 1981, Clark and Fujimoto 1991,
Teece et al. 1997, Dosi et al. 2000). Penrose thought of firms as bundles of managerial resources
which were bound together by a set of organizational capabilities. In the spirit of this theory,
firms compete in constructing organizational capability (or core competence), rather than simply
setting price or quantity. R&D competition seems to be relevant to this view. Obviously R&D is
not the only method to build up organizational capability. There are a lot of other aspects of a
firm’s organizational capability, such as managerial skill, product market strategies, experiences
(learning by doing or practiced routines), and IT investment. Bresnahan et al. (2002) present
another line of research in a related vein.
The gist which emerged from these growing literatures is that the relationship between
competition and productivity has a complex dynamics, and that these models of industry
evolution are mainly driven by differences in productivity within and between firms. Different
theoretical predictions may be attributable to various assumptions in terms of the source of
productivity change. Obviously competition is one of the important driving forces, although the
implication for productivity dynamics varies according to different assumptions on market
structure and firms’ behavior.
3. Empirical Formulation
In an excellent study, Nickel (1996) presents evidence that competition, as measured by lower
levels of rents, is associated with a significantly higher rate of total factor productivity (TFP) in
UK manufacturing. I utilize his econometric framework as a basic model in a slightly different
specification. Furthermore, I expand the basic model with an additive term of R&D stock using
the conventional specification of the literature (Griliches 1979, 1986). Both product market
competition and R&D investment possibly enhances productivity in an intertwined fashion.
Therefore I treat both of them simultaneously in single empirical specification. That is, I define
a productivity equation utilizing a Cobb-Douglas production function as follows:

y it = β i + β t + λ y i ,t −1 + (1 − λ ) α l it + (1 − λ ) (1 − α ) cit + γ k it + δ hit + ς s it + ξ comp j t + ε it
where y it is log of real output, l it is log of employment, cit is log of capital stock, k it is
log of R&D stock, hit is a cyclical component, sit reflects the impact of market power on the
level of productivity, comp j represents a cross-sectional impact of product market competition
on productivity growth at the industry level, i is the firm subscript, j is the industry
subscript, t is the time subscript, β i is firm fixed effects, β t is time effects, and ε it is
serially uncorrelated error terms.

6

This specification assumes that the production function exhibits constant returns to
conventional inputs ( l it , cit ) and therefore increasing returns to the basic three arguments
( l it , cit , k it ), following the EGT literature. Note that the present formulation does not make any
explicit assumption of global profit maximization, reflecting various predictions of firms’
behavior in the literature. Put differently, the model allows for the possibility that intangible
inputs (especially knowledge stock) are not fully adjusted to their equilibrium values, but are
considered quasi-fixed while the firm solves its short run profit maximization problem. As
Griliches (1986, p.152) indicated, “while it is likely that major divergences among firms in rate
of return to R&D would be eliminated or reduced in the long run, the relevant runs can be quite
long.”
To eliminate the firm fixed effects, I difference the production function to obtain, after
rearrangement,
∆( y it − cit ) = ∆β t + λ∆( y it −1 − cit ) + (1 − λ )α∆ (l it − cit ) + γ ∆k it + δ ∆hit + ς ∆s it + ξ comp j + ∆ε it .
To avoid the corruption of parameter estimates, y it , l it , cit , k it , sit and some other control
variables (which are explained in the next section) are treated as endogenous, in that they are
correlated with ε it and earlier shocks, but is uncorrelated with ε it +1 and subsequent shocks.
That is, the endogenous variables are treated symmetrically with the dependent variable y it 5.
Furthermore, after differencing, y i ,t −1 is correlated with the equation error ∆ε it . As long as the
basic error term ε it is serially uncorrelated, however, all lags on y it , l it , cit , k it and

sit beyond t − 1 are valid instruments6.
To alleviate endogeneity issues between competition and productivity, I utilize the
Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data model (Arellano and Bond, 1991)7. This estimator optimally
exploits all the linear moment restrictions that follow from the assumption of no serial
correlation in the error terms. That is, I estimate the model using orthogonality assumptions
between ∆ε it and the set of instruments Z is :

E ( ∆ε it Z is ) = 0
5

According to the usual terminology of the dynamic panel data analysis, xit series is endogenous if xit
is correlated with ε it and earlier shocks although xit is uncorrelated with ε it +1 and subsequent
shocks. On the other hand, if x it and ε it is also uncorrelated but still correlated with ε i ,t −1 and
earlier shocks, the variable xit series are called predetermined.
6
As is pointed out by Griliches (1986, p.152), “It is possible to use simultaneous equation techniques to
estimate such models, but then the argument shifts to the validity of the exogeneity assumption for the
particular instruments. In the context of my specific data set, it is hard to think of any valid instruments
except for possibly lagged values of the same variables.”
7 Baltagi (2001), Wooldridge (2001), Arellano and Honoré (2001), Bond (2002), and Arellano (2003)
concisely explain recent developments of dynamic panel data models. The description of econometric
issues in the following heavily depends on these studies.

∆ε it = (∆ε i 3 , ∆ε i 4 ,..., ∆ε iT ) ′ , and N is the total number of firms. Instrumental variables
estimators based on this fact is a generalized method of moment estimators (GMM), making use
of the moment restrictions generated by the serially uncorrelated errors (Arellano and Bond,
1991).
GMM optimally combines the set of orthgonality conditions8. The asymptotically

where ∆ε i is consistent estimate of the first-differenced residuals obtained from a preliminary

This is a two-step GMM estimator. Under homoskedasticity of the ε it disturbances, this structure
of the first-differenced model implies that an asymptotically equivalent GMM estimator can be
obtained through a one-step procedure, replacing the weight matrix to

where H is a square matrix with twos on the main diagonal, minus ones on the first
off-diagonals and zeros otherwise. This method crucially depends on the absence of serial
correlation in ε it . Absence of serial correlation is partially assisted by the inclusion of dynamics
in the form of a lagged dependent variable. I use serial correlation tests developed by Arellano
and Bond (1991) (hereafter A-B test), as well as a standard instrument validity test (Sargan test).
I will mainly report one-step GMM estimators’ results since the standard errors
associated with the two-step estimators tend to be seriously downward biased, as shown by
Arellano and Bond (1991). This is because the dependence of the two-step weight matrix on
estimated parameters makes the usual asymptotic distribution approximations less reliable for

I am greatly indebted to Arellano and Bond (1991), Arellano and Honoré (2001) and Bond (2002) as to
the following econometric description.

8

the two-step estimators (Arellano and Bond, 1991).
Generally, estimators which eliminate unobserved fixed effects by first-differencing,
and use lagged values of endogenous variables as instruments, tend to perform poorly in
situations where the series are close to being random walks. Furthermore, firms’ growth rate
might be subject to Gibrat’s Law (Sutton, 1997; Goddard et al., 2002). Identification would be
weak where the series is near unit root process. Blundell and Bond (1998) shows that dynamic
panel data models obtained after first differencing have large finite sample bias where the
autoregressive parameters is moderately large and the number of time series observations is
moderately small. Thus the A-B test statistics and the autoregressive parameters are crucial to
examine whether estimates are spurious statistical artifacts or not.
It is worth noting that, in the context to the present model, the attempt to isolate the
impact of competition on the level of productivity is a search for a time-series effect. It is clear
from the estimation equation that what is concerned is the impact of changes in the level of
market power ( ∆sit ) on changes in productivity. On the other hand, the impact of competition
on productivity growth is represented by the cross-sectional correlation between industrial
competition index ( comp j ) and productivity growth. Accordingly, the coefficient of
competition variables either represents growth effect (cross-section effect) or level effect
(time-series effect), depending on the variable construction of the competitive measures.
4. Variable Construction and Measurement Issues

Variable definitions are summarized in Table 1. Complete definitions are available in the
Appendix. I discuss some variable definitions and their measurement issues here because they
have important implications for the interpretation of the estimation results.
4.1. Real Output, Real Input of Labor and Capital
As is suggested by Nickel (1996, p738), freely estimated on the parameters of labor and capital,
the data tends to push the coefficients strongly toward diminishing returns, which is not unusual
in a dynamic time-series context. Nickel indicates that this is because of inadequately controlled
measurement error in labor and capital, strongly accentuated by differencing. Hence for the
purposes of investigating total factor productivity effects, it is better to impose constant returns9.

9

By using establishment data, Nakajima et al. (1998) find that, while significant scale economies exist in
many manufacturing industries, the TFP growth is attributable primarily to technical progress. They
suggest that the finding validates the current practice of assuming constant returns to scale production
functions. Klette (1999) shows that there is little scale effect on price-cost margins and productivity using
establishment data in Norwegian manufacturing. Klette shows that simultaneous estimation of price-cost
margins, scale economies and productivity reveals statistically significant, but quite small margins
between price and marginal costs in most manufacturing industries. That is, problems with market power
and unexploited scale economies seem to be small on average across manufacturing.

9

The present specification attempts to alleviate the simultaneity bias in the determination of
employment, capital and output by using lagged variables as instruments. Although the
coefficients of labor and capital are not the primary concern at the present study, the ultimate
directions of biases are not known a priori.
4.2. Product Market Competition
The main indicator of product market competition is constructed by using price-cost margin. I
utilize individual price-cost margin as a proxy for market power10. At the same time, I define
industry aggregate competition measure, following Aghion et al. (2002), as follows:

comp j = 1 −

1
Nj

∑ pcmij
i

where i indexes firms, j indexes industry, and N j is the number of firms in industry j 11.
These competitive measures may contain several misspecification biases. The most important
appears to be: (i) estimates of the competition index would suffer from endogeneity bias; and
(ii) mark-ups would fluctuate either pro-cyclically or counter-cyclically.
Concerning the fist issue which is the primary concern of the present study, I treat
individual firm’s price-cost margin as endogenous, and utilize the firm specific competition
variable ( ∆pcmit ) to measure time-series competitive effect on productivity level. On the other
hand, the industrial competition measure ( comp j ) is assumed to be exogenous, and their
identification comes from variation across industries over time. This means that, although
comp j is assumed to be time-invariant in the empirical formulation (and this is virtually in
accordance with the actual data), there still remains some endogeneity bias. To alleviate possible
endogeneity bias in the industrial competitive measure, I contain several cross-sectional control
variables in regressions as will be explained below.
The second point has been examined extensively in the industrial organization
12

literature . To control market demand fluctuation, I include growth rates of both industrial sales
10

Concerning the calculation of price-cost margin, see Appendix for more detail.
The conventionally used measures are concentration ratio and the Herfindahl index. In exploratory
works, however, I had no statistically significant impact of these traditional competition measures on
productivity in various specifications.
12
Green and Porter (1984) show that markups will be pro-cyclical under imperfect information. On the
other hand, Rotenberg and Saloner (1986) show markups will be counter-cyclical under perfect
information by specifying that demand is subject to i.i.d. shocks. Haltiwanger and Harrington (1991) and
Kandori (1991) further show theoretically that counter-cyclicality is robust with serially correlated
demand shocks for a range of values for the discount factor. These theoretical analyses assume implicit
collusion among firms. As for empirical findings, Odagiri and Yamashita (1987) and Nishimura et al.
(1999) find pro-cyclical mark-ups in Japanese manufacturing industries. Domowitz et al. (1986), Machin
and Van Reenen (1993), Chirinko and Fazzari (1994), and Ghosal (2000) also find similar pro-cyclicality
in manufacturing industries in UK and US.

( industrial _ sales jt ) and import penetration ( import _ penetration jt ) in regressions. These
variables as well as year dummies are expected to control the cyclical components of
productivity dynamics.
4.3. Market Share and Diversity Index

Although market share is conventionally used as an index of market power, there are a lot of
reservations to use. Nickel (1996, p.733) enumerates the caveats of market share as follows: (i)
collusion depends not only on the size of the various firms involved relative to the market but
also on other factors that are hard to control; (ii) potential as well as actual competition
influences market power; (iii) market share does not fully reflect foreign competitors; and (iv)
market share uses industrial sales as the denominator, but it is not certain that this represents the
actual market. Thus, the estimates of market share would have little value as a cross-section
measure of market power.
However, if market share is used as a time-series measure, the problems above may be
less serious. Nickel (1996, pp.733-4) explains the reason as follows. There are two types of
possible causality: (i) competition to firm growth and productivity growth; and (ii) firm growth
and productivity growth to competition. Reverse causality yields the opposite sign. Thus if there
is a positive relationship between productivity growth and competition (or negative relationship
between market share and productivity growth), the true relationship would be much stronger.
I use market share ( ∆shareit ) and individual price-cost margin ( ∆pcmit ) alternatively
in regressions for the sole purpose of robustness check. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the
above mentioned issues, I define weighted average market share following Crépon et al. (1998).
By using their definition, it is also possible to define diversity index of firms.
To calculate the weighted average market share and the diversity indices, I fully utilize
individual firm’s sales data by industry in the BSBSA: agriculture, construction, mining,
manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and remaining service sectors. The total number of
industries is 135 in which manufacturing sector consists of 59 industries. Thus the weighted
market share and diversity index ( diversityit ) likely reflect the extent of vertical (as well as
horizontal) diversification13.
4.4. Other Control Variables

I include additional control variables in regressions as shown in Table 1. Although it is very
difficult to incorporate a broad range of real-world business activities into a single empirical
formulation, I attempt to trace not only R&D activity but also some other related aspects of
industrial and firm characteristics as much as possible.
13

Concerning the variable constructions, see Appendix for more detail.

11

First, as is specified in the empirical formulation, the effect of R&D stock is measured
by γ that is allowed to vary across firms. Estimation of γ may require data on the growth of
R&D stock. But if investment in R&D does not depreciate, then data on R&D intensity
( rd _ intensityit ) can be used to capture the R&D effect 14 . That is, ∆k it ≅ Rit / K it and

γ ∆k it ≅ ρ ( Rit / Yit ) where ρ is the marginal product of R&D, Y is output, R is R&D
expenditures, and K is R&D stock. This implies that the rate of growth in productivity
depends on the intensity of R&D investment (Griliches 1986). Thus the coefficient of R&D
intensity can be regarded as the rate of return to R&D15.
Second, in order to control a firm specific appropriability condition which may affect
individual firm’s productivity, I contain a technology trade variable ( tech _ tradeit ) in
regressions. This is defined by technology transaction turnovers (revenue + expenditure) divided
by sales. This variable is expected to condition appropriability of R&D in a comprehensive
manner (Levin et al. 1987, Cohen 1995). That is, an active firm in technology transaction is able
to retain more profit from R&D investment that would induce more R&D expenditures, thus
such a firm would be more productive.
Third, in order to control remaining possible appropriation effect, I define the
Herfindahl index of R&D expenditures ( rd _ herf jt ). I include this variable in regressions, since
I noticed highly distinct distributions of R&D doers as well as the amount of expenditures
across industries. Larger industries contain more R&D doers and thus tend to have lower values
of rd _ herf jt , nonetheless, some of smaller industries have a lot of R&D performers: some
industries evenly spread R&D expenditure among firms whereas some other industries
concentrate R&D on a few large firms. These differences are likely associated with the R&D
appropriation effect across industries16.
Finally, I contain debt-asset ratio ( debt _ assetit ) in regressions as a financial
constraint variable. The Japanese economy in the latter half of 1990s was suffered from severe
debt-deflationary pressure. Although this financial predicament would damage the firms with
14

If R&D investments depreciate, as they likely do, the estimated coefficient may contain some
downward bias. Griliches and Lichenberg (1984) find that point estimates rise with the assumed rate of
depreciation but that the specification’s fit is best with zero rate of depreciation. On the other hand, Hall
and Mairesse (1995) suggest that this sort of method is still problematic because of (i) several
measurement issues concerning net R&D expenditures, and (ii) possible gestation lag between R&D and
productivity, and suggest that the relevant coefficients should be interpreted as an ‘excess’ rate of return
to R&D.
15
The potential measurement bias on the above-mentioned procedure would be quite serious.
Nevertheless, it is very likely that there is some R&D effect on productivity. The main purpose of
incorporating the R&D related variables at the present formulation is controlling the very probable source
of productivity gain and elucidating the impact of competition on productivity all the more.
16
This index is accompanied by the similar caveats to the traditional competition measures. The most
salient point appears to be: (i) international R&D competition; (ii) economies of scale and scope in R&D;
(iii) gestation lag between R&D investment and productivity gain; and (iv) knowledge spillovers among
firms. Therefore the coefficients of this variable should be interpreted with the utmost caution.

12

stricter financial constraint, financial pressure may play some role in motivating organizational
efficiency and growth, as pointed out by Jensen (1986, 2000), Nickel et al. (1997), and Aghion
et al. (1999, 2002)17.
Note that diversity index, technology trade, and debt-asset ratio are all included in
levels in regressions. Hence these variables are expected to control the cross-sectional correlates
of productivity growth. In addition I treat these variables as endogenous variables.
5. Results

5.1. Data Issues

To eliminate apparent outliers (due to missing data, erroneous data and possible erroneous
matches) without using arbitrary imputation procedures, I computed the sales/asset ratio and
eliminated those observations outside the 95 percentile (i.e. 2.5% on both side). I also
eliminated those observations whose price-cost margins were more than unity. Using these
procedures, the observations decreased by 5.05%. To make the dynamic panel data model
estimable, I further eliminated those observations with the number of consecutive periods for
which data were held was less than five years. By this procedure, the observations decreased by
27.40%. The industry classification in manufacturing as well as the corresponding number of
firms in both full sample and estimation sample is shown in Table 2.
The summary statistics are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Number of observations and
basic statistics of R&D performers and non-performers are shown in Table 3. According to the
Student’s t-values, almost all key variables, such as sales growth rate, price-cost margin,
debt-asset ratio and real value added per employee, are statistically different between R&D
performers and non-performers. Employment adjustment rate is the sole variable which is not
statistically different between the two sub-samples. This indicates that R&D performing and
non-performing firms adopt distinct managerial strategies which may result in different
productivity dynamics.
5.2. Basic Specification

The estimation results of the basic specification are presented in Table 5. The dependent
variable is log of real sales. The number of consecutive periods for which data are held is at
least five years. Since some observations for market share and price-cost margins are differently
missing due to erroneous data and possible erroneous matches, the number of observations is
not necessarily identical with each other. Constant returns to scale in labor and capital are
imposed in all regressions. All equations are estimated in first differences and include both year
17

Empirical findings by Aghion et al. (2002) suggest that firms with higher financial pressures innovate
more for any level of product market competition.

13

dummies and industry dummies. To save space the coefficients of these dummies are omitted.
A-B test statistics that average auto-covariance in residuals of order 1 and 2 is zero are
shown by the rows denoted by m1 and m2 respectively. The pattern of serial correlation in the
first-differenced residuals is consistent with the assumption that the ε it disturbances are
serially uncorrelated, so that ∆ε it should have significant negative first-order serial correlation
but no significant second-order serial correlation. There is also some evidence that the AR(1)
model is well specified for the data series as is shown by the significant coefficients of the
lagged dependent variable. The estimates, however, are quite small and negative 18 . This
suggests that there may be some very weak tendency to mean reversion which has been pointed
out by the literature on Gibrat’s Law, although it may result from measurement errors.
As the empirical model is over-identified, it is appropriate to use Sargan statistics to
test the validity of the over-identifying restrictions. Consistent with the evidence from the serial
correlation tests, the null that these moment conditions are invalid is not rejected at any
conventional significance level in columns (1) and (3). The Sargan statistic from the one-step
homoskedastic estimator in column (2) marginally rejects the null that the over-identifying
restrictions are valid. This could be due to heteroskedasticity. However, the two-step Sargan test
may be better for inference on model specification. Sargan χ2(98) is 80.51 (p=0.901) in column
(2) using two-step homoskedastic estimator. In addition, the two-step standard errors tend to be
biased downward in small samples. For this reason, Arellano and Bond (1991) recommend the
one-step results for statistical inferences. Thus I report the one-step results in column (2).
The estimation result in columns (1) through (3) show that the industrial competitive
measures ( comp jt ) are strongly significant and positive. This reveals a significant
cross-sectional impact of competition on productivity growth, controlling for various firm and
industry specific characteristics. On the other hand, in columns (2) and (3), the time-series
measures of product market competition ( shareit or pcmit ) have negative sign as expected but
not statistically significant. These variables are entered in growth rate, thus there are no
significant impact of competition on productivity level. This non-significance may be partly due
to small within variation in the data with at most seven-year periods.
It should be noted that several control variables have also significant coefficients. First,
cyclical time-series factors such as industrial growth and import penetration are positive and
significant. Unreported coefficients of either industry dummies or year dummies are also jointly
significant respectively. Thus it is arguable that industrial demand fluctuation would be well
18

Blundell and Bond (1998) show that if lagged dependent variable has a relatively large coefficient, a
first differenced estimator such as the Arellano and Bond model may contain significant (mostly upward)
bias. In this case, they recommend using the system GMM estimator which utilizes additional moment
restriction of the cross-sectional instruments. Fortunately, this bias is not so serious for the present
specification, because the autoregressive coefficients are very small.

14

controlled in the basic specification. Second, debt asset ratio has significantly negative impact
on productivity. Third, product diversity and technology trade has positive signs although
statistical significances are quite weak. Finally the coefficients of R&D concentration index
( rd _ herf jt ) are negative and significant. This suggests that spreading R&D expenditures
among firms has positive impact on productivity growth. Although whether the R&D
concentration index can be regarded as a proxy for R&D competition or knowledge spillovers
remains to be questionable, it is an interesting finding from the viewpoint of Schumpeterian
dynamics19.
5.3. R&D and Productivity

Next, in order to see whether or not R&D affects productivity growth, I expand the basic
specification by including R&D intensity variable. Table 6 shows that the impact of R&D
intensity ( rd _ intensityit ) on productivity growth is positive and highly significant. If R&D
intensity can be regarded as the rate of return to R&D, substantial part of productivity growth
can be attributable to R&D stock. The parameter estimates (0.48 to 0.61) are virtually
comparable to but slightly higher than the estimates of the prior studies in Japan, such as
Odagiri and Iwata (1986) and Goto and Suzuki (1989).
As for the remaining explanatory variables, I obtain virtually similar results to the
basic model. The time-series effect of market power ( shareit or pcmit ) is negative as expected
but not significant. The industrial competitive variables are still highly significant. Debt-asset
ratio is negative and technology trade has positive coefficients and both variables are
statistically significant.
5.4. R&D Performers and Non-performers

In Table 7, I employ regressions by using separate samples of R&D performers and
non-performers. R&D performers are defined as firms reporting non-zero R&D expenditures
and non-performers reporting no R&D expenditures within observation periods. In this case, the
time-series competition effect ( ∆shareit or ∆pcmit ) has negative signs and is statistically
significant in R&D performers, whereas they are not statistically significant in non-R&D
performers. This suggests that market power, as measured by market share or by higher level of
individual mark-up, has negative impact upon productivity level in R&D performing firms.
On the other hand, industrial competitive effects are virtually preserved in Table 7.
Thus it is likely that industrial competitive effects have a robust cross-sectional impact on
productivity growth.
19

Aghion et al. (2002) found that the equilibrium degree of technological ‘neck-and-neckness’ among
firms should decrease with product market competition.

15

Columns (3) and (4) in Table 7 show that R&D intensity has still positive and
marginally significant effect on productivity level, but the coefficients (0.23 to 0.24) become
slightly lower than the previous estimates. The possible reason would be an omitted variable
bias due to the negligence of knowledge spillovers which are more likely to exist among R&D
performers. Spillovers possibly make the estimated coefficients downward biased 20 . R&D
performers may have better absorptive capacity and could obtain external knowledge more
effectively than non-R&D-performers, as is suggested by Cohen and Levinthahl (1989).
Other salient features of the estimated results in Table 7 are as follows. First, the
coefficients of debt-asset ratio are negative and still highly significant for non-R&D performers,
but no longer significant for R&D performers. The financial predicament in the 1990s would
thereby damage more the non-R&D performers than the R&D-performers. I will discuss some
related issues in the next section.
Second, concerning the technology trade variable, Table 6 produced positive and
significant result at the 5% significance level. In Table 7, however, this variable is not
statistically significant in R&D performers, whereas it is slightly significant in non-R&D
performers (at 5 to 10% significance level). The possible reasons for this difference between
R&D performers and non-performers appear to be that: (i) R&D performers may tend to
appropriate their R&D outcome through in-house production; (ii) some industries with many
non-R&D performers are likely to be doing relatively more informal R&D, reporting less of it,
and hence providing the appearance of more productivity gain from technology transaction.
Thereby the relevant R&D expenditure is measured with error due to less-reporting bias and the
estimated coefficients for technological trade may be upward biased. Unfortunately this sort of
bias is hardly avoidable.
6. Discussion

6.1. Cross-sectional Competition Effect across Industries

In the previous section, I provided some evidence that product market competition enhanced
productivity. Now then, it is worth measuring the quantitative size of the competition effect.
Although our competition measures are defined by the basis of both industrial level ( comp j )
and firm level ( shareit or pcmit ), I will hereafter try to depict the cross-sectional competition
effect on the industrial basis following Nickel (1996).
The impact of competition on productivity growth is represented by the cross-sectional
correlation between industrial competition index ( comp j ) and productivity growth. In Table 8,

20

The fact that the social returns to R&D exceed its private returns due to knowledge spillovers among
firms has a sound empirical basis. For example, see Jaffe (1986), Griliches (1992) and Jones and Williams
(1998).

16

by using the competition coefficient of column (3) in Table 5 (2.097), I present the ceteris
paribus industry TFP growth differentials generated by the differences in the average value of
the competition index across industries. Industry names are placed in the order of productivity
differentials.
These differentials are substantial in magnitude, and are broadly consistent with other
evidence on the extent of competition in Japanese manufacturing. Less productive industries
with negative differentials are newspaper, drug & medicines, publishing, toilet preparations &
others, beverage & tobacco, medical instruments, miscellaneous food products, oil products &
detergents, industrial inorganic chemicals, and measuring & analytical instruments. On the other
hand, highly productive industries with positive differentials consist of petroleum refining,
reeling plants & spinning mills, blast furnace & basic steel, sawmills & millwork, dyed &
finished textiles, motor vehicles & parts, non-ferrous metals, miscellaneous transport equipment,
woven & knitted fabrics, and watches, clocks & related parts.
This simple calculation suggests that the productivity dispersion across industries is
extremely large. The lowest group contains many highly regulated industries such as
newspapers, drug & medicines, and medical instruments, whereas the highest group consists of
industries confronted with fierce domestic as well as international competition, such as reeling
plants & spinning mills, blast furnace & basic steel, and motor vehicles & parts.
7.2. Time-series Competition Effect

As was indicated in the previous section, the time-series competition effect presents positive
impact on productivity only in R&D performers. Under the present formulation, the impact of
market power (either ∆shareit or ∆pcmit ) is represented by the negative correlation with
productivity growth. Price-cost margins and market shares are fluctuated within our observation
periods, and these changes partially explain the time-series variation of the productivity level.
Hereafter I will measure the long-run competition effect on aggregate basis.
The estimates of proportional change of market share ( ∆shareit ) on productivity
growth are -0.048 in column (1) and -0.046 in column (3) in Table 7. This means that around 21
percent increase in market share leads to a 1 percent fall in TFP of R&D performers in the long
run. Surprisingly, this magnitude is quite similar to the result of Nickel (1996, p.741). According
to Nickel, 25 percent increase in market share leads to a 1 percent fall in TFP in UK
manufacturing. It should be noted, however, that the present paper constructed the weighted
market share reflecting vertical as well as horizontal diversification to some extent. Therefore it
may not be appropriate to compare these two figures straightforwardly. On the other hand, the
impact of proportional change of price-cost margin ( ∆pcmit ) on productivity growth is -0.138 in
column (2) and -0.146 in column (4) in Table 7. These results suggest that about 7 percent

17

increase in price-cost margin leads to a 1 percent fall in TFP in the long run.
7.3. Selectivity Bias

Sample selectivity may be quite serious for a dynamic panel data model. If observations are not
missing at random, estimates that are based on cleaned sub-samples could be badly biased. For
example, a negative correlation between estimated productivity shocks and future probabilities
of exit would induce a negative correlation between an error term and the stock of capital
among the surviving firms and bias the estimated capital coefficient downward. Moreover,
sample selection bias due to zero-R&D reporting or less-R&D reporting is hardly avoidable21.
The comparison between the full sample and the estimation sample in Table 3 suggests
that firm size measured by permanent employee or real sales in the estimation sample is slightly
larger than that in full sample, whereas sales growth rate in estimation sample is relatively lower
than that in full sample. This indicates that some new growing firms are omitted in our
estimation sample. In other words, the coefficients of the competition measures would be
underestimated due to sample selection biases.
It is difficult to eliminate these selectivity biases completely under the current
empirical specification22. By using price-cost margin as an alternative competition measure,
however, I expect that the above mentioned sampling bias would be, at least partially, alleviated.
There are no significant differences in price-cost margin between full sample and estimation
sample as is shown in Table 323. Thus it is arguable that price-cost margin would reflect some
potential as well as international competition.
7.4. Competition and the Japanese Economy in the 1990s

Finally I make somewhat speculative comments from the viewpoint of policy implications for
the Japanese economy in the 1990s. There was a lively debate on the causes for the productivity
decline in the Japanese economy (Motonishi and Yoshikawa, 1999; Hayashi and Prescott, 2002;
Nishimura et al., 2003; Fukao et al., 2003; Fukao and Kwon, 2004; Caballero et al., 2004;
Jorgenson and Nomura 2005, among others). Regulatory environment, international competition,
technological change, malfunction of financial market, IT investment, and evolution of
industrial mix would be possible factors that altered the nature and direction of productivity
21

Griliches (1994) emphasized this point.
Market turbulence (i.e., entry, exit, and merger) possibly affects productivity dynamics as depicted by
Baily et al. (1992), Hopenhayn (1993), Olley and Pakes (1996), Foster et al. (1997), Haltiwanger (1997),
Disney et al. (2003), Nishimura et al. (2003), Fukao et al. (2003), and Fukao and Kwon (2004).
23 The BSBSA data is truncated by the threshold of 50 employees and 30 million capitalizations. Thus
new small entrants are not likely to be covered in the survey. Moreover some firms are occasionally
classified in a different industrial sector from the previously classified one. This inter-industry artifactual
move would cause possible another sampling bias.
22

18

dynamics.
For instance, Motonishi and Yoshikawa (1999) indicate that corporate investment is
the most important factor to explain the long stagnation of Japan during the 1990s. Motonishi
and Yoshikawa suggest that for large firms, financial constraints are not significant whereas the
converse is true for small firms. On the other hand, Hayashi and Prescott (2002) show that the
problem is not a breakdown of the financial system, and suggest that lower productivity growth
in Japan be ascribable to inefficient supply-side factors, such as aging population and
diminishing labor input24.
The possible reason for the productivity decline in accordance with the findings from
the present study appear to be: (i) less competitive pressure in certain business fields is one of
the possible clues to elucidate the causes for inefficient supply-side sectors; and (ii) the financial
predicament in the 1990s might damage more the non-R&D performers rather than small firms.
The first issue is the main concern of the present study. There are several prior studies
confirming that less competitive pressure is one of the possible causes for the productivity
decline in the 1990s. In a careful study, Nishimura et al. (2003) show that there is no evidence to
demonstrate natural selection mechanism of economic Darwinism works even in severe
recession periods in the 1990s. They explore a firm’s entry, survival, and exit and its
relationship with TFP. Their empirical results show that efficient firms in terms of TFP quit
while inefficient ones survived in the banking-crisis period of 1996-1997. Fukao and Kwon
(2004) also provide the similar finding to Nishimura et al. (2003). That is, a large portion of
aggregate productivity growth was attributable to resource reallocation effect, and such
metabolism did not work well in the latter half of 1990s. Barriers to new competition would be

one of the possible clues to clarify the economic slowdown in the 1990s.
In a related vein, Caballero et al. (2004) explains the Japanese productivity decline by
the so-called zombie effect. That is, failing companies losing cash-flow were kept alive by
Japanese banks’ bad loans. This is related to the second point I raised above. As is well known,
in the latter half of 1990s, the Japanese economy suffered severe debt-deflationary pressure
which possibly damaged the firms with stricter financial constraint. But it should be noted that
the zombie firms were not necessarily small firms.
The present study showed that debt-asset ratio had a negative impact on productivity
growth of non-R&D performing firms. This financial predicament would thereby damage more
the non-R&D performers than the R&D-performers25. R&D-related activities, perhaps, made
24

Hayashi and Prescott (2002, p.227) emphasize that although the so-called “credit crunch” hypothesis
may be applicable only for the brief period of late 1997 through early 1998, it cannot account for the
decade-long stagnation in Japan.
25
The similar results are also obtained by Fukao and Kwon (2004). They show that TFP gap between 75
and 25 percentile is widening in many industries where R&D intensity is high and internationalization is

19

firms somewhat resilient to productivity shocks even in the severe recession period. The
significance of debt-asset ratio is relatively robust with respect to separate samples of large and
small firms. The estimation results by using separated samples by large and small firms are
shown in Table 9. The specification fit is rather weak due to serial correlation or invalid
over-identification, but the coefficients of debt-asset ratio are significant in both samples. Firm
size may be a red herring because non-R&D performers are not necessarily small firms. This
finding may be corroborated by Hayashi and Prescott (2002, pp.222-7) showing that despite the
collapse of bank loans, small firms found ways to finance investment during the recession
period for 1996-1998.
Jorgenson and Nomura (2005) raised another interesting issue concerning productivity
decline in Japan. According to Jorgenson and Nomura, there was a significant productivity gap
between IT-producing and IT-using sectors, especially in the latter half of 1990s; Japanese
IT-using sectors were in miserable situation in the 1990s except for telecommunications
industry; but IT-producing sectors were exceptionally active, especially in the latter half of
the1990s. This suggests that IT-using sectors cannot exploit the full potential of IT innovations
yet. Policy environments surrounding the IT-using sectors in Japan may not be favorable enough
to innovative use of IT. Generally, IT-using sectors are less competitive because many those
sectors are tightly regulated. Furthermore, collusive behaviors and bid-riggings are ubiquitous in
certain business fields in IT-using sectors26.
7. Concluding Remarks

Our findings suggest that product market competition enhance productivity growth
(cross-section effect). Market power has some negative impact upon productivity level in R&D
performing firms (time-series effect). The empirical findings provided here are subject to a
number of reservations. Nevertheless, they do raise the issue that suppressing competition may
turn out to have been very costly to the economy in terms of foregone growth opportunities.
Hayashi and Prescott (2002, p.228) emphasize that “research effort should be focused
on determining what policy reform will allow productivity to again grow rapidly”. I agree to
this remark. It is quite natural to think that well-designed economic policy is a prerequisite for
productivity growth. Above all things, competition policy would be one of the clues to revive
the Japanese economy in the 21st century. I hope that the present study may shed some

more advanced.
26
Japanese antitrust enforcement has slowly but steadily strengthened since the beginning of 1990 with
the assist of hard pressure from the US government. At the same time there was (and has been) a
considerable opposition from the Japanese business community against stricter antitrust enforcement. The
increased movement of strict antitrust enforcement and pro-competitive industrial policy would be an
important background to understand the Japanese economy since the 1990s.

20

additional light on the current productivity debate in Japan.
The present study opens up a number of questions for further study. First, the analysis
should have controlled for product differentiation because most products in manufacturing
consist of a number of different level of quality and varieties. However, empirically useful
measures of product differentiation and appropriate deflators adjusted for quality are difficult to
derive even in principle, not to mention the practical problems with data availability.
Second, the cause and effect of productivity change in non-manufacturing sectors is an
important issue to be explored in future research. The lack of attention to non-manufacturing
sectors is mainly due to data constraint, but it must be undoubtedly important to enhance
productivity in non-manufacturing sectors in Japan. Non-manufacturing sectors seem to be less
competitive than manufacturing sectors due to regulations and enclosed domestic markets. It is
therefore very likely that there is still a large growth opportunities left in the non-manufacturing
sectors.
Third, Griliches (1998) shows that there are substantial heterogeneity and instability in
the coefficients of the estimated Cobb-Douglas production function. This indicates that a more
flexible specification of technology would be desirable, as suggested by Klette (1999) and
Nishimura et al. (1999). The parameter estimates at the present study are still likely to be
suffered from some instability, especially in the input coefficients of labor and capital. Further,
dynamic panel data models are in a developing research area and in many cases GMM for panel
data perform poorly in finite samples. I used a large panel dataset and luckily obtained
meaningful estimates, although the GMM on first differences may still produce imprecise
estimates. A new semi-parametric approach dealing with both selectivity and simultaneity in an
intertwined fashion by Olley and Pakes (1996) would be a promising method in future research.
Fourth, I construct the R&D related variables by using the firm level data. But firm
level data may not be adequate enough for the purpose of investigating R&D related activities,
since some portion of manufacturing firms in Japan are integrated into interlocking groups27.
Economies of scope and spillovers in R&D may have also caused another possible estimation
biases. Furthermore, R&D outsourcing and joint R&D cooperation are more noticeable in the
late 1990s in Japan. Ownership structure and R&D cooperation, especially in high-tech sectors,
would be very important issues to be explored in future research. Patent data would be a
beneficial source of information on these issues (Jaffe and Trajtenberg 2002).
Finally, I must admit that this research adds quite a modest size of knowledge to the
understanding of competition effect in the Japanese economy. Evidence from the present study
may not be representative enough because the observation period is just for the years 1994-2000.

27

See Klette (1996) concerning scope economies, interlocking group and R&D performance.

21

The Japanese economy was in turmoil during the period and many Japanese manufacturing
firms were in the process of fundamental adjustment of over-capitalization and excess
employment under serious debt-deflationary pressure. Furthermore, detailed investigation of the
individual industry and its comparison with industry aggregates is required before any strong
conclusion could be drawn about the relationship between competition and productivity.
Appendix: Variable Construction

Output is measured by deflated sales and input

Real Output, Real Input of Labor and Capital

of labor is defined by the total number of employees. Since there is no accurate information on
material or the number of hours worked in the dataset, I define value-added as follows: sales operating cost + wage + depreciation + interest payments. Concerning capital stock, making
consecutive time-series data from BSBSA is virtually impossible, because the BSBSA has
considerable numbers of samples with null investment as well as the dataset is unbalanced. Thus
a standard perpetual inventory method is not applicable here. Therefore capital stock is
represented by the book value of tangible fixed asset deflated by real price of capital goods.
Product Market Competition

pcm =

I define individual firm’s average price cost margin as follows:

sales − cost of sales + depreciation − rK
sales

where r is cost of capital and K is capital stock. Cost of capital is defined by

1−τ d
r = ( ρ + δ − π Ke ) × (
) pK
1−τ
where ρ is cost of fund (inter-bank prime rate), δ is economic rate of depreciation
(assuming δ =0.09), π Ke is expected rate of inflation of capital goods (approximated by the
past 3-year moving average of the real price of capital goods, Bank of Japan), τ is an effective
corporate tax rate (Cabinet Office), d denotes the present value of the depreciation deduction
on unit nominal investment, and

p K is a investment goods deflator (SNA private

non-residential investment deflator, Cabinet Office). I simply define d as

δ /(δ + ρ + π Ke )
following Auerbach (1979).
Market Share and Diversity Index

I define weighted average market share following Crépon

et al. (1998). By using their definition, it is also possible to define diversity index of firms. Let
S i ,k be the sales of firm i for its product k in the industry segment or market k (time

subscripts are suppressed), then
22

S i = ∑ S i ,k and S k = ∑ S i ,k
k

i

are respectively the overall sales of firm i (over all its products) and the overall sales on
market k (over all firms). The market share si ,k of firm i on market k and the share of
product k in firm i total sales are thus equal to:
si ,k = S i ,k / S k and bi ,k = S i ,k / S i .

∑ bi,k = 1

Note that

k

market share

s iw

for each firm i . Then for diversified firm i the weighted average

and the diversification index ( diversityi ) are calculated as follows:
1 / diversity i = ∑ bi2,k .

siw = ∑ bi ,k × si ,k and
k

k

For a non-diversified firm, I have
Other Control Variables

siw

= si and diversityi = 1 .

First, in order to control market demand fluctuation, I include

growth rates of both industrial sales and import penetration in regressions. Second, I also
contain a technology trade variable ( tech _ tradeit ) in regressions which is defined by

technology trade turnovers (revenue + expenditure) divided by sales. The sum of revenues and
expenditures of the whole category of technology (patents, utilities, design, copyrights,
trademarks, and know-how) are used in calculation. Finally, I include the number of R&D doers
measured by the Herfindahl index of R&D expenditures ( rd _ herf jt ). I define the measure as
follows:
rd _ herf jt = ∑ ( Rijt / ∑ Rilt ) 2
i

where R is R&D expenditure,

l

i indexes firms, and j indexes industry.

Notes:

1) The dependent variable is log of real sales. The number of consecutive periods for which data are held is at least five years.
Some observations for market share (shareit) and price-cost margin (pcmit) are missing differently, therefore the number of
observations using shareit as an independent variable is not identical with that using pcmit. Constant returns constraint is
imposed in all equations. All equations are estimated in first differences and include both year dummies and industry dummies,
although compjt, rd_herfjt, diversityit, debt_assetit, tech_tradeit, and sizeit are all entered in level as control variables. Firm size
is measured by permanent employees.
2) The equations are estimated using the dynamic panel data model based on Arellano and Bond (1991). The GMM estimates
reproted are one-step results. Asymptotic standard errors and p-values are reported in parentheses. m1 and m2 are Arellano-Bond
tests that average autocovariance in residuals of order 1 and 2 are zero, i.e., they are tests for the null on no first-order and
second-order serial correlations, asymptotically N(0,1). Sargan statistics are used for testing of over-identifying restrictions for the
GMM estimators, asymptotically χ2. P-values are also reported. All computations are done using STATA.
3) * Variables are treated as endogenous.
4) † indicates that Sargan test from the one-step homoskedastic estimator in column (2) marginally rejects the null that the overidentifying restrictions are valid. This could be due to heteroskedasticity. However, the two-step Sargan test may be better fro
inference on model specification. The two-step Sargan statistics is χ2(98)=80.51(p=0.901).

Notes:

1) See footnote of Table 5. GMM estimates reproted are one-step results in all equations. Small firms are defined by the number
of permanent employees which is no more than 300.
2) * Variables are treated as endogenous.
3) † indicates that serial correlation test from the one-step homoskedastic estimator in column (1) cannot reject the null of no
second-order autocorrelation. This may imply that the estimates are inconsistent.
4) †† indicates that Sargan test rejects the null that the over-identifying restrictions are valid. However, this could be due to
heteroskedasticity. Therefore we reported robust estimates and serial correlation tests in column (3).
