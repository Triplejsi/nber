ABSTRACT
Backcasting upward bias in price index over long periods of time yields levels of real
consumption two or four centuries ago that are implausibly low, raising the possibility that price
index bias for important products may have been zero or even negative at some point in the past.
This paper studies apparel prices over the long period 1914-93, developing new price indexes based
on more than 16,000 data observations from the Sears catalog for that interval.
The basic conclusion is that hedonic price indexes for womens' dresses exhibit a rate of
increase of many orders of magnitude faster than either the Sears Matched-model index developed
from the same source data or as compared to the CPI. The results provided here offer a complement
to past research on computer prices, which also found that price changes were contemporaneous with
model changes. Just as hedonic price indexes for computers almost always drop faster than matchedmodel indexes for computers, we have found the opposite relationship for apparel prices, although
presumably for the same reason.
The Sears matched-model indexes do not exhibit a consistent negative or positive drift
relative to the CPI. For womens' apparel the drift is always negative but for mens' apparel there is
a turnaround, from negative before 1965 to positive thereafter. Both the matched- model indexes and
the CPI rise less rapidly for womens' apparel than for mens' apparel, which would be consistent with
the hypothesis that price changes accompanying model changes (and thus linked out of both the
Sears matched-model index and of the CPI but not in the hedonic index) are more frequent for
womens' apparel, since models change more frequently.

I. Introduction
So much evidence has been produced over the years demonstrating an upward
bias in the CPI and NIPA deflators, especially for consumer and producer durable
goods of relatively recent invention, that it requires a sharp adjustment in oneʹs mindset to contemplate the opposite, that for major consumption components over long
intervals the CPI may have incorporated a significant downward bias. Yet the HultenBruegel paradox as interpreted here makes a convincing logical case that at some point
in the past there must have been a downward bias in the CPI for several major
components. This paper demonstrates that one of these components is apparel, one of
the three ʺnecessitiesʺ (along with food and shelter), and a companion paper (Gordon
and VanGoethem, 2004) reaches the same conclusion for rental shelter. Both papers are
unique in covering most of the twentieth century, 1914-93 in this paper on apparel and
1914-2003 in the companion paper on shelter.
Viewed as a contribution to the price index literature, this paper joins others that
have explored differences in hedonic and matched-model indexes developed from the
same data. Several previous studies have found that computer prices tend to be
reduced upon the introduction of new models, leading hedonic price indexes to exhibit
more rapid rates of price decline than matched-model indexes from the same data.1 The

1. Among studies that examine differences between matched-model and hedonic indexes for
personal computers and/or software are Berndt, Griliches, and Rappaport (1995), Berndt and
Rappaport (2003), Doms, Aizcorbe, and Corrado (2003), and Triplett (2004).

matching process appears to exclude price declines when new computer models are
introduced. There has long been a suspicion in the apparel price literature that price
increases occur with changes in models or styles and are missed by the matched-model
procedures of the CPI, and this paper is perhaps the first study to demonstrate this
systematic difference between hedonic and matched-model indexes from a uniform
data set for apparel over a long historical period of time.2 A striking corollary of the
results is that quality change in apparel over the long period 1914-93 has been
negligible, in the sense that the new hedonic index tracks raw unadjusted price change
relatively closely, while changes in the implied index of average quality are relatively
minor.
This paper represents the fulfillment of a longstanding goal to extract from the
Sears catalog a new history of apparel prices over the entire history between the
beginning of the CPI in 1914 and the final year of the Sears catalog in 1993 (the catalog
itself began in 1893, two decades after the Montgomery Ward catalogʹs initiation in
1872).3 Initially the goal of this project was to duplicate the CPI matched-model
methodology with catalog data and compare CPI apparel sub-components with the
2. For history buffs, the time period of this study, dictated solely by the starting date of the
CPI and the termination date of the Sears catalog, echoes dates signifying the start and end of the
most terrible events of the 20th century. In the words of Eric Hobsbawm (1994, p. 3), the
interval 1914-91 marks the "short twentieth century" bookmarked by the start of World War I
and the final collapse of the Soviet Union.
3. Sears catalog data for 1893-1914 were previously analyzed by Rees (1961), as discussed
further below. A history of the Sears Roebuck and other mail-order catalogs and further
references can be found in Gordon (1990, pp. 419-23).

corresponding Sears matched-model indexes. Subsequently it became apparent that the
same Sears data could be used to develop hedonic price indexes for at least one
product, womensʹ dresses, where an ample number of data observations are available in
the catalogs. The resulting differences in the hedonic and matched-model indexes for
womensʹ dresses provide convincing evidence that the matched-model technique
misses a significant portion of price increases that occur when styles and models
change.
The Hulten-Bruegel Paradox
Numerous economists have speculated about the implications for estimates of
long-term economic growth of bias in official price indexes. In an important and
influential example, Nordhaus (1997) speculated that, when plausible rates of upward
price index bias are extrapolated backwards for two centuries, the increase in real
wages from 1800 to 1992, which in the official data is by a factor of 13 to 18, might have
been by a factor of 40 with a low estimate of price index bias (0.5 percent per year) or by
a factor of 190 with a higher estimate of bias (1.4 percent per year).
Nordhausʹ conference discussant, Charles Hulten, pointed out the implausibility
of this thought experiment; the high bias estimate implies (in my own numerical
example that makes Hultenʹs point with different numbers than his) that median

Apparel Prices, Page 4

household income in the year 1800 was $143 in 1992 prices, or $0.39 per day, enough to
buy a mere 1.3 pounds of potatoes per day for the household, with nothing left over for
shelter, clothing, or anything else.4
But why stop there? The ʺHulten paradoxʺ should be renamed the ʺBruegel
paradox,ʺ after the landmark painter Pieter Bruegel the elder (1525-1569). Even if we
assume that the then-unavailable official estimates would register no increase in the real
wage from 1569 to 1800, when we extrapolate Nordhausʹ high bias estimate back to the
last year of Bruegelʹs life, we find the implication that the real wage should have
increased from 1569 to 1992 by a factor of 5482, making median annual household
income in the earlier year equal to $5.59, enough to buy exactly 0.8 ounces of potatoes
per day, with nothing left over for food or shelter.5 Yet the happy burghers in Bruegel
paintings often look overfed, content, well-clothed, and with solid-looking houses in the
background.

4. 1992 current-dollar median household income was $30,786 and the 1992 price of a pound of white potatoes
was $0.31. Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1994, Tables 707 and 763, respectively. Extrapolating
backwards a growth rate of real wages of 2.8 percent per year yields a ratio of real wages in 1992 divided by the year
1800 of 216. ($30,786/216 = $142.50)
5. The factor of 5482 equals the factor of 216 implied by the high-bias estimate (a bias of 1.4 percent per year
added to the official growth rate of real wages of 1.4 percent per year), multiplied by an additional factor of 25.3 to
take account of a 1.4 percent bias in the 231 years from 1569 to 1800.

Apparel Prices, Page 5

The Application to Apparel
In setting a research agenda to look for the possibility of negative CPI bias, one
looks first to the three traditional consumer necessities, food, apparel, and shelter;
these are the ʺbig threeʺ items of consumer expenditure and have a sufficient weight to
ʺmatterʺ in arriving at an eventual resolution of the Hulten/Bruegel paradox. While
there might be some long-term bias in the CPI for food, I have sidelined that category to
the back burner for lack of an obvious data source that would incorporate
developments over time in the increased degree of processing of food (canned food,
frozen food, delis in the supermarket, etc.) Instead, the research payoff looks more
promising for the remaining two necessities, apparel and shelter, for two reasons. First,
there is prima-facie evidence, reviewed below for apparel (and equally true for
structures) that raw (non-quality-adjusted) price data for a given type of apparel sold in
mail-order catalogs increase far more over the 1914-93 period than the CPI. Second,
apparel is one of the three main areas where critics have suggested that the CPI may
incorporate a downward bias (the others being housing and autos, see Wynne and
Sigalla 1994, pp. 10-11).
Among the reasons suggested for the downward bias in apparel is the strong
seasonal pattern in clothing styles and prices, leading to possible inaccuracy in linking
prices for old styles sold at low close-out prices with new styles sold at high initial

Apparel Prices, Page 6

prices. In suggesting that ʺstyleʺ goods are a souce of the bias problem, Wynne-Sigalla
cite the difference between the 1967-87 CPI inflation rate of 6.0 percent for ʺinfantsʹ and
ʺtoddlersʹʺ apparel with those for mensʹ and boysʹ apparel (3.4 percent) and womensʹ
and girlsʹ apparel (2.9 percent). A much more comprehensive study of “style” and
“fashion” goods is provided by Pashigian and co-authors (1988, 1991, 1995) and
indicates that seasonal fluctuations in the prices of womens’ apparel are greater than for
mens’ apparel, and that prices of womens’ apparel start high because of uncertainty by
retailers about what styles will be popular and prices later decline as “sales” are
necessary to clear out inventories of unpopular merchandise. Without extreme care in
linking old styles last year to new styles this year, any price index based on linking is
subject to possibly major errors.
Plan of the Paper
Our review of the evidence begins with comparisons over the long 1914-93
period between changes in the CPI and in raw price changes for selected items from the
Sears catalog; the much faster increase in the Sears prices could be reconciled by a rapid
quality change, by an atypical rate of Sears increase relative to economywide apparel
prices, or by a downward bias in the CPI. To address the representativeness of Sears
catalog prices, we then turn to a consideration of advantages and disadvantages of the

Apparel Prices, Page 7

catalog as a data source.
The rest of the paper develops the matched-model (MM) for numerous apparel
product categories and the hedonic index for womensʹ dresses. The MM indexes are
based on more than 10,000 data observations, and the hedonic index on roughly 6,500
observations. The discussion of the MM indexes and a comparison with the CPI is
followed by a detailed presentation of the hedonic results. The case for a downward
bias in the CPI rests primarily on the hedonic regression study of womensʹ dresses,
which exhibits a much faster rate of price increase than either the Sears MM index for
womens’ dresses or the CPI for womensʹ dresses. The negligible rate of quality
improvement for womensʹ dresses is extrapolated to other types of apparel to reach the
general conclusion of downward bias in the CPI not just for womensʹ dresses but for all
apparel.

II. Further Motivation for a Study of Apparel Prices
Between 1914 and 1993 the CPI implies that apparel prices on average rose by a
factor of 7.6 (an average annual growth rate of 2.6 percent per annum). However, a
quick glance at any Sears catalog in the era prior to World War I reveals prices that
seem much too low relative to 1993 to be consistent with the CPI. In 1914 cotton percale
house dresses, trimmed with braid and ruffles, could be purchased fo $0.98 and a taffeta

Apparel Prices, Page 8

silk jacket for $6.75. Menʹs all-wool pants were $1.35, an all-wool suit was $4.50, and an
all-wool overcoat was $7.00.
The impression that the catalog prices have increased far more than the
1993/1914 price ratio of 7.6 for the CPI can be quantified. Taking the median dresses
(ranked from most to least expensive) sold by Sears in 1993 and the median sold in
1914, the 1993/1914 price ratio is 32.7. For the two most expensive dresses in each year
the ratio is 27.4, while for the two least expensive dresses the ratio is 59.5. It might seem
easy to dismiss this discrepancy between the CPI increase and the median increase in
catalog dress prices by arguing that quality has increased commensurately, but in fact
an inspection of the photos and specifications in the catalogs suggests that, if anything,
quality was higher in the earlier era, with higher quality fabrics (silk, cashmere) and
more decorative elements (ruffles, braids, etc.).
Experts at the BLS have long suspected that the CPI for apparel, at least prior to
1988, might incorporate a downward bias.6 Both the CPI and Sears MM indexes may
understate the true rate of quality-adjusted price increase. If our hedonic regression
results consistently display a faster rate of price increase than the MM indexes from the
same catalog data, then this would support the view based on the raw (quality-

Liegey (1993). Recent experiments with hedonic price indexes for apparel are described in Liegey (1994).

unadjusted) comparisons cited above that the CPI may understate secular inflation in
apparel prices, thus helping to explain the Hulten/Bruegel paradox.
Other Aspects of this Research
Part of the goal of this research is to determine if for important product groups
like apparel and shelter that there is any case to be made for a downward bias in the
CPI over any significant period of time. Another goal is simpler and more direct, to
create a complementary study of price changes to that of Rees (1961), who carried out
detailed studies of apparel prices from catalogs as well as for other products (e.g.,
shelter prices from newspaper advertisements). Rees covered the period 1890-1914, that
is, the years between the establishment of the WPI and of the CPI. The coverage in this
paper of apparel prices for the period after 1914 complements the study by Rees and
sheds new light on his results, since his study was based entirely on matched-model
methodology and did not make any use of hedonic regression techniques.
The research in this paper is based on much more evidence on MM indexes than
on hedonic indexes. MM indexes have been created for most types of apparel covered
by the CPI over the entire period 1914-93. Our hedonic study is of necessity limited to
womensʹ dresses, because of inadequate sample sizes for other types of apparel.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Catalog Price Data
In my past work on price measurement (Gordon, 1990), an important
preliminary step has been to discuss advantages and disadvantages of using mail-order
catalogs as a supplementary source of price index numbers to be compared with official
price indexes like the CPI. This comparison of advantages and disadvantages needs to
be put in perspective by two sets of factors. First, for many durable goods examined in
my book (Gordon, 1990), price indexes based on Consumer Reports were so clearly
superior in the extent of industry coverage and attention to the collection of true
transaction prices that, whenever available, Consumer Reports indexes were used in
preference to catalog indexes. For this study of apparel, the first consideration is
irrelevant, since Consumer Reports has never compiled ratings, quality evaluations, or
prices of apparel. Second, the emphasis in this paper is more on differences in
methodology to extract alternative matched model vs. hedonic indexes from the same
data than it is on differences in implied price changes between catalog indexes and the
official CPI. Thus differences in the validity of catalogs vs. the official CPI are less
important. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to review the advantages and disadvantages
of catalog data, especially for this study of apparel that goes back to 1914.

Apparel Prices, Page 11

Advantages of Catalog Price Data
Among the most important advantages of catalog price indexes are the
following:
1. Most important, specifications and illustrations published in catalogs allow
closer control for changes in quality than in the official price indexes. The continuity of
item codes from one catalog to the next is often helpful in following a particular item,
and there is usually a long list of specifications that can be checked to insure that the
models being compared are absolutely identical. In the CPI exact specifications are not
available and accessible over any kind of long historical period. The consistency of
specification listings in catalogs also makes them preferable to newspaper
advertisements as a data source.
2. The matched-model methodology used to compare catalog items over time
insures that price comparisons are included only for items that are absolutely identical
in every dimension reported in the catalog specification. In contrast, since 1978 the CPI
has not been based on published specifications, and even before 1978 — the time
period most relevant for this study — the CPI made direct comparisons between
nonidentical goods if both fell within the same specification description.7

7. This statement about the CPI comes from Rees (1961b), who states "the BLS makes direct comparisons
between nonidentical goods if both fall within the same specification." Triplett (1971, p. 186, Table 6.1) quotes a
study showing that for nonfood items in the CPI in April, 1966, more than half of all product substitutions were

Apparel Prices, Page 12

3. Related to the first two advantages is the fact that catalog price indexes can in
principle be replicated by anyone with access to a library containing historical catalog
volumes. In contrast, there is no way that CPI indexes at either the lower or upper level
can be replicated by anyone except BLS employees. As a practical matter, for historical
periods several decades in the past, original source data for the CPI may not be
available at all.
4. The selection of products and individual models sold in catalogs responds
automatically to the needs of the marketplace. It has always been true that ʺspace to
items always having been allotted on the basis of salesʺ (Hendrickson 1979, p. 249).
This gives catalog price indexes two inherent advantages over the CPI, especially prior
to the introduction of the current CPI sampling framework in 1978. First, for products
sold in a large number of models or varieties, ʺit seems reasonable to assume that the
number of different detailed varieties in the catalog will be greatest where the volume
of sales is greatest, so that we probably weight the major varieties of an item in rough
proportion to their importanceʺ (Ress, 1961b, p. 141). There is no such assurance that
product indexes are sales weighted across models within a product cateogry in the CPI,
at least prior to 1978.

handled by direct comparison of prices of the old and new model, and well under one percent were handled by an
"explicit size or quality adjustment."

Apparel Prices, Page 13

Also, products tend to be introduced into the catalogs soon after they become
marketable, in contrast to the CPI which often has introduced new products many years
after they become commercially important. This factor, which is crucial for durable
goods like room air conditioners (introduced into the Sears catalog in 1952 but not in the
CPI until 1964), is presumably less important for apparel. Prior to 1978 the CPI adhered
to fixed specifications over a long period of time, which could lead to a disproportionate
weight for obsolete items.8
5. Prices printed in the catalogs are actual transaction prices. If retail and
wholesale outlets that compete with catalog firms price items at varying discounts,
catalog houses must adjust their published prices to remain competitive (occasionally in
the past few decades speciality catalogs for particular products advertising sale prices
would be mailed between the issuance of the bi-annual catalogs — since these interim
sale catalogs are not collected by libraries, we cannot use them in this research).
6. Since postage and shipping costs, credit charges, and taxes (except for Federal
excise taxes when applicable) are not included in the published catalog prices, the
services provided with each item are held constant. In contrast, the CPI may reflect a
8. As reported by Rees (1961b, pp. 141-2), " . . . it seems probable to us that the selection of specified-in-detail
items for the CPI is often at too low a quality level for the index population, probably because the index population
moved up to better qualities after the item was specified. In a number of cases were were unable to find any variety
of an item in the catalogs . . . whose quality was as low as that specified by the BLS." Rees further reports (p. 142)
that rigid adherence to BLS specifications would require excluding a large fraction of the observations that can be
collected from the catalogs, in one case reducing the sample by a factor of ten.

Apparel Prices, Page 14

changing mix of services (e.g., some full-service department stores eliminated free
delivery in the 1970s under pressure from discount-store competition). CPI and catalog
indexes can differ due to the inclusion in the CPI of state and local sales taxes.
Disadvantages of Catalog Price Data
The case against catalog price indexes takes two forms. First, there are clear
disadvantages of relying on catalogs. Second, criticisms can be offered of the
advantages listed above.
1. The most serious problem in the use of catalog prices is the possibility of a
systematic difference in the secular growth rates of the same product sold by catalog
and non-catalog outlets, due, for instance, to differential growth in the efficiency of
catalog operations or changes in pricing policies. Regarding efficiency, for any
comparison with the CPI catalog prices include payment for warehouse and
distribution sevices and would have a slower secular rate of increase than prices of
retail competitors if the growth of efficiency in the provision of these services by catalog
houses had been relatively rapid compared to the services provided by retail stores. It
is hard to believe that such a bias could be important, since innovations in warehouse
technology are likely to have been adopted by non-catalog competitors, and indeed
Wal-Mart has outpaced Sears in warehouse and distribution efficiency over the past

Apparel Prices, Page 15

several decades.
In fact it seems to be the catalog merchants who were more efficient than
standard retailers in the early decades of the twentieth century and less efficient in the
later decades. Model-by-model price comparisons for consumer appliances in my book
(Gordon, 1990, pp. 422-23) between the Sears catalog and Consumer Reports indicated
that the catalog models tended to be at the lower end of the price range in the early
postwar period but drifted toward the middle of the price range over time. Such
behavior is consistent with a change in pricing strategy by Sears in the late 1960s and
early 1970s (ʺweʹre selling last yearʹs goods at next yearʹs pricesʺ). This evidence, if
applicable to apparel as well as to consumer appliances, would predict that Sears
catalog price indexes for apparel would drift upwards relative to the ʺtrueʺ universe of
prices that should be compared with the CPI. Any difference between the
representativeness of the Sears data and the CPI is, of course, not relevant to our
comparison of MM and hedonic indexes for womensʹ dresses, which is based on an
identical data base from the Sears catalog.
Another criticism of the preceding section on advantages of catalog price indexes
concerns reproducability, where we need to distinguish two issues. First, an
unambiguous advantage of a catalog pirce index is that in principle it can reproduced by
anyone with access to the same cataloguies. Second, we would not claim that any such

Apparel Prices, Page 16

reproduction would necessarily yield an identical index, because subjective decisions
must inevitably be made in situations where models change without an overlap period,
or when only a subset of available information is used in order to economize on
research time. The methods used to develop the catalog indexes were, however,
designed to minimize subjective decisions, since the actual data collection was carried
out by a succession of research assistants.
Weighing the Advantages and Disadvantages
In the goal of finding alternative sources of price data to compare with official
price indexes, particularly for earlier decades when the official methodology was not as
refined as it is today, catalog price indexes are no panacea. Even if catalog prices are
fully corrected for quality change, they may not accurately reflect the unobserved true
quality-corrected price index for all suppliers, because of differences between catalog
firms and all firms in the gorwth of efficiency or in the evolution of pricing policies. In
comparisons of catalog prices with the CPI for apparel, there is the problem that the
selection of models or types of apparel sold through catalogs may be different from
those sold by other outlets, e.g., if catalogs typically sell more items which are small or
lightweight in order to minimize shipping costs. We might also expect that the product
mix sold in catalogs would be more heavily wegihted to standard utilitarian items and

Apparel Prices, Page 17

less heavily to fashion goods. This difference could make the catalog indexes behave
differently than the closest comparable CPI strata indexes, although there is no
presumption for the direction of the drift.
Further, catalog prices may not adequately control for all types of quality change.
Some changes may be introduced without being explicitly acknoweldged in the printed
catalog descriptions. Indeed, catalog indexes based on the matched-model method are
as vulnerable as the CPI to deleting price change that occurs when new models are
introduced. Matched model indexes based on catalog prices or in the CPI may be
biassed downward if the timing of price increases typically coincides with the
introduction of new models (in the apparel case) or biassed upward if improvements in
performance-price ratios coincide with the introduction of new models (as for
computers and other electronic goods).

III. The Methodology of The Matched-Model Research
A close analogue to this study is the catalog price index for 36 clothing items
developed by Rees (1961a) for the period 1890-1914. Rees’s study differs from the
approach taken here, not only that he was comparing with the WPI since the CPI did
not yet exist, but also in that he did not attempt to match catalog price indexes with WPI
indexes on an item-by-item basis, but rather used catalog prices and expenditure survey

Apparel Prices, Page 18

weights to construct a completely new index that might be compared with the overall
WPI for clothing and for home furnishings. Because Rees made no attempt to compare
identical items, his index might differ from the WPI due to a different selection of items
and the earlier introduction of new items. In contrast, the drift in the catalog/CPI ratios
recorded in this paper relates to identical items within the limits of feasibility in
matching catalog products with CPI strata indexes for apparel.
For any given investment of research resources, there is a trade-off between the
number of different catalogs consulted for a given product and the numer of separate
products that can be included. An initial decision (in Gordon, 1990, and carried over to
this paper) was made to limit this study only to Sears, the largest catalog house, and
thus to allow time to copy data for additional varieties and products. This procedure is
supported by Rees’ conclusion (1961b) that the Sears and Wards catalogs gave similar
results in his research. Sears’ catalog sales in the 1970’s were triple Wards’ and equal to
Wards’ sales and the sales of the next three catalogs combined. To allow time to copy
prices for more products, prices were copied only from one catalog per year (springsummer), even though two catalogs were published annually. This decision has the
disadvantage that the resulting indexes may understate the degree of short-run
flexibility in the catalog prices.

Apparel Prices, Page 19

Timing
Since the primary purpose of this study is a comparison of the catalog prices
with CPI indexes for the same apparel products and time periods, a decision was
required on the choice of time periods for that comparison. The catalog data in this
study were collected from the Chicago-area edition of the Sears, Roebuck springsummer general catalog. According to a Sears official, however, prices are set long in
advance of catalog distribution. Since the spring-summer catalog went to press in
October of the previous year, and final price decisions were made in October, the most
closely comparable CPI indexes would be those for October of the year previous to the
date printed on the catalog. However, another interpretation is that the correct BLS
index is that of the following spring, contemporaneous with the period during which
the catalog prices are in effect, because aspects of Sears’ pricing strategy were forward
looking. For instance, in some past periods, Sears purchased futures in goods like
cotton and rubber to cover anticipated sales in the following six months. They also
owned parts of corporations supplying them with products and arranged to buy
forward at a price established for conditions of the following six months.
While in some early stages of the research on the 1990 book, BLS prices in year
t-1 were compared with prices in the spring-summer catalog for year t , in the end, both
were compared in year t. It might have been preferable to use monthly BLS indexes for,

Apparel Prices, Page 20

say, September or October of the year prior to the date on the catalog, but monthly data
for BLS commodity indexes were not as complete as for annual data. This choice to
adopt contemporaneous pricing is made partly because it is probably more accurate
and also to simplify the presentation of the results. Slight inaccuracies may be
introduced on the timing of major cyclical movements in prices, such as those in the
Great Depression, but there is unlikely to be any effect on the measured rate of change
of the Sears/CPI ratios over periods of a decade or more.

IV. Matched-Model Catalog Indexes for Apparel, 1914-93
Which products are chosen for study? For the apparel matched-model (MM)
indexes the approach is straightforward. Historical CPI strata indexes are available for
broad groupings, e.g., “women’s separates and sportswear.” We turned to the Sears
catalog and selected virtually every category of apparel that corresponded to each CPI
stratum description. Table 1 lists the 39 separate apparel categories for which Sears
catalog matched-model indexes were constructed, the average number of annual price
comparisons carried out for each category, and the CPI strata with which groups of
categories were compared. The table is divided into three sections, corresponding to
the three intervals of the 1914-93 period for which research was carried out at separate
stages.

Method of Comparison
Price comparisons for each pair of years are facilitated by Sears’ policy of
carrying several models in each product category. Changes in specifications usually
affect only a subset of models in any one year, so for almost every product at least a few
identical models are available for a price comparison between a pair of years. Because
model changes occur at irregular intervals, the number of price comparisons of identical
models for any given product may be on the order of seven for a series of years and
then collapse to two or three in a year of substantial model changes. Price changes for
models that are discontinued, newly introduced, or subject to quality change are
imputed to the price changes of models that remain completely unchanged in a given
comparison of prices in years t and t-1. In the subsequent comparison of prices in t+1
and t+2, a different set of models is covered, perhaps including one or more models
newly introduced in year t+1 and excluded in the previous comparison of t with t+1.
Thus each pair of years is treated separately and the list of models is allowed to
change annually. This approach allows much more frequent model changes than in the
CPI as it was constructed prior to 1978, when CPI field agents were required to find
prices for models according to a detailed description that might well have become
obsolete. Extra models can be included that appear and disappear between major CPI
revisions. Ideally, this approach should lead to the inclusion of more models per

Apparel Prices, Page 22

product than in the CPI.
The matched model indexes were developed by comparing all identical models
in every pair of adjacent years. For a comparison to be made, the adjacent-year
observations had to have the same serial number (subject to qualifications below), the
photo or drawing depicting the model must have been identical, and the description of
the model must have been identical. Identical catalog numbers do not always ensure
that two models are identical, just as dissimilar catalog numbers do not necessarily
signify differences between models. Therefore the determining criterion for the direct
comparison of models relied heavily on the match of product descriptions.
Nevertheless, the model numbers are very useful for quickly spotting models that are
likely to be identical or for spotting changes in characteristics in the set of models
available for two adjacent years.
Figure 1 presents a schematic diagram of the method of matching models for the
important example of womensʹ dresses. This method was carried out not only for
womensʹ dresses but for all apparel types in developing all the indexes reported in
Tables 2 through 7 of the paper. The criteria for matching are very tight and the
resulting MM price indexes are surely representative of apparel ʺmodelsʺ that have
almost exactly the same quality. The defect of the MM method is that these tight criteria
often exclude models which change in minor ways but for which prices increase much

Apparel Prices, Page 23

more than for the models that are matched. The irony of the MM method is that it can
control completely for changes in quality without providing an accurate measure of
changes in price, a phenomenon that only becomes evident when comparing the MM
indexes with hedonic indexes for the same products.
The lowest-level observation for the catalog matched-model price indexes is the
log change in price between two adjacent years for a given model that has been
determined by the above process to have remained identical across the two years. Then
these price changes are aggregated. Log price changes (e.g., for an identical dress in
two adjacent years) are aggregated into log product price changes for a product
category (e.g., ʺwomensʹ dressesʺ) by applying an equal weight to each model in any
given pair of adjacent years. The absence of model-by-model sales data necessitates the
use of equal weights for each model of a given product. Some response to market sales
is incorporated to the extent that the mix of models that Sears carries for a given
product responds to the relative volume of sales.
Product price changes are aggregated into subgroup price indexes, where the
subgroup refers to the lowest level of aggregation available in the CPI. Equal weights
are applied to each product in forming subgroup price indexes. Then subgroup price
indexes are aggregated into groups and totals, using the apprropriate CPI weights for
each subgroup. The indexes created in this paper have the advantage that they are

Apparel Prices, Page 24

open to public inspection and can be reproduced by anyone with access to a library that
holds back issues of the Sears catalog. As stated above, the catalog indexes are subject
to the same problem as any MM index, including those compiled by BLS. Any price
change that occurs upon the introduction of a new model is deleted. If manufacturers
typically postpone price increases during the life of a model for the occasion of a new
model introduction, then deletion causes the exclusion of major price changes and leads
to a downward secular bias in price indexes. If, on the other hand, quality
improvements in new models tend to be introduced with no change in price, the
deletion technique causes the exclusion of reductions in “true price” and leads to an
upward secular bias. We learn subsequently in the comparisons of the hedonic and
MM indexes for womensʹ dresses that the former phenomenon dominates and causes a
significant downward bias. As we will point out below in discussing the hedonic index
for womensʹ dresses, a striking aspect of the MM indexes is that they are based on so few
observations. In contrast, for many pairs of years the hedonic sample size is more than
300, or more than 150 observations per year for just a single product. This reflects the
tightness of the matching criterion used in developing the MM indexes, i.e., how hard it
is to find exactly the same item in the catalogs for two successive years.
The new MM price indexes for apparel cover 39 types of womensʹ, mensʹ, girls’
and boys’ apparel over part or all of the period 1914-93, covering the years from the

Apparel Prices, Page 25

beginning of the CPI in 1914 to the date when Sears discontinued publication of its
general catalog in 1993. Details on the types of apparel are shown separately for 191447, 1947-65, and 1965-93 in Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C. The sum of matched-model
comparisons in these tables is 10,385, an average of 52 per year during 1914-47 (for a
total of 1,719), an average of 146 per year during 1947-65 (for a total of 4,432), and 151
per year during 1965-93 (for a total of 4,234).
Matched-Model Results, 1914-47
For the 1914-47 period the matched-model indexes cover 37 types of womensʹ
and mensʹ apparel, as shown in Table 1A. There are an average of 1.5 model
comparisons each year for each of the 37 product groups. Separate catalog price
indexes and comparisons with the CPI are displayed in Tables 2 and 3 for womensʹ and
mensʹ apparel; the comparison for each is with the total CPI apparel index before 1935,
since the CPI began to break out separate aggregates for womensʹ and mensʹ apparel
only in that year. Figures 2 and 3 plot the numbers listed in Tables 2 and 3.
As shown in Table 8, for womensʹ apparel the 1914-47 annual growth rate of the
Sears matched model index is 1.68 percent per year, considerably slower than the CPI
increase of 2.87 percent per year, implying growth rate of the Sears/CPI ratio of -1.19
percent per year. The difference is similar for mensʹ apparel, 1.74 percent per year for

Apparel Prices, Page 26

Sears vs. 3.10 percent for the CPI, implying a growth rate of the Sears/CPI ratio of -1.36
percent per year.
A striking aspect of the results is that much of the decline in the Sears/CPI ratio
occurs during a single pair of years, 1934-35; this is particularly evident in Figure 5,
which plots the Sears/CPI ratios. The most obvious explanation would be a major
mistake in transcribing the Sears prices, so we have double-checked and triple-checked
the 1934-35 comparisons. Here are some sample prices for this pair of years for
particular closing items classified as identical by our matched-model procedure:

Mensʹ Suits
Mensʹ Union Suits
Mensʹ work socks
Mensʹ wool pants
Mensʹ ʺChieftanʺ overalls
Womensʹ silk slips
Womensʹ cotton hosiery
Womensʹ washfast house dresses
Womensʹ rayon glovers
Womensʹ rayon pajamas

It is possible that Sears changed its pricing policy relative to the rest of the marketplace
in 1935, but it is also possible that the CPI missed a shift in the availability of discount
outlets during the Great Depression — perhaps an early example of ʺoutlet substitution
bias.ʺ

Apparel Prices, Page 27

Matched Model Results, 1947-93
Tables 2 and 3 provide postwar data on the Sears MM indexes and a comparison
with the CPI for womensʹ and mensʹ apparel, and Tables 4 and 5 cover girlsʹ and boysʹ
apparel. Table 8 provides a summary of growth rates of the Sears and CPI indexes over
the entire 1947-93 period and various subperiods. Several patterns can be picked up
from the results. First, there is a consistent downward drift in the Sears/CPI ratio for
womensʹ apparel in all periods but the last, 1978-93. Second, there is a distinct
turnaround in the drift of the Sears/CPI ratio for mensʹ apparel from negative over 191465 to positive during 1965-93, with a small overall negative drift over the entire period.
Third, there is a consistent tendency for the inflation rate in womenʹs apparel to be a
smaller positive rate or larger negative rate than for mensʹ apparel, and this difference is
more pronounced for the Sears indexes than for the CPI. This finding is consistent with
the view that matched-model indexes ʺlink outʺ more quality change for womensʹ
apparel which are subject to more frequent changes in styles. Averaging together
womensʹ and mensʹ apparel for 1914-93 with girlsʹ and boysʹ apparel for 1978-93, the
Sears indexes increase less than the CPI during 1914-78 and by more during 1978-93,
and the overall drift in the Sears/CPI ratio for the entire period is roughly -1.0 percent
per year. The annual data presented in Tables 2, 3, 6, and 7 are also displayed in
Figures 2-5.

V. Hedonic Price Indexes for Womensʹ Dresses
This section discusses the application of standard hedonic regression techniques
to apparel. In this study we have chosen to do an intensive investigation of a single
type of apparel, womensʹ dresses, because the available data allows much larger sample
sizes in the regressions than for any other apparel product. The choice of variables is
limited to those provided in the catalogs, which differ from year to year. Womensʹ
dresses are complex products and many of their features are visible only in photos (e.g.,
decorative items, pockets, belts, etc.). Thus the large data set used in this hedonic
regression study was custom-built by several research assistants who examined the
photos as well as the detailed specifications as published in the catalog to assign values
to the quality characteristics entered into the regressions.9
Determination of Explanatory Variables and their Mean Values
The list of variables is displayed in Table 9. Of these the most important is
weight, which proxies the quality of fabric, amount of fabric, complexity of
construction, presence of linings, etc., and would be expected to have a positive
coefficient. In addition several dummy variables are included to indicate the presence

9. I am particularly grateful to Jayun Kim for her understanding of the nuances of womens’
dresses and acknowledge that she designed the final form of the hedonic project, including the
choice of the quality characteristics and their description.

Apparel Prices, Page 29

or absence of higher-quality ʺorganicʺ fabrics, knit or woven fabrics, and other quality
characteristics which should raise price and thus have a positive coefficient in the
regressions, including the presence of lace, sequins, embroidery, belt, jacket, bow, tie,
zipper, and the need for dry cleaning. There is also a dummy variable for imported
dresses, when they are identified as such in the catalog, and no presumption whether
the coefficient should be positive or negative.
The hedonic regression study for womensʹ dresses is carried out for 60 of the 79
possible pairs of adjacent years between 1914 and 1993. The exceptions are the years of
rapid inflation during World War I and its aftermath (1915-1920 are excluded), the years
of World War II price controls (1942-45 are excluded), and the years when the catalog
for unknown reasons temporarily suspended publication of weight data for each item
(1929-33). For a subset of fifteen of the included years Table 10 displays the number of
observations in that particular year, the average weight, and the percentage of dresses
having the various quality attributes designated by the zero, one dummy variables.
The sample sizes for the hedonic study of womensʹ dresses are much larger than
the sample on which the matched model indexes for dresses is based (only 0.9 matches
during 1914-47 and only 3.3 matches during 1965-93). The number of observations
shown in Table 9 are as high as 183 per year for 1936 and as low as 42 per year for 1980.
The number of observations diminishes markedly after 1988, and for this reason the

Apparel Prices, Page 30

hedonic study terminates in 1988 rather than 1993.
Table 10 exhibits the mean values of price and weight through 1993 and of the
other explanatory variables through 1988. The mean price jumps around from year to
year but on average in 1993 was 13.3 times the average in 1914 ($63.52 versus $4.75).
Recall above that the ratio for the median price was 32.7, indicating that the mean of the
1914 distribution was skewed upward by relatively expensive dresses. The mean value
of weight was by coincidence almost exactly the same in 1914 and 1993 at about 1.5
pounds, but there were “long waves” in the behavior of the mean weight. During the
entire 1928-48 period, weight was at 3.0 pounds or higher, and weight fell to as low as
0.9 pounds in 1983-84. A ten-year moving average of the mean weight from the hedonic
sample is displayed in Figure 6. To the extent that weight is the most important
explanatory variable and contributes positively to quality, then there was no net change
in quality between 1914 and 1993, and substantial fluctuations in quality in the
intervening years.
For the other quality variables as summarized in Table 10, a surprise is the lack
of consistent trends. In the early years (1914-30) Sears sold numerous elaborate dresses
made of silk and/or velvet, and this shows up in the relatively high value of the
“Organic” variable in Table 10. Similarly, through 1940 there were relatively large
values for the “LSE” (lace, sequins, embroidery) variable. The mix of dresses then shifts

Apparel Prices, Page 31

in the postwar period to a very large fraction of knit and/or woven (KWV). A peculiar
aspect of Table 9 is that the “DRY” (dry-cleaning) variable was at a high value between
the late 1940s and mid 1970s and then dropped off to almost nothing. This could
indicate a change in the catalog policy of explicitly listing the need for dry cleaning.
Hedonic Regression Results
There is always a tradeoff between two extremes in running hedonic price
regressions on a long time-series of data. One extreme would be to run separate
regressions on every pair of years. This has the advantage of allowing the regression
coefficients on characteristics like weight to shift as market and production conditions
change, and the disadvantage that it minimizes sample size. The opposite extreme
would be to run a single regression on all the data for all the years. This has the
advantage of maximizing sample size and the disadvantage that it forces coefficients on
characteristics to remain the same over a sample period of 79 years.
In the case of apparel, there is the additional consideration that fabrics changed
over time — silk disappeared and synthetics appeared, and so an approach that allowed
for changing coefficients seemed essential. There were sufficient data to base the
estimated coefficients on each successive pair of years, an abundance of data that
allowed us to escape the many compromises required in a previous study of mainframe
computers (Gordon, 1989, 1990). Looking at the regression coefficients as displayed in

Apparel Prices, Page 32

Table 11, those on weight are almost always highly significant, with an average
estimated elasticity of 0.71. The weight , with much higher estimated elasticities in the
1928-48 period (1.0 or above) and lower at the beginning and end. Several of the other
quality variables are highly significant with the expected positive coefficient and a
plausible magnitude of coefficients, particularly the “organic fabric” variable, as well as
the “LSE” (lace-sequins-embroidery) and “DRY” (dry cleaning) variables.
The implied hedonic price index for womensʹ dresses is compared with the CPI
for womens’ dresses and the Sears MM index for womens’ dresses. These are displayed
in Table 12 and in Figures 7 and 8, along with the median price and the implicit hedonic
quality index (i.e., median price divided by the hedonic price index). Table 13
summarizes the growth rates of these five indexes for womensʹ dresses over key
intervals. Except for the negligible difference during 1914-47, the huge positive
differences between the annual growth rates of the hedonic and MM indexes for
womens’ dresses from absolutely the same data set are remarkable. The introduction of
this paper provided a context for the “Hulten-Bruegel” paradox based on long-term
annual rates of bias of 0.5 or 1.5 percent. Here we have a long-term difference in the
Sears hedonic vs. MM index of 2.90 percent per year.
An important aspect of these results is that the Sears/MM difference in growth
rates is so much larger in the postwar era than between 1914 and 1947. While this is a

Apparel Prices, Page 33

puzzle, it may be related to the very different quality of dresses sold by Sears in the
early part of the sample period, silk and velvet during 1914-30 compared to pedestrian
working-class dresses in the later parts of the sample, e.g., 1975-93. A paradox that is
not resolved by this paper is that the hedonic/MM difference increases in annual growth
rates in the later years of the postwar just when Sears is becoming more “pedestrian”
and “less fashionable.”
A Closer Look at Particular Pairs of Years
Are any generalizations possible about the periods when the Sears hedonic price
increased so much more than the Sears MM index? To answer this question a closer
look was taken at three pairs of adjacent years with the greatest difference in growth
rates between the two price indexes; as shown in the first three columns of Table 14,
these were 1972-73, 1978-79, and 1982-83. The fourth column looks at the five-year
interval (1978-83) that had the greatest discrepancy. For contrast three other pairs of
years were chosen with only negligible differences between the growth rates of the two
indexes; these pairs (1960-61, 1966-67, and 1977-78) are displayed in the three right-hand
columns of Table 14.
The first three lines of Table 14 records the annual growth rates of the two price
indexes in each pair of years. The greatest difference was in 1982-83, with a 30 percent
increase in the hedonic index versus zero for the MM index. The next greatest

Apparel Prices, Page 34

difference was in 1978-79, with respective increases of 27.2 and 4.5 percent. We note
from Table 11 that the hedonic regressions for 1978-79 and 1982-83 were based on 116
and 170 observations, respectively, whereas the MM indexes are based on only four
observations in each year-pair. Even this small number of comparisons overstates the
representativeness of the MM index, since in 1978-79 the “two” models in each year are
actually a single dress, with the two models differing only as to whether they are
available in half-sizes (with a slightly higher price).
The remaining lines of Table 4 stratify the dresses in the hedonic sample in each
year by weight. The top section shows raw price change in each weight quartile in each
pair of years; this number was obtained by regressing the price on a constant and a
dummy variable for the second year in each pair. The second section shows the
coefficient on a time dummy in hedonic regressions run separately for each weight
quartile. Because the sample sizes were smaller by a factor of four, degrees of freedom
were economized by deleting any quality variable (among those listed in Table 8) which
was not significant in a particular regression at the 10 percent level. The third section
subtracts the numbers in each cell in the second section (hedonic price change) from the
corresponding cell in the first section (raw price change), resulting in the change in the
implicit hedonic quality index. For instance, in the second column for 1978-79, the raw
price change is 34 percent, the hedonic price change is 29 percent, and the implicit

Apparel Prices, Page 35

improvement in quality is 5 percent.
In the first four columns there is a consistent pattern that the lighter dresses (first
two weight quartiles) exhibit a substantially faster rate of raw price change and hedonic
price change than the two heavier quartiles, especially the heaviest. There was no such
difference across the lower two and higher two weight quartiles in the final three
columns, showing three pairs of adjacent years when the hedonic and MM price
indexes increased by about the same amount. Given the large samples in the hedonic
regressions, this result is consistent with the hypothesis that the MM technique, with its
sample sizes that of necessity are severely truncated, misses large price increases
associated with model changes. Looking at the bottom section of Table 14, there does
not appear to be any significant tendency for lighter dresses to decline in quality
relative to the heavier dresses. In several columns, the change in quality across weight
quartiles has a zig-zag pattern, alternating between positive and negative.
Several other experiments were run on the data for these pairs of years. Each of
the subset of significant quality variables was interacted with the year dummy to look
for changes in the coefficients of quality characteristics over time. However, none of
these interaction terms was significant at the 10 percent level. The absence of time
interaction effects, and the stability of the subset of coefficients which are significant in
Table 11, attests to the robustness of the hedonic regression results. Another

Apparel Prices, Page 36

experiment was to stratify the sample for these years by the DRY variable (0 or 1
depending on the need for dry cleaning), but price changes in this stratification
appeared to differ randomly across the DRY=0 and DRY=1 subsets of the sample. The
last experiment was to identify subsets of dresses with identical quality characteristics
across two adjacent years. This amounts to trying to “mimic” the MM technique within
the subset of variables available for the hedonic regression, without requiring (as does
the MM technique) that the models are absolutely identical. The result is that within
these constant-quality subsets, price increases in adjacent-year pairs were mostly higher
rather than lower than the basic hedonic time coefficient in those same year-pairs.
As a last step to understand the phenomenon of rapid price increases in the
hedonic regressions for these pairs of years, I visited the pair of microfilm machines
displaying the 1978 and 1979 Sears catalogs (after years of relying on research assistants
to collect the data). I checked the MM models to make sure they were identical, and
they were in both the photo, the available colors, and the specifications:
“Fabric: polyester-cotton blend. Tuck-stitching at sides, front placket
opening, pointed colar, should yoke in front, yoke and shirring in back,
one side-seam pocket, short sleeves, self-tie belt.”
This standard dress in standard sizes increased in price from $11.44 to $11.99, and in
available half sizes increased from $12.44 to $12.99. These price increases calculated in

Apparel Prices, Page 37

logs are 4.7 and 4.3 percent, respectively, yielding the 4.5 percent increase in the MM
index shown in Table 14, line 2, for 1978-79.
Then I looked for 1979 dresses that were “closely comparable” to their 1978
counterparts, and it immediately became apparent why the sample sizes in the MM
indexes are so small. I found a poly-rayon blend “cap-sleeve” one-piece dress in 1978
that in its photo looked just like a cap-sleeve one-piece dress in 1979. But upon closer
inspection of the specifications, they weren’t identical at all. The 1979 dress was polycotton rather than poly-rayon, its weight was 13 oz instead of 9 oz, it had no collar
instead of a pointed collar, and it had one pocket instead of two (the price increased
from $18 to $25). A two-piece dress comparison was more promising, since both the
1978 and 1979 version had a poly-cotton fabric. Both had a pointed collar, placket
opening, and a skirt with a “slightly flared style.” However, the 1978 dress had a zipper
in back while the 1979 style was “pullover,”, the 1979 dress had an elastic waistband
that was not mentioned in 1978, and the 1978 dress had “attached tabs with D-ring
closure” that was not mentioned in 1979. Despite a decline in weight from 15 to 10 oz,
the price went up from $20 to $24. Similarly, a floral print one-piece dress increased in
weight from 6 to 7 oz but increased in price from $19 to $27. Again, they looked similar
in photos but upon closer inspection one had a square neck, the other a “band
neckline,” one had 3/4 length sleeves, the other elbow-length sleeves, and the 1979 skirt

Apparel Prices, Page 38

was “three-tiered.”
Overall, the mind boggles at the difference between price research on womens’
dresses and on the many types of durable goods studied in my previous book (Gordon,
1990). In durable goods quality improves steadily, if not from year to year then from
decade to decade. Engines become more powerful, quieter, and more fuel efficient.
Electric and electronic products become more capable at the same time as they become
smaller. The difference with womens’ dresses could not be more profound. The many
small changes from year to year in womens’ dresses that prevent a researcher from
“matching a model” do not correspond to our standard notions of “quality.” A pocket
is moved from the top to the side, a zipper is replaced by buttons or vice-versa, a square
neck is replaced by a scooped neck. Immersion in the catalogs for a year-pair like 197879 leaves the overwhelming impression that the isolated model that was “matched” was
actually a freak, and that the large sample of dresses with as many as ten dimensions of
quality controlled, make the hedonic regression results greatly superior to the MM
indexes.
Many types of apparel, from mens’ suits to work clothes to underwear to
childrens’ clothes, exhibit far fewer dimensions of style change than womens’ dresses.
But our overall finding of minimal quality change between 1914-93 should carry over to
these apparel products as well, if there is any communality of production techniques

Apparel Prices, Page 39

used across different types of apparel. One may speculate that an index of the raw price
change for the Sears sample of these more homogeneous types of apparel would be
closer to the truth than the corresponding MM indexes displayed in Tables 2 through 7
above.

V. Conclusion
This paper develops new price indexes for apparel based on data from the Sears
catalog for the entire period 1914-93, beginning in the first year of the CPI and ending in
the last year of the general Sears catalog. The research, which is based on roughly
10,000 exact comparisons for the matched model(MM) index and another 6500
observations on the prices and quality characteristics of womensʹ dresses, leads to
several conclusions and numerous questions for further research.
The Sears matched-model indexes do not exhibit a consistent negative or positive
drift relative to the CPI. For womensʹ apparel the drift is always negative but for mensʹ
apparel there is a turnaround, from negative before 1965 to positive thereafter. Both the
matched-model indexes and the CPI rise less rapidly for womensʹ apparel than for
mensʹ apparel, which would be consistent with the hypothesis that price changes
accompanying model changes are more frequent for womensʹ apparel, since models
change more frequently.

Apparel Prices, Page 40

The hedonic price index for womensʹ dresses increases much faster than the
matched-model index from the same data over the entire postwar period, although not
in the earlier 1914-47 period. Likewise, the hedonic index also increases faster than the
CPI over the entire postwar period but also not during 1914-47 (when the CPI-hedonic
difference is a relatively minor 0.65 percent per year). To the extent that the Sears
hedonic and matched model indexes are based on the same data, so that systematic
differences between catalog market shares and pricing policies are not relevant, the
results provided here offer a nice complement to past research on computer prices,
which also found that price changes were contemporaneous with model changes. Just
as hedonic price indexes for computers almost always drop faster than matched-model
indexes for computers, we have found the opposite relationship for apparel prices,
presumably for the same reason.
Despite the large amount of data examined in this paper, it leaves open the
answer to the basic question that motivated the research – what is the overall bias in the
CPI for apparel from 1914 to 1993? One answer is a downward bias of 1.28 percent per
year, the difference between the CPI and hedonic indexes for womens’ dresses over the
1914-88 period for which the hedonic index was compiled. As shown in Table 13, the
figure of 1.28 is misleading, since the difference was actually in the opposite direction
before 1947, and the 1947-88 difference implies a much higher downward bias of -2.83

Apparel Prices, Page 41

percent per year for that period.
In extrapolating this difference from womens’ dresses sold by Sears to all apparel
sold by all retail outlets, two factors suggest scaling down the -2.83 difference for the
postwar period to a smaller number, say -1.5 percent. First, as discussed above the
market position changed over the years from the lowest-priced vendor to somewhere in
the middle. The fact that the catalog was eventually shut down in 1993 suggests the
growing importance of lower-priced merchants like Target and Wal-Mart. Second, the
underlying diagnosis of the MM-hedonic price difference as being due to frequent style
changes would apply less to mens’ and childrens’ apparel than to womens’ dresses,
suggesting the the CPI may have done a better job in these other categories. However,
the annual rate of increase in the CPI for mens’ apparel over the 1947-93 period was
only 0.57 percent per year faster than that for womens’ apparel, indicating that the
style-fashion source of bias for womens’ vs. mens’ apparel is only a fraction of the
overall difference between the CPI for womens’ dresses and Sears hedonic for womens’
dresses established in this paper. Our final conclusion that the downward bias in the
CPI for the postwar period, at least through 1988, is roughly in the range of -1.5 to -2.0
percent, with no evidence of bias in the 1914-47 period.
The implications of this paper go beyond the limited empirical application of
Sears catalog data for womens’ dresses. Perhaps the most important conclusion of this

Apparel Prices, Page 42

paper is one that economizes enormously on future research resources. Quality change
in womens’ dresses over the full 1914-93 period was negligible. If this can be extended
to other types of apparel, this creates an radical breakthrough for historical research.
However sophisticated the modern CPI in measuring price changes for apparel in the
21st century, significant information may be contained in raw price changes of
individual apparel products for most of the 20th century.
