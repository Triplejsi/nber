The Marginal Product of Capital

ABSTRACT

Whether or not the marginal product of capital (MPK) differs across countries is a question that
keeps coming up in discussions of comparative economic development and patterns of capital flows.
Attempts to provide an empirical answer to this question have so far been mostly indirect and based
on heroic assumptions. The first contribution of this paper is to present new estimates of the crosscountry dispersion of marginal products. We find that the MPK is much higher on average in poor
countries. However, the financial rate of return from investing in physical capital is not much higher
in poor countries, so heterogeneity in MPKs is not principally due to financial market frictions.
Instead, the main culprit is the relatively high cost of investment goods in developing countries. One
implication of our findings is that increased aid flows to developing countries will not significantly
increase these countries' incomes.

Introduction

Is the world’s capital stock efficiently allocated across countries? If so, then all countries
have roughly the same aggregate marginal product of capital (M P K). If not, the M P K
will vary substantially from country to country. In the latter case, the world foregoes
an opportunity to increase global GDP by reallocating capital from low to high M P K
countries. The policy implications are far reaching.
Given the enormous cross-country differences in observed capital-labor ratios
(they vary by a factor of 100 in the data used in this paper) it may seem obvious that
the M P K must vary dramatically as well. In this case we would have to conclude
that there are important frictions in international capital markets that prevent an
efficient cross-country allocation of capital.1 However, as Lucas [1990] pointed out in his
celebrated article, poor countries also have lower endowments of factors complementary
with physical capital, such as human capital, and lower total factor productivity (TFP).
Hence, large differences in capital-labor ratios may coexist with M P K equalization.2
It is not surprising then that considerable effort and ingenuity have been devoted to the attempt to generate cross-country estimates of the M P K. Banerjee and
Duflo [2005] present an exhaustive review of existing methods and results. Briefly, the
literature has followed three approaches. The first is the cross-country comparison of
interest rates. This is problematic because in financially repressed/distorted economies
interest rates on financial assets may be very poor proxies for the cost of capital actually
borne by firms.3 The second is some variant of regressing ∆Y on ∆K for different sets
1

The credit-friction view has many vocal supporters. Reinhart and Rogoff [2004], for example,
build a strong case based on developing countries’ histories of serial default, as well as evidence by
Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcam and Volosovych [2003] and Lane [2003] linking institutional factors to capital
flows to poorer economies. Another forceful exposition of the credit-friction view is in Stulz [2005].
2
See also Mankiw [1995], and the literature on development-accounting (surveyed in Caselli [2005]),
which documents these large differences in human capital and TFP.
3
Another issue is default. In particular, it is not uncommon for promised yields on “emerging
market” bond instruments to exceed yields on US bonds by a factor of 2 or 3, but given the much
higher risk these bonds carry it is possible that the expected cost of capital from the perspective of

of counties and comparing the coefficient on ∆K. Unfortunately, this approach typically relies on unrealistic identification assumptions. The third strategy is calibration,
which involves choosing a functional form for the relationship between physical capital
and output, as well as accurately measuring the additional complementary factors –
such as human capital and TFP – that affect the M P K. Since giving a full account of
the complementary factors is quite ambitious, one may not want to rely on this method
exclusively. Both within and between these three broad approaches results vary widely.
In sum, the effort to generate reliable comparisons of cross-country M P K differences
has not yet paid off.
This paper presents estimates of the aggregate M P K for a large cross-section
of countries, representing a broad sample of developing and developed economies. Relative to existing alternative measures, ours are extremely direct, impose very little
structure on the data, and are simple to calculate. The general idea is that under
conditions approximating perfect competition on the capital market the M P K equals
the rate of return to capital, and that the latter multiplied by the capital stock equals
capital income. Hence, the aggregate marginal product of capital can be easily recovered from data on total income, the value of the capital stock, and the capital share in
income. We then combine data on output and capital with data on the capital share
to back out the M P K.4
Our main result is that M P Ks are essentially equalized: the return from investing in capital is no higher in poor countries than in rich countries. This means that one
can rationalize virtually all of the cross-country variation in capital per worker without
appealing to international capital-market frictions. We also quantify the output losses
the borrower is considerably less. More generally, Mulligan [2002] shows that with uncertainty and
taste shocks interest rates on any particular financial instruments may have very low – indeed even
negative – correlations with the rental rate faced by firms.
4
Mulligan [2002] performs an analogous calculation to identify the rental rate in the US time series.
He finds implicit support for this method in the fact that the rental rate thus calculated is a much
better predictor of consumption growth than interest rates on financial assets.

3

due to the (minimal) M P K differences we observe: if we were to reallocate capital
across countries so as to equalize M P Ks the corresponding change in world output
would be negligible.5 Consistent with the view that financial markets have become
more integrated worldwide, however, we also find some evidence that the cost of credit
frictions has declined over time.
The path to this result offers additional important insights. We start from a
“naive” estimate of the M P K that is derived from the standard neoclassical one-sector
model, with labor and reproducible capital as the only inputs. Using this initial measure, the average M P K in the developing economies in our sample is more than twice
as large as in the developed economies. Furthermore, within the developing-country
sample the M P K is three times as variable as within the developed-country sample.
When we quantify the output losses associated with these M P K differentials we find
that they are very large (about 25 percent of the aggregate GDP of the developing
countries in our sample). These results seem at first glance to represent a big win for
the international credit-friction view of the world.
Things begin to change dramatically when we add land and other natural resources as possible inputs. This obviously realistic modification implies that standard
measures of the capital share (obtained as 1 minus the labor share) are not appropriate
to build a measure of the marginal productivity of reproducible capital. This is because
these measures conflate the income flowing to capital accumulated through investment
flows with natural capital in the form of land and natural resources. By using data
recently compiled by the World Bank, we are able to separate natural capital from reproducible capital and calculate the share of output paid to reproducible capital that
is our object of interest. This correction alone significantly reduces the gap between
rich and poor country capital returns. The main reason for this is that poor countries
5

Our counter-factual calculations of the consequences of full capital mobility for world GDP are
analogous to those of Klein and Ventura [2004] for labor mobility.

4

have a larger share of natural capital in total capital, which leads to a correspondingly
larger overestimate of the income and marginal-productivity of reproducible capital
when using the total capital-income share. The correction also reduces the GDP loss
due to M P K differences to about 5% of developing country GDP, one fifth of the
amount implied by the naive calculation.

6

The further and final blow to the credit-friction hypothesis comes from generalizing the model to allow for multiple sectors. In a multi-sector world the estimate of
M P K based on the one-sector model (with or without natural capital) is – at best –
a proxy for the average physical M P K across sectors. But with many sectors physical
M P K differences can be sustained even in a world completely unencumbered by any
form of capital-market friction. In particular, even if poor-country agents have access to
unlimited borrowing and lending at the same conditions offered to rich-country agents,
the physical M P K will be higher in poor countries if the relative price of capital goods
is higher there. Intuitively, poor-country investors in physical capital need to be compensated by a higher physical M P K for the fact that capital is more expensive there
(relative to output). Or, yet in other words, the physical M P K measures output per
unit of physical capital invested, while for the purposes of cross-country credit flows
one wants to look at output per unit of output invested. Accordingly, when we correct
our measure to capture the higher relative cost of capital in poor countries we reach
our result of M P K equalization.7
6

We are immensely grateful to Pete Klenow and one other referee for bringing up the issue of land
and natural resources. Incidentally, these observations extend to a criticism of much work that has
automatically plugged in standard capital-share estimates in empirical applications of models where
all capital is reproducible. We plan to pursue this criticism in future work.
7
In a paper largely addressing other issues, Taylor [1998] has a section which makes the same basic
point about price differences and returns to capital, and presents similar calculations for the M P Ks.
Our paper still differs considerably in that it provides a more rigorous theoretical underpinning for the
exercise; it provides a quantitative model-based assessment of the deadweight costs of credit frictions;
and it presents a decomposition of the role of relative prices v. other factors in explaining crosscountry differences in capital-labor ratios. Perhaps most importantly, in this paper we use actual data
on reproducible capital shares instead of assuming that these are constant across countries and equal
to the total capital share. This turns out to be quite important. Cohen and Soto [2002] also briefly

5

We close the paper by returning to Lucas’ question as to the sources of differences in capital-labor ratios. Lucas proposed two main candidates: credit frictions –
about which he was skeptical – and differences in complementary inputs (e.g. human
capital) and TFP. Our analysis highlights the wisdom of Lucas’ skepticism vis-a-vis
the credit friction view. However, our result that physical M P Ks differ implies that
different endowments of complementary factors or of TFP are not the only cause of differences in capital intensity. Instead, an important role is also played by two additional
proximate factors: the higher relative price of capital and the lower reproducible-capital
share in poor countries. When we decompose differences in capital-labor ratios to find
the relative contributions of complementary factors on one side, and relative prices and
capital shares on the other, we find a roughly 50-50 split.
Our analysis implies that the higher cost of installing capital (in terms of foregone consumption) in poor countries is an important factor in explaining why so little
capital flows to them. The important role of the relative price of capital in our analysis
underscores the close relationship of our contribution with an influential recent paper
by Hsieh and Klenow [2003]. Hsieh and Klenow show, among other things, that the
relative price of output is the key source for the observed positive correlation of real
investment rates and per-capita income, despite roughly constant investment rates in
domestic prices. We extend their results by drawing out their implications – together
with appropriately-measured reproducible capital shares – for rates of return differentials, and the debate on the missing capital flows to developing countries.8
observe that the data may be roughly consistent with rate of return equalization.
8
Another important contribution of Hsieh and Klenow [2003] is to propose an explanation for
the observed pattern of relative prices. In their view poor countries have relatively lower TFP in
producing (largely tradable) capital goods than in producing (partially non-tradable) consumption
goods. Another possible explanation is that poor countries tax sales of machinery relatively more
than sales of final goods (e.g. Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan [1996]). Relative price differences may
also reflect differences in the composition of output or in unmeasured quality. None of our conclusions
in this paper is affected by which of these explanations is the correct one, so we do not take a stand
on this. Of course the policy implications of different explanations are very different. For example,
if a high relative price of capital reflected tax distortions, then governments should remove these

6

Our results have implications for the recently-revived policy debate on financial
aid to developing countries. The existence of large physical M P K differentials between
poor and rich countries would usually be interpreted as prima facie support to the
view that increased aid flows may be beneficial. But such an interpretation hinges on
a credit-friction explanation for such differentials. Our result that financial rates of
return are fairly similar in rich and poor countries, instead, implies that any additional
flow of resources to developing countries is likely to be offset by private flows in the
opposite direction seeking to restore rate-of-return equalization.9

M P K Differentials
M P K Differentials in a One-Sector Model

Consider the standard neoclassical one-sector model featuring a constant-return production function and perfectly competitive (domestic) capital markets. Under these
(minimal) conditions the rental rate of capital equals the marginal product of capital,
so that aggregate capital income is M P KxK, where K is the capital stock. If α is the
capital share in GDP, and Y is GDP, we then have α = M P KxK/Y , or

MP K = α

In the macro-development literature it is common to back out the “capital
distortions, and capital would then flow to poor countries.
9
Our conclusion that a more integrated world financial market would not lead to major changes in
world output is in a sense stronger than Gourinchas and Jeanne [2003]’s conclusion that the welfare
effects of capital-account openness are small. Gourinchas and Jeanne [2003] find large (calibrated)
M P K differentials, and consequently predict large capital inflows following capital-account liberalization. However, they point out that in welfare terms this merely accelerates a process of convergence
to a steady state that is independent of whether the capital-account is open or closed. Hence, the
discounted welfare gains are modest. Our point is that, even though differences in physical M P Ks
are large, differences in rates of return are small, so we should not even expect much of a reallocation
of capital in the first place.

share” as one minus available estimates of the labor share in income (we review these
data below). But such figures include payments accruing to both reproducible and nonreproducible capital, i.e. land and natural resources. By contrast, the standard measure
of the capital stock is calculated using the perpetual inventory method from investment
flows, and therefore represents only the reproducible capital stock. As is clear from
the formula above, therefore, using standard measures of α leads to an overestimate of
the marginal productivity of reproducible capital. In turn, this bias on the estimated
levels of the M P Ks will translate into a twofold bias in cross-country comparisons.
First, it will exaggerate absolute differences in M P K, which is typically the kind of
differences we are interested in when comparing rates of return on assets (interest-rate
spreads, for example, are absolute differences).10 Second, and most importantly, since
the agricultural and natural-resource sectors represent a much larger share of GDP in
poor countries, the overestimate of the M P K when using the total capital share is
much more severe in such countries, and cross-country differences will once again be
inflated (both in absolute and in relative terms).
Of course equation (1) holds (as long as there is only one sector) whether or not
non-reproducible capital enters the production function or not. The only thing that
changes is the interpretation of α. Hence, these considerations lead us to two possible
estimates of the M P K:

(2)

M P KN = αw

Y
,
K

10
As an example, suppose that all countries have the same share of land and natural resources in
the total capital share, say 20%. Using the total-capital share instead of the reproducible-capital will
simply increase all the M P Ks by the same proportion. If the US’ “true” M P K is 8% and India’s
16% (a spread of 8 percentage points), the M P Ks computed with the total capital share are 10% and
20% (a spread of 10 percentage points).

M P KL = αk

K

In these formulas, Y and K are, respectively, estimates of real output and the reproduciblecapital stock; αw is one minus the labor share (the standard measure of the capital
share); and αk is an estimate of the reproducible-capital share in income. The suffix
“N ” in the first measure is a mnemonic for “naive,” while the suffix “L” in the second
stands for “land and natural-resource corrected.”
It is important to observe that, relative to alternative estimates in the literature,
this method of calculating M P K requires no functional form assumptions (other than
linear homogeneity), much less that we come up with estimates of human capital, TFP,
or other factors that affect a country’s M P K. Furthermore, the assumptions we do
make are typically shared by the other approaches to M P K estimation, so the set of
restrictions we impose is a strict subset of those imposed elsewhere. This calculation is
a useful basis for our other calculations because it encompasses the most conventional
set of assumptions in the growth literature.

II B

M P K Differentials in a Multi-Sector Model

The calculations suggested above are potentially biased because they ignore an important fact – the price of capital relative to the price of consumption goods is higher in
poor countries than in rich countries. To see why this matters consider an economy
that produces J final goods. Each final good is produced using capital and other factors, which we don’t need to specify. The only technological restriction is that each
of the final goods is produced under constant returns to scale. The only institutional
restriction is that there is perfect competition in good and factor markets within each
9

country. Capital may be produced domestically (in which case it is one of the J final
goods), imported, or both. Similarly, it does not matter whether the other final goods
produced domestically are tradable or not.
Consider the decision by a firm or a household to purchase a piece of capital
and use it in the production of one of the final goods, say good 1. The return from
this transaction is
P1 (t)M P K1 (t) + Pk (t + 1)(1 − δ)
,
Pk (t)

(4)

where P1 (t) is the domestic price of good 1 at time t, Pk (t) is the domestic price of
capital goods, δ is the depreciation rate, and M P K1 is the physical marginal product
of capital in the production of good 1. When do we have frictionless international
capital markets? When the firms/households contemplating this investment in all
countries have access to an alternative investment opportunity, that yields a common
world gross rate of return R∗ . Abstracting for simplicity from capital gains, frictionless
international capital markets imply
P1 M P K1
= R∗ − (1 − δ).
Pk

(5)

Hence, frictionless international credit markets imply that the value of the marginal
product of capital in any particular final good, divided by the price of capital, is
constant across countries.
To bring this condition to the data let us first note that total capital income
is

P
j

Pj M P Kj Kj , where Kj is the amount of capital used in producing good j. If

capital is efficiently allocated domestically, we also have Pj M P Kj = P1 M P K1 , so total
P
capital income is P1 M P K1 j Kj = P1 M P K1 K, where K is the total capital stock in
operation in the country. Given that capital income is P1 M P K1 K, the capital share
10

in income is α = P1 M P K1 K/(Py Y ) ,where Py Y is GDP evaluated at domestic prices.
Hence, the following holds:
P1 M P K1
αPy Y
=
Pk
Pk K

(6)

In other words, the multi-sector model recommends a measure of the marginal product
of capital that is easily backed out from an estimate of the capital share in income, α,
GDP at domestic prices, Py Y , and the capital-stock at domestic prices, Pk K. Comparing this with the estimate suggested by the one-sector model (equation (1)) we see that
the difference lies in correcting for the relative price of final-to-capital goods, Py /Pk .
It should be clear that this correction is fundamental to properly assess the hypothesis
that international credit markets are frictionless.
All of the above goes through whether or not reproducible capital is the only
recipient of non-labor income or not. Again, the only difference is in the interpretation
of the capital share α. Hence, we come to our third and fourth possible estimates of
the M P K:

(7)

P M P KN =

αw Py Y
,
Pk K

P M P KL =

αk Py Y
Pk K

and

(8)

where Py /Pk is a measure of the average price of final goods relative to the price of
reproducible capital, and the prefix “P ” stands for “price-corrected.”11
11

Since in our model Pj M P Kj is equalized across sectors j, the physical M P K in any particular
sector will be an inverse function of the price of output in that sector. Since the relative price of
capital is high in poor countries, this is consistent with the conjecture of Hsieh and Klenow [2003]
that relative productivity in the capital goods producing sectors is low in poor countries.

11

Notice that the one-sector based measures, M P KN and M P KL, retain some
interest even in the multi-sector context. In particular, one can show that
αY
1
= P Yj /Y .
K

(9)

j M P Kj

In words, the product of the capital share and real income, divided by the capital
stock, tends to increase when physical marginal products tend to be high on average
in the various sectors.12 Hence, the one-sector based measures offer some quantitative
assessment of cross-country differences in the average physical M P K.

Data

Our data on Y , K, Py , and Pk come (directly or indirectly) from Version 6.1 of the
Penn World Tables (PWT, Heston, Summers and Aten [2004]). Briefly, Y is GDP in
purchasing power parity (PPP) in 1996. The capital stock, K, is constructed with
the perpetual inventory method from time series data on real investment (also from
the PWT) using a depreciation rate of 0.06. Following standard practice, we compute
the initial capital stock, K0 , as I0 /(g + δ), where I0 is the value of the investment
series in the first year it is available, and g is the average geometric growth rate for
the investment series between the first year with available data and 1970 (see Caselli
[2005] for more details).13 Py is essentially a weighted average of final good domestic

Then substitute Pj = M P K
from the last equation in the text, and rearrange.

13
A potential bias arises if the depreciation rate δ differs across countries, perhaps because of
differences in the composition of investment, or because the natural environment is more or less
forgiving. In particular we will overestimate the capital stock of countries with high depreciation
rates, and therefore underestimate their M P K. However notice from equation (5) that countries with
a high depreciation rates should have higher M P Ks. In other words variation in δ biases both sides

12

prices, while Pk is a weighted average of capital good domestic prices. The list of final
and capital goods to be included in the measure is constant across countries. Hence,
Py /Pk is a summary measure of the prices of final goods relative to capital goods. As
many authors have already pointed out, capital goods are relatively more expensive in
poor countries, so the free capital flows condition modified to take account of relative
capital prices should fit the data better than the unmodified condition if the physical
M P K tends to be higher in poor countries.14
The total capital share, αw is taken from Bernanke and Gurkaynak [2001], who
build upon and expand upon the influential work of Gollin [2002]. As mentioned, these
estimates compute the capital share as one minus the labor share in GDP. In turn, the
labor share is employee compensation in the corporate sector from the National Accounts, plus a number of adjustments to include the labor income of the self-employed
and non-corporate employees.15
Direct measures of reproducible capital’s share of output, αk , do not appear
to be available. However, a proxy for them can be constructed from data on wealth,
which has recently become available for a variety of countries from the World Bank
[2006]. These data split national wealth into natural capital, such as land and natural
resources, and reproducible capital. If total wealth equals reproducible capital plus
of (5) in the same direction.
14
See, e.g., Barro [1991], Jones [1994], and Hsieh and Klenow [2003] for further discussions of the
price data.
15
Bernanke and Gürkaynak use similar methods as Gollin, but their data set includes a few more
countries. The numbers are straight from Table X in the Bernanke and Gürkaynak paper. Their
preferred estimates are reported in the column labeled “Actual OSPUE,” and they are constructed by
assigning to labor a share of the Operating Surplus of Private Unincorporate Enterprises equal to the
share of labor in the corporate (and public) sector. We use these data wherever they are available.
When “Actual OSPUE” is not available we take the data from the column “Imputed OSPUE,” which
is constructed as “Actual OSPUE,” except that the OSPUE measure is estimated by breaking down
the sum of OSPUE and total corporate income by assuming that the share of corporate income in
total income is the same as the share of corporate labor in total labor. Finally, when this measure, is
also unavailable, we get the data from the “LF” column, which assumes that average labor income in
the non-corporate sector equals average labor income in the corporate sector. When we use Gollin’s
estimates we get very much the same results.

13

natural wealth, W = Pk K + L, then the payments to reproducible capital should be
Pk K ∗r, and payments to natural wealth should be L∗r. Reproducible capital’s share of
total capital income is therefore proportional to reproducible capital’s share of wealth
(since all units of wealth pay the same return).16 So,

(11)

αk = (Pk K/W ) ∗ αw .

We can therefore back out an estimate of αk from αw as estimated by Bernanke and
Gurkaynak [2001] and Pk K/W as estimated by the World Bank.
Since the World Bank’s data on land and natural-resource wealth is by far the
newest and least familiar among those used in this paper, a few more words to describe
these data are probably in order. The general approach is to estimate the value of rents
from a particular form of capital and then capitalize this value using a fixed discount
rate. In most cases, the measure of rents is based on the value of output from that form
of capital in a given year. For subsoil resources, the World Bank also needs to estimate
the future growth of rents and a time horizon to depletion. For forest products, rents are
estimated as the value of timber produced (at local market prices where possible) minus
an estimate of the cost of production. Adjustments are made for sustainability based
on the volume of production and total amount of usable timberland. The rents to other
forest resources are estimated as fixed value per acre for all non-timber forest. Rents
from cropland are estimated as the value of agricultural output minus production costs.
Production costs are taken to be a fixed percentage of output, where that percentage
varies by crop. Pasture land is similarly valued. Protected areas are valued as if they
had the same per-hectare output as crop and pasture land, based on an opportunity cost
argument. Reproducible capital is calculated using the perpetual inventory method.
16

This requires the assumption that capital gains are identical for natural capital and reproducible
capital.

Source: Authors calculations using data from World Bank [2006].
Due to data limitations, no good estimates of the value of urban land are available. A
very crude estimate values urban land at 24% of the value of reproducible capital.
Summary statistics of the cross-country distribution of the shares of different
types of wealth in total wealth are reported in Table I. In the average country in our
sample, reproducible capital represents roughly one half of total capital, while various
forms of “natural” capital account for the other half. The proportion of reproducible
capital is highly correlated with log GDP per worker. All other types of capital (except
for urban land, which is calculated as a fraction of accumulated capital) are negatively
correlated with log GDP per worker. Cropland is particularly negatively correlated
with income. The weighted means are weighted by the total capital stock in each
country, so that they give the proportion of each type of capital in the total capital
stock of the World (as represented by our sample). The proportion of reproducible
capital is much higher in the weighted means, with almost 70% of total capital.
Other data sources provide opportunities for checking the broad reliability of
these data. For the US, the OMB published an accounting of land and reproducible
15

wealth (but not other natural resources) over time (Office of Management and Budget
[2005]). They find that the proportion of land in total capital varies between 20 and 26%
between 1960 and 2003, with no clear trend to the data. This range is consistent with
the World Bank estimate of 26% (when, for comparability with the OMB estimates,
one excludes natural resources other than land). Another check is from the sectorial
dataset on land and capital shares constructed by Caselli and Coleman [2001]. Our
approach to estimate the reproducible capital share in GDP implies a land share in
GDP in the US of 8%. According to Caselli and Coleman in the US the land share in
agricultural output is about 20%, and the land share in non-agriculture is about 6%.
Since the share of nonagriculture in GDP is in the order of 97%, these authors’ overall
estimate of the land share in the US is very close to ours.
There are a number of studies from the 60’s and 70’s which perform similar
exercises on a variety of countries. Raymond W. Goldsmith collects some of these in
Goldsmith [1985]. He finds land shares in total capital in 1978 that average about 20%
across a group of mostly rich countries. With the exception of Japan at 51%,the figures
range from 12% to 27%.17 This range is once again broadly consistent with the World
Bank data.
The data from Bernanke and Gurkaynak [2001] puts the heaviest constraints
on the sample size, so that we end up with 53 countries.18 The entire data set is
reported in Appendix Table VII. Capital per worker, k, the relative price Py /Pk , the
total capital share, and the reproducible capital’s share are also plotted against output
per worker, y, in Appendix Figures V, VI, VII, and VIII.
17

Japan is not similarly an outlier in the World Bank data. This may reflect the relatively crude
way that urban land values is estimated by the World Bank. Lacking a good cross country measure
of urban land value, they simply take urban land to be worth a fixed value of reproducible capital.
Given the population density of Japan this may substantially understate the value of Japanese urban
land.

For the calculations corrected for the reproducible capital share, we also lose Hong Kong.

M P K Results

In this section we present our four estimates of the M P K. To recap, the naive version,
M P KN , does not account for difference in prices of capital and consumption goods,
and also uses the total share of capital, not the share of reproducible capital. This
calculation is the simplest and will be used as a benchmark for the corrected versions.
M P KL is calculated using the share of reproducible capital rather than the share of
total capital. P M P KN is adjusted to account for differences in prices between capital
and consumption goods, but reverts to the total capital share. Finally P M P KL, the
“right” estimate, includes both the price adjustment and the natural capital adjustment. These four different versions of the implied M P Ks are reported in Appendix
Table VII, and plotted against GDP per worker, y, in Figure I.
The overall relationship between the naive estimate, M P KN , and income is
clearly negative. However, the non-linearity in the data cannot be ignored: there is a
remarkably neat split whereby the M P KN is highly variable and high on average in
developing countries (up to Malaysia), and fairly constant and low on average among
developed countries (up from Portugal). The average M P KN among the 29 lower
income countries is 27 percent, with a standard deviation of 9 percent. Among the 24
high income countries the average M P KN is 11 percent, with a standard deviation of
3 percent. Neither within the subsample of countries to the left of Portugal, nor in the
one to the right, there is a statistically significant relationship between the M P KN
and y (nor with log(y)).
This first simple calculation implies that the aggregate marginal product of
capital is high and highly variable in poor countries, and low and fairly uniform in rich
countries. If we were to stop here, it would be tempting to conclude that capital flows
fairly freely among the rich countries, but not towards and among the poor countries.
This looks like a big win for the credit friction answer to the Lucas question.

Once one accounts for prices and the share of natural capital a different story
emerges. Figure I shows that each of the adjustments reduces the variance of the
marginal product considerably and reduces the differences between the rich and poor
countries. Taking both adjustments together eliminates the variance almost completely
and the rich countries actually have a higher marginal product on average than the
poor countries. Table II summarizes the average marginal products for each of our
calculation for poor and rich countries. The differences between the poor and rich

countries are significant for the first three rows of the table. For the case using both
corrections, the difference is only significant at the 10% level.
Interestingly, with both adjustments there is a positive and significant relationship between P M P KL and output within the low income countries. The very lowest
income countries in our sample have the lowest P M P KL values. This would be consistent with a model where capital flows out of the country were forbidden, and where
some capital flows into the country were not responsive to the rate of return. This may
describe the poorest countries in our sample, where aid flows represent a significant
proportion of investment capital (and all of the inward flow of capital).

III

Assessing the Costs of Credit Frictions

The existence of any cross-country differences in M P K suggests inefficiencies in the
world allocation of capital. How severe are these frictions? One possible way to answer
this question is to compute the amount of GDP the world fails to produce as a consequence. In particular, we perform the counter-factual experiment of reallocating the
world capital stock so as to achieve M P K equalization under our various measures.
We then compare world output under this reallocation to actual world output. The
difference is a measure of the deadweight loss from the failure to equalize M P Ks.
We stress that this is not a normative exercise: our capital reallocation is not a
policy proposal. The observed distribution of output is an equilibrium outcome given
certain distortions that prevent M P K equalization. The point of this exercise is to
assess the welfare losses the world experiences relative to a frictionless first best, not
that the first best is easily achievable by moving some capital around.
While our M P K estimates are free of functional form assumptions, in order
to perform our counterfactual calculations me must now choose a specific production
function. We thus fall back on the standard Cobb-Douglas workhorse. Industry j in
country i has the production function

(12)

β

Yij = Zijij Kijαi (Xij Lij )1−αi −βij ,

where Zij is the quantity of natural capital, Kij the reproducible capital stock, Lij
the input of labor, βij is the share of natural capital in sector j in country i and
Xij is a summary measure of technology and is also sector and country specific. The
derivation below makes it clear that to pursue our calculations we must assume that
the reproducible-capital share in country i, αi , is the same across all sectors (though
it can vary across countries).
20

The marginal product of capital in sector j in country i is
β

M P Kij = αi Zijij Kijαi −1 (Xij Lij )1−αi −βij .

(13)

Taking into account the relative prices of capital and consumption goods, rates of
return within a country are equalized when

P M P Kij =

Pij

αi Zijij Kijαi −1 (Xij Lij )1−αi −βij = P M P Ki

j = 1...J.

Suppose now that capital was reallocated across countries in such a way that P M P Ki
took the same value, P M P K ∗ , in all countries. Assuming for the time being that Zij ,
and Lij are unchanged in response to our counterfactual reshuffling of capital (we will
check this is indeed the case later in the section), the new value of Kij , Kij∗ , satisfies19

which shows that capital increases or decreases by the same proportion in each sector.
Earlier we made the conjecture that all adjustment to the equalization of P M P Ks
was through the capital stock, and not through reallocations of labor or natural capital. Under this conjecture, since the amount of capital per worker changes by the

same factor in each sector, the marginal products of labor and natural capital must do
the same. Hence, even if labor is not a specific factor, as long as its allocation across
sectors depends on relative wages, there will be no reshuffling of workers across sectors.
In particular, our experiment is consistent with wage equalization across sectors, but
also with models in which inter-sectoral migration frictions imply fixed proportional
wedges among different sectors’ wages. The same is true of natural capital.
We can now aggregate the sectoral capital stocks to the country level:

Taking the values for P M P Ki calculated in the previous section, the only unknown in
(18) is P M P K ∗ , which can be solved for with a simple non-linear numerical routine.
To recap, P M P K ∗ is the common world rate of return to capital that would prevail if
the existing world capital stock were allocated optimally.20

III A

Counterfactual Capital Stocks

With the counterfactual world rate of return, P M P K ∗ , at hand we can use equation
(17) to back out each country’s assigned capital stock when rates of return are equal20

Removing the frictions that prevent P M P K equalization would almost certainly also lead to an
increase in the world aggregate capital stock. Our calculations clearly abstract from this additional
benefit, and are therefore a lower bound on the welfare cost of such frictions.

ized. As with our initial M P K calculations, four variations are calculated. The base
version, labeled M P KN , is calculated under the assumption that Pk = Py and uses the
total share of capital, not correcting for natural capital (i.e. it sets βij = 0). M P KL is
calculated using the share of reproducible capital rather than the share of total capital.
P M P KN allows for differences in prices. P M P KL includes both the price adjustment and the natural capital adjustment. Figure II plots the resulting counter-factual
distributions of capital-labor ratios against the actual distribution. The solid lines are
45-degree lines. Table III summarizes the change in capital labor ratios under the
various calculations for poor and rich countries.

Not surprisingly, under the naive M P K calculation, most developing countries
would be recipients of capital and the developed economies would be senders. The
magnitude of the changes in capital-labor ratios under this scenario are fairly spectacular, with the average developing country experiencing almost a 300 percent increase.
In the average rich country the capital-labor ratio falls by 13 percent. These figures
remain in the same ball park when weighted by population. The average developing
country worker experiences a still sizable 206 percent increase in his capital endowment. The average rich-country worker loses 19 percent of his capital allotment. The

scatter plots show that despite this substantial amount of reallocation, many developing countries would still have less physical-capital per worker, reflecting their lower
average efficiency levels (as reflected in the Xij s). Similarly, some of the rich countries
are capital recipients.
However when we correct the M P K for the natural capital share and relative
prices once again rich-poor differences are dramatically reduced. Either the price adjustment or the natural capital adjustment taken alone reduces the averaged weighted
gain in the capital stock to about 50% in the poor countries while the rich countries
lose about 5% of their capital stock. With both corrections in place the poor countries
actually lose capital to the rich countries.

Changes in output in our counterfactual world are obviously consistent with the
result for capital-labor ratios. For our naive M P K measure, developing countries tend
to experience increases in GDP, and rich countries declines. The average developing
country experiences a 77 percent gain, while the average developed country only “loses”
3 percent. These numbers fall dramatically when adjustments are made for relative
capital prices and natural capital, with increases of less than 25% in both cases. For
the scenario with both adjustments, average output in the two groups is essentially
unchanged.

III C

Dead Weight Losses

To provide a comprehensive summary measure of the deadweight loss from the failure
of M P Ks to equalize across countries we compute the percentage difference between
world output in the counterfactual case and actual world output, or

This can be calculated for each of our measures of the marginal product. Table V
summarizes this calculation for our four calculation methods.
For the naive M P K calculation, the result is in the order of 0.03, or world output
would increase by 3 percent if we redistributed physical capital so as to equalize the
M P K. This number is large. To put it in perspective, consider that the 28 developing
countries in our sample account for 12 percent of the aggregate GDP of the sample.
This result implies that the deadweight loss from inefficient allocation of capital is
in the order of one quarter of the aggregate (and hence also per capita) income of
developing countries.
Once one adjusts for price differences and natural capital, however, the picture
changes substantially. The natural-capital adjustment alone reduces the dead weight
loss to less than a quarter of the base case. The price adjustment alone reduces the
dead weight losses by over half. Taken together, the dead weight loss is negligible.
In these calculations, the natural-capital adjustment appears to be of greater
importance than the price adjustment. This was not the case for the M P K calculations. This is because the capital adjustment reduces the dead weight losses in two
ways. First, like the price adjustment, the natural-capital adjustment tends to reduce
the gap between rich and poor M P K. Unlike the price adjustment, the natural capital adjustment reduces the share of capital for our deadweight loss calculations for
all countries. This reduces the sensitivity of output to reallocations of capital and

reduces the dead weight losses further. This can be seen in Table VI which lists the
counter-factual M P K for each of our cases.
The main implication of our results thus far is that given the observed pattern
of the relative price of investment goods and accounting for differences in the share
of reproducible capital across countries, a fully integrated and frictionless world capital market would not produce an international allocation of capital much different
from the observed one. Similarly, as shown in Figure III, once capital is reallocated
across countries so as to equalize the rate of return to reproducible-capital investment
(corrected for price differences and using the proper measure of capital’s share), the
counter-factual world income distribution is very close to the observed one. Hence, it
is not primarily capital-market segmentation that generates low capital-labor ratios in
developing countries. In the next section we expand on this theme.

IV

Explaining Differences in Capital-Labor Ratios

Since we find essentially no difference in (properly measured) M P Ks between poor
and rich countries, we end up siding with Lucas on the (un)importance of international
credit frictions as a source of differences in capital-labor ratios. But our results also call
for some qualifications to Lucas’ preferred explanation, namely that rich countries had
a greater abundance of factors complementary to reproducible capital, or higher levels
of TFP. These factors certainly play a role, but other important proximate causes
29

are the international variation on the relative price of capital and the international
variation in the reproducible-capital share.
We cannot accurately apportion the relative contribution of prices, capital
shares and other (Lucas) factors without data on each sector’s price Pij , efficiency,
Xij , and natural-capital share, βij . But a rough approximation to a decomposition can
be produced by focusing on a very special case, in which each country produces only
one output good. In this example, clearly, most countries import their capital.21 With
this (admittedly very strong) assumption, we can rearrange equation (15) to read
ki∗ = Πi x Λi ,

where ki∗ is the ratio of reproducible-capital to labor and zi is the ratio of naturalcapital to labor. The first term captures the effect of variation in relative prices and
capital shares on the capital-labor ratio. The second term captures the traditional
complementary factors identified by Lucas. In the simplest case where αi and the price
ratio are assumed to be the same in all countries, all the variance of capital per worker
in a world with perfect mobility would be due to differences in Λ.
In equation (22) the term Πi is available from our previous calculations, so we

with income.

30

can , back out the term Λi as ki∗ /Πi . Following Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare [1997] we
can then take the log and variance of both sides to arrive at the decomposition:

(25)

var [log(k ∗ )] = var [log(Π)] + var [log(Λ)] + 2 ∗ cov [log(Π), log(Λ)] .

The variance of log(k ∗ ) for our P M P KL case is 2.46, the variance of log(Π) is 0.82,
the variance of log(Λ) is 0.61, and the covariance term is 0.52. If we apportion the
covariance term across Π and Λ equally this suggests that 54% of the variance in k ∗ is
due to differences in Π and 46% is due to differences in Λ. Each obviously plays a large
role and they are clearly interconnected (the simple correlation between them is 0.73).
This analysis can also be done weighting the sample by population. The results are
very similar with about 50% attributed to each of Π and Λ. It is also possible to look
within Π to determine the relative importance of variation in the share of reproducible
capital and relative capital prices. The result of this variance decomposition suggests
that they are of roughly equal importance.
These results should come as no large surprise. Hsieh and Klenow [2003] argue
that differences in the price ratio are due to relatively low productivity in the capital
producing sectors in developing countries. Since Λ in our formulation is comprised of
an amalgam of human capital and total factor productivity, it should not be surprising
that low Λ correlates with an unfavorable price ratio. Similarly, the proportion of
output in land and natural resources will tend to be larger in poor countries, simply
because they produce less total output. With rising incomes we would expect to see
that proportion fall. The ultimate cause of differences in capital per worker may
therefore be productivity differences if productivity differences are the ultimate cause
of differences in capital costs and the share of capital. However, failure to account for
these factors will falsely suggest that financial frictions play a large role.

Time Series Results

In this section we attempt a brief look at the evolution over time of our deadweight
loss measures. The results should be taken with great caution for two reasons. First,
they are predicated on estimates of the capital stock. Since the capital stocks are a
function of time series data on investment, the capital stock numbers become increasingly unreliable as we proceed backward in time. Second, our estimates of capital’s
share of income are from a single year, so changes over time are not reflected. This is
a particular problem in the case of the calculations corrected for natural capital. The
share of natural resources was particularly volatile during this period and this is not
properly accounted for in the results.
With these important caveats, Figure IV displays the time series evolution of the
world’s deadweight loss from M P K differentials. We find little – or perhaps a slightly
increasing – long-run trend in the deadweight loss from failure to equalize M P KN .
Once prices are accounted for, however, it appears that the size of the deadweight
losses have fallen somewhat over time. Adding in the correction for natural capital
causes the trend to be clearly downward. This provides tentative evidence that the
deadweight loss from failure to equalize financial returns – the cost of credit frictions
– has fallen somewhat over time. This latter result is consistent with the view that
world financial markets have become increasingly integrated.

22

22

The acceleration in the decline of the deadweight losses during the 1980s may reflect historically
low M P Ks in developing countries during that decade’s crisis. If M P Ks in poor countries were low
the cost of capital immobility would have been less.

Conclusions

Macroeconomic data on aggregate output, reproducible capital stocks, final-good prices
relative to reproducible-capital prices, and the share of reproducible capital in GDP
are remarkably consistent with the view that international financial markets do a very
efficient job at allocating capital across countries. Developing countries are not starved
of capital because of credit-market frictions. Rather, the proximate causes of low
capital-labor ratios in developing countries are that these countries have low levels
of complementary factors, they are inefficient users of such factors (as Lucas [1990]
suspected), their share of reproducible capital is low, and they have high prices of
capital goods relative to consumption goods.
As a result, increased aid flows to developing countries are unlikely to have
much impact on capital stocks and output, unless they are accompanied by a return to
financial repression, and in particular to an effective ban on capital outflows in these
countries. Even in that case, increased aid flows would be a move towards inefficiency,
and not increased efficiency, in the international allocation of capital.
