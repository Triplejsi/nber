ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the role of pain in determining self-reported work disability in the US, the
UK and The Netherlands. Even if identical questions are asked, cross-country differences in reported
work disability remain substantial. In the US and the Netherlands, respondent evaluations of work
limitations of hypothetical persons described in pain vignettes are used to identify the extent to
which differences in self-reports between countries or socio-economic groups are due to systematic
variation in the response scales.

1. Introduction
High and rising rates of work disability are a pervasive problem in many industrialized
countries (see, e.g., Bound and Burkhauser, 1999). But rates of reported work disability vary
considerably across countries with similar levels of economic development and comparable
medical technology and treatment. Institutional differences in eligibility rules or generosity of
benefits no doubt contribute to explaining the differences in disability rolls. Recent survey data
show that significant differences between countries are also found in self-reports of work
limiting disabilities and in general health. In comparing such self-reports, account should be
taken of measurement issues such as differences in question wordings, as well as differences
between and within countries that may exist in the scales that are used in answering questions
about work disability.
The paper investigates in some depth one highly salient- and as it turns out quite
important reason- for reporting work disability- the presence of some type of pain. Unlike many
illnesses of middle age, pain prevalence is very high. It also varies considerably across such key
demographic attributes as gender and education. Most importantly for this paper, amongst all
health conditions pain is the most important determinant of work disability.
A unique aspect of this research is that it has a distinct multi-national component by
using data from three countries: US, U.K., and the Netherlands. These three countries differ in
several relevant dimensions—observed rates of self-reported work disability, and perhaps
national norms about the appropriateness of not working when one is or one claims one is work
disabled. However, the countries appear to have similar economic standards of living and similar
levels of ‘objectively’ measured health status of the population. For this reason, international

1

comparisons may be particularly useful in understanding some of the most salient research issues
that have dominated the scientific literature on work disability.
Data on pain and its relationship to work disability are not abundant in any of the three
countries. In addition to relying on a diverse set of currently available health and economic
surveys in each country that do contain relevant information on pain and work disability, we
have also been able to remedy that deficiency with new data collection efforts. First, we have
had access to some reasonably large Internet samples in two of our countries allowing us to
experiment along several dimensions. These samples are the CentERpanel for the Netherlands
and the RAND HRS and RAND MS Internet panels for the United States. For example, we
placed experimental disability modules (with alternative forms of disability questions, etc.) and a
pain module into these panels. In addition, the recently fielded English Longitudinal Survey on
Aging (ELSA) has a detailed set of questions on pain, work disability, and workplace
accommodations.
Pain has a subjective as well as objective manifestation as individuals with the same
amount of pain may react to it in very different ways. Another aspect of this paper is that we
utilize the vignette methodology to evaluate—once again in an experimental setting—how
people within the same country as well as across countries set thresholds that result in labeling
some people work disabled while other people are not so described. Vignette questions have
been applied successfully in recent work on international comparisons of health and work
disability (King et al, 2004; Kapteyn, Smith, and Van Soest, 2004). In this paper, we will use
vignettes on pain to identify systematic differences in self-reported work disability in the
Netherlands and the United States.

2

One reason why pain may have differential impacts on work disability in the three
countries is that practices differ on how to limit the effects of pain on people’s ability to function
effectively in their lives, especially in the workplace. Two aspects of possible cross-country
differences will be investigated- the use of medication to relieve pain and the availability of
workplace accommodations that lessen its impact on the job.
The remainder of this paper is divided into 5 sections. The next section compares and
evaluates the impact of some differences in wording of work disability questions both within and
across countries on reports of work disability. Section 3 summarizes several salient differences
and similarities in the type, severity, and duration of pain in our three countries. This section also
documents the one-way and multivariate relationship between pain and self-reports of work
disability in each country. Section 4 examines differences across countries in pain medication
and work place accommodations. The fifth section summarizes our results using the vignette
methodology and the final section presents our conclusions.
2. Does the Form of the Question Matter?
It is an understatement that there is no agreed upon standard format for asking about
work disability. Thus, it is not surprising that the format and wording of questions on work
disability vary not only internationally but also across the major social science surveys within a
country. For example, in the United States quite different questions are asked in the principal
yearly government labor force survey—The Current Population Survey or CPS; and the principal
yearly health survey—National Health Interview Survey or NHIS (see Burkhauser et al. 2002).
To illustrate, the CPS question is

3

(a) “Does anyone in the household have a health problem or disability which prevents them from
working or which limits the kind or amount or work they can do? [If so,] who is that? (Anyone
else?)”
while the NHIS asks instead two questions
(b) “Does any impairment or health problem now keep you from working at a job or business?
(c) “ Are you limited in the kind of amount of work you can do because of any impairment?”
To add to the potential domestic confusion, the work disability question in the HRS is
(d) “Do you have any impairment or health problem that limits the kind or amount of paid work
you can do?”
and for PSID it is
(e) “Do you have any physical or nervous condition that limits the type of work or the amount of
work you can do?”
In all cases, the answers permitted are yes, no, don’t know, or refuse so that essentially a
dichotomous disability scale can be created.
Some differences between the ways these questions are asked involve language. NHIS
and HRS use the term ‘impairment’; NHIS, HRS, and CPS use ‘health problem’; PSID contains
only the phrase ‘physical or nervous’ condition; while the word ‘disability’ is only used
explicitly in CPS. Another potentially important difference is that CPS first asks about anyone in
the household and then in a follow-up inquires about whom that might be.
Not surprisingly, survey differences in the manner in which work disability questions are
asked are not limited to the United States. For example, the basic work disability question in the
Dutch CentERpanel is

4

(f) “Do you have an impairment or health problem that limits you in the amount or kind of work
you can do?”
While this sounds very similar to the HRS question format, the possible answers are now arrayed
on the following 5-point scale
(1) no, not at all, (2) yes, I am somewhat limited, (3) yes, I am rather limited, (4) yes, I am
severely limited, and (5) yes, I am very severely limited—I am not able to work.
Finally, in England the disability question used in the British Household Panel Survey
(BHPS) is very similar but not identical to the HRS variant—“Does your health limit the type of
work or the amount of work you can do?” While ELSA did not have a work disability question
in wave 1, the designers placed the following question into the first follow-up: “Do you have any
health problem or disability that limits the kind or amount of work you can do?”1
This wide variation in the form in which work disability questions are asked both within
and between countries raises the question of how important this variation is in creating
differences in reported rates of disability prevalence.
2.1. Reports of Disability Prevalence
In this project, we conducted several experiments to evaluate the impact of differences in
question wording on reporting of disability prevalence. First, we placed the disability questions
summarized above from the HRS, CPS, and NHIS into the RAND HRS Internet panel. This
panel is based on a sample of about 2,700 respondents in the HRS 2002 wave who had Internet
access and who expressed a willingness to participate in an experimental survey on the Internet.
This panel allows us to test in a random experimental setting whether the alternative forms of
these questions in these three prominent surveys lead to very different measures of disability

1

If the answer to this question is yes, ELSA follows the HRS format by asking “Is this a health problem or disability that you
expect to last at least three months?”

prevalence using the same population of respondents. Moreover, the reasons for any differences
that emerge can be subsequently explored using the rich information available from the core
HRS interviews.2
In the RAND HRS Internet panel, we conducted the following experiments—half of the
sample was randomly assigned the NHIS form of the disability question while the other half
received the CPS variant. To test for mode differences (the Internet vs. the telephone in the prior
wave), the full RAND HRS Internet sample received the normal HRS question. The principal
results are contained in Table 2.1.

Note: Sample is from RAND HRS Internet sample.

Contrary to the speculation in the literature, there does not appear to be any difference in
estimates of disability prevalence induced by the wordings of these alternative questions. The
NHIS and HRS variants produce bang-on estimates. One complication in making these
comparisons is that HRS staff has not yet coded the specific people affected in the CPS question.
Fortunately, a fix is available by limiting the comparisons to non-married respondents. Table 2.1
shows that in this sample HRS, CPS, and NHIS produce remarkably similar sets of estimates
about disability prevalence.
While the PSID disability question was not included in these experiments, one can
compare PSID estimates of work disability prevalence with those obtained in the HRS for the
2

The HRS respondents with Internet access are a selective sample of the population. However, since we are comparing within
sample it seems unlikely that our results are very much affected by this selectivity.

same age group. In that case the PSID estimate of work disability was 28.7 percent while it was
26.8 percent in the HRS, about a two-percentage point difference. This also does not seem to us
to be a large difference, but this conclusion must be qualified by the fact that unlike the numbers
in Table 2.1 this comparison is not a strict comparison of question wording only, as other factors
such as sampling frames likely differ between the surveys in view of the fact that the HRS
sample only includes respondents with Internet access
Similarly, two other British surveys in addition to the BHPS ask work disability
questions. For example, the Labor Force Survey (LFS) first asks, ‘Do you have any health
problems or disabilities that you expect will last for more than a year?’ If the answer is yes, then
respondents are asked in sequence “Does this health problem affect the KIND of paid work that
you might do?” and then “or the AMOUNT of paid work that you might do?” The other survey
is called the Family Resource Survey (FRS), which asks “Some people are restricted in the
amount or type of work they can do, because they have an injury, illness or disability. Which of
these statements comes closest to your own position at the moment?” 1. Unable to work at the
moment; 2. Restricted in amount or type of work I can do; 3. Not restricted in amount or type of
work I can do. In spite of the difference in the manner in which these questions are asked,
prevalence rates from the BHPS, LFS, and FRS are remarkably close
Thus in our view any conflicts that emerge amongst these surveys in estimates of the
prevalence of the work disabled population appear not to be due to the form of the disability
questions. One possible explanation is that the greater concentration on health content in the
NHIS alerts their respondents to health issues and results in higher reporting of disability,
although differences in sampling frames may be a more likely explanation.3

Some evidence is available from ELSA which experimented with placing the general health status questions before and after
the detailed set of questions that inquired about a long list of possible health problems.. There was some tendency to report better

7

Our next set of experiments was conducted using the Dutch CentERpanel, which includes
about 2,000 households who have agreed to respond to a set of questions every weekend over the
Internet. Unlike the RAND HRS Internet panel, this Dutch sample is not restricted to households
with their own Internet access. If they agree to participate and do not currently have Internet
access, they are provided Internet access.4 One advantage of the Dutch Internet panel is that
these respondents had already answered many questions about their lives, including questions
about their health, demographics and labor force activity. In this project, we carried out a number
of experiments over about a six-month period. These included the vignette experiments, which
are reported on below, test-retest experiments, and experiments with question wording. The
experiments took place mid-August, mid-October, and mid-December 2003.
For example, in the second round of the CentERpanel vignette disability experiments
(mid-October 2003), we conducted another experiment about question wording. Randomly, half
of CentERpanel respondents in the second wave of our vignette experiments were given the HRS
disability question whereby one answered on a yes no basis to the disability question. In the first
round (mid-August 2003) the same question had been asked with a five point response scale, as
noted above. Given that the first and second waves of our experiments were only a few months
apart so that disability reports should not change that much, for these respondents one can
compare the answers to this question to that given on the 5-point scale a few months earlier.
The results are presented in Table 2.2. For all but one row in the 5-point scale, the
correspondence is remarkably close. Ninety-six percent of those who answered they were not at
all disabled on the 5-point scale also said that they were not when using the HRS dichotomous

general health status when the questions were placed at the end but the principal difference was that there were fewer respondents
at either tail of the five point general health scale when the questions were at the end.

scale. Similarly, more than 90% of Dutch respondents who said that they were more than
somewhat limited replied that they had a work disability on the American 2-point scale.
The ambiguity occurs within the somewhat limited category, which splits about 50/50
when offered an opportunity to simply respond yes or no about their work disability. These are
people who are clearly on the margin in terms of their work disability problems. When offered a
stark yes or no choice, some will resist disability labeling. But if given a more nuanced set of
alternatives, they report some degree of disability.

Since this somewhat limited group represent just under a quarter of Dutch respondents,
the implication is that reports of disability prevalence are considerably lower if the 2-point scale
is used in place of the 5-point scale. Table 2.3 shows reported US disability rates by age (from
the PSID) alongside those in the UK (from the Labor Force Survey) and the Dutch disability
rates using the 5 and 2-point scale obtained from CentERpanel. Especially during middle age, the
Dutch have the highest rates of self-reported work disability, followed by the British, with the
Americans having the lowest rates. While estimates of Dutch disability prevalence using the
dichotomous scale are still much higher than that observed in the United States, a significant
fraction of the disparity could be explained by the format of the disability scale. However,
especially for middle age workers—say those between ages 45-64—Dutch rates of reported work
9

disability are still about 15 percentage points higher than those in the United States even when
the same question is asked in both countries.

3. Pain and Work Disability
In this section, we discuss the central role played by pain as a potential determinant of
work disability. The amount and type of pain information available differs in several ways
across the countries we study. Rather than going straight to the lowest common denominator by
restricting our analysis to information that is available and identical in all three countries, we
take the alternative strategy of using the best information that each country has to offer. While
comparability across countries will not be exact, this will still provide the most useful
information about the relative importance of pain in affecting work disability.
More so than many specific diseases, pain has subjective and objective aspects.
Objectively, in a reaction to a variety of stimuli, pain is started when energy is converted into
electrical energy (nerve impulses) by sensory receptors called nociceptors. These neural signals
are then transmitted to the spinal cord and brain, which perceives them as pain. Some pain
medications or analgesics can inhibit nociception and thereby lessen or even eliminate the
sensation of pain. Even without medication, individuals differ in how they access, interpret, and

10

tolerate pain so that there may well be a significant subjective component to the reporting of
pain, both within and across countries. As shown below, pain also varies in its severity,
duration, and location, all of which may have different implications for the tolerance and
perception of pain and for work disability.5
With this in mind, Table 3.1 provides information about the prevalence and types of pain
people experience in the US, the Netherlands, and the UK respectively. Unless otherwise
indicated, all data in this table refers to individuals ages 25 and over. Pain prevalence rates are
also stratified by gender, education, and age. Just like work disability, commonly used questions
used to ascertain whether an individual has pain or not also vary a good deal in their format and
wording, both across different surveys within countries and across countries. However, unlike
the form of questions on work disability, the specific language used in pain questions appears to
really matter a lot. For example, the most basic question asked in the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) in the United States about pain was whether an individual had any recurring pain
during the last twelve months while the most comparable question in the Dutch CentERpanel
was “Are you often troubled by pain? We will refer to this question form as the ‘recurrent pain’
question.
Another common form in which pain questions are asked involves inquiring about the
presence of pain in specific parts of the body from which an aggregate of pain can be deduced.
The American and Dutch surveys used the same parts of the body- neck, back, face or jaw,
joints, and headaches. The British survey only asks about migraine. However, these questions
tend to ask about the presence of pain over shorter periods of time- for example in the American
NHIS the reference period used is the last three months, in the Dutch panel the last thirty days
are used. We will refer to this question form as the ‘recent pain’ question.

The situation in England is more complicated. The 1999 British Household Survey
(BHPS) contained the SF-36 questionnaire (Ware and Sherbourne, 1992). As a consequence all
respondents were asked ‘How much bodily pain have you had during the past 4 weeks?’ where
the allowed responses follow a six-point scale - None, Very mild, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very
severe. In addition, a second item of the SF36 (again delivered to all respondents) asks ‘During
the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal work (including both work
outside the home and housework)?’ where five possible responses (Not at all, A little bit,
Moderately, Quite a bit, Extremely) are allowed. This SF36 questionnaire has not yet been
delivered again to BHPS respondents. However, in the 2001 wave of the BHPS, respondents
were asked ‘Are you regularly troubled by pain?’ - a question that is quite similar to the one
asked in the Dutch CentERpanel. Unfortunately, this question was only asked of respondents
ages 50 and over. Those reporting Yes to this question are asked how often they are troubled by
pain (Every day, At least once a week, Once a month, Less often), and how they would describe
pain (Mild, Moderate or Severe). In summary, all BHPS respondents were asked in the 1999
wave a form of the ‘recent pain’ question while BHPS respondents in the 2001 wave age 50 and
over were asked a version of the ‘recurrent pain’ question.
In all three countries, prevalence rates are considerably lower with the ‘recurrent pain’
than in the ‘recent pain’ formulation. For example, while one in five adult Americans report
some form of recurring pain during the last year, about half of them report having pain
somewhere during the last three months. Similarly, while a little more than a quarter of adult
Dutch respondents said that they were often troubled by pain, sixty percent of them reported that
they had some pain some place during the last thirty days.

12

There are several possible reasons for this difference. First, the use of words such as
“recurring” or “often” may imply a higher pain threshold, especially in its temporal duration, that
‘recent pain’ questions cannot match. Reflecting a standard result from retrospective memory
studies, recent pain may also be more likely to be recalled, thereby increasing its reported
prevalence. Finally, any ‘recent pain’ is calculated by going through specific types of pain like
back pain which because it is less vague and more specific may stimulate recall. This is quite
similar to findings that total consumption measures that are computed by asking about specific
consumption items yield higher consumption totals than a catch all single total consumption
question (see Browning, Crossley and Weber, 2003).
In whatever form the pain question is asked, there are several key similarities among the
countries. In each country, women are much more likely to report that they suffer from pain than
men are, pain prevalence declines significantly as education increases, and the age gradient in
pain is actually quite muted. If we compare Dutch, Americans and British using the more
comparable ‘recent pain’ formulation, prevalence levels of pain appear higher in the Netherlands
than in the other two countries.
Table 3.1 also documents that pain in the joints and back pain are the most common types
of pain that people report in both the Netherlands and the United States. All forms of pain
including joint and back pain have very pronounced negative gradients across education groups.
Finally, all types of pain are more prevalent among women than they are amongst men, and in all
three countries, severe headaches or migraines appear to especially be a problem for women. For
example, more than a third of Dutch women report that they suffer from headaches compared to
less than one-in-six Dutch men.

13

Individuals also differ in the severity of the pain that they experience. Table 3.2
summarizes the respondents’ assessments of the severity of the pain that they experience, with
that assessment placed into three categories—light, moderate, and heavy. While the specific
scales used to place individuals within these three groups differ between the countries, the
patterns that emerge across groups are quite similar. In each country, there is a great deal of
variation amongst people in how they evaluate the severity of the pain that they experience.
Women are more likely to say that they experience more severe pain and in all three countries
less educated individuals are more likely to state that their pain was not light.
Using the alternative forms of the definitions of pain used in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, Table
3.3 documents the relationship between the presence of pain and the report of a work disability.

cross-tabular relationships suggest that pain is a very powerful correlate of work disability. No
matter which specific definition of pain is used, those who claim that they suffer from pain are
much more likely to also say that they have a work disability. To illustrate using the recurrent
15

pain question, Dutch respondents who say that they are often troubled with pain are almost four
times as likely to say they are work disabled than those who do not have pain (64.9% compared
to 16.9%). That difference is even larger among Americans (35.7% compared to 7.5%). Just as in
the other two countries work disability in

Source: US – National Health Interview Survey 2002. US respondents were asked to rank their pain on a scale of
0-10 with 0 being no pain and 10 very bad pain. This numerical scale was converted as follows 0-3 + Light, 4-7 =
Moderate, 8-10 = Heavy. Netherlands – CentERpanel, December 2004. Dutch respondents were asked to rank their
pain into one of the three categories listed in this table. UK – 1999 British Household Panel Survey. Respondents
were asked to rank from 0 to 5, where 0 is No Pain in the last 4 weeks. Sample is those who do not report No Pain.
We convert that ranking as follows 2-3 = Light, 4= Moderate, 5-6 = Heavy. UK respondents were asked to rank
from 1 to 5. We convert that ranking as follows 1-2 = Light, 3= Moderate, 4-5 = Heavy.

the UK is around four times higher for those with general pain than for those without. And as in
the other countries when looking at specific pain, in this case migraine, the differences between
those with and without such pain are still apparent although the relative risk of work disability is
somewhat lower.
All forms of pain that we measured appear to be strongly associated with work disability.
Recurrent pain appears to be somewhat more strongly associated with work disability, and
16

among the alternative types of pain that are included in our surveys joint pain appears to have the
strongest association. Not surprisingly respondents’ report of the severity of pain is quite crucial
for whether a work disability is also reported. For example, among Americans those with heavy
pain are four times more likely to say that they are work disabled than those who categorize their
pain as only light. If anything, this difference is even larger in the Dutch sample. Even after one
controls for the degree of pain severity, those in lower education groups are much more likely to
report that the pain results in a work disability.
Pain is certainly not the only thing that matters for work disability. Therefore, we next
estimated probit models of the probability that a respondent reported having a work disability.
The American models are listed in Table 3.4A, the corresponding Dutch estimates are in Table
3.4B, and the British models in Table 3.4C. In addition to variables that capture some aspect of
pain, these models include

Source: United States – National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 2002. All places of pain are defined over the last three
months except joint pain which is defined over the last 30 days. Any pain in last three months includes the one-month joint pain.
Each cell presents the percentage of respondents with work disability. For instance the entry 35.7 indicates that among those
with recurring pain in the last 12 months, 35.7% reports to be work disabled; the entry 7.5 indicates that among those who do not
report a recurring pain in the last 12 months only 7.5% reports to be work disabled. Netherlands – CentERpanel, December
2004. Each of the specific types of pain are during the last 30 days and any pain in last 30 days means at least one type. United
Kingdom – British Household Panel Survey 1999.

First number: pain in joints only; second number: most serious type of pain (of the five types).

measures of a standard set of demographic attributes (gender, education, marital status, and age)
as well as a list of as many chronic health conditions that are available in the data (hypertension,
diabetes, cancer, diseases of the lung, heart problem, stroke, emotional problems and arthritis).
In each country three variants of the model were estimated—one with an indicator of
pain, the second which categorizes the severity of this pain, and the third of which includes
indicators of the location of pain. As mentioned above, places of pain are not available in the
UK, so in its stead we include a second variant where the pain threshold is moderate pain or
worse. All tables list estimated coefficients, derivatives, and z values of estimated differences
from zero in the three countries.
We first discuss the non-pain variables in these models. The Dutch samples are much
smaller than those available in the other two countries. Putting that caveat aside and given the
differences in the institutional context in each country and especially the diverse manner in
which the pain questions are formulated, one is struck by the basic similarity in model estimates
across the three countries. In these models in all three countries, work disability falls
significantly with education level, rises with age, and is lower among married respondents. The
only demographic difference that emerges concerns gender. In the US work disability is lower
among women (statistically significant) while it is not different by gender in the other two
countries. Finally, all the health problems included in these models appear generally to have
independent and statistically significant effects on work disability.
Pain turns out to be the most important predictor of work disability in all three countries.
Moreover pain- in each of the forms in which we measure it (place of pain and its severity)- is a
statistically significant independent predictors of work disability.

22

Our goal with these models is twofold—to uncover the principal factors that led to a
report of work disability and to isolate the sources of the international difference in reported
work disability. To see how we accomplish this goal, consider for example an evaluation of the
impact of a single health condition j. Let P(A) and P(B) be the (predicted) work disability rates in
country A and country B (for a given age group) and let P( A) − j and P( B) − j the predicted work
disabilities in countries A and B for the “counterfactual” situation that nobody would suffer from
health problem j. P( A) − P ( A)− j can then be interpreted as the work disability rate in country A
due to that health problem and similarly for country B. Note that this assignment of importance
to this health condition depends both on the prevalence of the health problem and on the
sensitivity of the probability of work disability to that health problem (i.e., on the corresponding
coefficients in β A ); we will separate these two below.
The difference in work disabilities in the two countries can be expressed using the
following decomposition:
P( B ) − P( A) = [ P( B ) − j − P( A) − j ] + [ P( B ) − P( B ) − j ] − [ P( A) − P( A) − j ]
The first term on the right hand side can be interpreted as the difference between work disability
prevalence in the two countries that is not due to the chosen health problem. The sum of the
second and third term is then the part that is due to the chosen health condition. The latter two
terms can be further separated in a ‘prevalence’ effect (the percentage with the health problem)
and an ‘impact ’ effect (the impact of the health problem on work disability). We can write:
P( A) − P( A) − j = 1
[
i∈A

xij / N A ][

i∈A, xij =1

N A i∈A

{g ( xi , bA ) − g ( xi− j , bA )} =

∆g ( xi , bA ) /

i∈A

xij ]

23

where g ( xi , bA ) is the probability of having the health condition for an individual with
characteristics xi and parameter vector bA .
The first factor is the fraction in country A that suffers from the chosen health problem
(the “quantity effect” for country A). In the second term, ∆g ( xi , bA ) is the marginal effect
(“partial derivative”) for a dummy variable, the difference if it is set to 1 or 0, with other
variables set to their values for observation i. Thus the second term can be seen as the average
marginal effect for those who have the health problem.
The same decomposition can be used for all co-variates in the model (both health and
non-health dummy variables) allowing us to compare the importance of each to the reported rates
of work disability in each country and the difference between the three countries.
Table 3.5 presents a summary of the relative contributions of different sets of factors
toward explaining the differences between the three countries in reported rates of work disability.
For this relative asssement, we divide covariates into five groups— the so called ‘objective’
health factors (hypertension, diabetes, cancer, diseases of the lung), heart problems and stroke,
arthritis, emotional problems, and pain. The first three columns in Table 3.5 assess the
‘importance’ of each factor to explaining work disability in the Netherlands, the United States,
and the United Kingdom. The final two columns assess the contribution of each factor toward
explaining the differences between countries using the Netherlands as the reference group.
Separate assessements are performed for each of the three models estimated for each country in
Table 3.4.
In each of the three countries, pain is by far the most important factor explaining reported
rates of work disability. This is especially true for the Netherlands and the UK where observed
work disability rates are higher than in the US. Moreover, as summarized by the ‘all pain’ row

24

the estimated role of pain rises when we estimate models which differentiate between the degree
of pain (light, moderate, and heavy) and the location of pain in the body. Joint pain and to a
somewhat lesser degree back pain are the most central types of pain in explaining rates of work
disability.
The most important columns in Table 3.5 are the final two which summarize the role of
each set of factors toward explaining differences in work disability between the countries. Once
again compared to either the Netherlands or the United Kingdom, pain predicts much lower rates
of work disability in the United States. This is in part due to the lower pain prevalence in the US
and in part due to the lower effect of pain on work disabiltity in the United States compared to
the other two countries. In explaining lower rates of work disability in the Untied States, pain is
by far the most important factor of those listed in Table 3.5. Why individuals in the United States
respond less to pain than residents of the other two countries will be the central question in the
next two sections.
4. Pain Medication and Workplace Accommodation
How pain translates into a personal assessment of a work disability may be affected by
pain medication and the types of accommodations available in the workplace to deal with any
impairment. If pain medication alone sufficiently alleviates the symptoms and severity of the
pain, individuals may not feel that they actually have a work disability. Similarly, if
accommodations are available at work so that the impairment does not affect the daily routines
of work or how productive a worker is, individuals may also believe that their problems are not
relevant to their current work situation. In both situations, individuals may answer a question on
whether they have a work disability in the negative even though without medication or
accommodation they would have one. Moreover, both the use and availability of pain

25

medication or the extent of accommodations available at work may well vary across the three
countries we are studying. If they do, these two factors may account for some of the differences
in reported work disability across these countries. To investigate this possibility, we present
information in this section on the role of pain medication and workplace accommodation in each
of our three countries.
Pain Medication
To help answer these questions, we added a pain module to the December 2004 wave of
the Dutch CentERpanel. To the question on whether they were ‘often troubled by pain,’
respondents could answer (1) yes, (2) no because I use pain medication, and (3) no and I do not
need pain medication. If people respond ‘yes’, there was a follow-up question that inquired about
whether they ‘used pain medication to combat the pain.’ That sequence of questions allows us to
estimate how many people troubled by pain are using pain medication and how effective that
medication is in eliminating the pain.
The results are listed in Table 4.1. The use of pain medication is actually very
widespread in the Netherlands and the use of this medication affects the reporting of pain. While
26.5% of respondents reported that they were often troubled with pain, that fraction would grow
to 37.4% if we included those

whose pain medication eliminated the pain. Among the Dutch respondents who either had pain
or would have had pain without medication, 69% were taking medication for this pain.
Moreover, the use of this medication was quite effective. Within this group, 42% of Dutch
respondents had no pain at all. Using this definition of effectiveness, pain medication appears
equally effective for women and men, but appears to have eliminated pain completely in a larger

27

fraction of the more educated Dutch respondents. This may be due to the fact that their pain was
less severe.
Unfortunately, the pain medication questions in the US and the UK are not strictly
comparable to those in the Netherlands. For the US we use data from NHANES, which asked
similar questions about the location of pain (neck, back, headaches, joint, face) during the last
three months as described above for the NHIS. The advantage of NHANES is that it also
contains a detailed set of questions about all types of medications. The non-comparability with
the Dutch sample derives from the fact that we have already

Source: Netherlands – CentERpanel, December 2004. United States – NHANES 1999-2000. Pain is defined as
some form of pain in the last three months, including neck, face, back, headaches, or joint pain. United Kingdom –
ELSA 2004. Sample is aged 50 in 2002.

demonstrated that this form of the pain question elicits much higher prevalence rates than the
‘recurrent’ pain question. This expansion in pain prevalence no doubt includes many less serious
forms of pain.
For the UK we use new data from the latest wave of the English Longitudinal Study of
Ageing (ELSA), which contains detailed questions on certain types of pain alleviation as part of

29

their questions on the use and efficacy of health care services. In this case the non-comparabilty
arises for three reasons. Firstly, only individuals reporting moderate or severe pain are asked
general questions about pain medication. Second, for both general and specific types of pain
medication, the ELSA questions relate solely to medication or treatment prescribed by a
respondent’s doctor or nurse. Finally, the ELSA sample consists of individuals aged 50 and over
in 2002, as opposed to being an age-representative sample such as the NHANES or CentER
panel.
These important caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting the second and third
panels of Table 4.1, illustrating the extent of pain medication in the US and the UK respectively.
Among those with pain or without the symptoms of pain due to medication, a much smaller
proportion of Americans (41.3%) are taking pain medication. When they do take medication, it
also appears to be less effective in completely eliminating pain symptoms than it was for Dutch
respondents. In the UK, an even lower fraction report receiving medication than in the US (even
when the definition of pain medication in the US is limited to prescription painkillers only). This
effect may even be somewhat underestimated since those in mild pain (who presumably have an
even lower rate of medication) are routed out of the ELSA questions. On the other hand, those
receiving medication are much more likely than those in both the US and the Netherlands to
report that the medication controls their pain. Once again, comparability of question wording
may be an issue here. If ‘controlled’ pain equates to mild pain, then such cases will be
differentially recorded across the different surveys.
Despite the relative lack of comparability of these data, the relevance of their overall
message to the questions addressed in this paper is clear. While we observe a much lower
prevalence of work disability and pain in the US and the UK compared to the levels observed in

30

the Netherlands, it is not due to a higher rate of (successful) medication in the US and the UK. If
anything, the differences across countries appear to go the other way.
Workplace Accommodation
In December 2004, we fielded a module on work disability in the Dutch CentERpanel
that was based on one already used in ELSA. This module posed a series of questions on work
place accommodations to all respondents who were not self-employed and who had worked
during the last decade. These respondents were asked if they had ever asked their employer to
make an accommodation, whether their employer had ever offered to make an accommodation,
and whether their employer had ever made an accommodation. The types of accommodation
inquired about included making work less physically demanding, less mentally
demanding/stressful, reducing hours worked/ arranging job-sharing, making working hours more
flexible, allowing work from home, p

pecial equipment and other such adaptations to

the workplace that make it easier to keep working.
A unique aspect of this module is that this series of questions were asked of all
respondents, whether or not they currently have a work disability. As will be the case with the
American and British survey on workplace accommodations discussed below, the standard
practice is to restrict these questions to those who said that they had a work place disability. The
advantage of the protocol used in Dutch panels is that it provides a complete description of the
availability of work place accommodations in the work force. For example, if the provision of
effective work place accommodations induced some respondents to say that they did not have a
work place disability, we would never be able to know that with questions limited to those with a
work place disability.

31

Tables 4.2 and 4.3 summarize the responses from the Dutch respondents from the work
accommodation module. Table 4.2 provides the data on the full set of respondents while Table
4.3 is limited to the subset that reports that they have a work disability.
There are no salient differences by age in these patterns of work place accommodations.
The principal differences that emerge by gender have to do with flexibility of hours where
women are more likely to ask and to have had adjustments in their work hours. However, this
pattern is only apparent in the full sample, which suggests that the differential gender treatment
is largely due to other matters (such as family responsibilities) rather than work disabilities.
Within the work disabled sub-sample, women are more likely to have had adjustments in their
physical workplace while men are more likely to have equipment adjustments.
There are much stronger differences by education that appear in both the full and work
disability samples. Those in the lower education category are much more likely to have asked
for, been offered, and received physical and equipment adjustments in their workplace
environment. For example, among those with a work disability 32% of less educated Dutch
respondents had a physical adjustment to their workplace compared to only 16% of the higher
educated respondents.
The final two rows in these tables provide a summary of the Dutch respondents
assessment of whether or not these workplace accommodations were helpful. When there were
workplace accommodations, more than three quarters of respondents thought that the
adjustments were useful and when there were no workplace adjustments a third of respondents
still believed that the adjustments would have helped if they had been made.
As explained above, questions on workplace accommodations in American surveys are
limited to those with a work disability. Perhaps, the best module was placed into the HRS, where

32

a set of questions was asked about workplace accomodations for those with a work disability.
These questions were asked whether or not the individual was currently employed. If not
currently employed, the questions referred to the last time of employment.
Table 4.4 based on the HRS provides a description of the types of help provided by
employers. These data in the HRS sample are most comparable with data from the Dutch
samples above that are restricted to those with a current work disability and who are older
workers (45-64 in the Dutch sample). Similar to the Dutch case, gender differences in workplace
accommodation in the US are small. But in sharp contrast to the Dutch data, there is also almost
no education gradient to the use of workplace accommodation in the United States. Most
importantly, workplace accommodations are far less common

board, but it is especially pronounced for equipment and physical changes in the workplace.

who are currently employed, Table 4.5 contains the most directly comparable data for all three
countries. In this table both the Dutch and American data are also limited to those who are

The first panel of Table 4.5 summarizes the responses from the Dutch respondents from
the work accommodation module. To enhance comparability across surveys we select the sample
of older respondents who report a work disability but who were also working at the time of the
survey. The principal differences that emerge by gender have to do with the physical nature of
work, where women

are less likely to have had adjustments, and in flexibility of hours and special equipment, where
women are more likely to have had adjustments. Differences by education are also apparent. As
before, those in the lower education category are much more likely to have asked for, to have
been offered, and to have received physical and equipment adjustments in their work place
environment.
The 2004 Wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing contains the same questions
on workplace accomodation, although due to the design of the survey, some individuals are
routed out of some of the items. In Table 4.5 we show similar descriptive statistics to those from
the Netherlands for the ELSA sample (which is aged 52 and over in 2004). The first three lines
of this table establish some basic patterns in the data. As observed in earlier sections of this paper
the prevalence of work disability is high, and higher amongst the low education group than the
high education group. In addition, conditional on reporting a work disability, the high education

36

group is substantially more likely to work, but conditional on having a work disability and being
in work, the two education groups are equally likely to report that their work disability limits
their activities in the current job.
What is apparent from the across country comparison in Tables 4.5 is that both overall
levels and the patterns across accomodations and across gender and education subgroups are
quite different in the UK from those observed in the Netherlands. Individuals working with a
work disability in the UK are much less likely to have received modifications to their work
environment in the UK. The overall level of accommodations is twice as high in the Netherlands
as in the UK, and the differences are even greater when looking at each individual type of
accommodation separately. Perhaps more surprisingly, the differences by gender and education
are reversed. In the UK it is women, and the highly educated, who are most likely to have
received workplace accommodations (conditional on working), whereas in the Netherlands these
groups have a lower likelihood of workplace accommodation. Once again, evidence from the
US, presented in panel C of Table 4.5, reveals similarities between the US and the UK and
differences to the Netherlands. Table 4.3 based on the HRS baseline data provides a description
of the types of help provided by employers. The overall level of employer accommodation is
lower even than in the UK (although it should be remembered that the HRS baseline data was
collected in 1992, some twelve years before the ELSA data presented for the UK). As in the UK,
women are more likely to receive accommodations, but as in the Netherlands it is the more
educated that are more likely to receive workplace accommodations in the US.
This section began by offering the possibility that some of the difference in work
disability prevalence among these three countries was due to differences in the use of either pain
medications or work place accommodations. If the use of pain medications or work place

37

accommodations was more common in America that could partially explain the lower rates of
reported work disability in the United States. However, if anything, the patterns go the other way
with less frequent use of work accommodations and medication in the United States. Apparently,
explanations for lower reported rates of work disability in the United States must lie elsewhere.
5. Vignettes
If differential use of pain medication and work place accommodation across countries
cannot explain across country differences in work disability prevalence that we documented in
section 3, what may explain it? In this section we present and apply a new methodology that
aims at uncovering differences across countries in their norms and attitudes toward work
disability. This new methodology relies on the use of vignettes.
We first provide an intuitive description of the use of vignettes for identifying reporting
biases, following King, Murray, Salomon and Tandon (2004). Their model shows how vignettes
can help to identify systematic differences in response scales between groups (or countries),
making it possible to decompose observed differences in, for example, self-reported health in a
specific domain into differences due to response scale variation and genuine differences in
health. Our analysis applies this model to work limiting disability rather than health. Vignette
evaluations were collected in The Netherlands in the fall of2003, and in the US in early 2004.
Work disability vignettes for the UK are not available yet. Thus we can only compare the US and
The Netherlands.
5.1. Using Vignettes to Identify Response Scales in Pain
The basic idea of the model is sketched in Figure 1. It presents the distribution of (workrelated) health in two countries. The density of the continuous health variable in country A is to
the left of that in country B, implying that on average, people in country A are less healthy than

38

in country B. The people in the two countries, however, use different response scales if asked to
report their health on a five-point scale (poor-fair-good-very good-excellent, say). In our
example, people in country A have a much more

positive view on a given health status than people in country B. For example, someone in
country A with the health indicated by the dashed line would report to be in very good health,
while a person in country B with the same actual health would report “fair.” The frequency
distribution of the self-reports in the two countries would suggest that people in country A are
healthier than those in country B—the opposite of the actual health distribution. Correcting for
the differences in the response scales (DIF, “differential item functioning,” in the terminology of
King et al. 2004) is essential to compare the actual health distributions in the two countries.
Vignettes can be used to do the correction. A vignette question describes the health of a
hypothetical person and then asks the respondent to evaluate that person’s health on the same
five-point scale that was used for the self-report. For example, respondents can be asked to
evaluate the health of a person whose health is given by the dashed line. In country A, this will
be evaluated as “very good.” In country B, the evaluation would be “fair.” Since the actual health
description of the vignette person is the same in the two countries, the difference in the
evaluations must be due to DIF. Vignette evaluations thus help to identify the differences
between the response scales in the two countries. Using the scales in one of the two countries as
the benchmark, the distribution of evaluations in the other country can be adjusted by evaluating
them on the benchmark scale. The underlying assumption is response consistency: a given
respondent uses the same scale for the self-reports and the vignette evaluations.
The corrected distribution of the evaluations can then be compared to that in the
benchmark country—they are now on the same scale. In the example in the figure, this will lead
to the correct conclusion that people in country B are healthier than those in country A, on
average. King et al. (2004) develop parametric and nonparametric models that make it possible
to perform the correction. They apply their method to, for example, political efficacy and visual

41

acuity. Their results strongly support the ability of the vignettes to correct for DIF. For example,
in a comparative study of political efficacy of Chinese and Mexican citizens, they find that
without correction the Chinese seem to have more political influence than the Mexicans. The
conclusion reverses if the correction is applied.7
5.2 Econometric Model
The model explains respondents’ self-reports on work limitations and their reports on
work limitations of hypothetical vignette persons. The first is the answer (Yri, i indicates
respondent i) to the question
“Do you have any impairment or health problem that limits the type or amount of
work that you can do?”
In our data for the US, the answers are given on a “yes/no” scale. In the Dutch data, respondents
answer this question both on a “yes/no” scale and on a five points scale, with answers “no, not at
all” (Yri =1), “yes, I am somewhat limited” (Yri =2), “yes, I am moderately limited” (Yri =3), “yes,
I am very limited” (Yri =4) and “yes, I am so seriously limited that I am not able to work”
(Yri =5).

7

More applications to health are discussed in Salomon, Tandon, and Murray (2004).

Table 2.2 suggests that there is some random error in the two-point and/or five-point
scale evaluations that is not transferred to the other scale. To account for this, we use the
following equations for the respondent’s own work limiting disability, partitioning the error term
in a genuine unobserved component of work disability affecting both the two-point and the fivepoint scale reports, and an idiosyncratic error term affecting only one report and independent of
everything else:
Genuine work disability:
Yri* = X i β + ε ri ; ε ri

N (0, σ r2 ), ε ri independent of X i , Vi

Five-point scale self-reports:
Yri = j if τ i j −1 < Yri* + ui5 ≤ τ i j , j = 1,...5

43

Two-point scale self-reports:
Yri = 0 if Yri* + ui2 ≤ τ i (2); Yri = 1 if Yri* + ui2 > τ i (2)

ui2 , N (0, σ u22 ); ui5

N (0, σ u55 ); ui2 , ui5 independent of each other and of other errors (such as ε ri ) )

The thresholds τ ij between the categories of the five-point scale are given by

τ i0 = −∞, τ i5 = ∞, τ i1 = γ 1Vi , τ i j = τ i j −1 + exp(γ jVi ), j = 2, 3, 4
The fact that different respondents can use different response scales is called “differential item
functioning” (DIF). As in the King et al. model, we assume that response scales can vary only
with observed characteristics Vi, including a country dummy and interactions with that country
dummy. The exponentials guarantee that the thresholds increase with j.
In order to link the two-point scale and the five-point scale, we use the fact that the the
cut-off point between “yes” and “no” for the two-point scale is somewhere between the cut-off
points between “no” and “mildly” and “mildly” and “moderately” for the five-point scale. In line
with this, we model the cut-off point τ i (2) on the two-point scale as a weighted mean of the two
first cut-off points on the five-point scale:

τ i (2) = λτ i1 + (1 − λ )τ i2
We assume that the weight λ does not vary with individual characteristics and is the
same in the US and the Netherlands. Thus the thresholds on the five-point scale and the
thresholds on the two-point scale can have completely different structures in the two countries,
but the relation between them is the same. If the Dutch have lower thresholds on the five-point
scale, they also have a lower threshold on the two-point scale, etc. This assumption is needed as
long as there are no five-point scale self-reports on the five-point scale for the US. Intuitively, it
seems clear that the parameter λ can be identified from the Dutch self-reports on both scales.

44

In the United States as well as the Netherlands, the questions on work limitations of the
vignette persons have the same five answering categories as the five-point scale self-report, and
are formulated in the same way (“Does Mr/Mrs X have any impairment or health problem that
limits the type or amount of work that he or she can do?”). The answers will be denoted by Yli
where each respondent i evaluates a number of vignettes l=1,…,L.
The evaluations of vignettes l=1,…,L are modeled using a similar ordered response
model:
Yli* = θ l + θ Femaleli + ε li
Yli = j if τ i j −1 < Yli* ≤ τ i j , j = 1,...5

ε li

N (0, σ 2 ), independent of each other, of ε ri and of X i , Vi

An important assumption is that the thresholds

i

j

are the same for the five-point self-reports and

the vignettes (“response consistency”). This is the basis for why vignettes help to identify DIF
and help to correct for reporting differences.
The second assumption of King et al. (2004) is that Yli* doesn’t vary with respondent
attributes in any systematic way, it only varies with vignette characteristics given in the
descriptions of the vignettes (captured by a vignette specific constant θ l and a dummy for the
gender of the vignette person).
Given these assumptions, vignette evaluations can be used to identify and γ (=γ 1 ,...γ 5 )
if all questions were asked on the five-point scale: From the vignette evaluations alone, ,

θ , θ1 ,...θ 5 can be identified (up to the usual normalization of scale and location). From the selfreports, can then be identified in addition. Thus the vignettes can be used to solve the
identification problem due to DIF. The two-step procedure is sketched only to make intuitively

45

clear why the model is identified. In practice, all parameters will be estimated simultaneously by
maximum likelihood, which is asymptotically efficient.
Correcting for DIF is straightforward once the parameters are estimated. Define a
benchmark respondent with characteristics Vi = V(B). (For example, choose one of the countries
as the benchmark country.) The DIF correction would now involve comparing Yri* to the
thresholds τ Bj rather than τ i j , where τ Bj is obtained in the same way as τ i j but using V(B) instead
of Vi. Thus a respondent’s work-related health is computed using the benchmark scale instead of
the respondent’s own scale. This does not lead to a corrected score for each individual
respondent (since Yri* is not observed) but it can simulate corrected distributions of Yri for the
whole population or conditional upon some of the characteristics in Vi and or Xi. Of course the
corrected distribution will depend upon the chosen benchmark.
5.3. Data and Vignette Questions

To estimate the model comparing work disability in the US and the Netherlands, three
data sets are combined: the Dutch CentERpanel (waves 1, 2 and 3, in August, October and
December 2003), the US RAND MS Internet panel, and the US HRS wave 1. They all have
different age selections (all age groups in CentERpanel; 40+ in RAND MS Internet Panel; 51-61
in HRS), but since we condition on age, this should not be a problem. CentERpanel and RAND
MS have exactly the same vignette questions on pain problems, emotional problems, and cardiovascular disease. HRS wave 1 has no vignettes. In this paper, we only use the vignettes on pain
problems.
In August 2003, we have collected work disability self-reports and vignette evaluations in
the Dutch CentERpanel, which allows researchers to include short modules of experimental
questions. This feature has been used to collect our data on work disability. The Internet

46

infrastructure makes the CentERpanel an extremely valuable tool to conduct experiments, with
possibilities for randomization of content, wording, question and response order, and regular
revisions of the design. Production lags are very short, with less than a month between module
design and data delivery. Based upon our first analysis, we have fielded a second wave in
October with different wordings of the vignette questions. In this paper we use the self–reports
on work disability collected in the first wave (August 2003) and we use vignette data from both
waves (August and October 2003). The vignettes on pain are presented in Table 5.1. All of them
deal with back pain. The first two describe relatively light problems; the other three describe
more serious problems.
Table 5.1
Vignette Descriptions on Pain Problems
1. [Katie] occasionally feels back pain at work, but this has not happened for the last several
months now. If she feels back pain, it typically lasts only for a few days.
2. [Catherine] suffers from back pain that causes stiffness in her back especially at work but
is relieved with low doses of medication. She does not have any pains other than this
generalized discomfort.
3. [Yvonne] has almost constant pain in her back and this sometimes prevents her from
doing her work.
4. [Jim] has back pain that makes changes in body position while he is working very
uncomfortable. He is unable to stand or sit for more than half an hour. Medicines
decrease the pain a little, but it is there all the time and interferes with his ability to carry
out even day-to-day tasks at work.
5. [Mark] has pain in his back and legs, and the pain is present almost all the time. It gets
worse while he is working. Although medication helps, he feels uncomfortable when
moving around, holding and lifting things at work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The vignette questions in Table 5.1 were also fielded in the RAND MS Internet panel, an
Internet survey for US respondents aged 40 and over. Table 5.2 presents the vignette evaluations
in the US and the Netherlands. In both countries, the frequency distributions of evaluations
reflect that vignettes 1 and 2 describe less serious problems than vignettes 3, 4 and 5. Still, there
47

are some substantial differences in the evaluations between the two countries. In particular, for
the first two vignettes, the US respondents much more often report that the described persons
have no limitation at all, where the Dutch respondents have a larger tendency to use the
intermediate categories “mildly” and “moderately.” The same tendency towards the extremes in
the US and towards the middle for the Netherlands is seen in the fourth vignette, describing a
person with relatively serious work limitations. The US respondents much more often evaluate
this person as severely or extremely limited, where the Dutch still tend to use the answer
“moderately.” This suggests that correcting for response scale differences could reduce the
difference in self-reported health distributions between the two countries.

5.4. Estimation Results

Estimation results of the complete model are presented in Table 5.3. The equations for
work disability and for the thresholds all include a complete set of interactions with the country
dummy for the Netherlands. Vignette evaluation equations and the auxiliary parameters
introduced above concerning the transformation from the two-point to the five-point scale do not
include such interactions. Panel A of Table 5.3 presents the results for the work disability
equation in the complete model and in a model without any form of DIF, in which thresholds do

48

not vary by country, individual characteristics, or health conditions. The latter model is clearly
rejected against the complete model by a likelihood ratio test.
Education level in the US is more important according to the complete model than in the
model without DIF. The explanation is that the pain vignettes indicate that in the US, the higher
educated use lower thresholds than the lower educated, i.e., tend to assign higher work disability
to the same vignette person than the lower educated. This is also revealed by the estimates for the
first threshold equation (γ 1 ) in panel B; the other threshold parameters appear not to play a large
role here.8 The complete model corrects for this. In the Netherlands, the correlation between
education level and work disability is much weaker, both before and after correcting for DIF.
Age is insignificant in the complete model. Of course this is related to the fact that health
conditions are controlled for directly. The large coefficients on the youngest age group are
somewhat misleading since this group is quite small in the US data. The age group 45-54 in the
US uses higher thresholds than the 55+ age groups. This is similar to the finding of Salomon et
al. (2004) for mobility (as a domain of general health, not work related), who explains it from
expectations: older respondents may more often expect to have some work disability and adjust
their scales accordingly. In the model that does not correct for DIF, this would lead to the
conclusion that this age group has significantly lower work disability. The role of gender is also
smaller in the model, which controls for DIF than in the model without DIF.
Health condition dummies are answers to questions of the form “has the doctor ever told
you that ….” , except for pain, which is self-reported (“do you often suffer from pain? ”). The
same variables were used in Section 3. They are included as exogenous background variables;
we assume that these health conditions do not suffer from reporting errors or other measurement
8

A model in which all thresholds shift with respondent characteristics in a parallel manner is statistically rejected against the
model presented here, but gives very similar corrections in the work disability equation.

49

errors. Different health conditions have very different effects on work disability, as in the binary
probits in the previous section. This does not change much after correcting for response scale
differences.
In Section 3, we found that the effect of pain on reported work disability is much larger in
the Netherlands than in the US. The results in Table 5.3 confirm this result. In the US, pain has a
larger effect on work disability than any other health condition. The significantly positive
interaction with the dummy for the Netherlands indicates that the effect is even stronger in the
Netherlands. Correcting for DIF hardly changes the effect of pain in either the US or the
Netherlands. Thus differences in response scales for reporting work disability cannot explain
why the effect of pain on reported work disability is so much larger in the Netherlands than in
the US.
Panel C contains the estimates for the vignette equations. The dummies for the five
vignettes are in line with the idea that vignettes 3, 4 and 5 describe more serious health problems
than vignettes 1 and 2. There appears to be a systematic difference between evaluating male and
female vignette persons (the parameter on the dummy female in θ). For a given vignette
description, a male vignette person is seen as more work disabled than a female vignette person,
by both male and female respondents.9 The estimated standard deviation of the vignette
evaluations is much smaller than that of the self-reports. This is in line with the fact that
everyone gets the same vignette descriptions (apart from the name of the person described,
determining the gender). In the self-reports, heterogeneity in respondents’ own work disability
not explained by gender, education or age, leads to the much larger variance of the unsystematic
part.

9

We included an interaction term of respondent gender and gender of the vignette person but this was insignificant.

50

Finally, panel D presents the auxiliary parameters related to the transformation between
the two-point and the five-point scale. The cut-off point for the two-point scale is a weighted
mean of the first and second threshold in the five-point scale, with an estimated weight for the
first threshold of 0.79. Both idiosyncratic errors in the vignette reports play a role, and are of
similar order of magnitude as the unobserved heterogeneity term in “true” latent work disability,
which is common in both reports and has variance 10, by means of normalization.
Table 5.4 compares predictions of work disability for the age group 45-64 on the twopoint scale of the models with and without DIF (the same two models presented in the first panel
of Table 5.9). The model without DIF predicts work disability rates of 34.8% in the Netherlands
and 20.6% for the US, close to the observed work disability rates on the two-point scale for this
age group. For the model with DIF, the estimated thresholds for the US are used. For the US
sample, this again closely reproduces the observed work disability rate. This is due to the way
the prediction is computed: there is no correction for within US DIF, only for cross-country DIF.
For the Netherlands, however, the result is quite different. For every Dutch respondent, the work
disability probability is computed as if this respondent would use the threshold of a US
respondent with the same characteristics (age, education level, gender, health conditions). The
results show that, if the Dutch would use the American thresholds, the self-reported work

disability rate in the Netherlands would be reduced to 27.6%, a difference of about 7.4
percentage points compared to the 34.8% in the model without DIF. Thus correcting for crosscountry DIF reduces the gap between the US and the Netherlands from 14.2 percentage points to
7.0 percentage points, a reduction of about 50%.
The other rows in Table 5.4 predict how much each health condition contributes to
explaining work disability according to both models, again using US response scales for the
model with DIF. Work disability is recomputed after setting the dummy for the given health
condition equal to zero, and the reduction in work disability compared to the first row is
reported. The differences between the two models are small. Pain remains the dominating factor
in both countries, and is much more important in the Netherlands than in the US. Thus we find
that there is a considerable difference in response scales between Dutch and US respondents
explaining a large part of the observed difference in the work disability rate, but the difference is
not related to whether respondents suffer from a health condition or not. All health conditions

54

together explain most of reported work disability according to both models. They explain more
in the Netherlands than in the US, again due to the effect of pain.
Table 5.5 gives the prevalence rates of the health conditions in the age group 45-64 and
the average marginal effect of each health condition on the probability of work disability. As in
Table 5.4, the estimated US response scales are used for both the Dutch and the American
respondents. Table 5.4 decomposes the contributions to work disability in Table 5.4 in two
components: prevalence and the marginal effect. There are some differences between the models
that do and do not correct for DIF across countries, but the qualitative conclusions remain the
same. Pain has both the largest prevalence rate and the largest marginal effect in both countries,
explaining why it has by far the strongest contribution on work disability. In the Netherlands,
both prevalence and marginal effect are substantially larger than in the US, explaining why the
contribution of pain to explaining work disability is larger in the Netherlands than in the US.

Conclusions

Workers in different industrial western countries report very different rates of work
disability. The diversity in reported work disability stands in sharp contrast to the believed
relative similarity in their observed health outcomes. This contradiction continues to be seen as a
major unresolved puzzle.
In this paper, we investigated the role of pain as a factor leading to work disability in
three countries—The Netherlands, England, and the United States. In all three countries pain is
by far the most important factor leading to reports of work disability. We also find however that
respondents in these three countries who appear to be suffering from similar degrees of pain
respond very differently to questions on work disability. These differences do not appear to be
related to differential use of painkillers to alleviate the effects of pain or differential degrees of
work acccomodation available in the three countries.
Using a new methodology of vignettes which were implemented in Internet surveys in
the United States and The Netherlands, our analysis claims that a significant part of the observed
difference in reported work disability between the two countries is explained by the fact that
residents of the two countries use different response scales in answering the standard questions
on whether they have a work disability. Essentially for the same level of actual work disability,
Dutch respondents have a lower response threshold in claiming disability than American
respondents do.
